A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Pete Sharbel, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Sharbel. You may now begin.\nPete Sharbel: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today\u2019s call, we will make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.\nJim Squires: Good morning. And welcome to Norfolk Southern\u2019s fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019d like to begin today by recognizing the hard work and dedication of all of our employees who persevered and adapted throughout 2020 to serve our customers and communities, and enhance shareholder value. As the past year unfolded, change was one of the few constants driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a global shift in energy markets that significantly impacted our business. Our people day in and day out ensured that our railroad was positioned to succeed by delivering for our customers changing needs, while seizing efficiency opportunities that produced record productivity levels and advanced our PSR based operating plan. Moving to our results on slide four, for the quarter EPS was $2.64 and the operating ratio was an all time record at 61.8%. Prior to summarizing the full year results, I\u2019ll highlight two previously disclosed non-cash charges. First, recall in the first quarter, we launched a rationalization of our locomotive fleet by 703 units, which resulted in a non-cash charge of $385 million. This was possible due to the deep and lasting efficiency that we\u2019ve driven into our train network through precision scheduled railroading. Next, in the third quarter, we disclosed a $99 million non-cash impairment charge related to an equity method investment. I will speak to full year results excluding both of these charges. For the full year, revenues declined 13% as we experienced significant disruption in business levels from the dual impacts of the global pandemic and energy market changes. In response, we pressed forward with PSR initiatives and quickly adapted to control costs. And as a result, we more than offset the revenue decline with a 14% reduction in adjusted operating expenses. The adjusted operating ratio improved to 64.4%, which marks the fifth consecutive year of improvement. As we manage significant volume fluctuations throughout the pandemic, we idled four additional hump operations, streamlined our resources and completed a redesign of our Southern operations around Atlanta ahead of peak season. Since our launch of TOP21, we\u2019ve completed a total of six hump rationalizations and we\u2019ve substantially reduced our asset requirements. Our ongoing efforts to improve fuel efficiency and resource productivity produced our best results to-date. These actions contributed to another year of operating ratio of improvement on an adjusted basis and are especially crucial to drive profitability and efficiency even further in 2021. We see ample opportunity to affect more positive change and remain focused on closing the OR gap with the industry. Moving into 2021, we are committed to providing a superior value to shareholders and best-in-class service to customers through an efficient profitable operation. Building further upon record productivity and efficiency gains to foster a platform of growth. Increasing resilience in our service offering and creating latent capacity to grow with our customers is in lockstep with our goals to grow profitably and efficiently. This alignment is paramount as we continue to leverage our superior positioning to consumer and industrial markets that have been proven growth drivers for Norfolk Southern. We will leave no stone unturned as we drive efficiency and create value for our shareholders. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Cindy.\nCindy Sanborn: Good morning. When I spoke to you last quarter, I had been at Norfolk Southern for less than two months, but I had already found a strong foundation and opportunities for us to maximize the value of our franchise. The most recent quarter has reinforced my belief in the magnitude of opportunity in front of us and that we are positioned to capture that opportunity. During the fourth quarter, we saw volumes continue their climb from pandemic induced lows earlier in the year, so the mission of the operating team was handling more business, while reducing resources and improving productivity. Our push for efficiency leads to record train weight and record train lengths in the quarter. These larger trains combined with our strategy of better matching train size and locomotive horsepower, drove us to record fuel efficiency and enabled us to get the job done with a smaller workforce and a record low count of locomotives. I also have to thank the people that make up our operations team and all crafts. We achieved these records due to their hard work, and most importantly, we did so safely. Turning to slide seven, our network performance throughout most of 2020 was strong, with many metrics at or above record performance levels even with unprecedented volume volatility. We accelerated network changes in the fourth quarter ahead of holiday peak season and as volume reached the highest point of the year. As you can see on the slide, our network fluidity metrics came under pressure as the quarter progressed. It is important to note that implementing these network changes as soon as possible, while challenging is a key to future success with our ongoing efficiency and growth initiatives, which I\u2019ll cover in more detail shortly. I can confidently say that we are meeting these challenges head on and have already improved fluidity in the first quarter as the black line on the graph indicates. We are focused on executing and improving the plan, and when necessary and justified deploying temporary resources to quickly address congested areas. For example, while we put locomotives into storage this quarter, we will use those locomotives temporarily if needed before returning them to inactive status. I have been very pleased with the way the team has risen to the challenge, especially during the holiday peak season when they upped their game to meet service expectations, even with additional premium intermodal traffic. Moving to slide eight, traffic coming back is both our challenge and an opportunity. We can and will add resources to meet customer needs, but first we must explore every option to fully utilize our existing crews and locomotives. We eliminate a lot of structural costs, including indirect and supporting costs during the pandemic. So we\u2019re being very careful to keep those costs from creeping back. Before we add a new service, the team goes through an extensive vetting process to explore the alternatives, including rebalancing traffic between existing trains and tactical extra trains. The focus is on using additional volume to help us increase the value we bring out of each locomotive and each crew start. Railcar velocity is our touchstone throughout as we push to quickly move volumes through the network. We have also made our organizational structure within operations more efficient during the quarter by reducing from nine to six geographic divisions and delayering our management structure to speed decision making and ensure that communication is clear and quick. As Alan will explain, we are preparing for significant volume growth in 2021. On slide nine, our six techniques that will help us get maximum leverage from additional traffic. Full pin is a technique used to optimally match train size with the pulling power of locomotives. While volume fluctuations can make this challenging, full pin drives fuel efficiency, controls crew starts and improves asset turns. Increasing the blending of different kinds of traffic on the same train supports full pin and minimizes additional train starts. We improve car velocity by blocking cars for the most distant possible destination, reducing yard costs by minimizing handlings. While we have reshaped the network through our four recent hump yard conversions, we are successfully minimizing hiring and training costs by helping furloughed employees in one craft transfer to another. This helps both the employee and Norfolk Southern. Those craft transfers are one way we are being more agile, flexing our resources up and down in sync with traffic volumes. We adapted the plan quickly through the pandemic and we continue to exercise that muscle memory. Finally, we are dynamically managing our operation to handle traffic fluctuations, keeping cars moving even when volume spikes. I am confident that we can meet customer expectations with our fast efficient network. With that, I will turn it over to Alan.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. Headwinds related to COVID-19 and energy markets challenged volume in 2020, with revenue improving sequentially through the second half of the year. Throughout the recovery, we continued our focus, our project driven growth and margin improvement supported by our market approach and service product. As you can see on slide 11, the dual shock of the pandemic and declining energy markets pressured volumes in 2020. However, volume in both our intermodal and industrial markets excluding energy returned to growth during the fourth quarter as the economy continued its recovery from the pandemic. Turning to slide 12, full year 2020 revenue decreased 13% and total volume declined 12%. While our business capitalized on a V shaped recovery and consumer driven markets, year-over-year declines persisted in energy, which accounted for more than 70% of the 2020 revenue decline. Our continued commitment to margin improvement partially mitigated these impacts, resulting in RPU less fuel increases in all three business groups during each of the last four years. The mixed impact of increasing share of intermodal volume relative to decrease in energy volume resulted in the total RPU decline. Merchandise revenue fell 11%, with almost all markets experiencing pandemic-related losses. Notably, energy-related commodities faced supply and demand shocks, prompting high inventory levels and record low commodity prices. Most prominent in the second quarter, dramatic declines in manufacturing and vehicle production, placed downward pressure on steel prices and production for much of the year. Intermodal revenue recovered significantly in the second half of the year. However, first half losses resulted in a 6% revenue reduction and a 2% decline in revenue excluding fuel for the full year. E-commerce and consumer driven business supported the intermodal recovery, particularly in our premium segment. Secular declines in the coal industry accelerated during the pandemic, as cold revenue and volume dropped 37% in 2020 in the face of declining low demand, with product substitutes gaining market share. Utility volume fell sharply year-over-year due to sustained low natural gas prices, reduced industrial power demand and high stockpiles. Lower seaborne coal prices were a headwind entering 2020, which coupled with the onset of COVID-19 and import restrictions, led to challenge volumes, especially in the second and third quarters. While pandemic conditions negatively impacted revenue and volume in 2020, we maintained our focus on delivering a service product that enables our customers and Norfolk Southern to grow, as the dynamic transportation environment continues to strengthen. This approach supports our strategy of providing a truck competitive, consistent and reliable service product to our customers, allowing our customers to compete, while creating operating leverage for Norfolk Southern and adding value for our shareholders. Moving to slide 13, our fourth quarter revenue results improve sequentially and outperform normal seasonality, as the economic recovery gained momentum. Total revenue for the quarter was down 4% year-over-year, as energy declines outweighed the year-over-year growth in both intermodal and merchandise excluding its energy components. RPU declined reflecting lower fuel surcharge revenue and the negative mix effect of higher intermodal and lower coal volume. Within merchandise, both volume and revenue were down 5% year-over-year, driven by declines in crude oil and natural gas liquids. Crude oil shipments were heavily impacted by reduced global consumption due to COVID-19 leading to lower refinery run rates, significant storage worldwide and unfavorable price spreads. Shipments of natural gas liquids were also down significantly due to additional pipeline capacity, coupled with lower consumption. Partially offsetting these declines were gains in soybeans from increased opportunities for export, reflecting our long standing focus on margin improvement, merchandise quarterly revenue per unit less fuel increased year-over-year for the 23rd consecutive quarter. Intermodal business levels grew meaningfully year-over-year as we leveraged our powerful franchise to secure new opportunities from the surge in e-commerce activity, record tightness in the trucking sector and recovering global demand, excluding fuel fourth quarter revenue increased 11% year-over-year. Domestic shipments were up 7% year-over-year, propelled by more than 30% increase in premium shipments. Revenue per unit less fuel reached a record level in the fourth quarter, marking the 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our coal franchise experienced continued declines, amid low energy prices in the fourth quarter. Thermal export volume increased, which was more than offset by a 40% decline in utility tons. Our utility franchise faced continued pressure from low natural gas prices, renewable generation and reduced manufacturing output. In total, coal volume fell 25% from the same period in 2019. Record level revenue per unit less fuel was driven by positive mix within our utility markets and volume shortfalls. Moving to our outlook on slide 14, we are closely monitoring economic developments and the attendant impacts on our franchise. Markets have not recovered equally. The consumer driven market recovered first and has exceeded pre-pandemic levels, while manufacturing markets have been slow to recover with existing social distancing protocols and labor force participation. Although, economic uncertainty persists, current trends support optimism for our business in the coming year, with an improving manufacturing sector and expected strength in consumer spending. With respect to the merchandise markets, we expect the steady recovery in manufacturing activity to support our customers\u2019 efforts to rebuild inventories and meet increasing demand. Total manufacturing activity is accelerating, driving opportunities across our merchandise segments. Supply chain disruptions and supplier shortages have further impacted inventory levels downward, creating an additional need for increased activity in the coming months. Prices for steel are up more than 80% year-over-year, which will lift production and trade activity. U.S. light vehicle production is expected to exceed 2019 levels by 3% in 2021, which will support automotive volume and adjacent markets like steel and plastics. Housing remains a growth story resulting in increases in construction activity. Growth in our agriculture and forest products segment will be led by agrofuels and food service related markets, as consumer gasoline demand returns and the service sector recovers, although most energy-related markets are expected to remain challenge. Projected strengthen consumer spending, low inventory levels, record tightness in the trucking industry and our best-in-class channel partners will continue to spur growth in our robust intermodal franchise. Good spending is forecasted derives 7% in 2021, due to continued pandemic induced spending patterns and high levels of personal savings, triggering increased demand for our intermodal product. Our outlook for coal remains pressured by high stockpiles that will lower utility volumes. Partially offsetting these declines will be export thermal and domestic met volumes projected to increase as the global recovery from COVID-19 continues into 2021. In summary, we expect 2021 revenue growth as overall economic conditions improved throughout the year. We\u2019re constantly adapting to the evolving needs of our customers, providing valued transportation solutions to the marketplace. We recognize that sustainable low carbon transportation is essential to our customers and our growth strategy. We remain committed to our efforts to improve fuel efficiency, modernize our fleet with energy management solutions and partner with our customers to prevent pollution. Our leadership and sustainability is resonating with our customers and the markets we serve validating these efforts. We\u2019re confident in our ability to leverage our value in the marketplace to secure new opportunities to support our customers\u2019 growth and grow our margins. I will now turn it over to Mark who will cover our financial results.\nMark George: Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. On slide 16, you\u2019ll note Q4 2020 was free of any non-core items, meaning the OR improvement of 240 basis points was clean. We did in Q4 2019 report a non-operating asset impairment of $21 million. That adversely impacted EPS by $0.06 and a $19 million retroactive income tax credit that aided EPS by $0.07. So with the absence of those two items, core EPS improvement this quarter was $0.10. Moving to the fourth quarter highlights on slide 17. Revenue was down 4% on volume that was down 1% as mix and fuel surcharge headwinds continued. Against that 1% decline in volume we drove down operating expenses by 8% in the quarter as benefits from workforce and asset productivity continued to grow. As a result, operating income actually grew in the quarter by $22 million or 2% and the operating ratio improved to 61.8, a 240-basis-point improvement over Q4 of 2019. This is a record low OR for Norfolk Southern and we are well-positioned to continue driving this down in 2021 and beyond. The margin improvement achieved in the fourth quarter capped off a year in which free cash flow improved by 14% to $2.1 billion, another record for NS. Moving to a review of operating expenses on slide 18. Total OpEx was down $139 million or 8%, fuel was down 87 million with lower pump prices contributing to $62 million of that reduction and consumption was down $21 million led by fewer GTMs, as well as a 3% improvement in fuel efficiency in the quarter. Comp and benefits are down 7% led mainly by employment cost with the workforce down by 3,300 or 15%, $10 million in one-time separation costs for certain craft employees partially offset these savings. Purchase services was down $41 million or 11%, as we\u2019re making progress on the structural and semi-structural costs within this category, as well as due to the absence of detouring costs associated with flooding in the prior year. Depreciation increased modestly by less than 1%, as we\u2019ve been able to successfully reduce asset intensity, including within the locomotive fleet, which continues to have ample surge capacity to absorb growth. Materials were down 7% due to lower spend associated with a smaller and more productive locomotive fleet. Lastly, gains on the sales of operating property was $11 million in the quarter, a decline of $32 million versus the prior year. So another quarter of expense reductions far in excess of the volume decline, leaving us well primed to deliver strong operating leverage as 2021 unfolds. Now turning to slide 19, for the remainder of the fourth quarter P&L. Below the operating income, you\u2019ll see that other income net of $43 million is $25 million better than the prior year, due to the absence of the $21 million impairment of natural resource assets in Q4 2019. We also had another quarter of healthy gains on our company own life insurance investments. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was just under 23%, helped by the coal gains that are exempt from income taxes. Net income increased by 1% and EPS rose by 4%, as we ramped up share repurchases to nearly $500 million in the quarter. Now for a look at the full year on slide 20 and to preface I\u2019ll speak to the adjusted numbers on this slide, excluding the impacts of the two non-cash charges during the year, the $385 million locomotive rationalization and the $99 million investment impairment. Despite the unprecedented volatility in business volumes that resulted in a 13% decline in revenues, we maintained focus on our long-term operational transformation, while adapting to the market changes that were induced by the global pandemic, as well as the contracting energy markets. In the midst of this, we produce record workforce productivity, locomotive productivity and fuel efficiency, which allowed us to more than match the revenue decline with a 14% reduction in adjusted operating expenses, while ensuring we are ready to serve improving freight demand as the economy recovers. The adjusted operating ratio posted improvement to 64.4%, the fifth consecutive year of improvement. But there\u2019s more under the covers when we look at the 30-basis-point improvement for the year. Moving now to slide 21, you can see during the second quarter of 2020, the 29% hit to revenue on a year-over-year basis took a toll on the operating ratio, but every other quarter of the year, improved in the 230-basis-point to 240-basis-point range. Throughout the year and especially during the depths of the pandemic induced volume trough, the team really pressed forward to adapt our operating plan to the changing business environment. In fact, two of the four hump idling during the year occurred within Q2 and when the nationwide automotive network shut down, we completely redesigned our auto plan to absorb it into existing trains. In addition, we continue to press lower on resources and ensure that we were able to serve a surge in demand as economic activity increased, which is exactly what happened. We maintained a heightened sense of urgency to transform the business, while ensuring we are positioned for long term success and further margin improvement. Moving on to cash flow on slide 22, although 2020 cash from operations came in under the 2019 levels, spend on property additions for the year was right in line with the reduced target we set earlier in the year of $1.5 billion, which was a 26% reduction from 2019 levels. We pivoted early in the year to this reduced CapEx target at the outset of the pandemic and executed the plan, while keeping priority on the health of the physical network. Thanks to these tight controls on both capital and operating expenses, free cash flow improved to a record $2.1 billion, while shareholder distributions total $2.4 billion. Average share count declined by 3%, with over 1.4 billion of buybacks as we maintain tight focus on returning capital to shareholders, while maintaining strong liquidity. To close, we have excellent momentum on improving both our cost and asset structures while we deliver on the growth in 2021. We expect this formula to yield even greater margins and cash flow and we remain committed to delivering significant returns for our shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll hand back over to Jim.\nJim Squires: Thank you, Mark. Turning to slide 24, I will wrap up with our 2021 expectations. As you heard from Alan, we expect segments related to manufacturing and consumer activity to drive growth, while energy-related commodities are likely to remain challenged. We are modeling total revenues up approximately 9%, with intermodal leading the way, merchandise growing solidly and coal declining. The power of our intermodal and merchandise segments to propel us to growth despite the secular decline in coal highlights the continuity of our strategy over time. As we move ahead, we will leverage many avenues to drive long-term volume and revenue growth, including a fast and reliable service product, the advancement of technology initiatives such as Access NS and Rail Pulse, just to name a couple, and our steadfast commitment to being a sustainable and socially responsible corporate citizen. With this positive momentum, we expect to achieve greater than 300 basis points of OR improvement in 2021 versus our adjusted 2020 results and to end 2021 with a full year run rate of 60%. As we have said before, when we achieve our targets, we won\u2019t stop there. In addition, we expect capital expenditures to approximate $1.6 billion, with a dividend payout ratio of 35% to 40%, an increase versus our prior target payout ratio of one-third. As we demonstrated in 2020, we are committed to protecting liquidity, while using remaining cash flow and financial leverage to repurchase shares. We are optimistic about growth in the year ahead and we will advance productivity initiatives to bring freight onto the railroad more profitably than ever. We know there is more improvement to be made across the organization and we\u2019ll continue executing on our commitments to drive efficiencies and create long-term sustained value for our shareholders. Thank you for your attention. We\u2019ll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one for, Cindy, on just the service levels. You mentioned, they had some challenges when you\u2019re doing the redesign in the fourth quarter, but you expect them to improve. Maybe you can give us some level of confidence as to how you\u2019re applying some of the resources tactically across the network? What sort of issues you\u2019ve had to face and just how you feel about hiring in the pipeline as you start to get ready for this type of growth in 2021?\nCindy Sanborn: Hey. Brian, thanks for the question. So, as we went into the fourth quarter with some of our operational changes, our Southeast plan, I also referenced in my prepared remarks, some organizational changes that we made. And in fact, we did reduce our locomotive fleet by about 100 locomotives during the quarter. So as we digested a lot of those challenges, we were starting to run a little slower, and we did in fact, inject a little bit of support from a resource perspective in temporarily. I would also add that as we were recovering from some of the challenges that I described, we did have some COVID impacts with some of our employees out as part of the COVID protocols and also don\u2019t feel as individuals. So that was how we were -- kind of how I would diagnose the fourth quarter. As we come out of the fourth quarter running through the holidays to get back on our feet, we\u2019ve gotten a lot better. We\u2019re not at 2020 levels, but we are much, much better. We are continuing to tweak and take resources out in terms of consolidating train. So we still have opportunities to digest changes within the network. But as necessary, we will inject a resource -- some resources into make sure that we recover quickly from challenges that we may have. From thinking about the volume that we\u2019re seeing, I think, some of it is in unit train and that will require resource use a little bit different than our scheduled network. But I will tell you that in our scheduled network, we still have a lot of opportunity to consolidate trains, make them longer and make them heavier, even on top of the gains that we made in the fourth quarter. And I can tell you that, even in our intermodal fleet, for example, our intermodal train operation, we\u2019ve got about 10% of our trains are operating over 10,000 feet. So we still have some opportunity to grow in that space and that should help us manage our headcount in this year to flat to down from where we exited \u201820 -- December of 2020. So I\u2019m pretty confident we will continue to make some gains there and also our locomotive fleet.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Great. Thanks Cindy for all the details there. Maybe one for, Mark, looking at the gains, I think, you says about $11 million in the quarter? Looking at the cash flow, I think, it implies something a little bit higher than that, just looking at the gain on disposal. So maybe you can clear that up for me? And then just give us a sense as to what you\u2019re expecting for gains in 2021, when you look at that 300 basis points of OR improvement.\nMark George: Yeah. The property gains, Brian, were in the quarter -- the fourth quarter were $11 million. We ended up the year at really $26 million of gains, a little shy of where we had intended or thought. And the guidance for 2021 is to be in that $30 million to $40 million range. But these property gains are lumpy and they can move around and we\u2019ll provide some transparency. And if we have bigger ones in a given quarter, we\u2019ll call them out and let you know.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Got it. Thank you, Mark.\nMark George: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions?\nScott Group: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, Alan, I want to start with you, on the 9% revenue growth. Can you give us directionally how much is volume versus RPU? And then in the fourth quarter coal RPU was really strong, was there any liquidated damages or is that just a mix? I\u2019m just trying to understand if that\u2019s sustainable or not?\nAlan Shaw: Scott, as we look into \u201821, we are projecting very strong growth in both our intermodal and automotive markets, as well as our merchandise ex energy. We expect energy revenues to remain about flat. They accounted for about 75% of our revenue decline in the -- in 2020. So we\u2019re not going to have that headwind, which is going to uncover the growth in the other markets. And we\u2019re targeting 9% revenue growth, upper single-digit volume growth. So martis -- modest, pardon me, RPU growth, just because of the mix impact of intermodal leading the way. With respect to coal, I mean, you are -- you got it right. We did have about $12 million of incremental year-over-year in volume shortfall, which aided the RPU. We also had positive mix within our utility franchise in which our utility North volume, which as you know was shorter haul was down about 50% and our utility South volume was down about 30%. And then we also got some good pricing too in some of our markets as well. So all that rolls up into the overall RPU improvement that you saw within coal.\nScott Group: Okay. Helpful. And then, Mark, for you on the cost side, so it sounds like full year headcount is going to be down a couple percent, but maybe help us think about some of the other pieces on the cost side. I know comp per employee, purchase services, depreciation, any other big items you can help us with? Thank you.\nMark George: Scott, are you referring to 2021?\nScott Group: Yes.\nMark George: Or 2020?\nScott Group: \u201821, just in terms of\u2026\nMark George: Yeah.\nScott Group: \u2026some of the guidance you could give us on comp per employee, purchase services, any of the other pieces?\nMark George: Right. So for cost per employee, you can expect the traditional year-over-year inflationary rate increases of a few percent, but you\u2019re going to also have some incentive headwinds as well. Clearly, we didn\u2019t pay out on incentive compensation at target this year. We fully expect to be at or above target next year. So you\u2019ll have pressures there. In addition, you\u2019re going to have some pressures on certain variable costs, like purchase services, and as Alan says [ph], those go with volume. And we are, though, however, pushing on efficiency and productivity to help mitigate some of those things.\nJim Squires: Depreciation.\nScott Group: Is there any way to just say what the headwind would be from incentive comp, just going from a partial payout to a full payout?\nMark George: I\u2019m not going to put a finer point on that just yet, Scott. But you can probably compute that, this year incentive comp was down and we expect that that is going to bounce back and hopefully bounce back significantly. But we\u2019ll provide a little bit more guidance on that as we get into the year and we start to see how the trends are going.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nMark George: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions.\nBascome Majors: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to some of the merchandise markets where the outlook is pretty constructive outside of energy. We get steel prices through the roof. You mentioned auto. But could you talk with what you\u2019re hearing from your customers? I mean, are there discrete items where you have plants reopening, utilization rising? Like how much visibility do you have into this turning into a real sequential volume acceleration versus just seeing some of the indicators in a very different backdrop from what we saw in the first six months of last year? Thank you.\nJim Squires: Yeah. Bascome, I think we\u2019ve got pretty good visibility into this, at least for the next couple quarters. You saw our merchandise ex energy rotating the growth year-over-year during the fourth quarter. So -- and we\u2019re continuing with that level of momentum. As you\u2019ve noted, steel prices are at like 12-year highs, right? And so our customers are talking about adding back capacity. The corn market, or I should say, the corn, wheat and soybean market, that -- those commodity prices are about six-year highs and then the housing market is about as strong as it\u2019s been in 14 years. And so, you couple that with the fact that wholesale inventory levels are close to two-year lows and there\u2019s a lot of demand for our product out there. Even in the paper market, those who make corrugated cardboard, they\u2019re sold out because of the proliferation of e-commerce. And so across the Board, we\u2019re seeing strength in our merchandise network, which gives us a lot of confidence as we move into \u201821.\nBascome Majors: And as that grows, should we expect the traditional relationship, where you\u2019re able to add cars to existing trains or have some of the\u2026\nJim Squires: Yeah.\nBascome Majors: \u2026train link gains that you\u2019ve made may be limited that normal kind of cyclical calculus that we\u2019re used to?\nJim Squires: No. You\u2019re exactly right. We\u2019ve -- Cindy highlighted that a little bit. We\u2019ve got capacity for growth, since most of our growth is going to be oriented towards consumer and manufacturer, and that\u2019s generally carloads, small block shipments and that\u2019s going to fit neatly into existing intermodal and merchandise trains. Now just the data point, within our intermodal franchise, we\u2019ve really been working on our productivity and train weight has improved year-over-year about 900 basis points more than train length. And so right there, you can visualize kind of vertical stacking of and creating more revenue density, improving productivity of crews and fuel and locomotives.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everybody. Congrats on the results. Alan, I guess, the first one for you. If we look back at 2020 and compare the volume performance to your closest competitor, there was significant volume underperformance. And this is not a critical question. It\u2019s more of -- I am just trying to understand what\u2019s behind that, specifically as it relates to merchandise. Sorry, I think I got disconnect.\nAlan Shaw: Yeah. Amit.\nAmit Mehrotra: Yeah.\nAlan Shaw: I\u2019m sorry\u2026\nAmit Mehrotra: Can you hear me now?\nAlan Shaw: I missed the last part of your question. \nAmit Mehrotra: Yeah. Yeah, I\u2019m just trying to understand, CSX has a lower cost structure, for now at least. I\u2019m just trying to understand is the volume underperformance relative to CSX over the course of 2020, specifically, in merchandise? Is that a pure market share shift or are there -- is there something beneath the numbers that maybe explains it better and if you can also talk about how you expect that relative performance to trend over 2021?\nAlan Shaw: Yeah. Amit, we talked about this a lot last year. We are fierce competitors. We\u2019re going to go out there and we\u2019re going to compete for every pound of business that\u2019s available to us, both with our eastern rail competitor and within that $800 billion trucking logistics market. We\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in our franchise. We have got a lot of confidence in our customers. And you can take a look at revenue per revenue ton mile comps and you can see, our focus really is on helping our customers grow and margin improvement. Specific to merchandise, as I -- let\u2019s say that the year-over-year gap between us and our eastern rail competitor was about 550 basis points in the fourth quarter, 400 basis points of that was just an energy, 400 basis points. So that\u2019s over 80% of it. I talked about, as we lead into the fourth quarter that we were about to run up against the most difficult comp of the year with respect to crude oil and that certainly played out. And so, those energy headwinds that we saw last year, which defined about close to three quarters of our overall revenue decline, are not something that we expect to see this year. We\u2019re not calling for growth there. And if that does happen, we\u2019re well-positioned to handle it and to profit from it. And we are seeing some signs there that commodity prices are strengthening and thermal coal is in pretty high demand in the worldwide market. But we\u2019re not expecting that level of headwind this year, which is why we really believe we\u2019re going to rotate into pretty strong growth led by our intermodal and our merchandise ex energy franchise.\nAmit Mehrotra: Great. Okay. That\u2019s really helpful and encouraging. I -- my second follow up, I guess, for Cindy or Mark, when I look at the guidance, it implies kind of mid-to-high 70% incremental margins, which is a really nice number. I guess, if you just break it down in terms of dollar cadence, you\u2019re basically projecting a $900 million increase in revenue and like a $200 million increase in expenses, which is a very good performance? And I think it\u2019d be helpful to, I guess, Cindy or Mark, just talk about your confidence level in terms of being able to achieve that? How much relies on price and how much relies on just blocking and tackling and be able to control the cost structure and just your overall confidence to be able to achieve that?\nMark George: Sure. Amit, I will start. Cindy can provide some color. But, yeah, look, the cost inflation as I had mentioned, we\u2019re going to be fighting some traditional inflation in terms of wages. But we are looking to really hold headcount flat or perhaps even drift down from where we ended this year. And that\u2019s largely going to be dependent upon where this incremental volume comes is to how aggressive we can get on constricting some of those headcount related costs. But we\u2019ve -- we feel pretty good and pretty confident with our plan to manage it that way and mitigate some of the wage inflation. We do have fuel inflation in our cost as well, as well as you have normal step up in depreciation. But other areas where we\u2019re baking in some efficiency and productivity gains in multiple levels in the P&L, and I think, we feel like, Cindy, had talked about, we have the capacity. We can make our trains longer. Yes, when we have unit train type of traffic, we\u2019re going to have to add some crews and costs. But aside from that, Cindy, would you add anything?\nCindy Sanborn: No. I think that sums it up very, very well. And I think what -- while we\u2019re very encouraged by the growth and we want to serve our customers and have a great sort of service product out here, if it doesn\u2019t come, we\u2019re going to take appropriate action. So we have a lot of opportunity, even with absorb existing growth and continue to consolidate trains and consolidate cars. Just focus on our car velocity initiative, but we will pivot if we need to pivot. So team is -- we got a lot of momentum here. If you look at the results coming out fourth quarter and the first, a lot of momentum and we will drive hump.\nAmit Mehrotra: Great. Okay. Thanks very much, everybody. Good luck. Appreciate it.\nJim Squires: Thanks, Amit.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nWalter Spracklin: Thanks for taking my question. Good morning, everyone. So I just thought\u2026\nJim Squires: Good morning.\nWalter Spracklin: Yeah. Yeah. Just starting on some of the more administrative, the other income line that you flagged, can you -- that\u2019s jumped around quite a bit quarter-to-quarter. It had an impact in the last couple quarters as well. Can you give us some guidance as to what to expect on a general base level quarter -- on a quarterly basis in that other income line going forward?\nMark George: Thank you, Walter, for the question. So, look, the main driver of volatility in that line is our -- the returns on our company own life insurance investments, which are invested in a combination of both equities and fixed incomes. So it does move around quite a bit, depending on market performance and that\u2019s why you see the volatility you see. We\u2019ve guided historically that other income would be in that $80 million to $100 million range. But, frankly, it will move around quarter-to-quarter. And if markets deteriorate, it\u2019s going to be a potential headwind for us. But we\u2019ve enjoyed a pretty good healthy gains here these past couple years.\nWalter Spracklin: Yeah. Absolutely. And you were guiding historically for 23% to 24% tax. You\u2019ve had a good run with lower taxes this year. What would be your expectation on the tax rate for \u201821?\nMark George: Yeah. So you\u2019re right, we guide to 23%, 24%. We\u2019re not going to change that guidance right now. We know that there\u2019s tax law being debated and whether the federal statutory rate moves up to 28%, which is what the current administration is aiming for. We don\u2019t know the timing. We don\u2019t know if there\u2019ll be some compromise at a lower rate. But our better performance than the guide, it\u2019s really driven by in large part the company own life insurances, those gains are non-tax. So that definitely provides us tailwind, which is why we\u2019ve been better past couple of years than the guided rate. We\u2019re not going to bake that in and anticipate more tailwind from that here in 2021. So we\u2019re going to stick with our guide of 23% to 24%. Thanks, Walter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thanks very much and good morning. I\u2019ll just stick to one here. There\u2019s certainly been a lot of talk across the industry about congestion in LA, Long Beach and in Chicago as a result of the import surge that we\u2019ve seen. Is there having a collateral impact on Norfolk Southern and if so how are you working with shippers and your rail partners to alleviate that congestion?\nJim Squires: Thanks, Cherilyn. Good morning. They -- the congestion out on the West Coast ports has limited the Transcon volume that we enjoy. And it\u2019s also caused some of our channel partners to allocate more assets out there, which limits upside in the East. And then with respect to Chicago, all of the congestion that we\u2019re seeing in Chicago is largely outside of our intermodal gates and that\u2019s with the drayage community and with warehouses as they go through pandemic protocols and regularly have difficulty getting people to work because of COVID concerns. And so that -- what that does share on is it slows down the turn of the assets, the chassis and the boxes, which can limit upside volume as well. So we\u2019re communicating really closely with our channel partners. We have got -- we\u2019re aligned with the best in the business and they\u2019re really good at what they do. And so we\u2019re working on solutions collaboratively in order to mitigate these impacts. And as a result, you saw that our intermodal revenue ex-fuel was up 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Landry: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. So, just clarified on the 60 run rate by the end of the year, I mean, is this how we should think about Q4 or would you expect that to be more of a second half run rate? And then if you could comment on your expectations for the Q1 OR with some of the other relative been a bit cautious on both year-over-year improvement and are also pointing few sequential degeneration that\u2019s a bit worse than normal. So is that a fair way to think about Q1 and then just if you could clarify on the run rate for the 60?\nMark George: Allison, this is Mark. Thanks for the question. We\u2019re not going to get into the quarterly guidance for Q1. Volume will play a role. Obviously, volume has started strong here. But as you know Q1 typically is the highest OR quarter that we do have. There are some seasonal cost reasons for that, whether or not -- I would expect from a year-over-year perspective, we will show improvement each quarter. But sequentially, I\u2019m not going to get into that yet until we understand where volumes fall out. With regard to the timing of the year, it will also depend on the cadence of the volume throughout the year. I would expect to be on a glide path for that 60 and it\u2019s too early to say again, what quarter we\u2019re going to touch it.\nAllison Landry: Okay. That helps. And then maybe, Mark, I guess, another one for you. Maybe if you could just give us your thoughts on leverage and what you\u2019re targeting for 2021?\nMark George: Sure, Allison. So we\u2019re basically staying fully committed to our BBB+, Baa1 credit rating with Moody\u2019s. So we\u2019re going to manage leverage in the course of the year accordingly to make sure that we work towards staying in balance and stay committed again to our current rating. So I\u2019m not going to put an exact number of what that means in terms of incremental debt or necessarily deleveraging, but just know that we\u2019re committed to be within the balance.\nAllison Landry: Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.\nMark George: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of David Ross with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.\nDavid Ross: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Having a conversation with somebody in the industry the other day, who said that intermodal and PSR in his mind were incompatible, because intermodal is about accommodating and balances and surges, and PSR\u2019s goal is really to eliminate them. How do you think about intermodal and then your PSR goals, and is there friction there?\nJim Squires: Strongly disagree with that characterization of PSR is applied to an intermodal franchise. We believe that and we have applied PSR principles to our intermodal network and we\u2019ll continue to do so, while maintaining intermodal as a growth engine. Cindy?\nCindy Sanborn: Yeah. I would say that, PSR is really about simplifying things and having very good asset terms. That can be done in any class of business you want to think about. And absorbing volume growth into existing schedule trains, mixing trains so that we in case some cases while you will see some intermodal in the train, you\u2019ll also see manifest and other commodities. So, all of those are levers that you naturally pull with PSR and are completely compatible with any kind of business that we might be able to bring onto the rail.\nMark George: David our intermodal franchise as you know is unrivaled in the East. It\u2019s a position of strength for us and for our shareholders and for our channel partners. PSR is about reducing complexity and running the trains on time, which is exactly what you want in an intermodal network. And we already have a point-to-point intermodal network with a lot -- with very little intermediate switching. We are very focused on our productivity initiatives within intermodal to drive additional business into the existing train structure and I noted earlier the fact that our train weight increases about 900 basis points above our train length increase. And so what that does is -- what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re just adding that additional business into the existing trains and improving our ability to double stack.\nDavid Ross: Yeah. And just as a quick follow up on that related to double stacking, are there any corridors left in the network, were that\u2019s a problem and you can\u2019t take advantage of the double stack capabilities?\nMark George: We are double stack capable and well over 95% of our launch [ph] segments.\nDavid Ross: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Alan, maybe sticking on the intermodal outlook for a moment here, I guess you guys have done a pretty good job improving the yields on that business ex-fuel over the last several years -- three years I guess in particular. When you look at \u201821, how do you sort of balance the approach, obviously, truckloads going to have a very good year from a pricing standpoint? There obviously is some read across the intermodal as a result of that. Are you going to be leaning in a little bit more on the volume side or is it still going to be a balance where you\u2019re looking to get more price out of the franchise?\nAlan Shaw: Chris, we\u2019re going to continue our balanced approach. We\u2019ve got long-term deals with our channel partners and we\u2019ve frankly take a long-term approach to the markets. We do not want to interject the volatility associated with the spot market into our intermodal rate base. We do have a small percentage of business that\u2019s transactional and we\u2019re adjusting our rate plan there. But for the large part we\u2019re taking measured rate increases and then you saw our rate increases benefit from that in 2019, in the first half of 2020 when we were in a fray recession. Over time what that means is that our rates are moving at a pace that\u2019s higher than changes in the spot market and a little bit higher than what\u2019s going on in the contract market. So as a result, you should not see -- expect to see any kind of significant in -- rate increase in 2021, because frankly overall contract rates were slightly down in the truck market in 2020. It\u2019ll support for the rate improvements in 2022.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it. And then a quick follow-up on CapEx, obviously guiding down to around 15% of revenue, I think, thinking back to the sort of launch of PSR in the Investor Day. I think the guidance was maybe a little bit higher than that over the longer run. So maybe trying to think about how -- what has changed since then and maybe if this is more of a sustainable kind of run rate when you think about it as a percent of revenue or maybe that\u2019s not the right way to about it, but just any sort of thoughts on CapEx because it\u2019s obviously just come down and that\u2019s going to be a boost to free cash?\nMark George: Yeah. Thanks. We\u2019ve took our CapEx down at a significant readjusted baseline level of $1.5 billion this past year. And we\u2019ve talked throughout the year about the fact that we want to grow it modestly from here and really like to see revenue out -- revenue growth outpaced the growth in CapEx. That means growing into a smaller percentage then so be it and certainly that\u2019s where the math equates to this year is that we will grow into a smaller percentage. We want to do CapEx and budget CapEx based on logic and need not just based on revenue based affordability for example. But that said, we put this budget together and if Alex come, I am sorry, if Alan comes in and says we\u2019ve got these certain projects we need to help drive growth. We will examine it. If Cindy comes and says, we got some work to do on siding expansions or to augment the network a little bit more from a maintenance away perspective, we\u2019ll examine it. So we\u2019re not going to be dogmatic and I would like to kind of bury the 16% to 18% range from here.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. That\u2019s helpful color. I appreciate the time. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Cindy, I guess, I wanted to come back to the beginning of the call here. Did you explicitly say that headcount could actually be down in 2021? And I guess it just wanted to balance that against the comments that you\u2019ve had with bringing back some unit train service and need for crews. Can you just maybe hash that out a little bit more?\nCindy Sanborn: Yeah. So guidance would be flat-to-down from where we ended 2020. So -- but -- and to your point, some of the odd -- some of the reason we would need to keep it flat would be the unit trains. So what that implies is that we\u2019re still consolidating and still figuring ways to make our schedule network much more efficient and absorb the growth and provide a very solid service product for our customers. So that\u2019s our mission going forward. We\u2019re actively in it now and have been. And I\u2019m very pleased with the momentum that we have there and going forward I think we\u2019ll see good results from it.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. And I don\u2019t mean to be pesky here and I know it\u2019s been a long call. But on the first quarter you did say something about bringing back temporary resources. Is that going to have any impact on those metrics in the near-term that we need to be aware of?\nCindy Sanborn: Yeah. When I spoke about that, it was really about recovering from some of the challenges that we faced in the fourth quarter, including some COVID impacted crew districts, where we had to move some temporary in from a headcount perspective. Those were back out now. And then, secondly, we had reduced locomotives in the quarter and some of the challenges that we had at the very end, we injected those for a very temporary period of time and have since pulled those out. So, what I was talking about earlier in my commentary was really around the fourth quarter.\nBrandon Oglenski: Got it. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jon Chapell with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions.\nJon Chapell: Thank you. A couple for Alan. First on coal, so you said in your outlook slide, you expect coal to decline this year, which from a secular standpoint, I don\u2019t think anyone would argue with that premise. However, the comps are so easy from the middle of this year of the precipitous declines you saw especially in second quarter? You\u2019ve seen sequential volume increases as you\u2019ve gone through the year and come out of the pandemic. The RPU increases exiting 2020 and even your through a couple of weeks of 2021, the carload comparisons don\u2019t look that bad. So just -- I understand that coals in decline forever, but is there a reason why you couldn\u2019t just see a reprieve in 2021 given those factors I just addressed?\nAlan Shaw: Hey, John. I hope you\u2019re right. I think the thing that gives me the largest pause is the status of stockpiles at utility plants. They\u2019re at across our system. The publicly available numbers show they\u2019re pretty close to about 130 days. And so that is really going to limit volumes for us. That\u2019s about 40% higher than they were this time last year. So that\u2019s a headwind, right? And if -- they need manufacturing engineers, commercial businesses reopened to start creating that load for the utilities as well and natural gas seems to be stuck in the mid-twos per million BTUs. So that\u2019s an issue too. So those are all headwinds. But as we talked about it -- this -- if it returns, that\u2019s great, we\u2019re ready and we\u2019ve got a really good coal franchise. And I do think there is some upside in thermal export coal, but we\u2019re not planning on it and we\u2019re not baking it into our outlook. That\u2019s upside.\nJon Chapell: Okay. Understood. And then shifting to auto, you guys have had a really strong start to the year, really real strong last several months. We\u2019re hearing some issues with chip shortages, potential near-term production issues. Obviously, you have a bit of a unique franchise there. Are you hearing any concerns from your customers about potential near-term shutdowns because of some of these equipment shortages?\nAlan Shaw: Yeah. We\u2019ve got a great auto team and they\u2019ve done a very good job of building that franchise for us. Yeah, there are supply disruptions and basically many of the markets, if not all of the markets that we serve, semiconductors that you referenced is something that we\u2019ve heard of as well. Although, generally the automakers are allocating the scarce resources to the SUVs and trucks and vans, which is predominantly what we handle in our bi-level product. But the auto volume will be upside for us this year.\nJon Chapell: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, Alan.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon: Hey. Good morning, guys. So one thing that always stands out in terms of talking to the intermodal market and the railroads, the rails are talking about advancing service levels with intermodal and a lot of the channel partners are frustrated with the handoffs at the terminals and things like that. If you think about your outlook for volume growth, do you get concerned at all that the channel and the terminal network is going to be able to handle that sort of mid-to-high single-digit volume growth in the intermodal segment? And how do you -- how are you set up to kind of handle that? It seems like over the last peak season we certainly saw some congestion in -- across the intermodal network?\nAlan Shaw: David, good question. We talked about that briefly before where the drayage community slowed down in the processing of the warehousing has impacted street dwell and turns of equipment chassis and containers, and that is limiting the upside. However, even with that, we still delivered 11% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter ex-fuel surcharge. And you can see that our volumes within our intermodal franchise to start the year are up double-digit. So we\u2019ve got a great franchise, we\u2019ve got great channel partners. Again, they\u2019re very good at what they do and managing complex supply chains. So we\u2019re going to work with them on this. We\u2019re delivering that level of growth with our intermodal franchise now.\nDavid Vernon: But -- I mean, I guess, is there anything you can do to advance the efficiency of that handoff operation? Do you need to think about that difference or that the way you\u2019re interacting with channels differently just to kind of unlock some additional growth potential or was it going to be just more kind of working with them status quo? Do you -- I mean, I guess, I\u2019m just trying to figure out like how do you unlock the potential that could be in that intermodal business, if this\u2026\nAlan Shaw: Yeah. It is -- it really is about improve -- I am sorry, it\u2019s about improving the transparency and the visibility of what we\u2019re seeing and the assets that we share. And then it\u2019s about channel partners working with their BCS and the warehousing not getting in the chassis back into the gate.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your questions.\nJason Seidl: Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. Cindy, you talked a lot about taking some structural costs out of the network in 2020. As you look at 2021 and beyond, are there any structural costs left in your opinion and if there are, when do you think you guys can address them?\nCindy Sanborn: Yeah. Jason, so we talked about some of our terminal consolidations and hump conversions that have occurred over the last couple of years. You\u2019ve seen us work very, very strongly prior to my arriving in that area. We have four actual humps left operating as hump yards. And so, we will continue to look at yards and see how we can speed up cars, the real mission around a terminal capability and terminal footprint is around keeping cars moving or not pushing cars into terminals, moving cars past terminal. So I think there is still some room there, quite a bit of room, but you\u2019ve seen us pivot now a little bit more into looking at our train length and locomotive utilization with full pin. And that\u2019s going to -- that\u2019s really our primary focus now. But we will always circle back and find opportunities to get the most out of our network and speed up cars and terminals are one of the methods that we use to do that. So there is always opportunity. And as we think about growth and we see the growth that we\u2019re having in 2021, it probably will look a little different than maybe what we would have thought in 2020. So we have to be very agile in looking at opportunities and we will continue to do that. So I don\u2019t have a specific number for you, Jason, but understand it is, we\u2019re really never done with looking at structural costs and we\u2019ll pull that out every opportunity we can find.\nJason Seidl: Well, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. Follow-up here, Alan, you talked a little bit about intermodal RPU. I just want to make sure I understand what you said. You said that really don\u2019t look for too much this year in terms of gains, but it\u2019s going to be more of 2022. Is that how we should think about it?\nAlan Shaw: Yeah. They -- I talked about the arc of the improvements, Jason, and the fact that we didn\u2019t reflect the reduction in spot prices over the 18-month period in 2019 and the first half of 2020. Overall contract rates were -- in the truck market on average were, I think, flat or down slightly in 2020. And so we are just -- we take a long-term approaches, because I don\u2019t want to interject that level of volatility. And so our rate structure or our customers, our channel partners rates structure either, right? And they need something that they can plan on ahead of time. So, the truck market continues to improve and rate contract rates actually improve this year, go up, which we think they will, then that would be reflected in improvements in the 2022 rate structure.\nJason Seidl: So, Alan, how should we think about the cadence of your intermodal contracts or contractual pricing renewals, like, when did the bulk of them renew?\nAlan Shaw: Well, I told you, I\u2019ve mentioned Jason that, we\u2019ve got long-term deals with our contract -- with our channel partners.\nJason Seidl: Okay. Perfect. Appreciate for the help, Alan.\nAlan Shaw: Does that help? Okay. Thank you.\nJason Seidl: Take care.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on that last point, because I think that\u2019s a little bit of a surprise because I think most people do expect the rails to be at least sort of ordered of beneficiaries of truck pricing tightness. Is this a new philosophy or was this the same approach that you guys had back in 2018 as well? I\u2019m just trying to figure out if it\u2019s just a case of we were saying the same thing, but in terms of different magnitudes? I mean, can you give us a ballpark of what we can expect 2021 and 2022 intermodal pricing to increase like that?\nJim Squires: Yeah. Ravi, let me be clear. We are going to benefit from the tight truck market and you\u2019re going to see that both in volume and in intermodal and in merchandise. We have got -- we\u2019re looking at really healthy growth in our merchandise ex energy and in our intermodal volumes this year. What I\u2019ve talked about is our long-term approach to markets and this is something that we\u2019ve employed for years within our intermodal franchise and it\u2019s -- we don\u2019t want that level of volatility associated with the spot market into our rate structure. We do have a small portion of our intermodal business that\u2019s transactional and we are reassessing our rate plan to the positive there. However, for most of it, it\u2019s the rate increases unwind over time. And as a result, what you see is over time, less volatility and yet our price and intermodal exceeds the spot market and so that really exceeds the contract market. Recall, I mean, contract rates were flat or slightly down on the truck market in 2020. We took rate increases and we\u2019ve got 16 consecutive quarters of RPU less fuel improvements and -- in our intermodal franchise in 23 consecutive quarters and our merchandise franchise. So we take a measured approach to this.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. And maybe as a follow-up for Cindy, can you just give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking about deploying technology and automation across the network in the next year or three? Again, you\u2019ve seen some of your peers start to commercialize things like automated transection portals, where you guys are with respect to rolling technologies that are out the network.\nCindy Sanborn: Yeah. Ravi, we are doing the exact same things. Really we do have plans around the inspection portals, automated train inspection or truck inspection, excuse me, as well as mobility tools to help our employees be more effective and efficient and more time on tool if you will, as well as think of analytics to help us manage through failures before they become failures and not have to wait for a failure in terms of let\u2019s say a switch failure or something on line road be able to predict that. So we\u2019ve got a number of great projects that are in flight and we\u2019re working very closely with our technology team here to get quick adoption and make our railroad safer and more efficient with the use of technology.\nRavi Shanker: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about truckload conversions and the network, any commentary around the trend you\u2019re seeing there in the fourth quarter and early part of this year. And as we think about the 2021 guidance, what has baked in from a conversion standpoint is, are you just making in-market assumptions and truckload convergence would be upside to that or can you just help us think through that?\nJim Squires: Yeah. Good morning, Justin. So I think one way to think about our revenue growth in 2021, it\u2019s 9%, right? And so I\u2019ve talked about how energy, which is pretty close to about 20% of our revenue base is going to be flat. So you can envision that and the rest of our market, which is generally the more truck competitive we are seeing above 9% revenue growth and that\u2019s above macro. And so with that implicit in that is the fact that we are going to continue to target that $800 billion truck and logistics market, and leverage the strength of our franchise, which includes intermodal network and the fact that we\u2019ve got a diverse merchandise network and we sit on top of a majority of the consumption and the manufacturing in the United States.\nJustin Long: Okay. And then for my second question, just a quick follow-up on coal RPU, Alan, I think you walked through some of the mixed dynamics in the fourth quarter? But as we think about 2021, is your expectation that coal RPU is relatively flat sequentially with where we ended the year last year or can you help us think through that as well?\nAlan Shaw: Yeah. I would anticipate it\u2019s going to decline. It\u2019s -- we had a record RPU within our coal franchise in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re not calling for that. I noted that our utility South franchise, Justin you know, is a longer length of haul and generally as higher rates than utility North -- outperformed utility North. And so as a result, typically we talk in terms of a 50-50 mix between those two franchises and in the fourth quarter was about 60% utility South and 40% utility North. I anticipate that will go back the 50-50 moving forward. And as we\u2019ve talked about, Justin, the upside really is in that export thermal market, which has a shorter length of haul than the export met market and so that has a mix impact as well.\nJustin Long: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. Hi. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re actually referenced this directly, but on the revenue per carload. I know you talked about some individual commodities, coal, just now intermodal? But from a total company standpoint is the anticipation as we start the year it\u2019s still going to be a negative headwind and then as we move into the second and the merchandise volumes and industrial picks up and that\u2019s when it flips to sort of from a headwind to a tailwind as we think about having a slight positive for the full year? Thanks.\nAlan Shaw: You are asking -- I am sorry.\nJim Squires: Decline of RPU throughout the year.\nCindy Sanborn: Yeah. RPU.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. As we start the year.\nAlan Shaw: Oh! Yeah. It\u2019s a great question. Yeah. And I\u2019m glad you asked that. Yeah. We -- I need to make it clear that, yes, we are expecting a year-over-year decline in RPU in the first quarter. A lot of that is mixed. A lot of that is fuel surcharge headwinds. And then as you go through the year, ultimately we\u2019ll get to a point where we\u2019ve got a modest increase in RPU that is driven by, we\u2019ve talked about a 9% revenue increase and a high upper single digit volume increase.\nJordan Alliger: Great. Thanks so much. That was my question.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Squires for closing comments.\nJim Squires: Thank you for your questions today. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participating. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Alan Shaw",
            "content": "Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. Headwinds related to COVID-19 and energy markets challenged volume in 2020, with revenue improving sequentially through the second half of the year. Throughout the recovery, we continued our focus, our project driven growth and margin improvement supported by our market approach and service product. As you can see on slide 11, the dual shock of the pandemic and declining energy markets pressured volumes in 2020. However, volume in both our intermodal and industrial markets excluding energy returned to growth during the fourth quarter as the economy continued its recovery from the pandemic. Turning to slide 12, full year 2020 revenue decreased 13% and total volume declined 12%. While our business capitalized on a V shaped recovery and consumer driven markets, year-over-year declines persisted in energy, which accounted for more than 70% of the 2020 revenue decline. Our continued commitment to margin improvement partially mitigated these impacts, resulting in RPU less fuel increases in all three business groups during each of the last four years. The mixed impact of increasing share of intermodal volume relative to decrease in energy volume resulted in the total RPU decline. Merchandise revenue fell 11%, with almost all markets experiencing pandemic-related losses. Notably, energy-related commodities faced supply and demand shocks, prompting high inventory levels and record low commodity prices. Most prominent in the second quarter, dramatic declines in manufacturing and vehicle production, placed downward pressure on steel prices and production for much of the year. Intermodal revenue recovered significantly in the second half of the year. However, first half losses resulted in a 6% revenue reduction and a 2% decline in revenue excluding fuel for the full year. E-commerce and consumer driven business supported the intermodal recovery, particularly in our premium segment. Secular declines in the coal industry accelerated during the pandemic, as cold revenue and volume dropped 37% in 2020 in the face of declining low demand, with product substitutes gaining market share. Utility volume fell sharply year-over-year due to sustained low natural gas prices, reduced industrial power demand and high stockpiles. Lower seaborne coal prices were a headwind entering 2020, which coupled with the onset of COVID-19 and import restrictions, led to challenge volumes, especially in the second and third quarters. While pandemic conditions negatively impacted revenue and volume in 2020, we maintained our focus on delivering a service product that enables our customers and Norfolk Southern to grow, as the dynamic transportation environment continues to strengthen. This approach supports our strategy of providing a truck competitive, consistent and reliable service product to our customers, allowing our customers to compete, while creating operating leverage for Norfolk Southern and adding value for our shareholders. Moving to slide 13, our fourth quarter revenue results improve sequentially and outperform normal seasonality, as the economic recovery gained momentum. Total revenue for the quarter was down 4% year-over-year, as energy declines outweighed the year-over-year growth in both intermodal and merchandise excluding its energy components. RPU declined reflecting lower fuel surcharge revenue and the negative mix effect of higher intermodal and lower coal volume. Within merchandise, both volume and revenue were down 5% year-over-year, driven by declines in crude oil and natural gas liquids. Crude oil shipments were heavily impacted by reduced global consumption due to COVID-19 leading to lower refinery run rates, significant storage worldwide and unfavorable price spreads. Shipments of natural gas liquids were also down significantly due to additional pipeline capacity, coupled with lower consumption. Partially offsetting these declines were gains in soybeans from increased opportunities for export, reflecting our long standing focus on margin improvement, merchandise quarterly revenue per unit less fuel increased year-over-year for the 23rd consecutive quarter. Intermodal business levels grew meaningfully year-over-year as we leveraged our powerful franchise to secure new opportunities from the surge in e-commerce activity, record tightness in the trucking sector and recovering global demand, excluding fuel fourth quarter revenue increased 11% year-over-year. Domestic shipments were up 7% year-over-year, propelled by more than 30% increase in premium shipments. Revenue per unit less fuel reached a record level in the fourth quarter, marking the 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our coal franchise experienced continued declines, amid low energy prices in the fourth quarter. Thermal export volume increased, which was more than offset by a 40% decline in utility tons. Our utility franchise faced continued pressure from low natural gas prices, renewable generation and reduced manufacturing output. In total, coal volume fell 25% from the same period in 2019. Record level revenue per unit less fuel was driven by positive mix within our utility markets and volume shortfalls. Moving to our outlook on slide 14, we are closely monitoring economic developments and the attendant impacts on our franchise. Markets have not recovered equally. The consumer driven market recovered first and has exceeded pre-pandemic levels, while manufacturing markets have been slow to recover with existing social distancing protocols and labor force participation. Although, economic uncertainty persists, current trends support optimism for our business in the coming year, with an improving manufacturing sector and expected strength in consumer spending. With respect to the merchandise markets, we expect the steady recovery in manufacturing activity to support our customers' efforts to rebuild inventories and meet increasing demand. Total manufacturing activity is accelerating, driving opportunities across our merchandise segments. Supply chain disruptions and supplier shortages have further impacted inventory levels downward, creating an additional need for increased activity in the coming months. Prices for steel are up more than 80% year-over-year, which will lift production and trade activity. U.S. light vehicle production is expected to exceed 2019 levels by 3% in 2021, which will support automotive volume and adjacent markets like steel and plastics. Housing remains a growth story resulting in increases in construction activity. Growth in our agriculture and forest products segment will be led by agrofuels and food service related markets, as consumer gasoline demand returns and the service sector recovers, although most energy-related markets are expected to remain challenge. Projected strengthen consumer spending, low inventory levels, record tightness in the trucking industry and our best-in-class channel partners will continue to spur growth in our robust intermodal franchise. Good spending is forecasted derives 7% in 2021, due to continued pandemic induced spending patterns and high levels of personal savings, triggering increased demand for our intermodal product. Our outlook for coal remains pressured by high stockpiles that will lower utility volumes. Partially offsetting these declines will be export thermal and domestic met volumes projected to increase as the global recovery from COVID-19 continues into 2021. In summary, we expect 2021 revenue growth as overall economic conditions improved throughout the year. We're constantly adapting to the evolving needs of our customers, providing valued transportation solutions to the marketplace. We recognize that sustainable low carbon transportation is essential to our customers and our growth strategy. We remain committed to our efforts to improve fuel efficiency, modernize our fleet with energy management solutions and partner with our customers to prevent pollution. Our leadership and sustainability is resonating with our customers and the markets we serve validating these efforts. We're confident in our ability to leverage our value in the marketplace to secure new opportunities to support our customers' growth and grow our margins. I will now turn it over to Mark who will cover our financial results. Scott, as we look into \u201821, we are projecting very strong growth in both our intermodal and automotive markets, as well as our merchandise ex energy. We expect energy revenues to remain about flat. They accounted for about 75% of our revenue decline in the -- in 2020. So we're not going to have that headwind, which is going to uncover the growth in the other markets. And we're targeting 9% revenue growth, upper single-digit volume growth. So martis -- modest, pardon me, RPU growth, just because of the mix impact of intermodal leading the way. With respect to coal, I mean, you are -- you got it right. We did have about $12 million of incremental year-over-year in volume shortfall, which aided the RPU. We also had positive mix within our utility franchise in which our utility North volume, which as you know was shorter haul was down about 50% and our utility South volume was down about 30%. And then we also got some good pricing too in some of our markets as well. So all that rolls up into the overall RPU improvement that you saw within coal. Yeah. Amit. I'm sorry... I missed the last part of your question. Yeah. Amit, we talked about this a lot last year. We are fierce competitors. We're going to go out there and we're going to compete for every pound of business that's available to us, both with our eastern rail competitor and within that $800 billion trucking logistics market. We've got a lot of confidence in our franchise. We have got a lot of confidence in our customers. And you can take a look at revenue per revenue ton mile comps and you can see, our focus really is on helping our customers grow and margin improvement. Specific to merchandise, as I -- let's say that the year-over-year gap between us and our eastern rail competitor was about 550 basis points in the fourth quarter, 400 basis points of that was just an energy, 400 basis points. So that's over 80% of it. I talked about, as we lead into the fourth quarter that we were about to run up against the most difficult comp of the year with respect to crude oil and that certainly played out. And so, those energy headwinds that we saw last year, which defined about close to three quarters of our overall revenue decline, are not something that we expect to see this year. We're not calling for growth there. And if that does happen, we're well-positioned to handle it and to profit from it. And we are seeing some signs there that commodity prices are strengthening and thermal coal is in pretty high demand in the worldwide market. But we're not expecting that level of headwind this year, which is why we really believe we're going to rotate into pretty strong growth led by our intermodal and our merchandise ex energy franchise. Chris, we're going to continue our balanced approach. We've got long-term deals with our channel partners and we've frankly take a long-term approach to the markets. We do not want to interject the volatility associated with the spot market into our intermodal rate base. We do have a small percentage of business that's transactional and we're adjusting our rate plan there. But for the large part we're taking measured rate increases and then you saw our rate increases benefit from that in 2019, in the first half of 2020 when we were in a fray recession. Over time what that means is that our rates are moving at a pace that's higher than changes in the spot market and a little bit higher than what's going on in the contract market. So as a result, you should not see -- expect to see any kind of significant in -- rate increase in 2021, because frankly overall contract rates were slightly down in the truck market in 2020. It'll support for the rate improvements in 2022. Hey, John. I hope you're right. I think the thing that gives me the largest pause is the status of stockpiles at utility plants. They're at across our system. The publicly available numbers show they're pretty close to about 130 days. And so that is really going to limit volumes for us. That's about 40% higher than they were this time last year. So that's a headwind, right? And if -- they need manufacturing engineers, commercial businesses reopened to start creating that load for the utilities as well and natural gas seems to be stuck in the mid-twos per million BTUs. So that's an issue too. So those are all headwinds. But as we talked about it -- this -- if it returns, that's great, we're ready and we've got a really good coal franchise. And I do think there is some upside in thermal export coal, but we're not planning on it and we're not baking it into our outlook. That's upside. Yeah. We've got a great auto team and they've done a very good job of building that franchise for us. Yeah, there are supply disruptions and basically many of the markets, if not all of the markets that we serve, semiconductors that you referenced is something that we've heard of as well. Although, generally the automakers are allocating the scarce resources to the SUVs and trucks and vans, which is predominantly what we handle in our bi-level product. But the auto volume will be upside for us this year. David, good question. We talked about that briefly before where the drayage community slowed down in the processing of the warehousing has impacted street dwell and turns of equipment chassis and containers, and that is limiting the upside. However, even with that, we still delivered 11% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter ex-fuel surcharge. And you can see that our volumes within our intermodal franchise to start the year are up double-digit. So we've got a great franchise, we've got great channel partners. Again, they're very good at what they do and managing complex supply chains. So we're going to work with them on this. We're delivering that level of growth with our intermodal franchise now. Yeah. It is -- it really is about improve -- I am sorry, it's about improving the transparency and the visibility of what we're seeing and the assets that we share. And then it's about channel partners working with their BCS and the warehousing not getting in the chassis back into the gate. Yeah. They -- I talked about the arc of the improvements, Jason, and the fact that we didn't reflect the reduction in spot prices over the 18-month period in 2019 and the first half of 2020. Overall contract rates were -- in the truck market on average were, I think, flat or down slightly in 2020. And so we are just -- we take a long-term approaches, because I don't want to interject that level of volatility. And so our rate structure or our customers, our channel partners rates structure either, right? And they need something that they can plan on ahead of time. So, the truck market continues to improve and rate contract rates actually improve this year, go up, which we think they will, then that would be reflected in improvements in the 2022 rate structure. Well, I told you, I've mentioned Jason that, we've got long-term deals with our contract -- with our channel partners. Does that help? Okay. Thank you. Yeah. I would anticipate it's going to decline. It's -- we had a record RPU within our coal franchise in the fourth quarter. We're not calling for that. I noted that our utility South franchise, Justin you know, is a longer length of haul and generally as higher rates than utility North -- outperformed utility North. And so as a result, typically we talk in terms of a 50-50 mix between those two franchises and in the fourth quarter was about 60% utility South and 40% utility North. I anticipate that will go back the 50-50 moving forward. And as we've talked about, Justin, the upside really is in that export thermal market, which has a shorter length of haul than the export met market and so that has a mix impact as well. You are asking -- I am sorry. Oh! Yeah. It's a great question. Yeah. And I'm glad you asked that. Yeah. We -- I need to make it clear that, yes, we are expecting a year-over-year decline in RPU in the first quarter. A lot of that is mixed. A lot of that is fuel surcharge headwinds. And then as you go through the year, ultimately we'll get to a point where we've got a modest increase in RPU that is driven by, we've talked about a 9% revenue increase and a high upper single digit volume increase."

            "name": "Jim Squires",
            "content": "Good morning. And welcome to Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to begin today by recognizing the hard work and dedication of all of our employees who persevered and adapted throughout 2020 to serve our customers and communities, and enhance shareholder value. As the past year unfolded, change was one of the few constants driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a global shift in energy markets that significantly impacted our business. Our people day in and day out ensured that our railroad was positioned to succeed by delivering for our customers changing needs, while seizing efficiency opportunities that produced record productivity levels and advanced our PSR based operating plan. Moving to our results on slide four, for the quarter EPS was $2.64 and the operating ratio was an all time record at 61.8%. Prior to summarizing the full year results, I'll highlight two previously disclosed non-cash charges. First, recall in the first quarter, we launched a rationalization of our locomotive fleet by 703 units, which resulted in a non-cash charge of $385 million. This was possible due to the deep and lasting efficiency that we've driven into our train network through precision scheduled railroading. Next, in the third quarter, we disclosed a $99 million non-cash impairment charge related to an equity method investment. I will speak to full year results excluding both of these charges. For the full year, revenues declined 13% as we experienced significant disruption in business levels from the dual impacts of the global pandemic and energy market changes. In response, we pressed forward with PSR initiatives and quickly adapted to control costs. And as a result, we more than offset the revenue decline with a 14% reduction in adjusted operating expenses. The adjusted operating ratio improved to 64.4%, which marks the fifth consecutive year of improvement. As we manage significant volume fluctuations throughout the pandemic, we idled four additional hump operations, streamlined our resources and completed a redesign of our Southern operations around Atlanta ahead of peak season. Since our launch of TOP21, we've completed a total of six hump rationalizations and we've substantially reduced our asset requirements. Our ongoing efforts to improve fuel efficiency and resource productivity produced our best results to-date. These actions contributed to another year of operating ratio of improvement on an adjusted basis and are especially crucial to drive profitability and efficiency even further in 2021. We see ample opportunity to affect more positive change and remain focused on closing the OR gap with the industry. Moving into 2021, we are committed to providing a superior value to shareholders and best-in-class service to customers through an efficient profitable operation. Building further upon record productivity and efficiency gains to foster a platform of growth. Increasing resilience in our service offering and creating latent capacity to grow with our customers is in lockstep with our goals to grow profitably and efficiently. This alignment is paramount as we continue to leverage our superior positioning to consumer and industrial markets that have been proven growth drivers for Norfolk Southern. We will leave no stone unturned as we drive efficiency and create value for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Cindy. Thank you, Mark. Turning to slide 24, I will wrap up with our 2021 expectations. As you heard from Alan, we expect segments related to manufacturing and consumer activity to drive growth, while energy-related commodities are likely to remain challenged. We are modeling total revenues up approximately 9%, with intermodal leading the way, merchandise growing solidly and coal declining. The power of our intermodal and merchandise segments to propel us to growth despite the secular decline in coal highlights the continuity of our strategy over time. As we move ahead, we will leverage many avenues to drive long-term volume and revenue growth, including a fast and reliable service product, the advancement of technology initiatives such as Access NS and Rail Pulse, just to name a couple, and our steadfast commitment to being a sustainable and socially responsible corporate citizen. With this positive momentum, we expect to achieve greater than 300 basis points of OR improvement in 2021 versus our adjusted 2020 results and to end 2021 with a full year run rate of 60%. As we have said before, when we achieve our targets, we won't stop there. In addition, we expect capital expenditures to approximate $1.6 billion, with a dividend payout ratio of 35% to 40%, an increase versus our prior target payout ratio of one-third. As we demonstrated in 2020, we are committed to protecting liquidity, while using remaining cash flow and financial leverage to repurchase shares. We are optimistic about growth in the year ahead and we will advance productivity initiatives to bring freight onto the railroad more profitably than ever. We know there is more improvement to be made across the organization and we'll continue executing on our commitments to drive efficiencies and create long-term sustained value for our shareholders. Thank you for your attention. We'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Depreciation. Yeah. Bascome, I think we've got pretty good visibility into this, at least for the next couple quarters. You saw our merchandise ex energy rotating the growth year-over-year during the fourth quarter. So -- and we're continuing with that level of momentum. As you've noted, steel prices are at like 12-year highs, right? And so our customers are talking about adding back capacity. The corn market, or I should say, the corn, wheat and soybean market, that -- those commodity prices are about six-year highs and then the housing market is about as strong as it's been in 14 years. And so, you couple that with the fact that wholesale inventory levels are close to two-year lows and there's a lot of demand for our product out there. Even in the paper market, those who make corrugated cardboard, they're sold out because of the proliferation of e-commerce. And so across the Board, we're seeing strength in our merchandise network, which gives us a lot of confidence as we move into \u201821. Yeah. No. You're exactly right. We've -- Cindy highlighted that a little bit. We've got capacity for growth, since most of our growth is going to be oriented towards consumer and manufacturer, and that's generally carloads, small block shipments and that's going to fit neatly into existing intermodal and merchandise trains. Now just the data point, within our intermodal franchise, we've really been working on our productivity and train weight has improved year-over-year about 900 basis points more than train length. And so right there, you can visualize kind of vertical stacking of and creating more revenue density, improving productivity of crews and fuel and locomotives. Thanks, Amit. Good morning. Thanks, Cherilyn. Good morning. They -- the congestion out on the West Coast ports has limited the Transcon volume that we enjoy. And it's also caused some of our channel partners to allocate more assets out there, which limits upside in the East. And then with respect to Chicago, all of the congestion that we're seeing in Chicago is largely outside of our intermodal gates and that's with the drayage community and with warehouses as they go through pandemic protocols and regularly have difficulty getting people to work because of COVID concerns. And so that -- what that does share on is it slows down the turn of the assets, the chassis and the boxes, which can limit upside volume as well. So we're communicating really closely with our channel partners. We have got -- we're aligned with the best in the business and they're really good at what they do. And so we're working on solutions collaboratively in order to mitigate these impacts. And as a result, you saw that our intermodal revenue ex-fuel was up 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Strongly disagree with that characterization of PSR is applied to an intermodal franchise. We believe that and we have applied PSR principles to our intermodal network and we'll continue to do so, while maintaining intermodal as a growth engine. Cindy? Yeah. Ravi, let me be clear. We are going to benefit from the tight truck market and you're going to see that both in volume and in intermodal and in merchandise. We have got -- we're looking at really healthy growth in our merchandise ex energy and in our intermodal volumes this year. What I've talked about is our long-term approach to markets and this is something that we've employed for years within our intermodal franchise and it's -- we don't want that level of volatility associated with the spot market into our rate structure. We do have a small portion of our intermodal business that's transactional and we are reassessing our rate plan to the positive there. However, for most of it, it's the rate increases unwind over time. And as a result, what you see is over time, less volatility and yet our price and intermodal exceeds the spot market and so that really exceeds the contract market. Recall, I mean, contract rates were flat or slightly down on the truck market in 2020. We took rate increases and we've got 16 consecutive quarters of RPU less fuel improvements and -- in our intermodal franchise in 23 consecutive quarters and our merchandise franchise. So we take a measured approach to this. Yeah. Good morning, Justin. So I think one way to think about our revenue growth in 2021, it's 9%, right? And so I've talked about how energy, which is pretty close to about 20% of our revenue base is going to be flat. So you can envision that and the rest of our market, which is generally the more truck competitive we are seeing above 9% revenue growth and that's above macro. And so with that implicit in that is the fact that we are going to continue to target that $800 billion truck and logistics market, and leverage the strength of our franchise, which includes intermodal network and the fact that we've got a diverse merchandise network and we sit on top of a majority of the consumption and the manufacturing in the United States. Decline of RPU throughout the year. Thank you for your questions today. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter."

            "name": "Cindy Sanborn",
            "content": "Good morning. When I spoke to you last quarter, I had been at Norfolk Southern for less than two months, but I had already found a strong foundation and opportunities for us to maximize the value of our franchise. The most recent quarter has reinforced my belief in the magnitude of opportunity in front of us and that we are positioned to capture that opportunity. During the fourth quarter, we saw volumes continue their climb from pandemic induced lows earlier in the year, so the mission of the operating team was handling more business, while reducing resources and improving productivity. Our push for efficiency leads to record train weight and record train lengths in the quarter. These larger trains combined with our strategy of better matching train size and locomotive horsepower, drove us to record fuel efficiency and enabled us to get the job done with a smaller workforce and a record low count of locomotives. I also have to thank the people that make up our operations team and all crafts. We achieved these records due to their hard work, and most importantly, we did so safely. Turning to slide seven, our network performance throughout most of 2020 was strong, with many metrics at or above record performance levels even with unprecedented volume volatility. We accelerated network changes in the fourth quarter ahead of holiday peak season and as volume reached the highest point of the year. As you can see on the slide, our network fluidity metrics came under pressure as the quarter progressed. It is important to note that implementing these network changes as soon as possible, while challenging is a key to future success with our ongoing efficiency and growth initiatives, which I'll cover in more detail shortly. I can confidently say that we are meeting these challenges head on and have already improved fluidity in the first quarter as the black line on the graph indicates. We are focused on executing and improving the plan, and when necessary and justified deploying temporary resources to quickly address congested areas. For example, while we put locomotives into storage this quarter, we will use those locomotives temporarily if needed before returning them to inactive status. I have been very pleased with the way the team has risen to the challenge, especially during the holiday peak season when they upped their game to meet service expectations, even with additional premium intermodal traffic. Moving to slide eight, traffic coming back is both our challenge and an opportunity. We can and will add resources to meet customer needs, but first we must explore every option to fully utilize our existing crews and locomotives. We eliminate a lot of structural costs, including indirect and supporting costs during the pandemic. So we're being very careful to keep those costs from creeping back. Before we add a new service, the team goes through an extensive vetting process to explore the alternatives, including rebalancing traffic between existing trains and tactical extra trains. The focus is on using additional volume to help us increase the value we bring out of each locomotive and each crew start. Railcar velocity is our touchstone throughout as we push to quickly move volumes through the network. We have also made our organizational structure within operations more efficient during the quarter by reducing from nine to six geographic divisions and delayering our management structure to speed decision making and ensure that communication is clear and quick. As Alan will explain, we are preparing for significant volume growth in 2021. On slide nine, our six techniques that will help us get maximum leverage from additional traffic. Full pin is a technique used to optimally match train size with the pulling power of locomotives. While volume fluctuations can make this challenging, full pin drives fuel efficiency, controls crew starts and improves asset turns. Increasing the blending of different kinds of traffic on the same train supports full pin and minimizes additional train starts. We improve car velocity by blocking cars for the most distant possible destination, reducing yard costs by minimizing handlings. While we have reshaped the network through our four recent hump yard conversions, we are successfully minimizing hiring and training costs by helping furloughed employees in one craft transfer to another. This helps both the employee and Norfolk Southern. Those craft transfers are one way we are being more agile, flexing our resources up and down in sync with traffic volumes. We adapted the plan quickly through the pandemic and we continue to exercise that muscle memory. Finally, we are dynamically managing our operation to handle traffic fluctuations, keeping cars moving even when volume spikes. I am confident that we can meet customer expectations with our fast efficient network. With that, I will turn it over to Alan. Hey. Brian, thanks for the question. So, as we went into the fourth quarter with some of our operational changes, our Southeast plan, I also referenced in my prepared remarks, some organizational changes that we made. And in fact, we did reduce our locomotive fleet by about 100 locomotives during the quarter. So as we digested a lot of those challenges, we were starting to run a little slower, and we did in fact, inject a little bit of support from a resource perspective in temporarily. I would also add that as we were recovering from some of the challenges that I described, we did have some COVID impacts with some of our employees out as part of the COVID protocols and also don't feel as individuals. So that was how we were -- kind of how I would diagnose the fourth quarter. As we come out of the fourth quarter running through the holidays to get back on our feet, we've gotten a lot better. We're not at 2020 levels, but we are much, much better. We are continuing to tweak and take resources out in terms of consolidating train. So we still have opportunities to digest changes within the network. But as necessary, we will inject a resource -- some resources into make sure that we recover quickly from challenges that we may have. From thinking about the volume that we're seeing, I think, some of it is in unit train and that will require resource use a little bit different than our scheduled network. But I will tell you that in our scheduled network, we still have a lot of opportunity to consolidate trains, make them longer and make them heavier, even on top of the gains that we made in the fourth quarter. And I can tell you that, even in our intermodal fleet, for example, our intermodal train operation, we've got about 10% of our trains are operating over 10,000 feet. So we still have some opportunity to grow in that space and that should help us manage our headcount in this year to flat to down from where we exited \u201820 -- December of 2020. So I'm pretty confident we will continue to make some gains there and also our locomotive fleet. No. I think that sums it up very, very well. And I think what -- while we're very encouraged by the growth and we want to serve our customers and have a great sort of service product out here, if it doesn't come, we're going to take appropriate action. So we have a lot of opportunity, even with absorb existing growth and continue to consolidate trains and consolidate cars. Just focus on our car velocity initiative, but we will pivot if we need to pivot. So team is -- we got a lot of momentum here. If you look at the results coming out fourth quarter and the first, a lot of momentum and we will drive hump. Yeah. I would say that, PSR is really about simplifying things and having very good asset terms. That can be done in any class of business you want to think about. And absorbing volume growth into existing schedule trains, mixing trains so that we in case some cases while you will see some intermodal in the train, you'll also see manifest and other commodities. So, all of those are levers that you naturally pull with PSR and are completely compatible with any kind of business that we might be able to bring onto the rail. Yeah. So guidance would be flat-to-down from where we ended 2020. So -- but -- and to your point, some of the odd -- some of the reason we would need to keep it flat would be the unit trains. So what that implies is that we're still consolidating and still figuring ways to make our schedule network much more efficient and absorb the growth and provide a very solid service product for our customers. So that's our mission going forward. We're actively in it now and have been. And I'm very pleased with the momentum that we have there and going forward I think we'll see good results from it. Yeah. When I spoke about that, it was really about recovering from some of the challenges that we faced in the fourth quarter, including some COVID impacted crew districts, where we had to move some temporary in from a headcount perspective. Those were back out now. And then, secondly, we had reduced locomotives in the quarter and some of the challenges that we had at the very end, we injected those for a very temporary period of time and have since pulled those out. So, what I was talking about earlier in my commentary was really around the fourth quarter. Yeah. Jason, so we talked about some of our terminal consolidations and hump conversions that have occurred over the last couple of years. You've seen us work very, very strongly prior to my arriving in that area. We have four actual humps left operating as hump yards. And so, we will continue to look at yards and see how we can speed up cars, the real mission around a terminal capability and terminal footprint is around keeping cars moving or not pushing cars into terminals, moving cars past terminal. So I think there is still some room there, quite a bit of room, but you've seen us pivot now a little bit more into looking at our train length and locomotive utilization with full pin. And that's going to -- that's really our primary focus now. But we will always circle back and find opportunities to get the most out of our network and speed up cars and terminals are one of the methods that we use to do that. So there is always opportunity. And as we think about growth and we see the growth that we're having in 2021, it probably will look a little different than maybe what we would have thought in 2020. So we have to be very agile in looking at opportunities and we will continue to do that. So I don't have a specific number for you, Jason, but understand it is, we're really never done with looking at structural costs and we'll pull that out every opportunity we can find. Yeah. Ravi, we are doing the exact same things. Really we do have plans around the inspection portals, automated train inspection or truck inspection, excuse me, as well as mobility tools to help our employees be more effective and efficient and more time on tool if you will, as well as think of analytics to help us manage through failures before they become failures and not have to wait for a failure in terms of let's say a switch failure or something on line road be able to predict that. So we've got a number of great projects that are in flight and we're working very closely with our technology team here to get quick adoption and make our railroad safer and more efficient with the use of technology. Yeah. RPU."

            "name": "Mark George",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. On slide 16, you'll note Q4 2020 was free of any non-core items, meaning the OR improvement of 240 basis points was clean. We did in Q4 2019 report a non-operating asset impairment of $21 million. That adversely impacted EPS by $0.06 and a $19 million retroactive income tax credit that aided EPS by $0.07. So with the absence of those two items, core EPS improvement this quarter was $0.10. Moving to the fourth quarter highlights on slide 17. Revenue was down 4% on volume that was down 1% as mix and fuel surcharge headwinds continued. Against that 1% decline in volume we drove down operating expenses by 8% in the quarter as benefits from workforce and asset productivity continued to grow. As a result, operating income actually grew in the quarter by $22 million or 2% and the operating ratio improved to 61.8, a 240-basis-point improvement over Q4 of 2019. This is a record low OR for Norfolk Southern and we are well-positioned to continue driving this down in 2021 and beyond. The margin improvement achieved in the fourth quarter capped off a year in which free cash flow improved by 14% to $2.1 billion, another record for NS. Moving to a review of operating expenses on slide 18. Total OpEx was down $139 million or 8%, fuel was down 87 million with lower pump prices contributing to $62 million of that reduction and consumption was down $21 million led by fewer GTMs, as well as a 3% improvement in fuel efficiency in the quarter. Comp and benefits are down 7% led mainly by employment cost with the workforce down by 3,300 or 15%, $10 million in one-time separation costs for certain craft employees partially offset these savings. Purchase services was down $41 million or 11%, as we're making progress on the structural and semi-structural costs within this category, as well as due to the absence of detouring costs associated with flooding in the prior year. Depreciation increased modestly by less than 1%, as we've been able to successfully reduce asset intensity, including within the locomotive fleet, which continues to have ample surge capacity to absorb growth. Materials were down 7% due to lower spend associated with a smaller and more productive locomotive fleet. Lastly, gains on the sales of operating property was $11 million in the quarter, a decline of $32 million versus the prior year. So another quarter of expense reductions far in excess of the volume decline, leaving us well primed to deliver strong operating leverage as 2021 unfolds. Now turning to slide 19, for the remainder of the fourth quarter P&L. Below the operating income, you'll see that other income net of $43 million is $25 million better than the prior year, due to the absence of the $21 million impairment of natural resource assets in Q4 2019. We also had another quarter of healthy gains on our company own life insurance investments. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was just under 23%, helped by the coal gains that are exempt from income taxes. Net income increased by 1% and EPS rose by 4%, as we ramped up share repurchases to nearly $500 million in the quarter. Now for a look at the full year on slide 20 and to preface I'll speak to the adjusted numbers on this slide, excluding the impacts of the two non-cash charges during the year, the $385 million locomotive rationalization and the $99 million investment impairment. Despite the unprecedented volatility in business volumes that resulted in a 13% decline in revenues, we maintained focus on our long-term operational transformation, while adapting to the market changes that were induced by the global pandemic, as well as the contracting energy markets. In the midst of this, we produce record workforce productivity, locomotive productivity and fuel efficiency, which allowed us to more than match the revenue decline with a 14% reduction in adjusted operating expenses, while ensuring we are ready to serve improving freight demand as the economy recovers. The adjusted operating ratio posted improvement to 64.4%, the fifth consecutive year of improvement. But there's more under the covers when we look at the 30-basis-point improvement for the year. Moving now to slide 21, you can see during the second quarter of 2020, the 29% hit to revenue on a year-over-year basis took a toll on the operating ratio, but every other quarter of the year, improved in the 230-basis-point to 240-basis-point range. Throughout the year and especially during the depths of the pandemic induced volume trough, the team really pressed forward to adapt our operating plan to the changing business environment. In fact, two of the four hump idling during the year occurred within Q2 and when the nationwide automotive network shut down, we completely redesigned our auto plan to absorb it into existing trains. In addition, we continue to press lower on resources and ensure that we were able to serve a surge in demand as economic activity increased, which is exactly what happened. We maintained a heightened sense of urgency to transform the business, while ensuring we are positioned for long term success and further margin improvement. Moving on to cash flow on slide 22, although 2020 cash from operations came in under the 2019 levels, spend on property additions for the year was right in line with the reduced target we set earlier in the year of $1.5 billion, which was a 26% reduction from 2019 levels. We pivoted early in the year to this reduced CapEx target at the outset of the pandemic and executed the plan, while keeping priority on the health of the physical network. Thanks to these tight controls on both capital and operating expenses, free cash flow improved to a record $2.1 billion, while shareholder distributions total $2.4 billion. Average share count declined by 3%, with over 1.4 billion of buybacks as we maintain tight focus on returning capital to shareholders, while maintaining strong liquidity. To close, we have excellent momentum on improving both our cost and asset structures while we deliver on the growth in 2021. We expect this formula to yield even greater margins and cash flow and we remain committed to delivering significant returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll hand back over to Jim. Yeah. The property gains, Brian, were in the quarter -- the fourth quarter were $11 million. We ended up the year at really $26 million of gains, a little shy of where we had intended or thought. And the guidance for 2021 is to be in that $30 million to $40 million range. But these property gains are lumpy and they can move around and we'll provide some transparency. And if we have bigger ones in a given quarter, we'll call them out and let you know. Thank you. Scott, are you referring to 2021? Or 2020? Yeah. Right. So for cost per employee, you can expect the traditional year-over-year inflationary rate increases of a few percent, but you're going to also have some incentive headwinds as well. Clearly, we didn't pay out on incentive compensation at target this year. We fully expect to be at or above target next year. So you'll have pressures there. In addition, you're going to have some pressures on certain variable costs, like purchase services, and as Alan says [ph], those go with volume. And we are, though, however, pushing on efficiency and productivity to help mitigate some of those things. I'm not going to put a finer point on that just yet, Scott. But you can probably compute that, this year incentive comp was down and we expect that that is going to bounce back and hopefully bounce back significantly. But we'll provide a little bit more guidance on that as we get into the year and we start to see how the trends are going. Thank you. Sure. Amit, I will start. Cindy can provide some color. But, yeah, look, the cost inflation as I had mentioned, we're going to be fighting some traditional inflation in terms of wages. But we are looking to really hold headcount flat or perhaps even drift down from where we ended this year. And that's largely going to be dependent upon where this incremental volume comes is to how aggressive we can get on constricting some of those headcount related costs. But we've -- we feel pretty good and pretty confident with our plan to manage it that way and mitigate some of the wage inflation. We do have fuel inflation in our cost as well, as well as you have normal step up in depreciation. But other areas where we're baking in some efficiency and productivity gains in multiple levels in the P&L, and I think, we feel like, Cindy, had talked about, we have the capacity. We can make our trains longer. Yes, when we have unit train type of traffic, we're going to have to add some crews and costs. But aside from that, Cindy, would you add anything? Thank you, Walter, for the question. So, look, the main driver of volatility in that line is our -- the returns on our company own life insurance investments, which are invested in a combination of both equities and fixed incomes. So it does move around quite a bit, depending on market performance and that's why you see the volatility you see. We've guided historically that other income would be in that $80 million to $100 million range. But, frankly, it will move around quarter-to-quarter. And if markets deteriorate, it's going to be a potential headwind for us. But we've enjoyed a pretty good healthy gains here these past couple years. Yeah. So you're right, we guide to 23%, 24%. We're not going to change that guidance right now. We know that there's tax law being debated and whether the federal statutory rate moves up to 28%, which is what the current administration is aiming for. We don't know the timing. We don't know if there'll be some compromise at a lower rate. But our better performance than the guide, it's really driven by in large part the company own life insurances, those gains are non-tax. So that definitely provides us tailwind, which is why we've been better past couple of years than the guided rate. We're not going to bake that in and anticipate more tailwind from that here in 2021. So we're going to stick with our guide of 23% to 24%. Thanks, Walter. Allison, this is Mark. Thanks for the question. We're not going to get into the quarterly guidance for Q1. Volume will play a role. Obviously, volume has started strong here. But as you know Q1 typically is the highest OR quarter that we do have. There are some seasonal cost reasons for that, whether or not -- I would expect from a year-over-year perspective, we will show improvement each quarter. But sequentially, I'm not going to get into that yet until we understand where volumes fall out. With regard to the timing of the year, it will also depend on the cadence of the volume throughout the year. I would expect to be on a glide path for that 60 and it's too early to say again, what quarter we're going to touch it. Sure, Allison. So we're basically staying fully committed to our BBB+, Baa1 credit rating with Moody's. So we're going to manage leverage in the course of the year accordingly to make sure that we work towards staying in balance and stay committed again to our current rating. So I'm not going to put an exact number of what that means in terms of incremental debt or necessarily deleveraging, but just know that we're committed to be within the balance. Thank you. David our intermodal franchise as you know is unrivaled in the East. It's a position of strength for us and for our shareholders and for our channel partners. PSR is about reducing complexity and running the trains on time, which is exactly what you want in an intermodal network. And we already have a point-to-point intermodal network with a lot -- with very little intermediate switching. We are very focused on our productivity initiatives within intermodal to drive additional business into the existing train structure and I noted earlier the fact that our train weight increases about 900 basis points above our train length increase. And so what that does is -- what we're doing is we're just adding that additional business into the existing trains and improving our ability to double stack. We are double stack capable and well over 95% of our launch [ph] segments. Yeah. Thanks. We've took our CapEx down at a significant readjusted baseline level of $1.5 billion this past year. And we've talked throughout the year about the fact that we want to grow it modestly from here and really like to see revenue out -- revenue growth outpaced the growth in CapEx. That means growing into a smaller percentage then so be it and certainly that's where the math equates to this year is that we will grow into a smaller percentage. We want to do CapEx and budget CapEx based on logic and need not just based on revenue based affordability for example. But that said, we put this budget together and if Alex come, I am sorry, if Alan comes in and says we've got these certain projects we need to help drive growth. We will examine it. If Cindy comes and says, we got some work to do on siding expansions or to augment the network a little bit more from a maintenance away perspective, we'll examine it. So we're not going to be dogmatic and I would like to kind of bury the 16% to 18% range from here."

It is now my pleasure to introduce Pete Sharbel, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Sharbel, you may now begin.\nPete Sharbel: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.\nJim Squires: Good morning, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. Before diving into our third quarter results, I'll highlight a previously disclosed noncash impairment charge of $99 million, related to an equity method investment. Slide 4 provides an adjusted view of our financials, excluding this charge, which is the view I will speak to in my comments this morning. During the third quarter, our volumes decreased 7% year-over-year, while adjusted operating expenses were down 15%, more than double the volume decline. On an adjusted basis, we reported our best operating ratio to date, but this is just the beginning. As we continue rolling out PSR, our team sees additional opportunities for efficiency and growth that will close the OR gap with the rest of the industry, driving shareholder value creation. As our third quarter results demonstrate, we are implementing sustainable cost structure improvements across our company. Employment levels are down 25% since the start of 2019, while active locomotives have decreased by 26%. We have advanced these resource improvements every quarter since launching TOP21 last year, including most recently by decreasing headcount by 2% sequentially in the third quarter, even as volumes surged 22%. We converted a fifth hump yard in the quarter, and you will hear from Cindy regarding further network enhancements that are underway. In the coming quarters, we will identify and execute on additional productivity initiatives to yield further efficiency gains. Turning to network performance. Even as we implemented deep and lasting cost structural moves in the third quarter, we ran a fast and fluid network with train speed, terminal dwell, train performance and shipment consistency, all better than before TOP21. We've now pushed train size to record levels. Finally, we are excited to have Cindy Sanborn join us as Chief Operating Officer. Cindy came to NS to drive operational change and improvement, bringing decades of experience and a deep commitment to precision scheduled railroading. Cindy has made it clear she sees many opportunities to increase efficiency and bottom line results at NS, and I know she looks forward to sharing her thoughts. Cindy?\nCindy Sanborn: Thank you, Jim. I am very excited to lead operations and look forward to participating in the analyst calls as Chief Operating Officer. For those of you I've not yet met, I've been railroading for 33 years and have experience working for several Class I railroads. My experience has included driving change and achieving what PSR is all about, being efficient, consistent and improving the operating ratio. What drew me to Norfolk Southern are the significant opportunities ahead. Each railroad is different in terms of markets and customer mix, but I believe we can and will operate at the very best levels of the industry. Across the organization, I am finding a team that is committed to driving efficiency while delivering the highest quality service to our customers. I know that we have great potential and are just getting started, making this company more productive. Moving to Slide 6. We have a strong foundation in place, but we still have a lot more work to do and we need to move faster. Our top priority is building on the momentum underway by taking steps to further unlock our PSR capabilities. We are taking a bottoms-up approach to reviewing each part of the operation, and I am confident we will find opportunities to apply principles that have been successful during prior experiences. In my 58 days here, I've already found opportunities that will help us improve and achieve higher levels of productivity. We are transitioning to put additional focus on railcar velocity. This scrutiny at the most granular level represents a big opportunity to convert structural change into gains in fuel efficiency, train size, equipment utilization and service levels. Turning to the quarter on Slide 7. Our mission was to absorb returning volumes with minimal additional cost. We successfully achieved this goal and in so doing, made significant network changes that we expect to yield ongoing efficiencies. Here we see continued year-over-year improvements in our service and productivity metrics. By leveraging the increased volumes versus the second quarter, we drove improved productivity while maintaining stable service metrics. Returning volumes, combined with disciplined execution and successful control of additional train starts, enabled us to drive train weight and fuel efficiency to record levels. I've added train length to the metrics shown here because we actively manage train length, and this represents another opportunity for improvement. I've included a snapshot of our train length history in the appendix, because it is important that we have a baseline for measurement. Across these efficiency indicators, we have significant opportunities for improvement. The graph on the next slide is an updated illustration of our train productivity since the onset of the pandemic. As volume continued to ramp up throughout the quarter, we kept crew starts virtually flat in August and September. Instead of reverting to previous train plans, we blended traffic into our new train plan to leverage the existing available capacity. The more important takeaway is that most of our train plan still has capacity to absorb traffic, and our initiatives on car velocity and train size are designed to produce even more productivity. Moving to Slide 9 to discuss where we are structurally with network configuration. As you already know, the beginning of the transformation included the idling of the hump at two yards last year. Then in the second quarter of this year, two more were idle for a total of four. But as you've heard the team say many times, we are focused on creating additional opportunities for improvement. In September, we stopped using the hump at Enola, Pennsylvania, the fifth hump to go down since last year. The change at Enola avoids an upcoming capital investment and will result in a more reliable and faster operation. Next week, we are kicking off a much larger set of changes in the South. When we stop hump operations at our yard in Macon, Georgia. Concurrently, we will also close several local yards in the Atlanta area. These changes enable us to rework many of our Southeastern intermodal flows for improved service, lower cost and additional growth capacity. After the Macon conversion, we will have curtailed operations at six humps in just the past 18 months, leaving us with four high-volume hump yards. Before I conclude, I want to emphasize the team is moving with a sense of urgency. The make and change is just one example of how we have accelerated our plans to create efficiencies. That project originally planned for early 2021 is being executed more quickly. I said it earlier, but let me reiterate, this is just the beginning. Our opportunities are significant. And I am excited about keeping you up to speed on the progress we are going to make. Now I will turn it over to Alan, who will cover the market outlook.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, volume improved sequentially as business levels continued to recover from April and May lows. Consumer-driven markets are driving the gains reflected in our intermodal and automotive franchises, which delivered year-over-year volume growth in the third quarter. Norfolk Southern and our customers are responding to market needs amid an extremely tight truck market, playing to the strengths of our service-focused product and our robust consumer-oriented franchise. We continue to enhance our pipeline for growth with sustained investment by our customers along our lines. We checked the pulse of economic trends and market shifts, innovating supply chain solutions for existing and potential customers. These solutions evolve as the environment changes, as exemplified by the COVID-induced supply chain shifts and the need for increased inventory levels and faster distribution. Our strong customer relationships and market knowledge have allowed us to respond to these market shifts and quickly secure new business. Moving to Slide 11. Revenue for the quarter declined 12% year-over-year, driven by 39% decline in our energy-related markets, while our remaining markets declined 4%. Overall volume was down 7% as growth in intermodal and automotive partially offset energy declines. Price gains have now produced higher revenue per unit less fuel for 15 consecutive quarters in both our merchandise and intermodal business units. Overall, RPU was impacted by the negative mix associated with increased intermodal volume and lower fuel surcharges. The continued effects of the pandemic and lower energy prices led to 10% decline in merchandise revenue for the quarter. Recovery in the automotive sector partially offset these declines with revenue 9% higher than prior year levels as manufacturers increase vehicle production to meet consumer demand. Merchandise RPU less fuel increased 3% year-over-year as we continued to deliver solid service. Our intermodal volumes surpassed 2019 levels with growth in our domestic franchise. E-commerce activity and record tight truck capacity strengthened demand that was further enhanced by new intermodal services and our superior franchise. International volume growth improved throughout the quarter, with September daily volumes 13% above July. Intermodal revenue and RPU were impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue, with RPU less fuel up 3% due to positive price and mix. Coal revenue declined 38% year-over-year due to sustained low natural gas prices and high inventories. Utility volumes fell 30% but improved on a sequential basis with warmer than normal weather Year-over-year, export continued to face demand challenges and low seaborne pricing. Moving to our outlook on Slide 12. We expect continued strength in our consumer oriented markets. The energy market will remain a headwind but its impact has decreased as coal revenue represented 10% of our top line in the third quarter. External economic forecasts remain optimistic and expect continued improvement as the economy adjusts. The impacts of lower interest rates and improved personnel income will continue to drive spending in the consumer markets with housing starts and durable goods spending experiencing V-shaped recoveries. Manufacturing has been slower to recover and has not kept pace with sales, evidenced by the declining inventory sales ratio, a positive indicator for future transportation demand. Truck capacity is at the tightest level on record, also generating a greater need and opportunity for Norfolk Southern's product. Within merchandise, the negative impacts of low energy prices will continue to be a drag on energy volume in the fourth quarter. Strength in the soybean export market will mitigate some of that headwind, while the automotive recovery will benefit adjacent markets like steel and plastics. Norfolk Southern's automotive volume is expected to decrease sequentially due to plant downtime associated with model changeovers, offsetting increased production from other plants. We are collaborating with our customers to deliver supply chain solutions to help them compete in an evolving market. Intermodal's continued strength will be supported by economic factors, including e-commerce, low inventories and a tight truck market, as well as in-house initiatives promoting new products and highway conversions. Deep supply chain disruptions from COVID have led many of our customers to reevaluate how they move goods to reduce risk. We are working with our best-in-class channel partners on new opportunities, delivering a truck like product and providing capacity to move their business safely and efficiently. We continue to leverage our capacity dividend from efficiency improvements to expand our business, built upon the foundation of our robust and flexible intermodal franchise. Within coal, we expect the utility market to face pressure associated with high stockpiles and low natural gas prices. Export volumes are likely to improve sequentially, although seaborne prices will remain below prior year levels. At Norfolk Southern, we remain poised to continue to seize immediate opportunities for growth at the same time that we strategize to the long game, focused on delivering profitable growth to our shareholders, while serving our customers and growing our franchise. We are executing this strategy with investments already made in consumer driven markets that provide access to over half of the US population, positioned to succeed in the fastest growing segments of the US economy. We will continue to realize the value of our service product, maintaining our focus on profitable growth through both revenue and volume. We built and maintained strong relationships with our strategic partners and provide them with an excellent service product, meeting their needs and allowing our customers and Norfolk Southern to grow profitably and sustainably, which I will discuss further on Slide 13. Through our powerful intermodal franchise and best-in-class network of industrial development sites, short line partnerships and transload facilities, which serve to expand the reach of our rail product, we are delivering more options than ever to a marketplace that is increasingly valuing low carbon transportation solutions. Our unique pioneering role in sustainability is evidenced by our decade-long participation in force carbon offset programs in South Carolina and along the Mississippi River, as well as our wetland restoration projects. In addition, we continue to reduce our impact by enhancing fuel efficiency, which you heard from Cindy, as we modernize our locomotive fleet and deploy energy management solutions. We have partnered with customers as part of a pledge called Operation Clean Suite to prevent plastic pollution while it is in transit. These are just a few of the reasons Norfolk Southern was recently named one of the 100 most sustainably managed companies in the world by the Wall Street Journal. Rail is three to four times more fuel-efficient than truck and our leadership and sustainability resonates with our customers and the markets we serve, and will be an important aspect of the continuing growth story across our truck competitive segments as we leverage our commitment to sustainability. I will now turn it over to Mark, who will cover our financial results.\nMark George: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. On Slide 15, you see the key financial measures. I'll talk on this slide and in the remainder of the presentation to the adjusted numbers, excluding the impact of the $99 million impairment charge. Revenue was down 12% on volume that was down 7%. As Alan shared, RPU ex-fuel for our merchandise and intermodal segments was positive but declining fuel surcharge revenue, along with adverse business mix, including within coal, created revenue headwinds. We drove down operating expenses 15% in the quarter with comp and ben, purchased services, fuel and materials, all declining by double digit percentages, solidly in excess of the volume decline. This resulted in operating income being down 6% and an operating ratio of 62.5%, that was 240 basis points better than Q3 of 2019. Despite the $57 million decline in operating income, free cash flow of $1.7 billion for the nine months was more durable, up by $211 million or 14%, a record for AMS. On Slide 16, you'll see the walk of our adjusted earnings from Q3 2019 referenced at the bottom has a 240 basis point improvement in or and $0.02 increase in EPS. You will recall that in Q3 2019, we had a receivable write off that adversely impacted operating income, creating a favorability in the compares this quarter by 110 basis points in the OR and $0.09 on EPS. That leaves core OR improvement in Q3 2020 as 130 basis points while EPS declined by $0.07. The OR improvement was driven by strong operating expense reductions versus last year, as you'll see on Slide 17. Operating expenses were down $278 million or 15%. Comp and benefits are down 15%, led mainly by our employment cost with the workforce down by 4,400 or 18%. Fuel was down $100 million with lower pump prices contributing to $61 million of that reduction and consumption was down $36 million, led by fewer GTMs, as well as a strong 6% improvement in fuel efficiency in the quarter. Material spend was down $13 million due to lower spend associated with smaller and more efficient locomotive and railcar fleets. Purchased services was down $35 million or 10% as we continue evaluating the structural and semi-structural costs within this category. I'll point out that the depreciation increase of $7 million was due to a nonrecurring leasehold improvement write off due to a terminated lease. Given the amount of structural change that we're driving into the business each and every month, I'd like to touch on how we have recovered from the volume trough in the second quarter on Slide 18. As background, recall in Q2 we did a tremendous amount of work to manage the short-term by more than matching the volume decline with crew start leverage while also forging ahead with structural change by idling two hump operations and driving headcount down 20%. As a result, we positioned ourselves very well for Q3 and beyond to leverage these sustainable cost structure improvements. From Q2 levels, revenue increased 20% or $421 million, while we constrained cost to just 6% growth to deliver nearly 80% incremental margins. We drove headcount down another 2% versus Q2. Materials, purchase services and equipment rents combined for an increase of only 6% on the 20% sequential revenue gain. And fuel efficiency improved 3 points sequentially as increases to train weight and length continued to record levels, as Cindy highlighted. We are confident that our advancing implementation of PSR is producing benefits, and we have great momentum to build on our cost structure improvements moving forward. On Slide 19, we look at the full P&L, with a Q3 to Q3 look. And here, you'll see that other income net of $39 million is $17 million better than prior year. We had another strong quarter of gains on our company owned life insurance investments. These COLI returns, including proceeds, are not subject to income tax as they contributed to our lower effective tax rate in the quarter of 22%, as did the tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. This is why net income contraction was only 2% compared to the 6% contraction in operating income. Adjusted EPS, you'll note, was actually up 1% supported by nearly $300 million of share repurchase activity in the quarter. Shifting to cash flow on Slide 20. Through nine months ended September 2020, our free cash flow was a record at $1.7 billion, aided in large part by fewer capital additions, as well as timing of income tax payments. Spend on property additions was $1.05 billion, nearly $450 million below 2019 levels and on a run rate to be at our target of roughly $1.5 billion for the year, which will be 25% reduction from 2019 spend levels. With our strong cash generation and liquidity profile, we were able to continue to distribute cash to shareholders through our dividend while ramping back up share repurchase activity. In the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares for roughly $300 million. As of now, we have approximately $1.4 billion of cash on hand with less than $100 million of debt maturities in the next year, providing us confidence that we have appropriate liquidity in this uncertain market. With that, I'll hand back over to Jim.\nJim Squires: Thank you, Mark. Before we conclude, I want to recognize all of our employees for their dedication to operating this railroad as efficiently and safely as possible, while continuing to deliver for our customers during these unprecedented times. As you've heard this morning, our leadership team is unified in a commitment to improving Norfolk Southern, and will leave no stone unturned in the quest for shareholder value. We are confident our momentum will enable us to achieve our goal of 60% operating ratio. And once we get there, we won't stop as we drive additional improvements across our network. In closing, we have built an organization that is moving faster than ever to deliver returns for shareholders. Thank you for your attention. And we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Jon Chapell with Evercore ISI.\nJon Chappell: Good morning, everybody. Alan, I want to start with you. You mentioned briefly that some of your auto customers are shutting down in the fourth quarter, so do you expect a sequential decline? But if we look across autos and intermodal, incredibly strong third quarter, maybe the start to the fourth quarter a little bit less robust. Is there anything happening within the network, whether it's some of the initiatives that Cindy is putting into place? Or is this really a focus on yield as you try to manage your capacity in a tight market?\nAlan Shaw: Jon, we do have some specific planned outages and retooling in the fourth quarter within our automotive franchise that are going to create some pressure. I'll circle back to the results in the third quarter. Our revenue was up 9% year-over-year, and our audit team is working every day to make a better franchise for our customers. And so that's -- the phenomenon that you're seeing right now is a short term phenomenon. We've got a lot of confidence in the strength in our automotive franchise moving forward. Same with the intermodal franchise. We're delivering record volumes within domestic and international volumes are starting to tick into the positive territory for us right now. So we're very confident in the strength of that franchise and basically all of our consumer oriented markets moving forward. I'll tell you that Cindy is focused on improving productivity. She's also focused on giving our customers a very good service product.\nJon Chappell: That's a good lead into my quick follow-up to Cindy. Just curious as have you been there now for two months. Is your kind of initiative to come in from the top-down with maybe a new team and invoke some pretty significant changes? Or you just taking what the MS has already been doing over the last year and half and kind of tweaking here and there?\nCindy Sanborn: I would say that there's a very strong foundation that's been built here and been operating here, very focused on the basics of running a good railroad. And I'm looking at it from the bottom-up and from the top down, and it's really more than tweaking, it\u2019s ignificantly more than tweaking. I introduced some information around train length. We're going to be working on that. That helps us tremendously with our locomotive productivity as well as fuel. And we will also be working very strongly on car velocity. A lot of these hump conversions that you've seen that were referenced in my earlier remarks, the team has engaged in at a discrete level actually improves car speed and at a system level, what we want to do is avoid touches altogether, if at all possible. And if we can speed the cars up, that's good for us in terms of asset intensity and it's also good for our customers. It provides them a more timely service product. So there's quite a bit of work going on. And I'm really excited about the team here and excited about exactly what we're going to be working on.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: So maybe to start, I wanted to ask about headcount. Is there any color you can provide on your expectations for headcount sequentially going into the fourth quarter? And then maybe same question on the OR. Even if it's just directionally, would love to get your thoughts about 4Q and what we could see based on demand today? Thanks.\nJim Squires: Justin, well, let me tackle the second question first, and then I'll ask Mark to address the headcount trend. We're not going to give quarterly guidance. You see the volume trend. We're working away on the expenses. I think it would be reasonable to expect an operating ratio in the fourth quarter below last year. But beyond that we're not going to give guidance. Mark, the employment trend?\nMark George: So as you saw, the employment trends are quite strong. We took out 4,400 or 18% since Q3 2019, actually, 2,900 so far in the nine months of 2020. And sequentially, we did come down. I do believe that volume growth and attrition are both our friends from this point forward. Not going to give a specific target for Q4, but the hope is that we certainly won't add here in the fourth quarter. And hopefully, with attrition being our friend we might see continued decline.\nJustin Long: And then, Cindy, maybe one for you. When you look at that 500 to 600 basis point margin gap versus your Eastern competitor today. I wanted to ask about how that gap looks in general merchandise versus intermodal. Is one of those segments -- does one of those segments need to play more catch up than the other from a margin perspective as you look to close that gap?\nCindy Sanborn: Justin, I think about every railroad kind of has a difference in terms of markets and customer mix. But our network is as good as any and I don't see any barriers to us continuing to reduce the gap between us and our competitor here in the east in both markets that you described, both merchandise and intermodal. We're going to drive very hard in that direction.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: I wanted to stay with Cindy there for a while. Cindy, you mentioned your great amount of railroad experience you've been at two Class 1s that have implemented PSR. Can you talk a little bit about what you learned there with PSR and how you think you can apply that Norfolk Southern? And also what might be different?\nCindy Sanborn: Well, I would say, Jason, that PSR at its core is just very basic railroading. And focusing on making every move count and accelerating asset intensity or improving asset intensity is the core of it. And no matter which railroad I\u2019ve worked for that has really been the effort as we implemented PSR. I don't see things different at Norfolk Southern. I see a workforce and a team that I've inherited that is very focused and very energized about what we're working on. They understand just how much work it's going to be. And I think we're going to be able to close the gap with any railroad in the country.\nJason Seidl: And Cindy, as a quick follow-up, as Norfolk starts gaining more and more ground with PSR. How should we think about maybe the gains on capital investments? Because it seems like closing some hump yards that have already eliminated some capital investments. Are there more to come? Should we expect a smaller capital investment profile going forward as you guys make progress?\nCindy Sanborn: Jason, I actually haven't gotten that far into the details on capital. I would say that you will see us make some investments in locomotives that you might not see otherwise as we convert from a DC fleet to an AC fleet and so forth. But at this point, I really can't answer that question terribly fully. But Mark, I'm sure has a view, and I'll turn it to him.\nMark George: It's a very good question and observation. And actually, the Enola closure, the home closure is an example where we will be avoiding some capital. So you do see some relief there. And the same thing, even the locomotive impairment that we took back in the first quarter where we idled 703 locomotives kind of reveals that we do feel with all this PSR momentum we have that we've got enough in the locomotive fleet. And hopefully, we won't be buying locomotives anytime soon. So I do think some of the transformations that we're making will relieve us of CapEx demands. But that said, Cindy is coming in and really taking a look at traffic patterns and looking at our train plan, and there may be areas where we need to do some siding extensions, as an example, to help accelerate the network. So overall, we are still working on that. Cindy and I have been spending a lot of time along with Alan, trying to understand some of the ideas and observations that she's had coming in. And we'll know better, I think, as we enter the first quarter, what the overall impact will be on capital, certainly in the next year or two.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Landry: So given the step function improvements that you've made in train length and weight, I guess, first, how much further room do you have here? And then are there any parts of the network that might need additional sidings to keep the train length moving higher? And then if you could speak to how you're thinking about operating leverage and incremental margins in 2021, given these productivity improvements as well as the recent volume and SM?\nJim Squires: Allison, let me start out and then I'll turn it over to Cindy to fill in the details. But as you noted, we did achieve significant asset and other resource productivities in the third quarter. For example, we had record performance on fuel efficiency, train weight, train length, teaming productivity and locomotive productivity. So virtually, across the board record levels of productivity. But that's just the beginning. As Cindy has just gone through, she sees and we see lots of additional opportunities for improvement. And those improvement opportunities will take the form of asset velocity, a focus on railcar velocity, which is something she has brought to us. It's a signature initiative or focus within PSR. We'll continue to look at the network footprint. We'll continue to look at labor and all other aspects of our operation. And indeed, our company in search of productivities that will propel us towards the goal of the peer-operating ratios. Cindy?\nCindy Sanborn: I think if we look at September, and I was looking at some numbers here, literally in the last couple of days. In our merchandise network, we operated with tonnage up to what our locomotives could pull. So maxing out that locomotive capability about 9% of the time. And we look at our intermodal opportunity in terms of length, where we're going over 10,000 feet, we had about 10% of our trains over 10,000 feet for the entire district. So we had a lot of opportunity here. It may, as Mark alluded to, it's on the radar to think about where there might be barriers to that from a side link perspective. Don't really have that completely flushed out. But we do have significant opportunity to improve our trend line.\nJim Squires: Allison, you mentioned incremental margin going forward. Mark, why don't you take a stab at that?\nMark George: As you know, Allison, we had very strong sequential growth in the top line here from Q2 to Q3, that allowed us to really leverage it and deliver 78% incremental margin. And frankly, that's the recipe we're hoping for going forward that we can get good volume growth here, and our goal would be to leverage it and deliver very strong incremental margins. Now I don't know that we can do 78% to 80% every single quarter. I think it will depend on how much volume we get and where that volume comes from. But certainly, I would expect that we would have accretive incremental margins in each quarter where we do have growth.\nCindy Sanborn: And let me also add that these numbers that I provided, it's not something you're going to be able to do 100% of the time. There's going to be situations where you're not going to reach perfection. But that's what we have to work toward. And we're going to be -- that's all part of closing the gap that we've got here on cost. And that's just some of the ingredients and the concepts, and areas that we're looking at to find those opportunities.\nAllison Landry: So as my follow-up, is there a way to think about or quantify the cost savings or the OR benefit from the network changes that you made, hump closures, et cetera? And then more broadly, do you see opportunities for further rationalization, whether that's yards or facilities, or other assets? Curious maybe what's left to do. And if there's anything you're considering as far as changes to the coal network? Thank you.\nCindy Sanborn: Let me add one component in terms of the terminal footprint. So the team has redesigned traffic flows through the terminals and we're continuing to do that with the make and change that we're talking about. But once we sort of go through it the first time, we don't stop looking. We go back to areas that we've looked -- that we've converted, and we continue to optimize the operation through those areas. So we most recently made some train consolidations that are a result of the changes we made at Bellevue that we just have put in place, as we have seen traffic balance out and traffic continue to change, and allow us to continue to optimize, I guess, is the best word, how we think about traffic flows through the areas that we've already been through. So a lot of -- it's not like you go through this one time and it's done. It's continuous improvement and continuous focus and driving our cost gap reduction.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: I wanted to touch on the 60% OR target. Kind of curious if you guys are comfortable reinstating or putting a time around that. Is it something that's achievable next year? And then maybe if you don't want to comment on the timing, can we talk a little bit sort of structurally, do you think you have the pieces in place? I'm thinking about the hump yard slide. Structurally, is the network kind of where it needs to be as volume comes back, that there's a clear line of sight for the sixth year? Is there more work to be done?\nJim Squires: Well, let me summarize, Chris. As we've noted several times already, our goal is to close the OR gap with our peers. And along the way, we will naturally get to 60% operating ratio. We believe we have line of sight to 60% during 2021 through a combination of cost reductions and revenue growth. But we're not going to stop there and we'll continue to drive harder and get that OR into the peer range and as low as we possibly can, which ought to generate a great deal of shareholder value. The progress will come from a combination of productivity and efficiency initiatives, as we've been discussing already this morning and revenue growth in sight during 2021.\nChris Wetherbee: As a quick follow-up for Alan. Can we talk a little bit about the intermodal competitive environment and specifically the yield up strategy? I think it was another record intermodal yield ex-fuel this year. Can you talk a little bit about sort of the opportunity as you turn the page into 2021 in terms of taking share? You have the cycle kind of turning in your favor from a truckload perspective. You have a pretty decent competitor in the east is also wanting to grow that business. Can you just put a little bit of context on how you think about how intermodal looks as we move forward over the next several quarters?\nAlan Shaw: Chris, through strategic foresight market approach, we've got the most robust intermodal franchise in the east, and we are aligned with the best channel partners in the business who are also committed to growth. I think we're in a very unique truck environment. What you've seen is that truck capacity is inelastic with demand. And so spot rates are at two, three year highs. Capacity is about as tight as it's been and we're in the midst of a prolonged inventory replenishment cycle. And as I noted, we're getting record volumes in domestic right now and our international business is ticking up into positive territory. So I'm very confident about where we're going the remainder of this year and next year. And it's just a continuation of what we've delivered. Remember, in 2017, our revenue was up 11%. We followed that with 18% improvement in 2018, it declined very slightly last year in the midst of a truck recession. And right now, it's back to growth.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nAri Rosa: So first question, I wanted to touch on how you're thinking about available capacity because, obviously, you've done a great job here of cutting resources. But as we see volume growth into 2021. Do you think you can take that without further adding to headcount or take on additional resources?\nMark George: Yes, plenty of capacity, particularly in light of our goal and our intent to increase train length. That right there, will absorb additional volume into the train plan. As far as infrastructure is concerned with the possible exception of some spot places where we need to increase siding lengths, we have more than adequate infrastructure capacity right now.\nJim Squires: And I\u2019ll add that the way the markets are shaping up, the incremental volume will largely fold into existing train network. We've redesigned our network so that we've got capacity. You saw that in the incremental margins in the third quarter. And these consumer-oriented markets, whether it's in the merchandise network or the intermodal, additional growth is going to be all about creating additional revenue density on our trains.\nCindy Sanborn: And as we increase our train length, that reduces the number of trains, actually, on the network, which frees up capacity and line growth. So there's a number of levers here from a capacity perspective that we have in our favor.\nAri Rosa: And then just looking at the evolution of PSR across some other railroads in North America. Obviously, it's opened up a lot of real estate opportunities for them. And I know you guys have taken some actions in that regard. But maybe you could talk about where you think you are in terms of the real estate footprint? What we could see in terms of opportunities for either real estate sales or maybe leveraging some available real estate to grow incremental volumes, which are clearly doing at very high margins? And so maybe just a couple of thoughts on where you are with your real estate strategy.\nMark George: This is Mark. I'll let Alan talk a little bit more about the tactics there. But I would say that we typically, right now, liberate about $30 million to $40 million of land per year, we generate gains from that and that is, we've got plenty of properties out there that contribute to that. And I think, Alan, why don't you talk a little bit more about what the strategies are.\nAlan Shaw: Within real estate, we're focused on delivering cash flow via two means. One is land sales. The other is through ongoing leases. And our real estate team is linked very closely with our best-in-class industrial development team to work to cite additional business on our lines. And you just saw one announced in a Delfood product that was recently announced on our network. It's one of the reasons that we serve more North American vehicle production than any other railroad. And then in addition to that, our real estate strategy is also about sustainability. And we're using some wetland credits on our real estate to provide offsets for infrastructure improvements on our lines to increase our capacity and also to help with local economic development, which will drive more business in Norfolk Southern. So it's a multifaceted approach, all designed to improve ongoing profits for Norfolk Southern and our shareholders.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nCherilyn Radbourne: That was my question on real estate, so maybe I'll ask one on technology. And just ask whether you could give us a bit more color on the joint venture that you announced last week, and speak a bit more broadly about technology and whether you're looking at some of the automated inspection technologies that your peers are adopting?\nAlan Shaw: Let me take the question about technology. It is a core part of our strategy. One of our strategy pillars is digital strategy and development of technology to promote both efficiency and growth in our operations. Particular areas of focus in the digital realm in recent years have been customer engagement and making sure that we have best-in-class customer tools, tracking tools and shipment intelligence tools. We've devoted quite a bit of technology, time and effort in that area. We're also very focused on improving asset productivity through technology, and that does include automated inspections. Yes, we are focused on that, and we see a significant opportunity there. And in other areas as well, replenishment of legacy information systems and artificial intelligence initiatives, machine vision initiatives, there's a raft of initiatives coming at us. And we're very excited about the prospects for promoting shareholder value through those investments.\nJim Squires: Charilyn, specific to your question about the recently announced rail pulse, that's just another example. Norfolk Southern innovating within the supply chain ecosystem, provide a value added truck competitive product. That's our partnership with G&W, and Watco, and GATX, and Trinity Rail. Combined with us, that's about 20% of the North American railcar fleet. And what we're focused on doing is providing focus on improving safety and transparency within the overall ecosystem so that we can provide a truck competitive product.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of David Ross with Stifel.\nDavid Ross: I wanted to talk a little bit about intermodal again, because it's been a very hot area, and maybe it's due to the yield up strategy. But volumes are only up about 2% or 3% on the Northfolk Southern last week. So I wanted to know, I guess, why you think you're not seeing the same volume growth? Is that purposeful because of the yield choice, or is there something else going on in the network or with the customers?\nMark George: We're starting to see improvements within our international business, and we're looking for some gains as the quarter progresses from the West Coast. And so we're very confident about where our intermodal franchise is.\nDavid Ross: Do you think it will be high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter?\nMark George: No. I'm not going to provide guidance on it, but intermodal was a growth driver for us in the third quarter along with automotive, and we expect it to be a growth driver for us in the fourth quarter as well. We've got an unrivaled intermodal franchise in the east, and we're in a very tight truck market. We're providing a really good service product.\nDavid Ross: And then just last question because we've got the election coming up next week, Jim. Is there anything, one way or the other, that has a bigger impact on the rails? Is there something that maybe you're most concerned about or most excited about if it goes one way or the other?\nJim Squires: Well, we'll work through the implications of the election outcome either way. And of course, we have close relationships on both sides of the aisle. We maintain constant communication with all those who support the rail industry and Norfolk Southern, in particular. So I'm confident that we will navigate through whatever political changes may come. We've been at this for a long time and are active in the political realm. And so I have a lot of confidence that we can manage through whatever changes may be on the horizon.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: I understand on the mix side, revenue per carload, the impact of intermodal on the total RPU of the business. I'm just sort of curious like within the specific commodity, like chemicals were up 6%, agriculture was down 1%, there's a couple of others that were negative year-over-year. Is that mostly a function of the fuel surcharge? Is there a length of fall issues? Again, I understand sort of the total. I'm just sort of wondering within a commodity category, what's been the biggest driver of the RPU? And when do you think you could start to see some of that total RPU negative mix start to look a little more normalized? Thanks.\nJim Squires: Most of our RPU pressure right now is coming from fuel surcharge and from seaborne coking coal pricing, which we've provided some color on in the past. Unwind our RPU a little bit, you're going to see 15 consecutive quarters of RPU less fuel growth, both merchandise and in intermodal. And even within intermodal, we just posted a record for RPU less fuel. So we're fully committed to revenue growth and we understand that that's got two components. One of that's price. One of that's volume. And we're providing the most stable service product that we ever have over a long time period, and we are positioned for where markets are headed. Strength in the consumer is where NS is positioned and where we excel.\nJordan Alliger: So I mean, presumably, then as the fuel stuff starts to normalize, the revenue per carload as we move, I'm assuming, into next year, or maybe\u2026\nJim Squires: I think I identified the two headwinds. Look at our revenue per revenue ton mile, up 3% for the quarter.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: So wanted to just ask on some of the cost pieces, Mark, and any way to think about comp per employee going forward? And then purchase services were down, I think down year-over-year for the first time. Is that sustainable sort of inflection in purchase services? And then maybe if we just tie it all together, when you talk about line of sight to 60% OR next year. What level of revenue growth, if any, do you think you need to get there?\nMark George: The comp per employee sequentially looking forward into Q4, I'd say, is likely to be in the flattish range. This quarter, obviously, we were up very, very modestly at 1.3%. I would expect us to be flat going into Q4. Sorry, the second question\u2026\nScott Group: Just purchase services and\u2026\nMark George: So purchase services, I thought we did a very good job. We've got some of the structural changes that we've been implementing kind of flowing through that line as well. So pretty good momentum going into the fourth quarter. I do think as volume steps up, especially in intermodal we'll start to see purchase services elevate a bit in conjunction with volume and that volume variability equation.\nJim Squires: And Scott, your question about line of sight 2% to 60% during 2021. A combination of cost reductions and revenue growth would be our expectation. And we do expect to see a rebound in revenue next year and growth year-over-year during 2021. So it will come from the two, but we have a lot of productivity initiatives in the hopper. And I think we've shown that during times of volume softness this year that we are fully committed to the PSR way, and to driving cost structural improvements throughout the organization. So that will be something we continue to rely on as we push for that pure OR.\nScott Group: But just directionally, if you have thoughts. I mean, do you think you need -- can you get there next year with mid-single-digit kind of revenue growth? Do you need closer to high single with easy comps to get there? Just any directional thoughts as you look.\nJim Squires: Give us time to firm up our revenue outlook, and we'll talk a little bit more about what we expect for year come January. We're still working on our forecasts right now. Things appear to be headed in the right direction. We would expect growth year-over-year. But we'll get back to you a little more detailed outlook in January.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Maybe one for Alan. We've seen a few coal plant retirements announced in the last month or so. It looks like it's more of a western rail issue. But how do you see that risk for Norfolk based on the plans and miles that you serve? And given where natural gas is about $3 and export prices maybe stabilizing a little bit. Do you think you're past the peak of the headwinds when it comes to the coal from RTU perspective?\nAlan Shaw: Yes, Brian, I think the plant closures are a result of the economic factors that are driving it. Power prices in the PJM right now are below $20 a megawatt hour. Coal is going to have a really hard dispatching into that environment. And while natural gas has rebounded nicely to $3, the spot market is still below $2. It's closer to about $1.70, which is kind of what coal uses the dispatch is that spot market. So that's going to create continued pressure for us in the fourth quarter, in addition to the fact that stockpiles are about 45% higher than they were this time last year. We are seeing improvements in export demand, as I noted. Although with the Chinese, Australian trade tensions, the premium low vol price out on the seaborne market actually declined. They had climbed up to about $128 a metric ton. Now it's close about $115. So we'll see some more export volume in that and in thermal as China and India have opened up, but there's still going to be pressure on pricing there.\nBrian Ossenbeck: And just one follow-up on the comp per employee comment. Maybe, Mark, if you can give us a sense of how you think of overtime as potentially productivity lever you probably have to incur maybe a little bit more as you manage headcount with the volume environment is still a little bit uncertain. But as things sort of normalize and you start to draw that line of sight to the 60 OR. Do you think this is an area of significant opportunity or are there maybe factors that would prevent you from being able to take some significant savings on the OT line item?\nMark George: We've done a pretty good job already bringing overtime down quite a bit. And it is another area that we are looking at going into the future. There's a lot of things, obviously, that impact the comp per employee, just increasing volumes has an impact on the T&E activity levels and the pay rates as well. So those are -- it's not just over time but it's also the activity levels in general. But I'd say we're looking at all the levers. The re-cruise is another area where we've done a good job tackling, trying to keep a lid on it. And I think if you look at our overall comp and ben trends over time, you've seen we've done a pretty good job keeping a lid on things, but we do see more opportunity going forward. And those are exactly some of the areas that Cindy and her team are talking about since she's come on board.\nOperator: We are nearing the end of our allotted time for question-and-answer session. And we have time for one additional question. And that question is coming from the line of Tom Marivitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Triano: This is Mike Triano on for Tom. So I just wanted to ask about industrial related volumes. The energy complex is obviously weak. But are you optimistic that the continued improvement in some of the other segments like metals or housing, or do you see any headwinds as we enter into 2021?\nJim Squires: We do see a lot -- we have a lot of confidence in our consumer oriented product, whether that's in industrial products or within intermodal. And I think we're going to see some improvements in ag. We're going to see improvements in metals. And intermodal is going to be a growth for us as well. And not only are we focused on growth, we're focused on productivity. Cindy talked a lot about some of the initiatives that she's implementing. And then within our intermodal network, we're applying technology and process improvement to improve the efficiency of the terminals and increase revenue density of the trains as well. So the consumer market is where NS is positioned. It's a position of strength for us and that's where we excel.\nMike Triano: How much exposure leverage to housing you have in the overall book? And do you think that can be a meaningful driver, especially on the car loading side as we go forward here?\nJim Squires: Exposure to housing? Is that what you asked?\nUnidentified Analyst: The housing. Yes.\nJim Squires: It certainly helps with housing, housing products. As Mark noted, lumber, some steel and then you've got the stuff that goes in it. And it also really helps drive the intermodal product as well, as people furnish the house or some of our larger BCOs are involved in the housing market. So there's opportunities there. And as I noted, we're seeing a V-shaped recovery in both durable goods and in the housing market. So we've got a lot of confidence in these consumer oriented markets as we head into '21.\nOperator: At this time, I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Jim Squires for his closing comments.\nJim Squires: Thanks, everyone, for your questions this morning. And special thanks to all the Norfolk Southern employees who helped us deliver a solid result in the third quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Alan Shaw",
            "content": "Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, volume improved sequentially as business levels continued to recover from April and May lows. Consumer-driven markets are driving the gains reflected in our intermodal and automotive franchises, which delivered year-over-year volume growth in the third quarter. Norfolk Southern and our customers are responding to market needs amid an extremely tight truck market, playing to the strengths of our service-focused product and our robust consumer-oriented franchise. We continue to enhance our pipeline for growth with sustained investment by our customers along our lines. We checked the pulse of economic trends and market shifts, innovating supply chain solutions for existing and potential customers. These solutions evolve as the environment changes, as exemplified by the COVID-induced supply chain shifts and the need for increased inventory levels and faster distribution. Our strong customer relationships and market knowledge have allowed us to respond to these market shifts and quickly secure new business. Moving to Slide 11. Revenue for the quarter declined 12% year-over-year, driven by 39% decline in our energy-related markets, while our remaining markets declined 4%. Overall volume was down 7% as growth in intermodal and automotive partially offset energy declines. Price gains have now produced higher revenue per unit less fuel for 15 consecutive quarters in both our merchandise and intermodal business units. Overall, RPU was impacted by the negative mix associated with increased intermodal volume and lower fuel surcharges. The continued effects of the pandemic and lower energy prices led to 10% decline in merchandise revenue for the quarter. Recovery in the automotive sector partially offset these declines with revenue 9% higher than prior year levels as manufacturers increase vehicle production to meet consumer demand. Merchandise RPU less fuel increased 3% year-over-year as we continued to deliver solid service. Our intermodal volumes surpassed 2019 levels with growth in our domestic franchise. E-commerce activity and record tight truck capacity strengthened demand that was further enhanced by new intermodal services and our superior franchise. International volume growth improved throughout the quarter, with September daily volumes 13% above July. Intermodal revenue and RPU were impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue, with RPU less fuel up 3% due to positive price and mix. Coal revenue declined 38% year-over-year due to sustained low natural gas prices and high inventories. Utility volumes fell 30% but improved on a sequential basis with warmer than normal weather Year-over-year, export continued to face demand challenges and low seaborne pricing. Moving to our outlook on Slide 12. We expect continued strength in our consumer oriented markets. The energy market will remain a headwind but its impact has decreased as coal revenue represented 10% of our top line in the third quarter. External economic forecasts remain optimistic and expect continued improvement as the economy adjusts. The impacts of lower interest rates and improved personnel income will continue to drive spending in the consumer markets with housing starts and durable goods spending experiencing V-shaped recoveries. Manufacturing has been slower to recover and has not kept pace with sales, evidenced by the declining inventory sales ratio, a positive indicator for future transportation demand. Truck capacity is at the tightest level on record, also generating a greater need and opportunity for Norfolk Southern's product. Within merchandise, the negative impacts of low energy prices will continue to be a drag on energy volume in the fourth quarter. Strength in the soybean export market will mitigate some of that headwind, while the automotive recovery will benefit adjacent markets like steel and plastics. Norfolk Southern's automotive volume is expected to decrease sequentially due to plant downtime associated with model changeovers, offsetting increased production from other plants. We are collaborating with our customers to deliver supply chain solutions to help them compete in an evolving market. Intermodal's continued strength will be supported by economic factors, including e-commerce, low inventories and a tight truck market, as well as in-house initiatives promoting new products and highway conversions. Deep supply chain disruptions from COVID have led many of our customers to reevaluate how they move goods to reduce risk. We are working with our best-in-class channel partners on new opportunities, delivering a truck like product and providing capacity to move their business safely and efficiently. We continue to leverage our capacity dividend from efficiency improvements to expand our business, built upon the foundation of our robust and flexible intermodal franchise. Within coal, we expect the utility market to face pressure associated with high stockpiles and low natural gas prices. Export volumes are likely to improve sequentially, although seaborne prices will remain below prior year levels. At Norfolk Southern, we remain poised to continue to seize immediate opportunities for growth at the same time that we strategize to the long game, focused on delivering profitable growth to our shareholders, while serving our customers and growing our franchise. We are executing this strategy with investments already made in consumer driven markets that provide access to over half of the US population, positioned to succeed in the fastest growing segments of the US economy. We will continue to realize the value of our service product, maintaining our focus on profitable growth through both revenue and volume. We built and maintained strong relationships with our strategic partners and provide them with an excellent service product, meeting their needs and allowing our customers and Norfolk Southern to grow profitably and sustainably, which I will discuss further on Slide 13. Through our powerful intermodal franchise and best-in-class network of industrial development sites, short line partnerships and transload facilities, which serve to expand the reach of our rail product, we are delivering more options than ever to a marketplace that is increasingly valuing low carbon transportation solutions. Our unique pioneering role in sustainability is evidenced by our decade-long participation in force carbon offset programs in South Carolina and along the Mississippi River, as well as our wetland restoration projects. In addition, we continue to reduce our impact by enhancing fuel efficiency, which you heard from Cindy, as we modernize our locomotive fleet and deploy energy management solutions. We have partnered with customers as part of a pledge called Operation Clean Suite to prevent plastic pollution while it is in transit. These are just a few of the reasons Norfolk Southern was recently named one of the 100 most sustainably managed companies in the world by the Wall Street Journal. Rail is three to four times more fuel-efficient than truck and our leadership and sustainability resonates with our customers and the markets we serve, and will be an important aspect of the continuing growth story across our truck competitive segments as we leverage our commitment to sustainability. I will now turn it over to Mark, who will cover our financial results. Jon, we do have some specific planned outages and retooling in the fourth quarter within our automotive franchise that are going to create some pressure. I'll circle back to the results in the third quarter. Our revenue was up 9% year-over-year, and our audit team is working every day to make a better franchise for our customers. And so that's -- the phenomenon that you're seeing right now is a short term phenomenon. We've got a lot of confidence in the strength in our automotive franchise moving forward. Same with the intermodal franchise. We're delivering record volumes within domestic and international volumes are starting to tick into the positive territory for us right now. So we're very confident in the strength of that franchise and basically all of our consumer oriented markets moving forward. I'll tell you that Cindy is focused on improving productivity. She's also focused on giving our customers a very good service product. Chris, through strategic foresight market approach, we've got the most robust intermodal franchise in the east, and we are aligned with the best channel partners in the business who are also committed to growth. I think we're in a very unique truck environment. What you've seen is that truck capacity is inelastic with demand. And so spot rates are at two, three year highs. Capacity is about as tight as it's been and we're in the midst of a prolonged inventory replenishment cycle. And as I noted, we're getting record volumes in domestic right now and our international business is ticking up into positive territory. So I'm very confident about where we're going the remainder of this year and next year. And it's just a continuation of what we've delivered. Remember, in 2017, our revenue was up 11%. We followed that with 18% improvement in 2018, it declined very slightly last year in the midst of a truck recession. And right now, it's back to growth. Within real estate, we're focused on delivering cash flow via two means. One is land sales. The other is through ongoing leases. And our real estate team is linked very closely with our best-in-class industrial development team to work to cite additional business on our lines. And you just saw one announced in a Delfood product that was recently announced on our network. It's one of the reasons that we serve more North American vehicle production than any other railroad. And then in addition to that, our real estate strategy is also about sustainability. And we're using some wetland credits on our real estate to provide offsets for infrastructure improvements on our lines to increase our capacity and also to help with local economic development, which will drive more business in Norfolk Southern. So it's a multifaceted approach, all designed to improve ongoing profits for Norfolk Southern and our shareholders. Let me take the question about technology. It is a core part of our strategy. One of our strategy pillars is digital strategy and development of technology to promote both efficiency and growth in our operations. Particular areas of focus in the digital realm in recent years have been customer engagement and making sure that we have best-in-class customer tools, tracking tools and shipment intelligence tools. We've devoted quite a bit of technology, time and effort in that area. We're also very focused on improving asset productivity through technology, and that does include automated inspections. Yes, we are focused on that, and we see a significant opportunity there. And in other areas as well, replenishment of legacy information systems and artificial intelligence initiatives, machine vision initiatives, there's a raft of initiatives coming at us. And we're very excited about the prospects for promoting shareholder value through those investments. Yes, Brian, I think the plant closures are a result of the economic factors that are driving it. Power prices in the PJM right now are below $20 a megawatt hour. Coal is going to have a really hard dispatching into that environment. And while natural gas has rebounded nicely to $3, the spot market is still below $2. It's closer to about $1.70, which is kind of what coal uses the dispatch is that spot market. So that's going to create continued pressure for us in the fourth quarter, in addition to the fact that stockpiles are about 45% higher than they were this time last year. We are seeing improvements in export demand, as I noted. Although with the Chinese, Australian trade tensions, the premium low vol price out on the seaborne market actually declined. They had climbed up to about $128 a metric ton. Now it's close about $115. So we'll see some more export volume in that and in thermal as China and India have opened up, but there's still going to be pressure on pricing there."

            "name": "Jim Squires",
            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. Before diving into our third quarter results, I'll highlight a previously disclosed noncash impairment charge of $99 million, related to an equity method investment. Slide 4 provides an adjusted view of our financials, excluding this charge, which is the view I will speak to in my comments this morning. During the third quarter, our volumes decreased 7% year-over-year, while adjusted operating expenses were down 15%, more than double the volume decline. On an adjusted basis, we reported our best operating ratio to date, but this is just the beginning. As we continue rolling out PSR, our team sees additional opportunities for efficiency and growth that will close the OR gap with the rest of the industry, driving shareholder value creation. As our third quarter results demonstrate, we are implementing sustainable cost structure improvements across our company. Employment levels are down 25% since the start of 2019, while active locomotives have decreased by 26%. We have advanced these resource improvements every quarter since launching TOP21 last year, including most recently by decreasing headcount by 2% sequentially in the third quarter, even as volumes surged 22%. We converted a fifth hump yard in the quarter, and you will hear from Cindy regarding further network enhancements that are underway. In the coming quarters, we will identify and execute on additional productivity initiatives to yield further efficiency gains. Turning to network performance. Even as we implemented deep and lasting cost structural moves in the third quarter, we ran a fast and fluid network with train speed, terminal dwell, train performance and shipment consistency, all better than before TOP21. We've now pushed train size to record levels. Finally, we are excited to have Cindy Sanborn join us as Chief Operating Officer. Cindy came to NS to drive operational change and improvement, bringing decades of experience and a deep commitment to precision scheduled railroading. Cindy has made it clear she sees many opportunities to increase efficiency and bottom line results at NS, and I know she looks forward to sharing her thoughts. Cindy? Thank you, Mark. Before we conclude, I want to recognize all of our employees for their dedication to operating this railroad as efficiently and safely as possible, while continuing to deliver for our customers during these unprecedented times. As you've heard this morning, our leadership team is unified in a commitment to improving Norfolk Southern, and will leave no stone unturned in the quest for shareholder value. We are confident our momentum will enable us to achieve our goal of 60% operating ratio. And once we get there, we won't stop as we drive additional improvements across our network. In closing, we have built an organization that is moving faster than ever to deliver returns for shareholders. Thank you for your attention. And we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Justin, well, let me tackle the second question first, and then I'll ask Mark to address the headcount trend. We're not going to give quarterly guidance. You see the volume trend. We're working away on the expenses. I think it would be reasonable to expect an operating ratio in the fourth quarter below last year. But beyond that we're not going to give guidance. Mark, the employment trend? Allison, let me start out and then I'll turn it over to Cindy to fill in the details. But as you noted, we did achieve significant asset and other resource productivities in the third quarter. For example, we had record performance on fuel efficiency, train weight, train length, teaming productivity and locomotive productivity. So virtually, across the board record levels of productivity. But that's just the beginning. As Cindy has just gone through, she sees and we see lots of additional opportunities for improvement. And those improvement opportunities will take the form of asset velocity, a focus on railcar velocity, which is something she has brought to us. It's a signature initiative or focus within PSR. We'll continue to look at the network footprint. We'll continue to look at labor and all other aspects of our operation. And indeed, our company in search of productivities that will propel us towards the goal of the peer-operating ratios. Cindy? Allison, you mentioned incremental margin going forward. Mark, why don't you take a stab at that? Well, let me summarize, Chris. As we've noted several times already, our goal is to close the OR gap with our peers. And along the way, we will naturally get to 60% operating ratio. We believe we have line of sight to 60% during 2021 through a combination of cost reductions and revenue growth. But we're not going to stop there and we'll continue to drive harder and get that OR into the peer range and as low as we possibly can, which ought to generate a great deal of shareholder value. The progress will come from a combination of productivity and efficiency initiatives, as we've been discussing already this morning and revenue growth in sight during 2021. And I'll add that the way the markets are shaping up, the incremental volume will largely fold into existing train network. We've redesigned our network so that we've got capacity. You saw that in the incremental margins in the third quarter. And these consumer-oriented markets, whether it's in the merchandise network or the intermodal, additional growth is going to be all about creating additional revenue density on our trains. Charilyn, specific to your question about the recently announced rail pulse, that's just another example. Norfolk Southern innovating within the supply chain ecosystem, provide a value added truck competitive product. That's our partnership with G&W, and Watco, and GATX, and Trinity Rail. Combined with us, that's about 20% of the North American railcar fleet. And what we're focused on doing is providing focus on improving safety and transparency within the overall ecosystem so that we can provide a truck competitive product. Well, we'll work through the implications of the election outcome either way. And of course, we have close relationships on both sides of the aisle. We maintain constant communication with all those who support the rail industry and Norfolk Southern, in particular. So I'm confident that we will navigate through whatever political changes may come. We've been at this for a long time and are active in the political realm. And so I have a lot of confidence that we can manage through whatever changes may be on the horizon. Most of our RPU pressure right now is coming from fuel surcharge and from seaborne coking coal pricing, which we've provided some color on in the past. Unwind our RPU a little bit, you're going to see 15 consecutive quarters of RPU less fuel growth, both merchandise and in intermodal. And even within intermodal, we just posted a record for RPU less fuel. So we're fully committed to revenue growth and we understand that that's got two components. One of that's price. One of that's volume. And we're providing the most stable service product that we ever have over a long time period, and we are positioned for where markets are headed. Strength in the consumer is where NS is positioned and where we excel. I think I identified the two headwinds. Look at our revenue per revenue ton mile, up 3% for the quarter. And Scott, your question about line of sight 2% to 60% during 2021. A combination of cost reductions and revenue growth would be our expectation. And we do expect to see a rebound in revenue next year and growth year-over-year during 2021. So it will come from the two, but we have a lot of productivity initiatives in the hopper. And I think we've shown that during times of volume softness this year that we are fully committed to the PSR way, and to driving cost structural improvements throughout the organization. So that will be something we continue to rely on as we push for that pure OR. Give us time to firm up our revenue outlook, and we'll talk a little bit more about what we expect for year come January. We're still working on our forecasts right now. Things appear to be headed in the right direction. We would expect growth year-over-year. But we'll get back to you a little more detailed outlook in January. We do see a lot -- we have a lot of confidence in our consumer oriented product, whether that's in industrial products or within intermodal. And I think we're going to see some improvements in ag. We're going to see improvements in metals. And intermodal is going to be a growth for us as well. And not only are we focused on growth, we're focused on productivity. Cindy talked a lot about some of the initiatives that she's implementing. And then within our intermodal network, we're applying technology and process improvement to improve the efficiency of the terminals and increase revenue density of the trains as well. So the consumer market is where NS is positioned. It's a position of strength for us and that's where we excel. Exposure to housing? Is that what you asked? It certainly helps with housing, housing products. As Mark noted, lumber, some steel and then you've got the stuff that goes in it. And it also really helps drive the intermodal product as well, as people furnish the house or some of our larger BCOs are involved in the housing market. So there's opportunities there. And as I noted, we're seeing a V-shaped recovery in both durable goods and in the housing market. So we've got a lot of confidence in these consumer oriented markets as we head into '21. Thanks, everyone, for your questions this morning. And special thanks to all the Norfolk Southern employees who helped us deliver a solid result in the third quarter. Thank you."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Cindy Sanborn",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. I am very excited to lead operations and look forward to participating in the analyst calls as Chief Operating Officer. For those of you I've not yet met, I've been railroading for 33 years and have experience working for several Class I railroads. My experience has included driving change and achieving what PSR is all about, being efficient, consistent and improving the operating ratio. What drew me to Norfolk Southern are the significant opportunities ahead. Each railroad is different in terms of markets and customer mix, but I believe we can and will operate at the very best levels of the industry. Across the organization, I am finding a team that is committed to driving efficiency while delivering the highest quality service to our customers. I know that we have great potential and are just getting started, making this company more productive. Moving to Slide 6. We have a strong foundation in place, but we still have a lot more work to do and we need to move faster. Our top priority is building on the momentum underway by taking steps to further unlock our PSR capabilities. We are taking a bottoms-up approach to reviewing each part of the operation, and I am confident we will find opportunities to apply principles that have been successful during prior experiences. In my 58 days here, I've already found opportunities that will help us improve and achieve higher levels of productivity. We are transitioning to put additional focus on railcar velocity. This scrutiny at the most granular level represents a big opportunity to convert structural change into gains in fuel efficiency, train size, equipment utilization and service levels. Turning to the quarter on Slide 7. Our mission was to absorb returning volumes with minimal additional cost. We successfully achieved this goal and in so doing, made significant network changes that we expect to yield ongoing efficiencies. Here we see continued year-over-year improvements in our service and productivity metrics. By leveraging the increased volumes versus the second quarter, we drove improved productivity while maintaining stable service metrics. Returning volumes, combined with disciplined execution and successful control of additional train starts, enabled us to drive train weight and fuel efficiency to record levels. I've added train length to the metrics shown here because we actively manage train length, and this represents another opportunity for improvement. I've included a snapshot of our train length history in the appendix, because it is important that we have a baseline for measurement. Across these efficiency indicators, we have significant opportunities for improvement. The graph on the next slide is an updated illustration of our train productivity since the onset of the pandemic. As volume continued to ramp up throughout the quarter, we kept crew starts virtually flat in August and September. Instead of reverting to previous train plans, we blended traffic into our new train plan to leverage the existing available capacity. The more important takeaway is that most of our train plan still has capacity to absorb traffic, and our initiatives on car velocity and train size are designed to produce even more productivity. Moving to Slide 9 to discuss where we are structurally with network configuration. As you already know, the beginning of the transformation included the idling of the hump at two yards last year. Then in the second quarter of this year, two more were idle for a total of four. But as you've heard the team say many times, we are focused on creating additional opportunities for improvement. In September, we stopped using the hump at Enola, Pennsylvania, the fifth hump to go down since last year. The change at Enola avoids an upcoming capital investment and will result in a more reliable and faster operation. Next week, we are kicking off a much larger set of changes in the South. When we stop hump operations at our yard in Macon, Georgia. Concurrently, we will also close several local yards in the Atlanta area. These changes enable us to rework many of our Southeastern intermodal flows for improved service, lower cost and additional growth capacity. After the Macon conversion, we will have curtailed operations at six humps in just the past 18 months, leaving us with four high-volume hump yards. Before I conclude, I want to emphasize the team is moving with a sense of urgency. The make and change is just one example of how we have accelerated our plans to create efficiencies. That project originally planned for early 2021 is being executed more quickly. I said it earlier, but let me reiterate, this is just the beginning. Our opportunities are significant. And I am excited about keeping you up to speed on the progress we are going to make. Now I will turn it over to Alan, who will cover the market outlook. I would say that there's a very strong foundation that's been built here and been operating here, very focused on the basics of running a good railroad. And I'm looking at it from the bottom-up and from the top down, and it's really more than tweaking, it's ignificantly more than tweaking. I introduced some information around train length. We're going to be working on that. That helps us tremendously with our locomotive productivity as well as fuel. And we will also be working very strongly on car velocity. A lot of these hump conversions that you've seen that were referenced in my earlier remarks, the team has engaged in at a discrete level actually improves car speed and at a system level, what we want to do is avoid touches altogether, if at all possible. And if we can speed the cars up, that's good for us in terms of asset intensity and it's also good for our customers. It provides them a more timely service product. So there's quite a bit of work going on. And I'm really excited about the team here and excited about exactly what we're going to be working on. Justin, I think about every railroad kind of has a difference in terms of markets and customer mix. But our network is as good as any and I don't see any barriers to us continuing to reduce the gap between us and our competitor here in the east in both markets that you described, both merchandise and intermodal. We're going to drive very hard in that direction. Well, I would say, Jason, that PSR at its core is just very basic railroading. And focusing on making every move count and accelerating asset intensity or improving asset intensity is the core of it. And no matter which railroad I've worked for that has really been the effort as we implemented PSR. I don't see things different at Norfolk Southern. I see a workforce and a team that I've inherited that is very focused and very energized about what we're working on. They understand just how much work it's going to be. And I think we're going to be able to close the gap with any railroad in the country. Jason, I actually haven't gotten that far into the details on capital. I would say that you will see us make some investments in locomotives that you might not see otherwise as we convert from a DC fleet to an AC fleet and so forth. But at this point, I really can't answer that question terribly fully. But Mark, I'm sure has a view, and I'll turn it to him. I think if we look at September, and I was looking at some numbers here, literally in the last couple of days. In our merchandise network, we operated with tonnage up to what our locomotives could pull. So maxing out that locomotive capability about 9% of the time. And we look at our intermodal opportunity in terms of length, where we're going over 10,000 feet, we had about 10% of our trains over 10,000 feet for the entire district. So we had a lot of opportunity here. It may, as Mark alluded to, it's on the radar to think about where there might be barriers to that from a side link perspective. Don't really have that completely flushed out. But we do have significant opportunity to improve our trend line. And let me also add that these numbers that I provided, it's not something you're going to be able to do 100% of the time. There's going to be situations where you're not going to reach perfection. But that's what we have to work toward. And we're going to be -- that's all part of closing the gap that we've got here on cost. And that's just some of the ingredients and the concepts, and areas that we're looking at to find those opportunities. Let me add one component in terms of the terminal footprint. So the team has redesigned traffic flows through the terminals and we're continuing to do that with the make and change that we're talking about. But once we sort of go through it the first time, we don't stop looking. We go back to areas that we've looked -- that we've converted, and we continue to optimize the operation through those areas. So we most recently made some train consolidations that are a result of the changes we made at Bellevue that we just have put in place, as we have seen traffic balance out and traffic continue to change, and allow us to continue to optimize, I guess, is the best word, how we think about traffic flows through the areas that we've already been through. So a lot of -- it's not like you go through this one time and it's done. It's continuous improvement and continuous focus and driving our cost gap reduction. And as we increase our train length, that reduces the number of trains, actually, on the network, which frees up capacity and line growth. So there's a number of levers here from a capacity perspective that we have in our favor."

            "content": "Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. On Slide 15, you see the key financial measures. I'll talk on this slide and in the remainder of the presentation to the adjusted numbers, excluding the impact of the $99 million impairment charge. Revenue was down 12% on volume that was down 7%. As Alan shared, RPU ex-fuel for our merchandise and intermodal segments was positive but declining fuel surcharge revenue, along with adverse business mix, including within coal, created revenue headwinds. We drove down operating expenses 15% in the quarter with comp and ben, purchased services, fuel and materials, all declining by double digit percentages, solidly in excess of the volume decline. This resulted in operating income being down 6% and an operating ratio of 62.5%, that was 240 basis points better than Q3 of 2019. Despite the $57 million decline in operating income, free cash flow of $1.7 billion for the nine months was more durable, up by $211 million or 14%, a record for AMS. On Slide 16, you'll see the walk of our adjusted earnings from Q3 2019 referenced at the bottom has a 240 basis point improvement in or and $0.02 increase in EPS. You will recall that in Q3 2019, we had a receivable write off that adversely impacted operating income, creating a favorability in the compares this quarter by 110 basis points in the OR and $0.09 on EPS. That leaves core OR improvement in Q3 2020 as 130 basis points while EPS declined by $0.07. The OR improvement was driven by strong operating expense reductions versus last year, as you'll see on Slide 17. Operating expenses were down $278 million or 15%. Comp and benefits are down 15%, led mainly by our employment cost with the workforce down by 4,400 or 18%. Fuel was down $100 million with lower pump prices contributing to $61 million of that reduction and consumption was down $36 million, led by fewer GTMs, as well as a strong 6% improvement in fuel efficiency in the quarter. Material spend was down $13 million due to lower spend associated with smaller and more efficient locomotive and railcar fleets. Purchased services was down $35 million or 10% as we continue evaluating the structural and semi-structural costs within this category. I'll point out that the depreciation increase of $7 million was due to a nonrecurring leasehold improvement write off due to a terminated lease. Given the amount of structural change that we're driving into the business each and every month, I'd like to touch on how we have recovered from the volume trough in the second quarter on Slide 18. As background, recall in Q2 we did a tremendous amount of work to manage the short-term by more than matching the volume decline with crew start leverage while also forging ahead with structural change by idling two hump operations and driving headcount down 20%. As a result, we positioned ourselves very well for Q3 and beyond to leverage these sustainable cost structure improvements. From Q2 levels, revenue increased 20% or $421 million, while we constrained cost to just 6% growth to deliver nearly 80% incremental margins. We drove headcount down another 2% versus Q2. Materials, purchase services and equipment rents combined for an increase of only 6% on the 20% sequential revenue gain. And fuel efficiency improved 3 points sequentially as increases to train weight and length continued to record levels, as Cindy highlighted. We are confident that our advancing implementation of PSR is producing benefits, and we have great momentum to build on our cost structure improvements moving forward. On Slide 19, we look at the full P&L, with a Q3 to Q3 look. And here, you'll see that other income net of $39 million is $17 million better than prior year. We had another strong quarter of gains on our company owned life insurance investments. These COLI returns, including proceeds, are not subject to income tax as they contributed to our lower effective tax rate in the quarter of 22%, as did the tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. This is why net income contraction was only 2% compared to the 6% contraction in operating income. Adjusted EPS, you'll note, was actually up 1% supported by nearly $300 million of share repurchase activity in the quarter. Shifting to cash flow on Slide 20. Through nine months ended September 2020, our free cash flow was a record at $1.7 billion, aided in large part by fewer capital additions, as well as timing of income tax payments. Spend on property additions was $1.05 billion, nearly $450 million below 2019 levels and on a run rate to be at our target of roughly $1.5 billion for the year, which will be 25% reduction from 2019 spend levels. With our strong cash generation and liquidity profile, we were able to continue to distribute cash to shareholders through our dividend while ramping back up share repurchase activity. In the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares for roughly $300 million. As of now, we have approximately $1.4 billion of cash on hand with less than $100 million of debt maturities in the next year, providing us confidence that we have appropriate liquidity in this uncertain market. With that, I'll hand back over to Jim. So as you saw, the employment trends are quite strong. We took out 4,400 or 18% since Q3 2019, actually, 2,900 so far in the nine months of 2020. And sequentially, we did come down. I do believe that volume growth and attrition are both our friends from this point forward. Not going to give a specific target for Q4, but the hope is that we certainly won't add here in the fourth quarter. And hopefully, with attrition being our friend we might see continued decline. It's a very good question and observation. And actually, the Enola closure, the home closure is an example where we will be avoiding some capital. So you do see some relief there. And the same thing, even the locomotive impairment that we took back in the first quarter where we idled 703 locomotives kind of reveals that we do feel with all this PSR momentum we have that we've got enough in the locomotive fleet. And hopefully, we won't be buying locomotives anytime soon. So I do think some of the transformations that we're making will relieve us of CapEx demands. But that said, Cindy is coming in and really taking a look at traffic patterns and looking at our train plan, and there may be areas where we need to do some siding extensions, as an example, to help accelerate the network. So overall, we are still working on that. Cindy and I have been spending a lot of time along with Alan, trying to understand some of the ideas and observations that she's had coming in. And we'll know better, I think, as we enter the first quarter, what the overall impact will be on capital, certainly in the next year or two. As you know, Allison, we had very strong sequential growth in the top line here from Q2 to Q3, that allowed us to really leverage it and deliver 78% incremental margin. And frankly, that's the recipe we're hoping for going forward that we can get good volume growth here, and our goal would be to leverage it and deliver very strong incremental margins. Now I don't know that we can do 78% to 80% every single quarter. I think it will depend on how much volume we get and where that volume comes from. But certainly, I would expect that we would have accretive incremental margins in each quarter where we do have growth. Yes, plenty of capacity, particularly in light of our goal and our intent to increase train length. That right there, will absorb additional volume into the train plan. As far as infrastructure is concerned with the possible exception of some spot places where we need to increase siding lengths, we have more than adequate infrastructure capacity right now. This is Mark. I'll let Alan talk a little bit more about the tactics there. But I would say that we typically, right now, liberate about $30 million to $40 million of land per year, we generate gains from that and that is, we've got plenty of properties out there that contribute to that. And I think, Alan, why don't you talk a little bit more about what the strategies are. We're starting to see improvements within our international business, and we're looking for some gains as the quarter progresses from the West Coast. And so we're very confident about where our intermodal franchise is. No. I'm not going to provide guidance on it, but intermodal was a growth driver for us in the third quarter along with automotive, and we expect it to be a growth driver for us in the fourth quarter as well. We've got an unrivaled intermodal franchise in the east, and we're in a very tight truck market. We're providing a really good service product. The comp per employee sequentially looking forward into Q4, I'd say, is likely to be in the flattish range. This quarter, obviously, we were up very, very modestly at 1.3%. I would expect us to be flat going into Q4. Sorry, the second question... So purchase services, I thought we did a very good job. We've got some of the structural changes that we've been implementing kind of flowing through that line as well. So pretty good momentum going into the fourth quarter. I do think as volume steps up, especially in intermodal we'll start to see purchase services elevate a bit in conjunction with volume and that volume variability equation. We've done a pretty good job already bringing overtime down quite a bit. And it is another area that we are looking at going into the future. There's a lot of things, obviously, that impact the comp per employee, just increasing volumes has an impact on the T&E activity levels and the pay rates as well. So those are -- it's not just over time but it's also the activity levels in general. But I'd say we're looking at all the levers. The re-cruise is another area where we've done a good job tackling, trying to keep a lid on it. And I think if you look at our overall comp and ben trends over time, you've seen we've done a pretty good job keeping a lid on things, but we do see more opportunity going forward. And those are exactly some of the areas that Cindy and her team are talking about since she's come on board."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce Pete Sharbel, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Sharbel. You may now begin.\nPete Sharbel: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section along with our non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.\nJim Squires: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's second quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mark George, Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer. As we announced earlier this week, Mike will retire from Norfolk Southern on October 1, after a 35-year career of distinguished achievement. He will be greatly missed, and we wish him well. When we began the search for our next Chief Operating Officer, we looked for an experienced executive who could lead our day-to-day operations and build on our successful implementation of precision scheduled railroading. We are proud to welcome Cindy Sanborn, one of our industry's leading operations experts, to the Norfolk Southern team. We look forward to Cindy joining the company on September 1. With that, let's proceed to a review of our second quarter performance. Amid the global pandemic and ensuing economic disruption in the markets and communities we serve, the men and women of Norfolk Southern demonstrated their resilience in the second quarter. Our customers in virtually every segment shipped significantly lower volumes, with many changing their shipping patterns as they work to keep the supply lines open. The automotive industry was particularly volatile, experiencing a rapid and almost total shutdown and then a subsequent restart and push to restock inventory, all within the same quarter. Norfolk Southern's business reflected that disruption. Revenues decreased 29%, leading to a decline of 43% in earnings per share. Our team rose to the challenge. We quickly adjusted network plans and resources in the short-term, while advancing our long-term strategy to deliver shareholder value with several important achievements. First, Norfolk Southern employees are serving our customers and our country with excellence during a pandemic. The successful implementation of our TOP21 strategic plan and precision scheduled railroading, combined with the hard work and commitment of our employees, is producing results. We achieved record train performance, train speed, terminal dwell and shipment consistency. Many other service metrics were near all-time best levels. Second, we managed our operations efficiently as shipped volumes bottomed out while ensuring we have strong operating leverage as business recovers. Year-over-year in the second quarter, our force levels declined by 20%, that's nearly 5,000 positions while train size increased and fuel efficiency improved. These achievements enabled an operating expense reduction of 21% against a 26% decline in volume. We are a fast-fluid railroad ready to take advantage when volumes return. Third, and perhaps most important, we kept our eye on our strategic objectives by attacking structural costs. We reduced our hump yard footprint in the quarter by idling two additional humps, bringing the total to four that have been idled over the past year. These actions create direct cost savings over the coming quarters and demonstrate our success improving our TOP21 train plan to be nimble and adaptive to changing freight demand with fewer, more efficient major terminals. Throughout all of this, we are taking comprehensive steps to protect the health and well-being of our people. All employees who can work remotely continue to do so. For employees whose responsibilities require them to work on site, we are following CDC guidelines. I opened by lauding our team's resilience. While each one of these actions and achievements on its own has merit, when taken together and in the face of the unique disruptions of the second quarter, they demonstrate the determination of this team to forge ahead and take on any challenges necessary to create value for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Alan and the team, to provide further details and commentary. Alan?\nAlan Shaw: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter volume was greatly influenced by the dual shocks of COVID-19 and large declines in our energy markets. We remain committed to executing our strategic plan of long-term revenue and margin growth based on our excellent service product and market approach, both valued by our customers. Our productivity, service and collaborative focus was most evident in our automotive franchise, where weekly volumes declined over 90% early in the quarter. We quickly pulled down our automotive train service and as automotive production resumed rapidly ramped up operations to effectively and efficiently serve our customers. Our dynamic planning process and proactive collaboration with our customers produced this rapid restructuring of plan and assets. Our team remains committed to both maximizing profitable growth and improving our service offering as we emerge from the challenge of the pandemic. Moving to slide 6, second quarter revenue declined 29% year-over-year. These declines were affected by volume impacts of COVID and low energy prices, the latter of which also impacted fuel surcharge revenue. The first half of the quarter had dramatically different results than the second, in which we saw an 8% sequential improvement in volume as the economy started to reopen. Our continued focus on yield is evident with all three business groups improving revenue per unit, excluding fuel, a year-over-year gain we have delivered for 10 consecutive quarters. Decline in fuel surcharge revenue and a changing business mix composed of a greater percentage of intermodal volume, lowered overall revenue per unit. Merchandise volume declines were most pronounced in the automotive franchise as automotive volumes declined more than 60% quarterly for mid-April and May production stoppages throughout the industry. Decreases in this market rippled to adjacent products such as steel and plastics. Nearly every market was hurt by pandemic shutdowns, energy prices, consumption decreases or a combination of these items. Food products were greatly influenced by closed restaurants and other points of sale. Low energy prices drove declines in all of our energy markets, including utility coal, frac sand, crude oil, natural gas products and scrubber stone. Intermodal revenue fell 19% in the second quarter, driven by lower levels of consumer demand in response to the pandemic. As the economy reopened, intermodal volume improved as demand for our services grew and truck rates increased. Domestic volumes rebounded as the quarter progressed due to the need to quickly rebuild inventory, while international remained pressured. The increased use of e-commerce and essential goods led to more transloads and domestic equipment. Our coal franchise continued to face pressure this quarter, with revenue declining 55% year-over-year, a result of sustained low energy prices and the global pandemic. Utility volumes declined 57% as load in the industrial and commercial markets deteriorated and coal generation faced intense competition from low natural gas prices. The overall coal decline was slightly offset with an RPU gain of 3%, reflecting volume shortfalls and changing mix. Moving to our outlook on slide 7. We believe the recent volume growth trajectory will moderate with future gains at a slow and uneven pace from June levels. A high degree of uncertainty exists. State and local government reaction to increased COVID cases will have a major influence on the speed and shape of the economic recovery. The growing number of such cases and fiscal policy will impact our outlook to the extent that both influence the strength of consumer demand and labor availability, with the latter having an effect on production. The consumer is active with high retail sales figures reported for June and durable goods spending close to pre-pandemic levels, increasing the need for transportation services. In the trucking sector, spot rates have returned to pre-COVID levels and are currently at the highest point of the year during this inventory replenishment cycle, a positive near-term signal for intermodal and truck competitive merchandise markets. These markets rely heavily on the consumer where the impact of government stimulus, potential shutdowns and unemployment will be key drivers in the continued recovery. Intermodal will benefit from new product development, such as the recently announced numerous services that strengthen the link with our best-in-class channel partners, enhance our interline service offerings and allow Norfolk Southern to secure even more business moving from the Southeast to the Northeast. These products create value for our customers, while utilizing the capacity dividend, generated by our efficient and faster network. Although the manufacturing economy is lagging the consumer, we are seeing a solid rebound in automotive, where volumes quickly started improving at the end of May with continued strength through the third quarter as inventories rebuild. We expect energy to remain depressed. Continued low natural gas prices and unfavorable crude oil spreads are creating additional headwinds across all of our energy markets. Export coal is expected to continue to be negatively impacted by the worldwide pandemic and geopolitical tensions. Our expectations are tempered with the ever-present uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and fiscal policy. This quarter was marked with a sharp difference between the first six weeks and the last. We understand that our volumes will fluctuate as our customers and their customers are impacted by potential future state and local restrictions, in response to increasing COVID infections. Despite these conditions, our strategy is clear. We will continue to improve our revenue quality and service product, delivering services that allow our customers to compete and succeed, while utilizing fewer resources. I will now turn it over to Mike, for an update on operations.\nMike Wheeler: Thank you, Alan. And thank you, Jim, for those kind words. The second quarter saw an unprecedented amount of operating change, as we ceased hump operations at two yards and responded to major volume shifts with a keen eye, towards making many of our crew start reductions permanent. We continued to execute at a high level, while pressing forward with our transformation and managing through the challenges of the pandemic. Moving on to slide 9, which again shows continued improvements in train speed and terminal dwell, setting or tying all-time records for us this quarter. Our operation benefited from the network fluidity that came with dramatically lower volumes. We were able to adjust our operation, in line with our customers, again, setting records in train performance, shipment consistency and plan adherence. These milestones came as we further reduced assets and employment, while taking advantage of the lower volume environment to reconfigure, our network operations. Moving on, slide 10 is the update to our service and productivity metrics for the year, which you have seen in previous quarters. All of our metrics are showing improvement on a year-to-date basis, reflecting both our continued progress and the effect of the pandemic. Our service delivery index measures shipment on-time performance, indexed to 2018. We were already at our 2021 goal in the first quarter. And continue to improve in the second quarter, which will enable us to meet or exceed our goals over the rest of the year. We continue to provide a service product that meets or exceeds our customers' expectations. Extreme volume swings challenged both T&E and locomotive productivity, during the quarter. We reduced both T&E employment and active locomotives during the quarter to the lowest numbers on record, but those changes slightly lag the reduction in volumes. We improved our year-over-year train way, by closely matching the train plan to volume changes. And being careful about, when and where we added additional service as business returned. Train length grew even more than train weight. Matching the plan to volumes helped us realize an increase in fuel efficiency, to a second quarter record, by maximizing the returns on the investment in energy management and PTC technology. Finally, we easily surpassed our Cars Online goal, setting new records in the quarter that were driven down in part, directly by lower volumes and in part, by our record train speed and dwell metrics that kept cars moving towards destination. As in past quarters, this includes cars that were both active and stored awaiting upturns in business. Moving on to slide 11, this is our sixth consecutive quarter of accelerated crew start reductions. I am exceptionally proud that our operating team was able to respond so quickly to the sudden and severe pandemic-induced volume drops. We will continue to use both tactical and structural changes to keep our cost structure controlled and flexible as volume changes. Prior to the pandemic, we advanced through Phase 3 of the TOP21 program. We are continuing to optimize our train network and rationalize our yard network, even while setting the stage for positive operating leverage as volumes rise. Implementing TOP21 enabled us to cease hump operations at Linwood and Bellevue. Continued progress comes through long-term structural changes in our asset base, improved service levels and rising productivity metrics following proven PSR principles. Moving to slide 12, we seized the opportunity to use the second quarter business drop to craft a better plan for when traffic returned. As this graph shows, we reduced crew starts in line with business reductions. But as traffic comes back, we are fully optimizing our train capacity based on our current business mix instead of simply just restoring previous train starts. Slide 13 shows how Well Norfolk Southern is positioned. In the second quarter, we closed one of our two locomotive heavy repair shops and ceased hump operations at two of our large yards, Linwood and Bellevue, making a total of four hump yards eliminated in a year's time. Our structural network changes are emblematic of our willingness to transform the way we operate in the pursuit of efficiency. We aggressively continue to look for additional opportunities to reduce our terminal footprint. We can and will do more to reduce our resource and investment needs. But we are also capitalizing on the return of traffic from historic lows by adding back trains more slowly than returning traffic. As traffic does come back, we are much more willing to mix traffic types on whatever trains have capacity and can meet service standards. Generating this kind of operating leverage during a rise in traffic is very powerful, and we are committed to maintaining that leverage. Now I will turn it over to Mark who will cover the financial results.\nMark George: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. On slide 15, you see the key financial measures. As Alan shared, while RPUX fuel for each commodity was favorable, adverse mix and declining fuel surcharge revenue created headwinds leading to overall revenue being down 29% on volume being down 26%. Operating expenses were down 21% in the quarter, with each cost component driven lower, led by fuel as well as employment-related costs. As we signaled in May, we weren't able to completely mitigate the sudden and dramatic volume declines with dollar-for-dollar expense reductions. And this led to operating income being down $455 million while the operating ratio increased 710 basis points. Despite the 43% decline in operating income, free cash flow for the quarter declined by half that rate or 22%. So it remained more durable and contributed to a record free cash flow during the first half of the year of over $1 billion. On slide 16, you will see that the quarter was free of any significant unusual items, although, the EPS compare versus last year does benefit from the absence, of a non-operating impairment charge that was recorded in Q2 2019. So while the reported EPS eroded by $1.17, the contraction from core operations is actually $1.25. Moving to Slide 17 and operating expenses, you will see they were driven down by $385 million or 21%. Certainly, fuel savings were a large contributor with roughly half of that savings driven by the sharply lower prices. $74 million of the reduction was from lower consumption due to the decline in GTMs. But also another solid quarter of fuel efficiency gains, which was 3% this quarter and is now 4% year-to-date. We drove Comp & Ben down $126 million or 18% as employment was reduced by nearly 20% or 5,000 year-over-year and down 5% versus 1Q. It's important to note that, as we pressed forward with structural resource reductions in the quarter. We did maintain forces on extra board status that would be required to serve in the event of a sudden surge in volume, which is exactly what happened, in June, where volume sequentially increased 12% from the May level with no adverse service disruption. As Mike touched upon, we prioritized this approach as complementary to our strategic plans focus on best-in-class service without the cyclical variability in reliability that has plagued the industry historically. You'll note $20 million in savings from managing tightly our overtime as well as re-crews which were down 50%. In line with what I had signalled during the quarter, Comp & Ben per employee was sequentially down by a modest amount. Moving over to Purchase Services & Rents, this was down 11%, with Purchase Services itself down 13%, driven by lower intermodal and automotive facility costs associated with the volume decline. Material costs are down $20 million, thanks in large part to reduced maintenance costs associated with our mechanical realignment as well as initiatives surrounding a locomotive and railcar fleet rationalization, the lower other costs of $11 million benefits from our constraint of travel and other discretionary items. Gains from the sales of operating properties this quarter was negligible, similar to last year. You'll recall last quarter. I provided a window into, how you should think about these expense categories, from a volume variability perspective given the on-set of what we knew would be a volume shock here in Q2. I indicated that we would be able to reduce roughly 50% to 60% of our costs, with volume. In Q2, the 21% reduction in costs or 16%, if you exclude the anomalous fuel price benefit, was exactly in line with that 50% to 60% guidance, I had given. On slide 18, we look at the full P&L and here, you'll see that other income net of $49 million is $27 million better than prior year. This favorability is driven by the absence of last year's $28 million asset impairment charge, along with a $25 million year-over-year increase in COLI returns. This favorable return was partially offset by headwinds from lower non-operating property gains, as well as transaction costs associated with the debt exchange that we completed during the quarter. Lastly, the modestly lower effective tax rate in the quarter of 22.1% was driven by the COLI returns I just mentioned, which are not subject to income tax. Moving to slide 19. For the six months ended June 2020, our free cash flow was a record at $1.23 billion, aided in large part by fewer capital additions and timing of income tax payments. Property additions in the first half were $735 million, $244 million below 2019 levels, and we're on a run rate to be at our target of $1.5 billion for the year, which will be a 25% reduction from 2019 spend levels. With our cash generation and liquidity profile, we were able to continue to distribute cash to shareholders, maintaining our dividend, while moderating share repurchase activity. In the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares, roughly $200 million. As of now, we have over $1 billion of cash on hand, with less than $100 million of debt maturities in the next year. So we are in a comfortable place in case the recent market stabilization that we are enjoying falters. I'll just wrap with a comment on the outlook. While we can't be certain of the volume shape in the back half, as you heard from Mike, we are taking this opportunity to make significant structural changes to our network, while also driving further efficiencies into the train plan. These actions ensure that we are well positioned to leverage the volume recovery. And that in any scenario, we are moving forward with transforming our cost structure. Jim?\nJim Squires: Thank you, Mark. In summary, we are committed to driving our operating ratio down and still have a goal of 60. We have a full-court press on productivity initiatives to ensure that our cost structure improves while also capitalizing on the operating leverage that we are achieving. Thank you for your attention, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\nQ - Chris Wetherbee: Yeah. Hey, thanks and good morning guys. Jim, I just want to pick up where you left off. So you mentioned the goal 60 from an OR perspective. And, obviously, there are some structural changes that you made during the quarter. Some of those might have been pulled forward from future plans because of the pandemic. But when you think about sort of the hump yard opportunities and some of the other structural network changes that you've made, how do you sort of see that potentially impacting that longer-term 60 goal? Is there an opportunity beyond 60? Can you just put some numbers around it?\nJim Squires: Good morning, Chris. Good question and really shines a light on what is our main focus right now, which is to continue driving productivity and efficiency gains in the current economic environment. And we took action in that regard in the second quarter through the conversion of one hump yard and the closure of another. We also took off-line 1 of 2 major back shop locomotive maintenance facilities. So we demonstrated our commitment to driving productivity in the midst of the volume challenges in the second quarter, and we will continue to push hard on that as we move through the rest of the year and beyond. Mike, let me turn it over to you for some additional comments.\nMike Wheeler: Yes. Well, we're not letting off the gas. We've got several things we continue to look at that are in the hopper, and we'll roll out as appropriate based on the volumes in the business. But like I've said before, we are going to continue to push ourselves to find ways to reduce our structural costs out there and the terminals that we can do without, while still providing service product that we've committed to. So we still have things we're working on and you'll see those roll out in the future.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then maybe, Alan, one for you on the yield-up strategy, obviously, you put up, I think, 10 consecutive quarters of yield growth, RPU growth, less fuel. When you think about the potential for an improving truckload cycle, so our rate environment getting better potentially next year. How quickly does that translate down into the business, say, into the Merchandise or Intermodal business? Can you capitalize on that in the back half of the year? Is it something we need to see potentially rolling out into 2021? Can you just give us some comments on that?\nAlan Shaw: Yes, Chris, it depends upon how quickly moves up and whether those spot rates that we're seeing right now translate into contract rates. But yes, we generally touch 50%, 55% of our revenue every year. And we've got a great service product, and we've got confidence in the quality of that product and we're pricing accordingly.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, appreciate the time. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Thomas Wadewitz with UBS.\nThomas Wadewitz: So maybe I can start off with one for you, Jim, just in terms of the Chief Operating Officer transition, so Mike, congratulations on the retirement and all the progress on PSR and TOP21.\nMike Wheeler: Thank you.\nThomas Wadewitz: Jim, how did you think about the search process? And given the success with TOP21, the decision to go external as opposed to going internal?\nJim Squires: Sure, Tom. Well, I too wanted to thank Mike again for his many contributions over the years and we deeply appreciate your service, Mike. Let me describe briefly the process that the Board of Directors went through in selecting Cindy, as our next Chief Operating Officer. It was a comprehensive search process. It began by defining the experiences and qualities we were looking for as a Board of Directors in our next COO. And these were things like demonstrated experience with operations at a very high level, at a leadership level, a commitment to safety in operations as paramount, qualities like success in working with regulators and other stakeholders, a commitment to service, great service for our customers. And \u2013 so we began with a large field of candidates. We steadily narrowed it down, and we ended up with Cindy and she brings to us all of the qualities and experiences that I just outlined. And in addition, she brings experience with the PSR model specifically, having worked at both Union Pacific and CSX, which, like NS, are in the midst of implementing PSR. So we're delighted to welcome her to our team starting September 1.\nThomas Wadewitz: Okay. Great. And then for the follow-up question, just wanted to see if you could offer some broader thoughts on how we think about the move over the next year or plus or minus, the move in the operating ratio. Is this primarily a volume-driven operating leverage type of framework? Is that the way we should look at it in terms of really focusing on volume, or is there really a lot to go still on the kind of pure cost, productivity, TOP21 framework? I'm sure it's a mix of both, but I'm just trying to get a sense of which would be more important looking forward or looking to 2021? Thank you.\nJim Squires: Let me start by acknowledging that the operating ratio in the second quarter is not where we need it to be and not where the operating ratio will be going forward, we believe. It was a tough quarter, particularly the first part of it, with revenue down as much as it was, particularly in key areas. So we struggled in the first couple of months in the quarter. Now things began to turn around in June and we saw the volume pick up. And naturally, we saw the operating leverage kick in, in the month of June, and that has continued thus far in July as well. Who knows what the rest of the year may hold. As you heard from Alan, it's a mixed outlook. We're feeling pretty bullish about the current volume levels relative to where they were in the second quarter, but we'll see. Looking out, if the question is whether growth counts, whether growth matters for further operating ratio improvement, absolutely, it helps. And it would be a significant tailwind. If the question is whether our strategy for OR improvement is dependent on growth, the answer is no. We intend to drive the operating ratio lower and to get to our 60 goal under whatever conditions we experience. We believe we have a strategy that is adaptable enough and we have enough opportunities in other areas while pursuing strategies that we believe will grow the top line as well.\nThomas Wadewitz: Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nQ \u2013 Amit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Just a quick question. Jim, do you think OR can be flat to down this year? I mean, it seems like the 71 OR this quarter is really a reflection of unprecedented volume decline. And to be fair, but the cost performance was actually pretty good, but there's just a certain point where you can't react to a 30% decline in revenue from an OR perspective, which is an output. But obviously, there's a lot of revenue \u2013 incremental revenue coming in, in the third and fourth quarter relative to the second quarter that could drive this step function improvement in OR given the costs that you've done. So I'm just trying to understand, can you hold the line on OR on a year-over-year basis this year, even despite the volume challenges you had in the first half, given that it's getting a lot better in the second half so far?\nJim Squires: If the comparison is to the volume trough, what we hope will prove to be the trough in April and May, then yes, we have seen a significant impact and is uptick. And as I said, that has translated into operating leverage in the latter part of the second quarter and in the third quarter. And we would expect that to continue given current volume levels, and the productivity measures we've undertaken. But there's so much uncertainty in the macro outlook. Not only for the remainder of this year, but going forward as well. And let me turn it over to Alan. He made a few comments and prepared remarks on this. But Alan, why don't you talk a little bit about our macro outlook for the rest of this year and into next year.\nA \u2013 Alan Shaw: As Jim noted, we're pretty optimistic about the third quarter. You saw a pretty strong sequential improvement in June over our trough in April and May. Volumes are increasing again sequentially in July, which kind of goes against normal seasonality, where you typically have a little bit of a downturn in July. Yeah. So we see retail activity was up 7.5% in June. We saw durable goods orders were up 7.3%. Housing starts were up 17.3%. Spot rates are up in the upper teens. And truck tonnage increased at the fastest pace in 8.5 years. The auto restart has certainly helped and that's reverberated through the supply chain. So as we talk to our customers, there's a lot of near-term demand. The risks that we see going forward are increasing cases of COVID and the unsettled situation with fiscal policy and the stimulus and the impact that that could potentially have on fourth quarter volume and revenue.\nQ \u2013 Amit Mehrotra: Right. So if I'm hearing you guys correctly, nobody knows the future, but if the current trends hold, you think you can keep OR flat to even better on a year-over-year basis this year. Is that \u2013 am I reading that correctly?\nJim Squires: We're not willing to give guidance on OR, just given the overall uncertainty. We will continue to push hard on cost. And we have measures in the pipeline, and we demonstrated our commitment to cost control in the second quarter as well. We'll keep doing that.\nQ \u2013 Amit Mehrotra: Okay.\nJim Squires: It's just the macroeconomic. The macroeconomic outlook is so uncertain right now.\nQ \u2013 Amit Mehrotra: Fair enough. And then, Mark, just a follow-up. The CapEx year-to-date is running lower than the 16% to 18% of sales, which is actually making free cash conversion look pretty good. I'm wondering if there's a potential to see CapEx come down relative to that guidance. You've talked about it in the past, but I'm just wondering if there's any more update you can give there, because the company's free cash conversion is lagging most of the peers that's obviously going to weigh on the multiple of the company, the valuation of the company. I'm just wondering if there's any opportunity to bring down the CapEx to actually improve the free cash conversion.\nMark George: Yes. Thanks for the question, Amit. We didn't guide to really to 16% to 18% after the last call. We actually just gave a fixed guidance number on CapEx, where we brought it down to $1.5 billion. And really, the first half number that is our run rate. So we are going to finish the year at/or about $1.5 billion regardless of revenue. So I think hopefully, it means that as a percentage, it could actually be lower than the 16% to 18% range. So we started early in the year in February, and said it's time to bring it down, and we took $0.5 billion out. We will have taken $0.5 billion out of our CapEx budget this year compared to last year. And yeah, definitely, that is what's driving that good conversion you point out in the first half. So the CapEx in the back half is going to continue at that rate. So that should help. But also, Amit, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, some of the conversion benefit that we did enjoy in the first half was a function of tax -- income tax payments that really, in large part, thanks to the Cares Act were pushed into July. So some of that will be made up, unfortunately, in the second half, we won't have the same tax benefit. And then we also had some working capital benefits in the first half. When volumes come down, you don't have as much AR building up. So that will probably unwind as volumes recover in the second half as well. But fully aware that from a cash conversion perspective, our goal is to try to raise that number from where it's been historically. And CapEx is one of the vehicles to get there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nQ \u2013 Jordan Alliger: Yes. Hi. A question on intermodal. You had noted the truckload market tightening. I'm just -- of course, that's good for the longer-term intermodal. I'm just sort of curious, are you actually seeing increased activity or dialogue with customers or perhaps even truck conversions now with regards to intermodal as the truckload market tightens? Thanks.\nJim Squires: Alan?\nAlan Shaw: Hey, Jordan, absolutely. And you can see that reflected in our numbers. Intermodal is actually leading our growth right now as is Automotive. Basically, the consumer segments are doing really well. And we've got a powerful intermodal franchise. We've got a lot of channel partners and beneficial cargo owners out there who want to continue to align themselves with us. And so we've got -- we're delivering a wonderful service product, and it gives us the strength and the confidence to initiate some of these new service products. We've got a couple of new products that we're going to be launching in the third quarter between the Southwest and the Southeast, which are the two fastest-growing regions of the country, and also some product from the Southeast to the Northeast, which has already started. There is absolutely demand for intermodal in this market. And the truck market in certain regions of the country is extremely tight. And Norfolk Southern has got the solution for that.\nQ \u2013 Jordan Alliger: Great. And then just a follow-up. I know you mentioned -- you guys mentioned on the call, not bringing back crew starts, one-for-one with volume, et cetera. Is there a way you could give some thoughts on headcount as we move sequentially from here based on where it ended in the second quarter? I mean, is there a way to sort of think about the pace of that coming back?\nJim Squires: Mike, why don't you comment on the trend in crew starts and then ripple through to employment specifically. And then, Mark, maybe you can take the question on overall head count going forward.\nMike Wheeler: Yes. As you noticed in the slides, we continue to leverage crew starts versus volume. And the good news is that's continued in through July. Through July, our crew starts are down 20%, while our volumes only down 10%. So we expect to see that leverage going forward, and we've got a great nimble group to be able to iterate the train plan as necessary and get the leverage on the volume. So really pleased about that, again, 20% down in crew starts, July already, while volume is only down 10%. So we continue to see that and will in the future. Mark?\nMark George: Yes. And just to remind, I mean, we've gone down 5,000 employees versus Q2 of last year, that's a 20% reduction. We're kind of lapping now the big step change from the TOP21 implementation. But obviously, we're still chasing a Q2 volume decline that was pretty significant. So, we are focused on trying to rebuild that productivity curve. And as Mike said, hopefully, with any volume growth that comes here in the back half, we can absorb it with what we have, but also continue to look for more productivity opportunities. I'm not going to put a fine point or a number on guidance for headcount, but for sure, it's going to be an area that we're focused on leveraging while we enjoy the volume recovery.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Hey thanks. Morning guys. Mark, last quarter, you gave us some good color on costs and said, I don't expect them to be down more than 20%. Any initial thoughts on how to think about the OpEx in the third quarter? And I know there's been a bunch of OR questions and you guys aren't giving guidance, but I don't know if you're willing to share, but maybe it would be helpful if -- do you have a sense on -- can you share what the June operating ratio was? Maybe that will give us a little bit of help.\nMark George: Yes. So, pretty much the volume variability that we had guided last quarter, I think, helped informed you on expectations for OpEx and at the end of the day, we came in pretty much in line with what we guided. So, it worked out well. I would hope now, Scott, that as we start to see volume growth, we actually do better than that curve, and we leverage it and get better incrementals. That's the goal and that's the objective that this leadership team is fully aligned on. But really, the big variable is going to be this momentum we saw with the June volume recovery. And what we're enjoying here in July, does it continue on this trajectory or does it stabilize? And that is really -- if it continues, and I'm fully expecting we're going to try to leverage that and get more and greater incrementals than, hopefully, what I showed you. And yes, we had quite a curve -- to your second part of your question, quite a curve within the second quarter. And I'm not going to give you the exact number, but I will tell you, we weren't in the 70s in the month of June. So, that was encouraging to see that we will -- hopefully, now that's behind us. We had a real deep body blow we took in April and May that it's hard to recover from. But June, we started to be encouraged by the leverage that we started to see with the 12% sequential improvement in volumes. So, with the cost that we took out, we had a decent quarter -- I'm sorry, a decent month in June with an OR that was back in the 60s.\nScott Group: Okay. And then, Alan, any -- can you help us think about the core RPU in the -- going forward? It was still positive in the second quarter, but is that possible in the third quarter, I don't know, year-over-year, sequentially, however you think is the best way to help us out here?\nAlan Shaw: Yes. Scott, as I noted, there were two factors that primarily drove core RPU in the second quarter. One was volume shortfalls, the other was mix. And you can see that punctuated where utility was down 67%, whereas, export was down 45%. So just there, you get some positive mix. So you feel back even more, Scott. There's mix within these markets as well. So our utility South franchise in the second quarter was about 54% of our volume. Last year, at the time, it was 50%. So there's a positive mix there. Similarly within export, export met, which tends to also be longer haul and a higher RPU, was 74% of our volume in the second quarter comp to 56% in the second quarter of last year. So we had a lot of positive mix factors going for us in the quarter. I'd tell you seaborne coking coal prices continue to fall. In the first quarter, they averaged about $155 per metric ton that cascaded down throughout the second quarter. Right now, they stand at like $110 to $115. And so that will put pressure on prices moving through the third quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey good morning, everyone. And thank you for taking my question. Alan or Jim, I guess can we just balance the comments you guys have made here because, Alan, I think in your prepared remarks you said the recent pace of volume gains could moderate. But then I think as you've answered some questions here, you guys have sounded relatively bullish about volume outcomes. So what is it that you see in the market that gives you the bullish sense now, but just maybe making a moderate\u2026\nJim Squires: Bullish for what?\nBrandon Oglenski: It's just the idea that maybe we pull back here on recent COVID cases?\nAlan Shaw: Brandon, there are a couple of factors. Number one, we don't expect to continue a 12% sequential improvement in volume month-over-month as we saw, as we moved from May to June. As Jim noted, April and May were deep troughs for us. And we climbed out of that. We think that July is going to come in 4%, 5% probably above where we were in June. So you already see that pace starting to moderate. As we look forward, we see a lot of demand in our consumer oriented markets, which includes merchandise and intermodal, the pressure continues within energy. And so that will have a governor on sequential improvement as we move through the year, and frankly, as I just noted, with Scott Group.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Appreciate that. And then Mike, congrats again on retirement. But I guess\u2026\nMike Wheeler: Thank you.\nBrandon Oglenski: \u2026I think you guys said the TOP21, you've gone through Phase 3 now. Can you just remind us what that phase was? I think it was integrating more line haul train operations, but can you dig deeper there and talk about what incremental changes you can make looking ahead to?\nMike Wheeler: Thank you. Yeah, sure. So the whole phases of TOP21 implementation has been about blending more and more traffic into the train network. And we first started out blending a lot of the merchandise into the automotive network. That was a big deal for last year's July 1st TOP21 implementation. A lot of that was done with the automotive multilevel into the merchandise, saw great results from that. Phase 2 and 3 was more along the lines of integrating the intermodal into the operation and then continuing to look at what we could do with a reduced terminal footprint but still continue the integration of traffic into the train network. And then that's kind of where we're at now is we've got to the point where a train is a train and it gives us a lot of opportunities to add business back to the network, give it all sorts of opportunities for train rides and still meet the customer expectations. So we've got a lot of flexibility going forward now that we've blended all of that into the TOP21 network. So really pleased about that. And again, a train is a train. And as volume comes back, it just gets added to the network in a really nice incremental way from a productivity metric. So really excited about that going forward. So we're ready to continue to iterate as necessary with to TOP21 as the business comes back. So pretty excited about it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Mike, congrats and good luck. Jim, maybe I just want to step back on the clarifying your 60%. Is that now long-term, it's not -- I just want to clarify, it's not a next year target. And then I guess I want to dig into this quarter, Mike, a little bit. If you took out 20% of employees, but as you noted, only 1,000 in the quarter with volumes down 26%. So most of the work was done before. Comp is now still 28% of costs, which is not different than it was back in 2017. So as you post an over 70% operating ratio, which is now 700 basis points worse than your peer and 1,300 basis points worse than the company that tried to acquire you. Just I understand the confidence still in TOP21. What's missing? Even as companies were going through it, we saw others able to make improvements in that OR. What is the constraint here in getting the cost out because in times like this sometimes companies are able to pull out and be more aggressive in structurally taking out those costs. So Jim, as you step back, maybe give a view of what needs to be done here.\nJim Squires: Sure, Ken. Well, as we said a few minutes ago, it was a challenging quarter, and we are not satisfied with the 70% operating ratio we posted in the second quarter. We fully expect operating ratios to trend down through a combination of the growth that we reasonably expect over time and that we will produce ourselves and the productivity initiatives, the many productivity initiatives we have underway. Our strategy is adaptable, and we will lean one way or the other or into both as necessary given the environment we're in. And we are confident that we will make progress toward a 60% operating ratio. We'll get there as fast as we possibly can.\nKen Hoexter: But it's not -- no longer it's a 2021 target, right? It's now back to long-term.\nJim Squires: As I said, we'll get there as fast as we possibly can. And we have a lot of initiatives underway to do just that.\nKen Hoexter: Okay. And then, Alan, for a follow-up. Your pricing up with the ARPU program, which is yielding great results, are you seeing any increased competitive moves, given your focus on pricing, or is the industry taking the opportunity to move on pricing as well. I want to understand like if others are viewing it as an opportunity to come in and take away business if you're focused more on pricing. And maybe that's why the extreme kind of volume swings?\nAlan Shaw: Yes, Ken, we have seen increased competitive pressures from truck. There's no doubt. And we went through a truck recession last year. But we remain focused during that time period on the long-term and long-term value creation for our shareholders. And that's why we've got 10 consecutive quarters of RPU ex-fuel growth in all three of our business units. We're focused on revenue, revenue quality and margin improvement. We've got confidence in the strength of our franchise, in our markets, our customers and our service products and the fact that we can provide a long-term platform for growth. And you see that reflected in our activity.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore.\nJon Chappell: Thank you and good morning everyone. Alan, the auto snapback in the third quarter has been quite noteworthy, not just in your segments, but even across the industry, double-digit jumps almost every single week since the third quarter started. How much of that from your conversation with your customers is a need to restock aggressively versus maybe how much of it is the network that you guys have to relatively outperform the rest of the industry?\nAlan Shaw: Jon, that's a very valid point. That's kind of one of the issues that we've highlighted going forward. There is -- there are low inventory levels everywhere. We believe that auto finished vehicle inventories are close to a nine-year low at this point. Just look at retail sales. The May inventory sales ratio in retail was at the lowest point in eight years. And so some of what we're seeing right now is an effort to rebuild inventories. And we saw our Auto customers kind of adjust their normal July shutdown time period in an effort to rebuild inventories. Some of that will get pushed back until later in the year. So again, as we talked about this pace of growth that we've seen over the last 10 weeks, we do not reasonably expect that. But we are encouraged by the strength in the Auto industry. And as a result, we're seeing our Steel customers are out. They're raising their rates, and they're adding capacity back as well. \nJon Chappell: Great. That's very helpful. And Alan, if I can keep you for the follow-up too. You mentioned the intermodal service offering a couple of times the new ones in the growth part of the country. Just curious on the initial uptake response so far from the customers. On the one hand, you would think the cost proposition of rail is even more compelling just given the pressure that most industries have right now. On the other hand, given the uncertainty in the market, maybe a little bit reluctant to transition more to the rails. How has the initial response been so far on some of those new offerings?\nAlan Shaw: It's been very strong. Customers are very interested in the product that Norfolk Southern delivers. And a lot of that has to do with the strength of our franchise. We've got the most robust Intermodal franchise in the East. It is a powerful asset for Norfolk Southern, for our customers and our shareholders. We've made this investment, and it's already in the ground and it's created this network that's unrivaled in the East which is where a majority of the consumption and the manufacturing takes place. And so we grew it, as you saw, by 11% in 2017. We grew it by 18% in 2018. It took a pause last year during the freight recession. We're very confident in the strength of our franchise, our market approach, the service product that we deliver and the fact that it's going to be a unique platform for growth for us in the long-term and near-term.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.\nAllison Landry: Thanks. Good morning. Jim, so you have Cindy starting in about a month or so. Could you talk a little bit about the initiatives that she will tackle first in terms of the network? Any ideas that she may have already brought to the table from her time at UP or CSX maybe that are different or additive to what you're currently doing? And then where does Mike Farrell fit in? Will he report directly to Cindy and continue to roll out PSR? \nMark George : Cindy and I are very focused on maintaining the operational momentum that we have demonstrated in 2019 and 2020. So we together, view this as an opportunity to continue to push hard on productivity. As we've said, that's a key part of our strategy. And the measures that we take will be similar to the measures we have taken thus far to work to enhance labor productivity, fuel productivity, asset productivity and on down the line. She and I are both also focused on maintaining a high level of service while we pursue these productivity initiatives. That's critical to our long-term success. That's the basis for our ability to grow the top line in the future. And lastly, I would say that she and the rest of the Board are closely aligned on the central importance of safe operations, and we'll be looking for every possible way to continue to drive safety performance as well. So at a high level, that will be the agenda and the alignment that the two of us have.\nAllison Landry: Okay. That's really helpful. And then just as my follow-up, is there a way to help us think through or quantify the cost savings or the OR benefit from the network changes that you made? And then more broadly, do you see opportunities for further rationalization, whether that's yards or other facilities or assets and possibly, are you considering any changes to the coal network? Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Mike? \nMike Wheeler: Yes. Thank you, Allison. Like I noted, yes, we are still going to continue to look at structural opportunities for cost reduction. We're going to find terminals that we can live without and still provide the service that we need. So we're going to push ourselves to do that. I will note, we changed the operation at the two humps this quarter, and that's in addition to the two that we did last year. Jim noted the locomotive shop closure where we've just gone down to one heavy repair shop. We are reducing our production gains here the rest of the year for capital reductions. So we're doing a lot of things to change the structural costs of the network. But that doesn't mean that we're going to stop. Everybody is out there looking every day, turning over every rock to try and continue to find ways to do that. And yes, terminals will be a part of that, just like we've always talked about. We've got more in the hopper, and we'll continue to look at that. But it will all be with an eye toward continuing to provide the service product that we've committed to, like we have. So more in the gas tank and more to come.\nMark George: And Allison, this is Mark. I think we've mentioned before, you can probably pencil in $10 million to $15 million for the humps that \u2013 for each of the two humps that we've closed. So to your specific question on quantifying them. That's the number.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. \nBascome Majors: Yeah. Alan, looking at your coal volumes, specifically in the domestic utility side, and 10 years ago, that was 30 million tons in the second quarter. This year, it's closer to 6 million tons, with quite a bit of that just coming out in the last year. Can you help us understand some of the differences between the structural pressure that you're feeling this year? And what I mean by that is, have you seen any newer accelerated customary retirement, some of the domestic utility side of plants where that's just gone and gone forever in the cyclical -- what I mean by that is just the pressure from natural gas and how power is being dispatched and just lower overall power consumption in the U.S.? Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Hey, Bascome, we understand that, that calls in a secular decline. We get that. And so what you've seen us do over time is adjust our coal network. We've idled Ashtabula. We've short lined some property in our coal fields. We have reorganized our operations in conjunction with our customers in the coal fields, into the southern utility market and actually improved service and improved efficiency. So we understand the pressures that we're facing. Natural gas prices in June were at an inflation-adjusted low for the last 30 years. So that's created some headwinds, as we talked about. And I also had talked about before that we fully expected that the economic shutdown would negatively impact load in commercial and industrial markets for our utility customers. So that's where it's headed. Frankly, we've got a diverse merchandise franchise that set a record for revenue last year and a pretty weak freight environment, and we've got the most powerful intermodal franchise in the East. So we are well positioned for where markets are headed.\nBascome Majors: Okay. So I mean, looking into next year, it's -- I mean, clearly, these declines are pretty substantial in the coal franchise today. I mean, do you expect that to moderate as at least the inventory withdrawal and the power consumption decline inevitably cyclically adjust, or should we just kind of model zero several years out in the domestic business to be safe? Thank you.\nJim Squires: There's going to be 0.5 billion tons of coal produced in the United States this year. We're going to haul our share of it. There will be close to 0.5 billion tons of coal produced in the United States next year. We're going to continue to participate in that market where it drives shareholder value. And we're going to continue to look for opportunities within our strong Merchandise and Intermodal market to compete with truck. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. \nDavid Vernon: Hey, good morning. Jim and Alan, this question is for you on the commercial side. If we kind of look past the monthly sequential gains from the COVID volatility and we think about where Norfolk is going to be one year or two years from now, presumably, you're still going to have a little bit of an or disadvantage to your eastern peer. How is that going to affect kind of your ability to get back to a market level of growth, or should we not.\nJim Squires: Kind of your ability to get back to a market level of growth, or should we not be thinking that, that cost position relative to CSX is going to impact the growth rates across the business?\nMark George: Yes, we're going to continue to focus on revenue and revenue quality. And we performed pretty well there. You can see that in the numbers. We are fully intent on competing with truck. We're going to deliver and we are delivering a best-in-class service product. We're implementing customer-facing technology. We've got a consistent and reliable service product with schedules that our customers value. We also have this no-surprises approach to PSR and which we're collaborating with our customers on changes that we're making to the network. And so they know they're confident that we're going to partner with them and continue to provide them with a platform for growth. We serve a majority of consumption and manufacturing in the United States. We're aligned with over 250 short line partners. We've got a best-in-class industrial development team that is developing a robust pipeline of new opportunities. Near shoring, reshoring and onshoring is only going to assist freight demand in the United States. We serve more North American vehicle production than anybody else and more integrated steel mills than anybody else. We've got a powerful franchise. We're very confident in where we're headed with this thing. We've got it positioned well where the consumer and the transportation markets are headed, and that's in areas in which Norfolk Southern excels.\nDavid Vernon: So no sort of direct impact on the rail competitiveness, then it's more about what's happening in the truck market for growth?\nMark George: Yes. We are going to continue to focus on the truck market for growth, and you're going to see us continue to be aggressive and kinetic in offering new service products that our customers value. We're aligned with the best channel partners in the intermodal industry. We're in good shape going forward. This is where the long-term markets are headed.\nDavid Vernon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Justin Long from Stephens.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. Maybe circling back to the operating leverage question and asking it a little bit differently. As you look into the back half, third and fourth quarter, do you think that operating expenses can decline at a rate that's faster than revenue? And then also, Mark, if there's anything unusual in the second half in terms of gains on sale you're expecting or anything else from an operating expense perspective?\nMark George: Thank you, Justin. So I'll answer the second one first. We don't anticipate any unusual activity in the second half, significant gains or significant write-offs at this point in time. Otherwise, we would have probably taken them, so nothing at this point. Of course, I do believe in the third quarter of last year, you'll recall there was some account receivable provision that was taken that will impact the compares in the third quarter, but I'm sure you all have that in your models. And the first, truly the trajectory of OpEx will be influenced in part by volume. I mean, if volume steps back down, we will be attacking OpEx even more. If volumes do continue on an upward trajectory, then we're still going to put pressure on certain lines of OpEx to reduce them with structural things, and we're going to try to limit the volume variable type of increases that would typically come. And as we say, we're going to try to leverage the P&L with any growth that might come. That said, there is fuel cost that's creeping back up. I think our average price at the pump in the second quarter was under $1 per gallon. So that will go up in the back half of the year. I think right now, it's already trending in the $1.20 something range. So that will be something that we are fighting against. And since I bring that up, we will have some fuel surcharge probably headwinds in the third quarter because that's on a lag. And that $0.98 range in the second quarter will hit our fuel surcharge in the third quarter because it's a lag item.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Coming back to Intermodal, where you clearly are focusing a lot of time and effort there and see growth down the road. Can you remind us how the clean sheeting programs going on within those intermodal terminals? Is that still pretty well developed, or is that something that you've yet to see much benefit from, especially if you're expecting for this to be one of the primary levers to drive growth across the network as you look out over the next couple of years?\nMark George: Brian, we continue our progress in making our intermodal network, both within the terminals and in our train performance more efficient. And as Mike has talked about, we continue to look for opportunities to intermodal trains. And we know that as Intermodal and Merchandise revenues come back, it's going to fold into existing trains. And in the third quarter, we're going to be rolling out an optimized a terminal optimization system across our Intermodal network which is going to offer even further improvements in the service that we provide within our terminals to our customers as well as the efficiency of our terminals. But I also want to make sure that it's really clear. We are focused on growing Merchandise just as much. And we're putting out new products in Merchandise based on this strong and reliable and consistent service product that we've got that's going to allow us to take share from truck as well\u2026\nJim Squires : And the capacity dividend that we have out there on the rail Merchandise side as well.\nMark George: That's exactly right. Mike referenced the capacity dividend, Brian. And so that's where we're going to fold new business into existing operations which is going to give us great operating leverage going forward as we continue to grow.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay. Quick follow-up for Mike then. Congrats, again, on the retirement and the recent success with TOP21 and Phase 3. What do you think would be as you look forward what are the biggest challenges you see structurally on the operating side as you look over the next couple of years? And how do you think you would be addressing those? And I guess I'll take away the answer of volume as a big challenge. So maybe volume agnostic, what are some of the bigger challenges? Any opportunities as well in terms of what's left for the network the next couple of years and in the long term?\nMike Wheeler: Well, thank you. And the opportunity is the fact that our operation leadership team is completely bought into and aligned with the PSR principles. So they understand them. They know them. And they're implementing them. So they're using that every day to find ways to be more productive, but still provide the good service product. So I think that's the great opportunities. As we've got a great team out there, that every day is looking to turn over the rocks and find what they can do. And then the network planning and optimization group, that we put together that's really helped drive the TOP21 iteration, take the structural costs out. They're in place, continuing to look at long-term, structural cost changes. And these are the terminals that we're talking about. And then, the last thing is, we continue to have technology implementation across the operating division, whether it's in engineering to look at. Where we need to replace ties and rail and making sure, we're doing it the most efficient way and the safest way. How we do train handling. So we have just got so many opportunities out there on the railroad to continue to provide the service product that allows marketing to grow the business, but also folks know how to take out tactical and structural costs, and then utilizing technology that we've put out there across the railroad. And the technology really has driven our fuel efficiency that you've seen over the last couple of quarters. And that will continue to be another opportunity for cost going out the door, because that's nothing. But dollar savings right to the bottom line. And it fits in with the ESG, making us a really good partner there.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Thank you. Operator: Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.\nWalter Spracklin: Hi. Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to go back, Jim, to one of the questions on operating ratio. I understand that looking out to next year in the back half, I should say, is a little difficult given the macro uncertainty. So I wanted to kind of take out that uncertainty and give you a scenario where volume is down or -- the volume rebound continues and year-over-year down just modestly. In that scenario, not guidance, but in that scenario where we have volume down modestly, could you do better in terms of operating ratio than you did last year?\nJim Squires: Walter, I think in the current environment of uncertainty, it's very difficult for us to sign up for any scenario, even a hypothetical one. But I would say this we are committed to driving toward a 60% operating ratio, irrespective of the macro environment, in which we find ourselves. And that means that, if we are unable to grow volume and revenue at the pace we would like, we will attempt to make it up, through productivity improvements. And I think we demonstrated that. Yes, the operating ratio in the second quarter was not what we wanted it to be. And not what it needs to be. But in the midst of that, we recommitted to productivity improvements, and we demonstrated that commitment through the actions we took.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay. As a follow-up, on yields, just regardless of base price, I don't know if you can give me an indication ex-coal, what the mix effect is expected to be in the back half, just kind of should it be additive or negative. I would assume, with automotive and some of the other products that are higher yield coming back, that should be positive, but I just want to make sure.\nAlan Shaw: Walter, good morning, it will be negative as intermodal is a growth driver for us. So that's negative with respect to yield, certainly, positive with respect to revenue growth.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Ross with Stifel.\nDavid Ross: Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. I just want to circle back on intermodal. Obviously, much better third quarter to date. In the second quarter, international was a lot weaker than the domestic. How would you characterize July so far in the international versus domestic?\nAlan Shaw: They both have improved quite a bit. What you're seeing is there's not a lot of exports right now. There's heavy demand for imports in the international space. Since inventories are so low, you're seeing a lot of stuff that's hitting the West Coast as opposed to coming all the way around to the East Coast. And so that's creating some transloads into 53-foot containers out on the West Coast, which has opened the domestic demand. But I should say that, we do have several ports that we serve where import demand right now is very high as well.\nDavid Ross: And when you talked about the new service offerings, is that fair to say that those are new intermodal lanes or new intermodal corridors? And then the question is, are they, I guess, new to Intermodal as if a shipper did not have that intermodal choice versus truck in those lanes before, or are they just new to Norfolk Southern?\nAlan Shaw: They are certainly new \u2013 they are a new level of product that is not out there in the marketplace right now, or had not been. We're confident that it's going to be \u2013 it's going to help us grow moving forward. And as I noted, we are going to be very aggressive in launching new products based on the capacity dividend and the service product that Mike and his team are delivering.\nMike Wheeler: And the good news, most of that folds into the current intermodal network that we have now.\nAlan Shaw: And we've got our investments in place in our intermodal network.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Q - Jason Seidl Thank you, operator. Jim and team, good morning. Mike, congratulations on the retirement and listening. Welcome. I wanted to talk a little bit about your end markets. And if you can sort of give us an idea sort of what percentage of your end markets sort of started to come back in 2Q and what percent are out still here as we look in \u2013 as we operate in 3Q?\nAlan Shaw: Jason, we \u2013 as we've talked about, about 70% of our business is tied to the consumer economy and that certainly has improved sharply in June and July. And that we maintain our optimism for that through the third quarter. We also saw some improvement as well, though, in the energy market, but you're still talking about pretty difficult year-over-year comparisons there. So we're seeing lift in all of our markets, sharper lift within the consumer-oriented products that we serve.\nJason Seidl: Okay. That's good color. And the other one and Jim, this might be one for you. But you've got a joint venture with PanAm up in New England. That railroad has been put up for sale. Just wondering, is this something that Norfolk would look at? And sort of how would it work if another class one took over that railroad?\nJim Squires: Pan Am Southern is an important part of our network. It is our presence in New England and we're committed to maintaining a presence in New England as part of our overall network footprint and let me leave it at that.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. And I will now hand the call back to Mr. Jim Squires for closing comments.\nJim Squires: Thank you for your questions this morning. Before we close, I want to take a moment to affirm for everyone on the call, whether you're an investor, customer or employee or other stakeholder of our company, Norfolk Southern's commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. At a time when our society is experiencing dramatic upheaval, it's important to state in this forum that such a commitment is essential to delivering shareholder value. By pursuing measures that ensure inclusion and equal opportunity inside our company and in our interactions with others, we will serve our bottom line and our shareholders well. Thank you and be safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alan Shaw",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter volume was greatly influenced by the dual shocks of COVID-19 and large declines in our energy markets. We remain committed to executing our strategic plan of long-term revenue and margin growth based on our excellent service product and market approach, both valued by our customers. Our productivity, service and collaborative focus was most evident in our automotive franchise, where weekly volumes declined over 90% early in the quarter. We quickly pulled down our automotive train service and as automotive production resumed rapidly ramped up operations to effectively and efficiently serve our customers. Our dynamic planning process and proactive collaboration with our customers produced this rapid restructuring of plan and assets. Our team remains committed to both maximizing profitable growth and improving our service offering as we emerge from the challenge of the pandemic. Moving to slide 6, second quarter revenue declined 29% year-over-year. These declines were affected by volume impacts of COVID and low energy prices, the latter of which also impacted fuel surcharge revenue. The first half of the quarter had dramatically different results than the second, in which we saw an 8% sequential improvement in volume as the economy started to reopen. Our continued focus on yield is evident with all three business groups improving revenue per unit, excluding fuel, a year-over-year gain we have delivered for 10 consecutive quarters. Decline in fuel surcharge revenue and a changing business mix composed of a greater percentage of intermodal volume, lowered overall revenue per unit. Merchandise volume declines were most pronounced in the automotive franchise as automotive volumes declined more than 60% quarterly for mid-April and May production stoppages throughout the industry. Decreases in this market rippled to adjacent products such as steel and plastics. Nearly every market was hurt by pandemic shutdowns, energy prices, consumption decreases or a combination of these items. Food products were greatly influenced by closed restaurants and other points of sale. Low energy prices drove declines in all of our energy markets, including utility coal, frac sand, crude oil, natural gas products and scrubber stone. Intermodal revenue fell 19% in the second quarter, driven by lower levels of consumer demand in response to the pandemic. As the economy reopened, intermodal volume improved as demand for our services grew and truck rates increased. Domestic volumes rebounded as the quarter progressed due to the need to quickly rebuild inventory, while international remained pressured. The increased use of e-commerce and essential goods led to more transloads and domestic equipment. Our coal franchise continued to face pressure this quarter, with revenue declining 55% year-over-year, a result of sustained low energy prices and the global pandemic. Utility volumes declined 57% as load in the industrial and commercial markets deteriorated and coal generation faced intense competition from low natural gas prices. The overall coal decline was slightly offset with an RPU gain of 3%, reflecting volume shortfalls and changing mix. Moving to our outlook on slide 7. We believe the recent volume growth trajectory will moderate with future gains at a slow and uneven pace from June levels. A high degree of uncertainty exists. State and local government reaction to increased COVID cases will have a major influence on the speed and shape of the economic recovery. The growing number of such cases and fiscal policy will impact our outlook to the extent that both influence the strength of consumer demand and labor availability, with the latter having an effect on production. The consumer is active with high retail sales figures reported for June and durable goods spending close to pre-pandemic levels, increasing the need for transportation services. In the trucking sector, spot rates have returned to pre-COVID levels and are currently at the highest point of the year during this inventory replenishment cycle, a positive near-term signal for intermodal and truck competitive merchandise markets. These markets rely heavily on the consumer where the impact of government stimulus, potential shutdowns and unemployment will be key drivers in the continued recovery. Intermodal will benefit from new product development, such as the recently announced numerous services that strengthen the link with our best-in-class channel partners, enhance our interline service offerings and allow Norfolk Southern to secure even more business moving from the Southeast to the Northeast. These products create value for our customers, while utilizing the capacity dividend, generated by our efficient and faster network. Although the manufacturing economy is lagging the consumer, we are seeing a solid rebound in automotive, where volumes quickly started improving at the end of May with continued strength through the third quarter as inventories rebuild. We expect energy to remain depressed. Continued low natural gas prices and unfavorable crude oil spreads are creating additional headwinds across all of our energy markets. Export coal is expected to continue to be negatively impacted by the worldwide pandemic and geopolitical tensions. Our expectations are tempered with the ever-present uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and fiscal policy. This quarter was marked with a sharp difference between the first six weeks and the last. We understand that our volumes will fluctuate as our customers and their customers are impacted by potential future state and local restrictions, in response to increasing COVID infections. Despite these conditions, our strategy is clear. We will continue to improve our revenue quality and service product, delivering services that allow our customers to compete and succeed, while utilizing fewer resources. I will now turn it over to Mike, for an update on operations. Yes, Chris, it depends upon how quickly moves up and whether those spot rates that we're seeing right now translate into contract rates. But yes, we generally touch 50%, 55% of our revenue every year. And we've got a great service product, and we've got confidence in the quality of that product and we're pricing accordingly. Hey, Jordan, absolutely. And you can see that reflected in our numbers. Intermodal is actually leading our growth right now as is Automotive. Basically, the consumer segments are doing really well. And we've got a powerful intermodal franchise. We've got a lot of channel partners and beneficial cargo owners out there who want to continue to align themselves with us. And so we've got -- we're delivering a wonderful service product, and it gives us the strength and the confidence to initiate some of these new service products. We've got a couple of new products that we're going to be launching in the third quarter between the Southwest and the Southeast, which are the two fastest-growing regions of the country, and also some product from the Southeast to the Northeast, which has already started. There is absolutely demand for intermodal in this market. And the truck market in certain regions of the country is extremely tight. And Norfolk Southern has got the solution for that.\nQ \u2013 Jordan Alliger: Great. And then just a follow-up. I know you mentioned -- you guys mentioned on the call, not bringing back crew starts, one-for-one with volume, et cetera. Is there a way you could give some thoughts on headcount as we move sequentially from here based on where it ended in the second quarter? I mean, is there a way to sort of think about the pace of that coming back? Yes. Scott, as I noted, there were two factors that primarily drove core RPU in the second quarter. One was volume shortfalls, the other was mix. And you can see that punctuated where utility was down 67%, whereas, export was down 45%. So just there, you get some positive mix. So you feel back even more, Scott. There's mix within these markets as well. So our utility South franchise in the second quarter was about 54% of our volume. Last year, at the time, it was 50%. So there's a positive mix there. Similarly within export, export met, which tends to also be longer haul and a higher RPU, was 74% of our volume in the second quarter comp to 56% in the second quarter of last year. So we had a lot of positive mix factors going for us in the quarter. I'd tell you seaborne coking coal prices continue to fall. In the first quarter, they averaged about $155 per metric ton that cascaded down throughout the second quarter. Right now, they stand at like $110 to $115. And so that will put pressure on prices moving through the third quarter. Brandon, there are a couple of factors. Number one, we don't expect to continue a 12% sequential improvement in volume month-over-month as we saw, as we moved from May to June. As Jim noted, April and May were deep troughs for us. And we climbed out of that. We think that July is going to come in 4%, 5% probably above where we were in June. So you already see that pace starting to moderate. As we look forward, we see a lot of demand in our consumer oriented markets, which includes merchandise and intermodal, the pressure continues within energy. And so that will have a governor on sequential improvement as we move through the year, and frankly, as I just noted, with Scott Group. Yes, Ken, we have seen increased competitive pressures from truck. There's no doubt. And we went through a truck recession last year. But we remain focused during that time period on the long-term and long-term value creation for our shareholders. And that's why we've got 10 consecutive quarters of RPU ex-fuel growth in all three of our business units. We're focused on revenue, revenue quality and margin improvement. We've got confidence in the strength of our franchise, in our markets, our customers and our service products and the fact that we can provide a long-term platform for growth. And you see that reflected in our activity. Jon, that's a very valid point. That's kind of one of the issues that we've highlighted going forward. There is -- there are low inventory levels everywhere. We believe that auto finished vehicle inventories are close to a nine-year low at this point. Just look at retail sales. The May inventory sales ratio in retail was at the lowest point in eight years. And so some of what we're seeing right now is an effort to rebuild inventories. And we saw our Auto customers kind of adjust their normal July shutdown time period in an effort to rebuild inventories. Some of that will get pushed back until later in the year. So again, as we talked about this pace of growth that we've seen over the last 10 weeks, we do not reasonably expect that. But we are encouraged by the strength in the Auto industry. And as a result, we're seeing our Steel customers are out. They're raising their rates, and they're adding capacity back as well. It's been very strong. Customers are very interested in the product that Norfolk Southern delivers. And a lot of that has to do with the strength of our franchise. We've got the most robust Intermodal franchise in the East. It is a powerful asset for Norfolk Southern, for our customers and our shareholders. We've made this investment, and it's already in the ground and it's created this network that's unrivaled in the East which is where a majority of the consumption and the manufacturing takes place. And so we grew it, as you saw, by 11% in 2017. We grew it by 18% in 2018. It took a pause last year during the freight recession. We're very confident in the strength of our franchise, our market approach, the service product that we deliver and the fact that it's going to be a unique platform for growth for us in the long-term and near-term. Mike? Hey, Bascome, we understand that, that calls in a secular decline. We get that. And so what you've seen us do over time is adjust our coal network. We've idled Ashtabula. We've short lined some property in our coal fields. We have reorganized our operations in conjunction with our customers in the coal fields, into the southern utility market and actually improved service and improved efficiency. So we understand the pressures that we're facing. Natural gas prices in June were at an inflation-adjusted low for the last 30 years. So that's created some headwinds, as we talked about. And I also had talked about before that we fully expected that the economic shutdown would negatively impact load in commercial and industrial markets for our utility customers. So that's where it's headed. Frankly, we've got a diverse merchandise franchise that set a record for revenue last year and a pretty weak freight environment, and we've got the most powerful intermodal franchise in the East. So we are well positioned for where markets are headed. Walter, good morning, it will be negative as intermodal is a growth driver for us. So that's negative with respect to yield, certainly, positive with respect to revenue growth. They both have improved quite a bit. What you're seeing is there's not a lot of exports right now. There's heavy demand for imports in the international space. Since inventories are so low, you're seeing a lot of stuff that's hitting the West Coast as opposed to coming all the way around to the East Coast. And so that's creating some transloads into 53-foot containers out on the West Coast, which has opened the domestic demand. But I should say that, we do have several ports that we serve where import demand right now is very high as well. They are certainly new \u2013 they are a new level of product that is not out there in the marketplace right now, or had not been. We're confident that it's going to be \u2013 it's going to help us grow moving forward. And as I noted, we are going to be very aggressive in launching new products based on the capacity dividend and the service product that Mike and his team are delivering. And we've got our investments in place in our intermodal network. Jason, we \u2013 as we've talked about, about 70% of our business is tied to the consumer economy and that certainly has improved sharply in June and July. And that we maintain our optimism for that through the third quarter. We also saw some improvement as well, though, in the energy market, but you're still talking about pretty difficult year-over-year comparisons there. So we're seeing lift in all of our markets, sharper lift within the consumer-oriented products that we serve."

            "name": "Jim Squires",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's second quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mark George, Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer. As we announced earlier this week, Mike will retire from Norfolk Southern on October 1, after a 35-year career of distinguished achievement. He will be greatly missed, and we wish him well. When we began the search for our next Chief Operating Officer, we looked for an experienced executive who could lead our day-to-day operations and build on our successful implementation of precision scheduled railroading. We are proud to welcome Cindy Sanborn, one of our industry's leading operations experts, to the Norfolk Southern team. We look forward to Cindy joining the company on September 1. With that, let's proceed to a review of our second quarter performance. Amid the global pandemic and ensuing economic disruption in the markets and communities we serve, the men and women of Norfolk Southern demonstrated their resilience in the second quarter. Our customers in virtually every segment shipped significantly lower volumes, with many changing their shipping patterns as they work to keep the supply lines open. The automotive industry was particularly volatile, experiencing a rapid and almost total shutdown and then a subsequent restart and push to restock inventory, all within the same quarter. Norfolk Southern's business reflected that disruption. Revenues decreased 29%, leading to a decline of 43% in earnings per share. Our team rose to the challenge. We quickly adjusted network plans and resources in the short-term, while advancing our long-term strategy to deliver shareholder value with several important achievements. First, Norfolk Southern employees are serving our customers and our country with excellence during a pandemic. The successful implementation of our TOP21 strategic plan and precision scheduled railroading, combined with the hard work and commitment of our employees, is producing results. We achieved record train performance, train speed, terminal dwell and shipment consistency. Many other service metrics were near all-time best levels. Second, we managed our operations efficiently as shipped volumes bottomed out while ensuring we have strong operating leverage as business recovers. Year-over-year in the second quarter, our force levels declined by 20%, that's nearly 5,000 positions while train size increased and fuel efficiency improved. These achievements enabled an operating expense reduction of 21% against a 26% decline in volume. We are a fast-fluid railroad ready to take advantage when volumes return. Third, and perhaps most important, we kept our eye on our strategic objectives by attacking structural costs. We reduced our hump yard footprint in the quarter by idling two additional humps, bringing the total to four that have been idled over the past year. These actions create direct cost savings over the coming quarters and demonstrate our success improving our TOP21 train plan to be nimble and adaptive to changing freight demand with fewer, more efficient major terminals. Throughout all of this, we are taking comprehensive steps to protect the health and well-being of our people. All employees who can work remotely continue to do so. For employees whose responsibilities require them to work on site, we are following CDC guidelines. I opened by lauding our team's resilience. While each one of these actions and achievements on its own has merit, when taken together and in the face of the unique disruptions of the second quarter, they demonstrate the determination of this team to forge ahead and take on any challenges necessary to create value for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Alan and the team, to provide further details and commentary. Alan? Thank you, Mark. In summary, we are committed to driving our operating ratio down and still have a goal of 60. We have a full-court press on productivity initiatives to ensure that our cost structure improves while also capitalizing on the operating leverage that we are achieving. Thank you for your attention, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Good morning, Chris. Good question and really shines a light on what is our main focus right now, which is to continue driving productivity and efficiency gains in the current economic environment. And we took action in that regard in the second quarter through the conversion of one hump yard and the closure of another. We also took off-line 1 of 2 major back shop locomotive maintenance facilities. So we demonstrated our commitment to driving productivity in the midst of the volume challenges in the second quarter, and we will continue to push hard on that as we move through the rest of the year and beyond. Mike, let me turn it over to you for some additional comments. Sure, Tom. Well, I too wanted to thank Mike again for his many contributions over the years and we deeply appreciate your service, Mike. Let me describe briefly the process that the Board of Directors went through in selecting Cindy, as our next Chief Operating Officer. It was a comprehensive search process. It began by defining the experiences and qualities we were looking for as a Board of Directors in our next COO. And these were things like demonstrated experience with operations at a very high level, at a leadership level, a commitment to safety in operations as paramount, qualities like success in working with regulators and other stakeholders, a commitment to service, great service for our customers. And \u2013 so we began with a large field of candidates. We steadily narrowed it down, and we ended up with Cindy and she brings to us all of the qualities and experiences that I just outlined. And in addition, she brings experience with the PSR model specifically, having worked at both Union Pacific and CSX, which, like NS, are in the midst of implementing PSR. So we're delighted to welcome her to our team starting September 1. Let me start by acknowledging that the operating ratio in the second quarter is not where we need it to be and not where the operating ratio will be going forward, we believe. It was a tough quarter, particularly the first part of it, with revenue down as much as it was, particularly in key areas. So we struggled in the first couple of months in the quarter. Now things began to turn around in June and we saw the volume pick up. And naturally, we saw the operating leverage kick in, in the month of June, and that has continued thus far in July as well. Who knows what the rest of the year may hold. As you heard from Alan, it's a mixed outlook. We're feeling pretty bullish about the current volume levels relative to where they were in the second quarter, but we'll see. Looking out, if the question is whether growth counts, whether growth matters for further operating ratio improvement, absolutely, it helps. And it would be a significant tailwind. If the question is whether our strategy for OR improvement is dependent on growth, the answer is no. We intend to drive the operating ratio lower and to get to our 60 goal under whatever conditions we experience. We believe we have a strategy that is adaptable enough and we have enough opportunities in other areas while pursuing strategies that we believe will grow the top line as well. If the comparison is to the volume trough, what we hope will prove to be the trough in April and May, then yes, we have seen a significant impact and is uptick. And as I said, that has translated into operating leverage in the latter part of the second quarter and in the third quarter. And we would expect that to continue given current volume levels, and the productivity measures we've undertaken. But there's so much uncertainty in the macro outlook. Not only for the remainder of this year, but going forward as well. And let me turn it over to Alan. He made a few comments and prepared remarks on this. But Alan, why don't you talk a little bit about our macro outlook for the rest of this year and into next year.\nA \u2013 Alan Shaw: As Jim noted, we're pretty optimistic about the third quarter. You saw a pretty strong sequential improvement in June over our trough in April and May. Volumes are increasing again sequentially in July, which kind of goes against normal seasonality, where you typically have a little bit of a downturn in July. Yeah. So we see retail activity was up 7.5% in June. We saw durable goods orders were up 7.3%. Housing starts were up 17.3%. Spot rates are up in the upper teens. And truck tonnage increased at the fastest pace in 8.5 years. The auto restart has certainly helped and that's reverberated through the supply chain. So as we talk to our customers, there's a lot of near-term demand. The risks that we see going forward are increasing cases of COVID and the unsettled situation with fiscal policy and the stimulus and the impact that that could potentially have on fourth quarter volume and revenue.\nQ \u2013 Amit Mehrotra: Right. So if I'm hearing you guys correctly, nobody knows the future, but if the current trends hold, you think you can keep OR flat to even better on a year-over-year basis this year. Is that \u2013 am I reading that correctly? We're not willing to give guidance on OR, just given the overall uncertainty. We will continue to push hard on cost. And we have measures in the pipeline, and we demonstrated our commitment to cost control in the second quarter as well. We'll keep doing that.\nQ \u2013 Amit Mehrotra: Okay. It's just the macroeconomic. The macroeconomic outlook is so uncertain right now.\nQ \u2013 Amit Mehrotra: Fair enough. And then, Mark, just a follow-up. The CapEx year-to-date is running lower than the 16% to 18% of sales, which is actually making free cash conversion look pretty good. I'm wondering if there's a potential to see CapEx come down relative to that guidance. You've talked about it in the past, but I'm just wondering if there's any more update you can give there, because the company's free cash conversion is lagging most of the peers that's obviously going to weigh on the multiple of the company, the valuation of the company. I'm just wondering if there's any opportunity to bring down the CapEx to actually improve the free cash conversion. Alan? Mike, why don't you comment on the trend in crew starts and then ripple through to employment specifically. And then, Mark, maybe you can take the question on overall head count going forward. Bullish for what? Sure, Ken. Well, as we said a few minutes ago, it was a challenging quarter, and we are not satisfied with the 70% operating ratio we posted in the second quarter. We fully expect operating ratios to trend down through a combination of the growth that we reasonably expect over time and that we will produce ourselves and the productivity initiatives, the many productivity initiatives we have underway. Our strategy is adaptable, and we will lean one way or the other or into both as necessary given the environment we're in. And we are confident that we will make progress toward a 60% operating ratio. We'll get there as fast as we possibly can. As I said, we'll get there as fast as we possibly can. And we have a lot of initiatives underway to do just that. There's going to be 0.5 billion tons of coal produced in the United States this year. We're going to haul our share of it. There will be close to 0.5 billion tons of coal produced in the United States next year. We're going to continue to participate in that market where it drives shareholder value. And we're going to continue to look for opportunities within our strong Merchandise and Intermodal market to compete with truck. Kind of your ability to get back to a market level of growth, or should we not be thinking that, that cost position relative to CSX is going to impact the growth rates across the business? And the capacity dividend that we have out there on the rail Merchandise side as well. Walter, I think in the current environment of uncertainty, it's very difficult for us to sign up for any scenario, even a hypothetical one. But I would say this we are committed to driving toward a 60% operating ratio, irrespective of the macro environment, in which we find ourselves. And that means that, if we are unable to grow volume and revenue at the pace we would like, we will attempt to make it up, through productivity improvements. And I think we demonstrated that. Yes, the operating ratio in the second quarter was not what we wanted it to be. And not what it needs to be. But in the midst of that, we recommitted to productivity improvements, and we demonstrated that commitment through the actions we took. Pan Am Southern is an important part of our network. It is our presence in New England and we're committed to maintaining a presence in New England as part of our overall network footprint and let me leave it at that. Thank you for your questions this morning. Before we close, I want to take a moment to affirm for everyone on the call, whether you're an investor, customer or employee or other stakeholder of our company, Norfolk Southern's commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. At a time when our society is experiencing dramatic upheaval, it's important to state in this forum that such a commitment is essential to delivering shareholder value. By pursuing measures that ensure inclusion and equal opportunity inside our company and in our interactions with others, we will serve our bottom line and our shareholders well. Thank you and be safe."

            "content": "Thank you, Alan. And thank you, Jim, for those kind words. The second quarter saw an unprecedented amount of operating change, as we ceased hump operations at two yards and responded to major volume shifts with a keen eye, towards making many of our crew start reductions permanent. We continued to execute at a high level, while pressing forward with our transformation and managing through the challenges of the pandemic. Moving on to slide 9, which again shows continued improvements in train speed and terminal dwell, setting or tying all-time records for us this quarter. Our operation benefited from the network fluidity that came with dramatically lower volumes. We were able to adjust our operation, in line with our customers, again, setting records in train performance, shipment consistency and plan adherence. These milestones came as we further reduced assets and employment, while taking advantage of the lower volume environment to reconfigure, our network operations. Moving on, slide 10 is the update to our service and productivity metrics for the year, which you have seen in previous quarters. All of our metrics are showing improvement on a year-to-date basis, reflecting both our continued progress and the effect of the pandemic. Our service delivery index measures shipment on-time performance, indexed to 2018. We were already at our 2021 goal in the first quarter. And continue to improve in the second quarter, which will enable us to meet or exceed our goals over the rest of the year. We continue to provide a service product that meets or exceeds our customers' expectations. Extreme volume swings challenged both T&E and locomotive productivity, during the quarter. We reduced both T&E employment and active locomotives during the quarter to the lowest numbers on record, but those changes slightly lag the reduction in volumes. We improved our year-over-year train way, by closely matching the train plan to volume changes. And being careful about, when and where we added additional service as business returned. Train length grew even more than train weight. Matching the plan to volumes helped us realize an increase in fuel efficiency, to a second quarter record, by maximizing the returns on the investment in energy management and PTC technology. Finally, we easily surpassed our Cars Online goal, setting new records in the quarter that were driven down in part, directly by lower volumes and in part, by our record train speed and dwell metrics that kept cars moving towards destination. As in past quarters, this includes cars that were both active and stored awaiting upturns in business. Moving on to slide 11, this is our sixth consecutive quarter of accelerated crew start reductions. I am exceptionally proud that our operating team was able to respond so quickly to the sudden and severe pandemic-induced volume drops. We will continue to use both tactical and structural changes to keep our cost structure controlled and flexible as volume changes. Prior to the pandemic, we advanced through Phase 3 of the TOP21 program. We are continuing to optimize our train network and rationalize our yard network, even while setting the stage for positive operating leverage as volumes rise. Implementing TOP21 enabled us to cease hump operations at Linwood and Bellevue. Continued progress comes through long-term structural changes in our asset base, improved service levels and rising productivity metrics following proven PSR principles. Moving to slide 12, we seized the opportunity to use the second quarter business drop to craft a better plan for when traffic returned. As this graph shows, we reduced crew starts in line with business reductions. But as traffic comes back, we are fully optimizing our train capacity based on our current business mix instead of simply just restoring previous train starts. Slide 13 shows how Well Norfolk Southern is positioned. In the second quarter, we closed one of our two locomotive heavy repair shops and ceased hump operations at two of our large yards, Linwood and Bellevue, making a total of four hump yards eliminated in a year's time. Our structural network changes are emblematic of our willingness to transform the way we operate in the pursuit of efficiency. We aggressively continue to look for additional opportunities to reduce our terminal footprint. We can and will do more to reduce our resource and investment needs. But we are also capitalizing on the return of traffic from historic lows by adding back trains more slowly than returning traffic. As traffic does come back, we are much more willing to mix traffic types on whatever trains have capacity and can meet service standards. Generating this kind of operating leverage during a rise in traffic is very powerful, and we are committed to maintaining that leverage. Now I will turn it over to Mark who will cover the financial results. Yes. Well, we're not letting off the gas. We've got several things we continue to look at that are in the hopper, and we'll roll out as appropriate based on the volumes in the business. But like I've said before, we are going to continue to push ourselves to find ways to reduce our structural costs out there and the terminals that we can do without, while still providing service product that we've committed to. So we still have things we're working on and you'll see those roll out in the future. Thank you. Yes. As you noticed in the slides, we continue to leverage crew starts versus volume. And the good news is that's continued in through July. Through July, our crew starts are down 20%, while our volumes only down 10%. So we expect to see that leverage going forward, and we've got a great nimble group to be able to iterate the train plan as necessary and get the leverage on the volume. So really pleased about that, again, 20% down in crew starts, July already, while volume is only down 10%. So we continue to see that and will in the future. Mark? Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, sure. So the whole phases of TOP21 implementation has been about blending more and more traffic into the train network. And we first started out blending a lot of the merchandise into the automotive network. That was a big deal for last year's July 1st TOP21 implementation. A lot of that was done with the automotive multilevel into the merchandise, saw great results from that. Phase 2 and 3 was more along the lines of integrating the intermodal into the operation and then continuing to look at what we could do with a reduced terminal footprint but still continue the integration of traffic into the train network. And then that's kind of where we're at now is we've got to the point where a train is a train and it gives us a lot of opportunities to add business back to the network, give it all sorts of opportunities for train rides and still meet the customer expectations. So we've got a lot of flexibility going forward now that we've blended all of that into the TOP21 network. So really pleased about that. And again, a train is a train. And as volume comes back, it just gets added to the network in a really nice incremental way from a productivity metric. So really excited about that going forward. So we're ready to continue to iterate as necessary with to TOP21 as the business comes back. So pretty excited about it. Yes. Thank you, Allison. Like I noted, yes, we are still going to continue to look at structural opportunities for cost reduction. We're going to find terminals that we can live without and still provide the service that we need. So we're going to push ourselves to do that. I will note, we changed the operation at the two humps this quarter, and that's in addition to the two that we did last year. Jim noted the locomotive shop closure where we've just gone down to one heavy repair shop. We are reducing our production gains here the rest of the year for capital reductions. So we're doing a lot of things to change the structural costs of the network. But that doesn't mean that we're going to stop. Everybody is out there looking every day, turning over every rock to try and continue to find ways to do that. And yes, terminals will be a part of that, just like we've always talked about. We've got more in the hopper, and we'll continue to look at that. But it will all be with an eye toward continuing to provide the service product that we've committed to, like we have. So more in the gas tank and more to come. Well, thank you. And the opportunity is the fact that our operation leadership team is completely bought into and aligned with the PSR principles. So they understand them. They know them. And they're implementing them. So they're using that every day to find ways to be more productive, but still provide the good service product. So I think that's the great opportunities. As we've got a great team out there, that every day is looking to turn over the rocks and find what they can do. And then the network planning and optimization group, that we put together that's really helped drive the TOP21 iteration, take the structural costs out. They're in place, continuing to look at long-term, structural cost changes. And these are the terminals that we're talking about. And then, the last thing is, we continue to have technology implementation across the operating division, whether it's in engineering to look at. Where we need to replace ties and rail and making sure, we're doing it the most efficient way and the safest way. How we do train handling. So we have just got so many opportunities out there on the railroad to continue to provide the service product that allows marketing to grow the business, but also folks know how to take out tactical and structural costs, and then utilizing technology that we've put out there across the railroad. And the technology really has driven our fuel efficiency that you've seen over the last couple of quarters. And that will continue to be another opportunity for cost going out the door, because that's nothing. But dollar savings right to the bottom line. And it fits in with the ESG, making us a really good partner there. And the good news, most of that folds into the current intermodal network that we have now."

            "name": "Mark George",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. On slide 15, you see the key financial measures. As Alan shared, while RPUX fuel for each commodity was favorable, adverse mix and declining fuel surcharge revenue created headwinds leading to overall revenue being down 29% on volume being down 26%. Operating expenses were down 21% in the quarter, with each cost component driven lower, led by fuel as well as employment-related costs. As we signaled in May, we weren't able to completely mitigate the sudden and dramatic volume declines with dollar-for-dollar expense reductions. And this led to operating income being down $455 million while the operating ratio increased 710 basis points. Despite the 43% decline in operating income, free cash flow for the quarter declined by half that rate or 22%. So it remained more durable and contributed to a record free cash flow during the first half of the year of over $1 billion. On slide 16, you will see that the quarter was free of any significant unusual items, although, the EPS compare versus last year does benefit from the absence, of a non-operating impairment charge that was recorded in Q2 2019. So while the reported EPS eroded by $1.17, the contraction from core operations is actually $1.25. Moving to Slide 17 and operating expenses, you will see they were driven down by $385 million or 21%. Certainly, fuel savings were a large contributor with roughly half of that savings driven by the sharply lower prices. $74 million of the reduction was from lower consumption due to the decline in GTMs. But also another solid quarter of fuel efficiency gains, which was 3% this quarter and is now 4% year-to-date. We drove Comp & Ben down $126 million or 18% as employment was reduced by nearly 20% or 5,000 year-over-year and down 5% versus 1Q. It's important to note that, as we pressed forward with structural resource reductions in the quarter. We did maintain forces on extra board status that would be required to serve in the event of a sudden surge in volume, which is exactly what happened, in June, where volume sequentially increased 12% from the May level with no adverse service disruption. As Mike touched upon, we prioritized this approach as complementary to our strategic plans focus on best-in-class service without the cyclical variability in reliability that has plagued the industry historically. You'll note $20 million in savings from managing tightly our overtime as well as re-crews which were down 50%. In line with what I had signalled during the quarter, Comp & Ben per employee was sequentially down by a modest amount. Moving over to Purchase Services & Rents, this was down 11%, with Purchase Services itself down 13%, driven by lower intermodal and automotive facility costs associated with the volume decline. Material costs are down $20 million, thanks in large part to reduced maintenance costs associated with our mechanical realignment as well as initiatives surrounding a locomotive and railcar fleet rationalization, the lower other costs of $11 million benefits from our constraint of travel and other discretionary items. Gains from the sales of operating properties this quarter was negligible, similar to last year. You'll recall last quarter. I provided a window into, how you should think about these expense categories, from a volume variability perspective given the on-set of what we knew would be a volume shock here in Q2. I indicated that we would be able to reduce roughly 50% to 60% of our costs, with volume. In Q2, the 21% reduction in costs or 16%, if you exclude the anomalous fuel price benefit, was exactly in line with that 50% to 60% guidance, I had given. On slide 18, we look at the full P&L and here, you'll see that other income net of $49 million is $27 million better than prior year. This favorability is driven by the absence of last year's $28 million asset impairment charge, along with a $25 million year-over-year increase in COLI returns. This favorable return was partially offset by headwinds from lower non-operating property gains, as well as transaction costs associated with the debt exchange that we completed during the quarter. Lastly, the modestly lower effective tax rate in the quarter of 22.1% was driven by the COLI returns I just mentioned, which are not subject to income tax. Moving to slide 19. For the six months ended June 2020, our free cash flow was a record at $1.23 billion, aided in large part by fewer capital additions and timing of income tax payments. Property additions in the first half were $735 million, $244 million below 2019 levels, and we're on a run rate to be at our target of $1.5 billion for the year, which will be a 25% reduction from 2019 spend levels. With our cash generation and liquidity profile, we were able to continue to distribute cash to shareholders, maintaining our dividend, while moderating share repurchase activity. In the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares, roughly $200 million. As of now, we have over $1 billion of cash on hand, with less than $100 million of debt maturities in the next year. So we are in a comfortable place in case the recent market stabilization that we are enjoying falters. I'll just wrap with a comment on the outlook. While we can't be certain of the volume shape in the back half, as you heard from Mike, we are taking this opportunity to make significant structural changes to our network, while also driving further efficiencies into the train plan. These actions ensure that we are well positioned to leverage the volume recovery. And that in any scenario, we are moving forward with transforming our cost structure. Jim? Yes. Thanks for the question, Amit. We didn't guide to really to 16% to 18% after the last call. We actually just gave a fixed guidance number on CapEx, where we brought it down to $1.5 billion. And really, the first half number that is our run rate. So we are going to finish the year at/or about $1.5 billion regardless of revenue. So I think hopefully, it means that as a percentage, it could actually be lower than the 16% to 18% range. So we started early in the year in February, and said it's time to bring it down, and we took $0.5 billion out. We will have taken $0.5 billion out of our CapEx budget this year compared to last year. And yeah, definitely, that is what's driving that good conversion you point out in the first half. So the CapEx in the back half is going to continue at that rate. So that should help. But also, Amit, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, some of the conversion benefit that we did enjoy in the first half was a function of tax -- income tax payments that really, in large part, thanks to the Cares Act were pushed into July. So some of that will be made up, unfortunately, in the second half, we won't have the same tax benefit. And then we also had some working capital benefits in the first half. When volumes come down, you don't have as much AR building up. So that will probably unwind as volumes recover in the second half as well. But fully aware that from a cash conversion perspective, our goal is to try to raise that number from where it's been historically. And CapEx is one of the vehicles to get there. Yes. And just to remind, I mean, we've gone down 5,000 employees versus Q2 of last year, that's a 20% reduction. We're kind of lapping now the big step change from the TOP21 implementation. But obviously, we're still chasing a Q2 volume decline that was pretty significant. So, we are focused on trying to rebuild that productivity curve. And as Mike said, hopefully, with any volume growth that comes here in the back half, we can absorb it with what we have, but also continue to look for more productivity opportunities. I'm not going to put a fine point or a number on guidance for headcount, but for sure, it's going to be an area that we're focused on leveraging while we enjoy the volume recovery. Yes. So, pretty much the volume variability that we had guided last quarter, I think, helped informed you on expectations for OpEx and at the end of the day, we came in pretty much in line with what we guided. So, it worked out well. I would hope now, Scott, that as we start to see volume growth, we actually do better than that curve, and we leverage it and get better incrementals. That's the goal and that's the objective that this leadership team is fully aligned on. But really, the big variable is going to be this momentum we saw with the June volume recovery. And what we're enjoying here in July, does it continue on this trajectory or does it stabilize? And that is really -- if it continues, and I'm fully expecting we're going to try to leverage that and get more and greater incrementals than, hopefully, what I showed you. And yes, we had quite a curve -- to your second part of your question, quite a curve within the second quarter. And I'm not going to give you the exact number, but I will tell you, we weren't in the 70s in the month of June. So, that was encouraging to see that we will -- hopefully, now that's behind us. We had a real deep body blow we took in April and May that it's hard to recover from. But June, we started to be encouraged by the leverage that we started to see with the 12% sequential improvement in volumes. So, with the cost that we took out, we had a decent quarter -- I'm sorry, a decent month in June with an OR that was back in the 60s. Cindy and I are very focused on maintaining the operational momentum that we have demonstrated in 2019 and 2020. So we together, view this as an opportunity to continue to push hard on productivity. As we've said, that's a key part of our strategy. And the measures that we take will be similar to the measures we have taken thus far to work to enhance labor productivity, fuel productivity, asset productivity and on down the line. She and I are both also focused on maintaining a high level of service while we pursue these productivity initiatives. That's critical to our long-term success. That's the basis for our ability to grow the top line in the future. And lastly, I would say that she and the rest of the Board are closely aligned on the central importance of safe operations, and we'll be looking for every possible way to continue to drive safety performance as well. So at a high level, that will be the agenda and the alignment that the two of us have. And Allison, this is Mark. I think we've mentioned before, you can probably pencil in $10 million to $15 million for the humps that \u2013 for each of the two humps that we've closed. So to your specific question on quantifying them. That's the number. Yes, we're going to continue to focus on revenue and revenue quality. And we performed pretty well there. You can see that in the numbers. We are fully intent on competing with truck. We're going to deliver and we are delivering a best-in-class service product. We're implementing customer-facing technology. We've got a consistent and reliable service product with schedules that our customers value. We also have this no-surprises approach to PSR and which we're collaborating with our customers on changes that we're making to the network. And so they know they're confident that we're going to partner with them and continue to provide them with a platform for growth. We serve a majority of consumption and manufacturing in the United States. We're aligned with over 250 short line partners. We've got a best-in-class industrial development team that is developing a robust pipeline of new opportunities. Near shoring, reshoring and onshoring is only going to assist freight demand in the United States. We serve more North American vehicle production than anybody else and more integrated steel mills than anybody else. We've got a powerful franchise. We're very confident in where we're headed with this thing. We've got it positioned well where the consumer and the transportation markets are headed, and that's in areas in which Norfolk Southern excels. Yes. We are going to continue to focus on the truck market for growth, and you're going to see us continue to be aggressive and kinetic in offering new service products that our customers value. We're aligned with the best channel partners in the intermodal industry. We're in good shape going forward. This is where the long-term markets are headed. Thank you, Justin. So I'll answer the second one first. We don't anticipate any unusual activity in the second half, significant gains or significant write-offs at this point in time. Otherwise, we would have probably taken them, so nothing at this point. Of course, I do believe in the third quarter of last year, you'll recall there was some account receivable provision that was taken that will impact the compares in the third quarter, but I'm sure you all have that in your models. And the first, truly the trajectory of OpEx will be influenced in part by volume. I mean, if volume steps back down, we will be attacking OpEx even more. If volumes do continue on an upward trajectory, then we're still going to put pressure on certain lines of OpEx to reduce them with structural things, and we're going to try to limit the volume variable type of increases that would typically come. And as we say, we're going to try to leverage the P&L with any growth that might come. That said, there is fuel cost that's creeping back up. I think our average price at the pump in the second quarter was under $1 per gallon. So that will go up in the back half of the year. I think right now, it's already trending in the $1.20 something range. So that will be something that we are fighting against. And since I bring that up, we will have some fuel surcharge probably headwinds in the third quarter because that's on a lag. And that $0.98 range in the second quarter will hit our fuel surcharge in the third quarter because it's a lag item. Brian, we continue our progress in making our intermodal network, both within the terminals and in our train performance more efficient. And as Mike has talked about, we continue to look for opportunities to intermodal trains. And we know that as Intermodal and Merchandise revenues come back, it's going to fold into existing trains. And in the third quarter, we're going to be rolling out an optimized a terminal optimization system across our Intermodal network which is going to offer even further improvements in the service that we provide within our terminals to our customers as well as the efficiency of our terminals. But I also want to make sure that it's really clear. We are focused on growing Merchandise just as much. And we're putting out new products in Merchandise based on this strong and reliable and consistent service product that we've got that's going to allow us to take share from truck as well... That's exactly right. Mike referenced the capacity dividend, Brian. And so that's where we're going to fold new business into existing operations which is going to give us great operating leverage going forward as we continue to grow."

Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with our non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.\nJim Squires: Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Norfolk Southern\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. Before we discuss our financial results, I\u2019d first like to thank our employees for their dedication during these unprecedented times. Norfolk Southern employees are proud to be delivering an essential service. In a video message to employees dispatcher Misty Brayton expressed the sentiment well when she said, we supply America with the goods that they are short of right now. And I hope everybody that works for Norfolk Southern feels essential after this. It is truly inspirational to watch our employees rise to the challenge. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we established three simple goals early on, protect our employees, serve our customers and exercise strong financial discipline. I will talk briefly about the steps we are taking in each area. Our first responsibility is to protect our people. We acted quickly based on CDC guidelines and took extensive measures to keep employees safe. We transitioned most of our office employees to remote work in a matter of days. For employees whose jobs require them to work on site, we implemented social distancing and established rigorous cleaning protocols for their work environments. Our preventive measures, combined with the diligence of our employees have kept the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at Norfolk Southern low. I am also pleased to report that our employees are working safely through the many potential distractions. Our thoughts are with all those whose lives have been impacted by the virus. Our second goal is to continue providing an excellent service product for our customers and that\u2019s exactly what we are doing. Our customers are making rapid adjustments to their operations due to the impacts of the Coronavirus and we are right there with them every day as a valued partner. They count on us for reliable service, close collaboration and nimble operational adjustments and we are delivering. We will address our third goal, which is to exercise strong financial discipline throughout the balance of this call. The work we have done to implement our strategic plan has made us an even more resilient business, putting us in a good position to navigate the current market disruption. I will now turn to our financial results for the quarter. Allow me to first remind everyone of our announcement on April 16th of a non-cash charge of $385 million related to the ongoing disposition of 703 locomotives. Thanks to the excellent execution of our strategic plan, our fleet today is more efficient and we are able to operate with significantly fewer locomotives. Mark will provide additional color. But as you can see on slide five, we have provided an adjusted view of our financials to exclude this charge. This is what I will reference in the rest of my comments this morning. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.58 and the adjusted operating ratio was 63.7%. These numbers improved upon last year\u2019s record results by 3% and 230 basis points, respectively. Within the context of an 11% volume decline, they are remarkable achievements that demonstrate this team\u2019s urgency to transform our company. We also set records and metrics such as train performance, terminal dwell and shipment consistency among others and accelerated crew start reductions in excess of declining volumes for a third straight quarter. When coupled with the ongoing realignment of resources around our new operating model, we reduced operating expenses by $202 million in the first quarter when excluding the non-cash locomotive charge. Our team is committed to driving improvements across the network and significantly and consistently lowering our operating ratio. We are focused on the factors within our control and confident that by continuing to adjust and successfully execute our strategic plan, we are building a stronger, more resilient and a more profitable Norfolk Southern. I will now turn the call over to Alan and the team to begin detailing our first quarter results and our progress executing the strategic plan. Alan?\nAlan Shaw: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter started with the impact of low natural gas prices and mild weather on our coal franchise. In February, we saw the initial impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, impacting international intermodal volume. As COVID-19 evolved into a global pandemic, a majority of our markets experienced volume declines, with business levels further impacted by plummeting energy prices. In the face of this challenging environment, we are flexible and responsive to market changes and customer needs, adjusting our operating plan and resources where necessary. We remain focused on our long-term strategy with an emphasis on superior service to our customers and margin improvement, demonstrated by consistent growth in revenue per unit and revenue per revenue ton-mile over the last three years. Our service is the best in Norfolk Southern history, a testament to the commitment of our employees to respond to rapidly evolving customer requirements and deliver an exceptional service product, while producing structural and volumetric improvements to our cost. Moving to slide seven. The impacts of COVID-19, energy and excess truck capacity lowered our revenue by 8%, with the volume decline partially offset by RPU less fuel growth in all three business groups, marking our 13th consecutive quarter of delivering year-over-year RPU growth. Merchandised revenue was down 1%. As record RPU, partially offset a 5% volume decrease. Automotive car loads declined due to plant shutdowns late in the quarter in response to COVID-19. Steel volumes continued to be impacted by weak demand and frac sand faced pressure from low energy prices, while favorable spreads allowed increases in crude oil volumes. Intermodal revenue declined 9% driven by a loose truck market, lower demand and the early negative impacts of COVID-19 in our International Group. RPU gains propelled by our strong service product offset some of the impacts of the volume decline. Coal volumes and revenue were both down 31% year-over-year, driven by extremely low natural gas prices throughout the mild winter. Our export franchise also experienced slight volume losses due to low seaborne pricing. Moving to our outlook on slide eight. We continue to monitor the combination of COVID-19 pandemic and energy decline and the unprecedented impact on our markets. We project year-over-year volume declines across all business groups with large impacts in the second quarter and future volumes dependent upon the depth of the downturn and the timing of the reopening of the economy, as well as energy prices. We are partnering with our customers to affect necessary short-term adjustments that allow for quick and decisive reactions to market changes, remaining in close collaboration with our customers and economic allies that place their confidence in Norfolk Southern. The chart on slide eight classifies our markets by revenue and the sensitivity to both COVID-19 and energy. The agriculture, forest and consumer group includes among other markets, food products, which remain in high demand and ethanol, which will decline due to demand and energy prices. Lower consumer spending and disruptions in the supply chain will likely continue to impact automotive intermodal and other consumer-driven products. Intermodal will be further influenced by low oil prices and the associated competitive dynamics with truck. Shutdowns in automotive and other manufacturing will drive declines in the already soft steel market. Our crude market will be adversely impacted by low energy prices and decreased demand from COVID-19 disruptions. Natural gas prices and mild weather coupled with declining industrial and commercial load will negatively impact our utility market. Lastly, export coal will continue to be pressured by lower seaborne coal prices and COVID-19. We maintain strong customer relationships, built on a collaboration and constant communication, which facilitated our flawless implementation of PSR last year. We continue this approach as we adjust our network to conserve resources, while continuing to meet our customer\u2019s needs. The economic headwinds will significantly impact 2020 revenue. The strength of our franchise, our commitment, the collaboration, deep customer relationships and superior service product provide the foundation for success through this downturn and as economic conditions improve. Our portfolio ranches from the most powerful intermodal franchise in the east to broad participation in over 50% of the consumer, industrial and energy markets that drive the U.S. economy. We are leveraging our deep market knowledge to partner with our customers, innovate logistic solutions for evolving supply chain requirements, securing new opportunities in the near-term and for when markets normalize. I will now turn it over to Mike for an update on operations.\nMike Wheeler: Thank you, Alan. Today, I will update you on the state of our operations. The first quarter continued our story of superior service and improved cost structure, leading to increased operational leverage even in the face of declining volumes. We are continually improving our operating plan and using PSR principles to deliver superior execution. Going to slide 10. Continued improvements in train speed and terminal dwell despite tougher year-over-year comps drove record quarterly terminal dwell, train performance, customer service at the car load level and unprecedented executional success in the service sensitive intermodal segment. We achieved these milestones with fewer assets and lower employment levels, further reducing our cost structure and driving efficiency. These trends have continued into the second quarter. Moving onto our service and productivity metrics on slide 11, which I have shared with you in prior calls. These metrics measure important productivity and customer service levels and are indicators of our success meeting our productivity goals. The service delivery index measures our on-time performance at the shipment level and is indexed to 2018. Our first quarter 2020 performance is at our 2021 goal and we are confident we will maintain these service levels throughout the year. Our lowest T&E headcount on record drive substantial year-over-year productivity, while still providing stellar service. As I will show you on the next slide, we continue to aggressively size our train plan to the changing business levels. We continued our momentum of train weight improvements, showing further progress in the first quarter. Remember that we re-targeted this goal 6,700 tons in light of continued changes in the coal market. Productivity driven by our top 21 operating plan will boost us towards this goal, despite the challenges of the current volume environment. We made considerable progress in locomotive productivity in 2019 by rationalizing our fleet, a trend that continued in the first quarter of 2020. Our active locomotive fleet is almost 15% lower in 2020 than in the first quarter of 2019 and our recent locomotive disposition announcement reinforces our commitment to getting the most out of our fleet. We also thought it would be useful to show you our year-over-year progress in fuel efficiency. This is an area of focus for us and the improvements in gallons per ton-mile reflect the results of efforts on many fronts, including increased train weight, continued rationalization of the DC to AC upgrade of our locomotive fleet, increased use of energy management technology and completion of our full PTC footprint. Finally, even after we raised the bar on the Cars On-Line goal, we continue to beat our targets. First quarter results were measurably better than goal and we set a new record earlier this month. To be clear, this count includes cars in storage that can be brought out as business rebounds. Slide 12 shows our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerated reductions in crew starts. We are continuously improving our TOP21 plan and are now completing Phase 3 of the program. This will deliver the three phases of the program in 18 months, instead of the anticipated three years. The first quarter saw 19% fewer crew starts, showing increased leverage between crew starts and volume. After we complete Phase 3 of TOP21, we will continue to optimize the operating plan, in part by combining traffic of all types on single trains and reviewing our yard network for further rationalization. Before I shift to discussing Norfolk Southern\u2019s operational response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I want to emphasize our positive operational momentum. We are making progress long-term structural changes in our asset base, service levels and productivity drivers. We will continue to build on our progress from 2019, following PSR principles while proactively adapting our operating plan to the economic environment. Turning to slide 13. I am very proud of how Norfolk Southern\u2019s railroaders have dealt with both the threat and the business impact of the pandemic. We took early proactive measures to protect our workforce and make sure that being at work, continue to be the safest part of an NS employees day, because the railroad was very fluid and service levels were very high, we were able to quickly store surplus equipment, while also mobilize employees to provide extra manpower in hot zones like Northern New Jersey. We made special efforts to assist customers by expediting shipments of goods in short supply or that were urgently needed. All the while, we maintain service levels and the railroad has run even faster in April. As you can see on slide 14, the pandemic also mandated a proactive response to the drop in volume. Tactically, we very quickly over just a few days removed the blocks and trains carrying auto parts and finished vehicles from our TOP21 plan. Crew starts dropped almost as quickly as volume, enabling us to preserve leverage even as shipment count declined. We will again redesign the operating plan as auto volume rebounds, using our operating leverage to handle returning volumes in the most efficient way possible. While we do not yet know the shape of the recovery curve, we are taking this time of lower traffic as an opportunity to challenge ourselves and our capabilities to improve our TOP21 operating plan in the long-term. For example, we are successfully handling carload traffic on premium intermodal trains, lending previously separate service networks in a way that allows us to maintain service frequency and train size while reducing costs. In addition, we are taking hard looks at our yard and terminal network, testing what we can live without. I will now turn it over to Mark, who will cover the financials.\nMark George: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the review of adjusted financials, just a moment to talk about the locomotive write-down that we disclosed two weeks ago, simply said, it\u2019s a capacity dividend of our TOP21 PSR implementation, which has resulted in the decongestion of our yards and road network, allowing cars to turn quicker in the terminals and trains to move faster on the network. The blending of our discrete networks resulted in fewer but longer trains, fewer trains along with better balancing of our routes require fewer locomotives. We enter 2020 with roughly 1,000 locomotives on the sidelines, out of the approximate fleet of 3,900. We spent time this quarter aligning on exactly how many locomotives we would need even at 2018 volume levels. Our operations team essentially modeled the capacity requirements in a post PSR world and determined that of our stored locomotives 703 are deemed excess and available for sale, while the balance are held for surge and in cycle for AC upgrades. In fact, 298 of the 703 were effectively sold in Q1, while the remaining will be marketed for sale or scrapped in the next 12 months. The $385 million is essentially the remaining book value on those locomotives that otherwise would have been depreciated in the P&L in the years to come. In the process, the team targeted removal of the oldest, least reliable and least efficient of the locomotives and eliminated entire model lines, moving us to a more homogenous fleet of 10 models from \u201819. With that we were able to also eliminate inventory and rationalize mechanical resources. So moving now to slide 17 and the remaining slides will reflect adjusted results, excluding the impact from the locomotive rate down. Recall this slide format we introduced last quarter to show large and anomalous events that impact our results. There is just one item in the quarter worth calling out and that is a one-time benefit on an income tax refund related to the 2012 tax year. That provided $0.09 of EPS tailwind in the quarter and contributed to the 12.6% effective tax rate. No other meaningful adjustments in Q1 of 2019 or 2020, so the improvement in the operating ratio of 230 basis points was core. Now moving to the adjusted results on slide 18, a very strong operational quarter, as both Jim and Mike described earlier. Revenue was down 8% driven by an 11% volume contraction that was partially offset by the strong RPU improvement that Alan spoke to. Thanks to our effective yield-up strategy enabled by our enhanced customer service delivery. Operating expenses were 11% lower, almost mitigating the revenue decline in dollar terms and that resulted in the strong 230 basis point OR improvement, which follows the 240 basis point core OR improvement we showed in Q4, despite a softer environment during that time. And you see on the right, very strong free cash flow performance, a record $589 million, which is 42% greater than Q1 of last year. So now drilling into the operating expense categories on slide 19, we drove down compensation and benefits in the quarter, 14% year-over-year on a 19% reduction in employees versus Q1 of 2019. Employee count was down 6% sequentially from Q4. Our employment levels declined throughout the quarter and this along with lower costs associated with benefits, over time, re-crews and incentive compensation saved us $105 million. Fuel was down $61 million from a combination of lower prices, as well as lower consumption from both volume and also efficiency gains. Consumption declined 15% on a 10% decrease in GTMs, despite significant adverse commodity mix. Materials and other spending was down $24 million or 13% led by a $15 million reduction in materials. Gains on operating properties amounted to $11 million, which was lower than the $17 million recorded in Q1 of 2019. Purchased services and rents was down $21 million or 5% with purchase services alone down 7%. Rents were actually up 5% in the quarter due to lower equity income from the TTX joint venture that more than offset savings from lower rent spend. So when looking at the big picture, the underlying change to our cost structure continue to shine through in the first quarter, as we reduce and realigned resources around our new operating model. Moving to slide 20. Let\u2019s take a look at our summarized first quarter financial results below the income from operations line. Other income was down $22 million from lower investment returns on corporate-owned life insurance and a lower effective tax rate of 12.6% was driven by the refund I discussed earlier, as well as benefits from stock-based compensation. This first quarter low ETR will provide benefit to the full-year effective tax rate as we expect the remaining quarters to return to the guidance range of 23% to 24%. Moving now to slide 21, as mentioned, we generated a record Q1 free cash flow of $589 million. Thanks to expanding margins, but also from constraining our capital spend, which was $100 million less than last year. And we returned $708 million to shareholders in the quarter, with a solid dividend bolstered by our continued share repurchase activity. Now let\u2019s talk outlook on slide 22. Obviously, the economic environment has progressively worsened here in Q2 and while we can\u2019t be certain of the severity and duration of the downturn in 2020, we do know that revenue will be much lower than we thought at the beginning of the year. So we pulled our guidance for flat revenue for 2020, as well as the guidance for OR improvement. We are modeling a number of revenue scenarios, so that we are positioned to respond as a scenario starts to play out. We are focused on what we can control, service and costs. We feel that with modest revenue contractions, we can manage to match it with cost takeout. With steep revenue declines, you just can\u2019t keep up with certainly not in the short-term. To help you in your modeling and for illustrative purposes, you see the P&L cost categories that provide a general sense, how they correlated the volume changes. Most categories have an element of cost that is directly tied to volume, and on a mostly immediate basis, fuel being the most obvious, but there are also structural components that take longer to move, as well as great areas that are also subject to volume, but pretty dependent on management decisions that are influenced by the expected duration of the downturn and the anticipated pace of recovery. We never want to cut in a way where we can handle volume when a recovery occurs, which would then adversely impact customer service. And we absolutely won\u2019t compromise on network safety. In aggregate, roughly 50% to 60% of our costs could be categorized as volume variable and semi-variable. The balance is structural cost and there is a reason I refer to this category as structural instead of fixed which kind of its permanent. We have been and continue to work on structural cost trying to eliminate not just variabilize them and we are looking at all structural buckets including even the biggest one depreciation, a category that many would consider truly fixed. We have to look at how we can keep this bar from getting fatter and certainly adding fewer assets over time helps, but there are even unique opportunities to make it skinnier. Our recent locomotive action for example will generate roughly $25 million of annual depreciation savings going forward, so all structural cost is under constant review by this committed leadership team that\u2019s dedicated to evaluating all opportunities. So while our deep revenue decline may put short-term pressure on the OR, I have every confidence that when we are on the other side of this market dislocation, we will be coiled up with great operating leverage to deliver significant OR improvement. Let me wrap up on slide 23. Given the steep drop in the markets and the lack of clarity on the slope of recovery, it\u2019s important to share with you a bit about our financial standing. On top of significant expansion of free cash flow generation, we also maintain a solid balance sheet with good debt capacity and robust access to credit markets. We have relatively light levels of debt maturities in the next two years. More importantly, we have already significantly dial-back on our capital spend budget for 2020, recognizing the challenging environment that we are entering. Property additions will be limited to roughly $1.5 billion this year, regardless of revenue, which is a reduction from our 2019 spending levels by $500 million or 25%. If the right thing to do, it would be the lowest level of spend in absolute dollars since 2010, while not jeopardizing the safety, service or near-term revenue opportunities. So we feel real good about our liquidity and our ability to weather this storm. Thank you and I will turn the call back over to, Jim.\nJim Squires: Thank you, Mark. There is much for us to be proud of in our report today, from our strong first quarter financial performance to the incredible job the men and women of Norfolk Southern are doing to keep the trains running. Our industry faces a difficult volume environment with an uncertain trajectory. By executing our strategic plan, exercising capital discipline and serving our customers well, Norfolk Southern is poised to emerge stronger and ready for growth as the economy recovers. Thank you for your attention and we will now open the line for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Jason Seidl of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, Operator. Gentlemen, good morning. I hope everyone is doing well. I wanted to jump on the outlook question. I think one of you mentioned sort of not cutting too much into the system, not only for safety but to handle the rebound whenever it does come. How much in expenses do you think you are holding in anticipation of that? Let\u2019s say, if you look at the automotive sector, for example, plants being shutdown, how much more expenses is Norfolk sort of maintaining right now and how do you think about forecasting some of these areas for head count or equipment demand?\nJim Squires: Good morning, Jason. It\u2019s, Jim. We are committed to managing our volume variable and structural cost through this downturn. So you saw evidence of that in the first quarter with adjusted expense reductions totaling $202 million. We are pulling every lever at our disposal when it comes to cost reductions in this environment and that\u2019s the right thing to do given the trend in the revenue this year. Nevertheless, we do believe we are capable of responding to the upturn, which will come as volume growth resumes. We expect to generate significant operating leverage and that will result in rapid margin improvement and bottomline growth.\nJason Seidl: And right now, how are you guys looking at the anticipated rebound, because clearly, we are going to see 2Q that\u2019s going to take a big step down, right, even from the weakness in 1Q? But what is Norfolk looking for in terms of a gradual recovery and how should we think about headcount throughout the system as we move throughout the quarters?\nJim Squires: Well, growth will resume and when it does, as I said. We will have the resources in place and we expect to generate significant operating leverage. Let me talk a little bit further about kind of next steps in terms of cost reductions, and I will ask Alan to comment on the topline outlook. So we are pressing the TOP21 accelerator right now. And that, as Mike said, that means crew start reductions going forward, a hard look at our yard and facilities network, blending more trains, the kind of step straight out of the PSR playbook to continue to drive down costs. So, Alan, what about the revenue outlook?\nAlan Shaw: Hey. Good morning, Jason. We are staying very tight with our customers and modulating our expenses appropriately because we are going to make sure that we are there as they start to recover. The first step would be say reopening within auto manufacturing and that\u2019s generally targeted to start slowly, in the middle of May, that should pull some additional raw materials through the pipeline as well say steel for example and some plastics. And then, as I noted on Slide 8, it really is about just the reopening of the economy and improvement in energy prices. Resolution of that is open-ended and so it remains critical for us to stay close and tight with our customers as we plan going forward.\nOperator: The next question is from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAllison Landry: Good morning. Thank you. So, good progress on the OR improvement in the first quarter. So, I know you withdrew the 2020 guidance expect some near-term margin pressure, but I don\u2019t think I heard you comment on the 2021 OR guidance, so is this intact and do you think a 60 is still achievable?\nJim Squires: We did not pull our guidance for 60 in 2021 and we are still focused on getting to a 60 OR as fast as we can. The timing and shape of the recovery will likely have an impact for sure. But one thing is for certain, as I said, we get to the other side of this and growth resumes, our operating leverage would be very powerful and should drive rapid OR improvement in bottomline growth.\nAllison Landry: Okay. And then -- and just sort of in light of the collapse in volumes, are you seeing any increased resistance from customers with respect to the yield-up strategy. I think we have heard from a number of shippers that said they are being asked for monthly volume commitments and liquidated damages and exchange for one-year contracts. So just hoping to get your thoughts on whether this is leading to some share losses to truck and if you are considering any changes to the pricing strategy, in order to keep more volume on the network? Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Allison, there are lot of unknowns in the market space right now. Our critical role in the nation\u2019s economy and our customer supply chains is clearly evident right now, that is not an unknown. We are pricing the value of our product, we are pricing of the value of our franchise and we are very confident in our understanding of the market. We are maintaining a long-term view of this and we are maintaining a long-term view of our business decisions to benefit our shareholders. We understand that eventually we are going to cycle through this market and we have got a great franchise and a great approach to support our customers\u2019 growth when that occurs.\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, I want to ask a few things on the cost side, maybe just starting with labor comp per employee was up 6% sequentially -- 6%, sorry, 6% year-over-year. Any thoughts on how we should be thinking about comp per employee going forward and then any thoughts on where -- what you are doing with head count right now, given the volume environment?\nJim Squires: Mark?\nMark George: Yes. Scott, you are right, the comp per employee did move 6% sequentially. But remember, these are quarter-to-quarter in particular is very lumpy. And you are always going to have some noise on the timing of when you have incentive accrual top-ups or write-back. So I think you are got to look at it more over time and when you look at it over time, you are always going to be fighting inflation, wage inflation. So, that\u2019s certainly something that we are dealing with every year. And but generally, we are really shifting our focus to the absolute comp and win numbers, which as you know, have gone down and continued to decline in part from the volume, but in particular from the PSR actions that we have taken.\nScott Group: I guess I am not sure I followed. So, like, so, as we think about going forward, I guess, was there anything unusual in this first quarter on the comp per employee or should we assume like that this level continues going forward, meaning, certainly\u2026\nMark George: Well, look\u2026\nScott Group: Meaning in the fourth -- in the first quarter you had headcount down 6% sequentially, but I think labor costs, total labor costs to your point were only down 1% or 2% sequentially?\nMark George: You had some incentive accrual disparities between quarters. So that\u2019s one thing, where in Q4 you had -- based on the way the year ended, you ended up having a benefit or a pickup from writing back some of the incentive accruals. So that certainly dropped the Q4 number and creates a little bit of a tougher compared sequentially. I think from here, you will see that it\u2019s going to be more even throughout the year.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Ossenbeck of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Mark, can you go back to the locomotive side and maybe just walk us through the potential benefits, some that you may be recognized or whether you called out like the depreciation? And then, secondly, out the different components on the labor side, maybe even further on the D&A side, on the efficiency side for fuel and just how do you think about what this has done for Norfolk so far and what it could represent in the future, your call this year and next year as it rolls out completely.\nMark George: Sure. I mean, we talk a little bit about the locomotives, first. And again we took out 250 locomotives last year as we launch the TOP21 strategic plan and mainly those were on the sideline, but they were with a lot of other locomotives that we had on the sideline. We knew that every quarter throughout this year, we were probably going to see, we were going to convince ourselves that we were going to have more and more surplus locomotives. So rather than leak it out over time, we really held hands as an organization and said, look, we have got very good progress here on liberating assets in the field. Where can we be in a post-PSR world with regard to locomotive needs? And there were several iterations, I think, the PSR experts that we have in-house, really pushed the envelope and said, look, we know where we can get to. So, we had a 1,000 when we started the year on the sideline, the numbers initially started with 400, maybe 450, the team iterated several times and ultimately got back to a number of 703, where we said that is absolutely doable, even if we go back to 2018 volume levels, we can still manage with the remaining fleet. So we decided, rather than just leak this out over time to take a look at it, it was clearly a significant portion of the -- of that particular asset base. So we decided the right thing to do, the appropriate thing to do is actually pull it out of group accounting and write it off. The benefit of doing that, first off is, we get the organization focused on removing assets and I think that\u2019s a very important thing for any company when you have surplus assets is to eradicate them, because assets attract cost. You got yard congestion in our case. You have got network congestion by parking all these excess locomotives, let\u2019s commit to get rid of them quickly, and then they will attract less cost, less maintenance and less attention and less property tax whatever you can assign to it will end up being savings. So it\u2019s healthier just to get to recognize what surplus upfront and move as quick as possible to remove them from the company\u2019s properties. And then by removing them from group accounting, you also now have taken that $385 million asset and you avoid depreciating it over many years and absorbing it into your remaining assets, it seems like it\u2019s a very unusual form of accounting that\u2019s relatively unique to our industry, where you have group accounting attaching excess book value from discarded assets to remaining assets and depreciating further over time. So we avoid doing that, we get rid of it, we get depreciation benefit in the future. So that\u2019s really how this came about.\nScott Group: Okay. Can you offer any commentary on this, what that means for maintenance or mechanical resources, fuel economy going from -- to a more homogenous fleet in anything beyond the D&A that you are looking to realize in the next couple of quarters or into \u201821?\nMark George: Yes. Clearly, they attract less maintenance and part of that $385 million was a little bit of inventory that went for the model lines that are no longer here, the seven model lines we eliminated. So that\u2019s another trailing benefit that we have. And but, yes, clearly, we are going to have some mechanical benefit from this, savings that arise from having fewer locomotives and a more streamlined fleet model. Maybe, Mike, you want to make some comments.\nMike Wheeler: Yeah. I mean, it helps your whole material network, because you are managing less, less materials with less models. A lot of these models were smaller type models and so that helped to be efficient. And it\u2019s also going to help our sharp footprint going forward as we continue to rationalize that, you have heard some of the things we are doing there and those are coming to fruition now and those will help that as well. So, yeah, there\u2019s a lot of ancillary benefits to this going forward.\nMark George: And remember, Brian, we got rid of 300 of those already in Q1. So the physical assets have been removed and there is just the remaining 400 now, that over the next 12 months, hopefully in the next 9 months or so we will follow.\nOperator: The next question is from David Ross of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Ross: Yeah. Good morning, gentlemen. I wanted to talk a little bit about Phase 3 of TOP21. We mentioned combining the cars of all different types onto a single train. Where are you in that process, has that been done yet, what\u2019s left and how might mix in the second quarters, you are doing this, I would say not look normal depending on the restart of the economy in which commodity types come back online and is that going to create any issues at completing Phase 3?\nJim Squires: Well, Mike went through the steps that we have taken under TOP21 and essentially we have completed all of the network redesign to this point that we had mapped out through 2021. So all phases of TOP21 that we had initially signaled we would implement, we have implemented at this point. Going forward, our focus, as we have said is on additional crew start reductions, blending more trains and a hard look at the facilities we use, the yards we use to support network operations. Mike, anything to add?\nMike Wheeler: Yeah. We have been talking with you on all the quarters about our blending of our network. We first started talking about blending bulk into the general merchandise and we did that. And then we started blending the automotive into the general merchandise as well and that was a big part of TOP21 last year, very successful. And as we have continued on, we have blended general merchandise and bulk into the intermodal network that\u2019s been very successful. And then, now we are in the process of blending traffic even into our premium network. So we have really blended all of the different traffic types into our network. So we are to the point now where a train is a train. So our Phase 3 implementation is really in place. And the beauty of this, as you go forward and traffic comes back, we are blended now that a train is a train, and it can ride on a train that gives us the right service requirement that it needs, but also as efficient as it can be. So we are really in a good place with our network with the TOP21 implementation, and going forward, we are just going to continue to optimize the network as traffic comes back on.\nMark George: And David, if I could add one thing, it also benefits us and our customers and that it provides us with a broader product offering, and no longer do we need to find enough density for a point to point intermodal train. We could find smaller blocks of intermodal and put it on a merchandise train and open up some lanes, which we are doing.\nDavid Ross: That\u2019s great color. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Hi. I just wanted to follow up a bit on the price for the yield question a bit, obviously, volumes have been impacted pretty heavily hearing thus far, as you said, I think, you mentioned down about 30%, which is trailing the industry for some degree. I am just curious -- at the same time, your yields are tending to be better, so I am just curious, some of the volume discrepancy maybe related to that or how do you deal with price for yield in the face of these steep declines going forward? Thanks.\nJim Squires: Jordan, at Norfolk Southern, we are fierce competitors and we are determined to make decisions in the long-term, best interest of our shareholders. We have got a deep knowledge of our markets and we are confident in our ability to price to the value of our service product, which is outstanding and our franchise, with a focus on margin improvement and also providing our customers with a platform for growth and you can see this in our RPU, in revenue-to-revenue ton-mile trends over the last three years, it\u2019s a consistent and a strategic approach for us. There are some specific market forces that are impacting our volumes. Last year, 60% of our coal volume was in the utility coal network. That volume was down 44% in the first quarter of this year. We participate in the energy markets, whether that\u2019s frac sand or ethanol and those have been pressured. They have been pressured for much as a year, as I called out. And separately, we also are highly integrated with customers who are the integrated steel mills, so that has taken a hit throughout the year. One thing to point out is, we are running against our toughest year-over-year comps of the year. I believe week 20 of last year, so mid-May was our highest volume week of the year. So that\u2019s causing part of the volume decline year-over-year. But we also understand and it\u2019s important to note that our opportunities are within that $800 billion plus truck and logistics market. We have got the most powerful intermodal franchise in the east, and as you know, we are aligned with the best channel partners in the industry. We have got a diverse merchandise network with a great service product. We are staying very close to our customers and we are collaborating with them right now, near-term opportunities as they adjust the supply chain dislocations and on longer term opportunity. So we are confident about where we are headed.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Alan, I guess, if we could just follow-up there though, I mean, in an environment coming out of post-COVID. Are you talking with your customers right now about what\u2019s going to take for a recovery and get them back up to prior volume levels and does that include changes in service patterns or pricing or I guess what\u2019s the path forward once we get beyond the shutdowns here?\nMike Wheeler: Yeah. Brandon, I think, you are going to see some differences in supply chain requirements moving forward. There is going to be potentially more forward positioning. There is going to be more an emphasis on reliability and consistency. And frankly, that benefits Norfolk Southern, because we have got the best intermodal franchise in the East. When the recovery happens, people are going to be focused on capacity, cost, service and ESG and Norfolk Southern offers all of that relative to our primary form of competition, which is truck. So we touch over 50% of the consumption and the manufacturing in the economy. We are staying close to our customers. Even now we are launching innovative service products. So we are pretty confident about where things are headed once the economy re-opens.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. I appreciate that. And then, maybe follow up for Mark or Jim, you guys did say that some of your cost variability is dependent service product expectations. And Jim that was pretty bullish that you are not backing off of the 2021 OR target. So, I guess, are you putting a cost structure in place where you see line of sight to achieving that type of operating ratio at some sort of volume level in the future?\nJim Squires: Well, the question is not if, but when we get to a 60 operating ratio. That remains our goal. We are going to get there as quickly as we can. And yes, that will be through a leaner cost structure, with the kinds of cost structural initiatives that we have been through this morning. And so, yes, that\u2019s very much part of the outlook and we believe we will have strong operating leverage when growth resumes, which it will.\nBrandon Oglenski: All right. Thank you, Jim.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nBascome Majors: Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Mark, most of the class ones have pulled their guidance like you did today, but several have continue to provide investors with some sort of framework to think about kind of a worst case, free cash flow scenario in their own stress tests of the business. How should we think about free cash flow for Norfolk this year?\nMark George: Thanks, Bascome. So we have modeled a number of different scenarios and we haven\u2019t picked one, because we know whatever one we pick will be wrong. But we have modeled high single-digit declines to mid-upper teen declines on revenue and volumes to \u201820s and \u201830s. And in all those circumstances and cases, you are going to see that we have modeled free positive cash flow contribution, we are going to grow cash flow this year regardless. But one thing we are doing is to preserve cash, you would have noticed, we have really taken a significant chunk out of capital expenditures this year to make sure that we maintain the proper balance and we augment our liquidity and certainly what is going to be an uncertain time, because we don\u2019t know how deep this will go and how long it will last before recovery begins again. So in pretty much all the scenarios we have modeled we are still generating positive cash flow and positive free cash flow and we feel actually very good about our whole liquidity equation as well as you can see from the slide I shared. We have got plenty of plenty of vehicles to go for credit, if we needed, and again, the capital reduction is also very, very meaningful to us as well as frankly, a very strong cash balance opportunity.\nBascome Majors: Thank you. Thank you for walking us through that. I am sorry, so on the January call, maybe take that a step further to the structural discussion, you said one of the biggest surprises coming into this industry from the outside was the capital intensity of the business and that was going to be a priority for you to take a hard look at that as the CFO. I mean, so you have been going through these this process of broader structural cost reductions, any update you could have on some opportunities you think where you could kind of change that equation longer term within that?\nMark George: Yeah. I mean, I think, you see a little bit of evidence of that here with the capital reduction that we have done very early in the year. You don\u2019t cut $500 million or 25% out of your annual capital spend easily. So we really got together as a team and similar to the whole locomotive discussion, I just went through, we iterated several times on what we could do to reduce capital spend and get to a new baseline level. For which to be honest, we are at -- this is a low level, we haven\u2019t been here since 2010 in absolute dollars. But we felt it was the right thing to do because we sense that there was going to be volume pressure, sure enough, it\u2019s come and it\u2019s, it\u2019s real in front of us, so I am glad we have gone through this exercise. From here though as revenue grows, I would hope that we are able to contain growth in CapEx at a more moderate pace below the pace of revenue growth in the future and maybe grow into a lower percentage of revenue below the 16 to 18 at some point. So that\u2019s one thing that I think the organization is very keen on and then the second frankly is what we talked about with regard to the locomotive rationalization itself. We took a long hard look at the assets and in that particular pool, and frankly, we are going to shift over and now look at other pools of assets we have as well and make sure, one of the perils of group depreciation is that you are not necessarily motivated or incentivized to be looking at the assets once they are on the books. In this case, I think we have to look at that, because they do attract cost. Do we have a lot of buildings out there along the network that maybe we don\u2019t need any more, structures that again attract maintenance cost, they attract electricity costs, they attract property assessments, those are like one area we might look at, we have seen our coal franchise shrinks considerably. Do we have surplus assets in coal that we need to re-examine and re-look at. So we are asking these questions as a team, the team is open-minded about it, and I think, again, you see in the first quarter some evidence of that.\nOperator: The next question is from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on the discussion about the incremental margins when volumes do come back. You have a pretty illustrative cost structure slide on slide 22 of your deck. It\u2019s really helpful, which shows that you have a pretty variable or semi-variable cost structure, which should help you on the way down. But, I mean, how does that not become an impediment to incremental margins on the way back up again, given that we just by very nature if it\u2019s more variable, a lot of those cost need to come back?\nJim Squires: Well, we do expect to be able to hold the line on many of the costs within our cost structure, as volumes return and there lies the operating leverage in the model. Now, certainly, we will have some volumetric expense increases with volume on the way up as is the case on the way down. But the key will be to hold the line in terms of additions to the asset and resource base as much as we possibly can. We know we can do that and ride that wave of volume upsurge, which should generate rapid and significant operating ratio improvement and bottomline growth.\nRavi Shanker: Okay. And as a follow-up, how would you characterize the competitive environment in the east, I mean, obviously, we know what\u2019s happened in the truck side, but just more with your rail competitor?\nMike Wheeler: Yeah. Trucks are very competitive right now. Those are the opportunities for us that is supported by our -- strength of our franchise and those are the service products that we are developing right now is to help our customers and as they deal with changes in their supply chain and we are working on near-term solutions and long-term solutions. I have noted we got wonderful merchandise franchise with broad exposure to the U.S. economy. We have got a great intermodal franchise, the best in the east and we have got an outstanding service product. And just within intermodal, you can go back three years, go back four years, you go back five years and you can see that Norfolk Southern and our customers have paced the growth in the entire industry during that time period. You can go all the way back to recovery from the great recession in 2010. So it\u2019s -- as I have talked about before, we are making decisions in the long-term best interest of our shareholders. That includes our market approach and our willingness to partner with our customers to support their growth over the long-term.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Hey. Good morning. And great job in the -- on the cost side and the locomotive move. Mike or Jim, just an interesting move in shutting the yards and some of the other steps you are taking during this volume downturn. Maybe can you talk a bit about what move you could see becoming more permanent, are there some examples that you can talk to. I know you talked a little bit about the blending of the trains, but just want to understand as the business comes back, what are the steps that you are taking, you see, could be a bit more permanent?\nMike Wheeler: Yeah. Sure. Thank you. As you have noted, we have been looking at our term loan yards for long-term since a great recession, we have either idled or converted five of our top terminals, we did two of them last year and we are continuing to look at that and those are long-term structural cost reductions and you will see more of that as we go forward. I would also note that we have talked about we have shutdown a lot of our smaller outline yards, brought that traffic in and consolidated it. And as Mark noted, those are assets over time that will go away and take less cost. But we continue to look at it and find out what we can live without and we have got a lot of opportunities out there that we are looking at, more to come and you will hear more about it as we go forward. But yeah, those are things we are looking at and are going to do.\nKen Hoexter: Okay. Alan, maybe just, I appreciate your competitive comment before when you were talking about the competitive market. But just looking at coal being down 60% this past week and really taken a beating lately. How do you plan for this, are you looking at the business structurally disappearing, is it something that\u2019s just a mild winter and you expect it to come back as the export and domestic markets come back, maybe just talk about your views on that market a bit?\nAlan Shaw: Ken, we understand that our utility coal or the nations utility coal franchise is in a secular decline. And so what you see from us is, a response and working with our customers on ways to promote coal dispatch relative to natural gas, but also we are adjusting our franchise as well. You saw that and so with short line activities, you saw that idled of Ashtabula just this quarter you saw in the sale of our Pocahontas Land Corporation assets. Stockpiles in the utility coal franchise right now are incredibly high. They are at about 125 days. Coal burn in March was at a new national record low at 29 million tons. And so, I think, coal is -- our utility coal franchise is going to be pressured for a considerable amount of time. We need to get the economy back running. So industrial and commercial load comes back and we are also going to need to see an overall increase in energy prices, prices in the PJM are in the teens right now for electricity and that is not going to promote coal burn.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey. Great. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe, Mark, if you could drill in a little bit more specific around some of the CapEx comments, I think when you outlined or when the company outlined the plan, the PSR plan locomotives were kind of decent size chunk of the 16% to 18% CapEx spend over time. I think it seems like some of the actions you guys have taken recently have the potential to really rationalize that, even just obviously this year, but potentially in 2021 and 2022. Is that the right way to think about it or could there be other puts and takes that might drive that number back up into that sort of longer term rate. Just want to make sure I understand that this is sort of a spin that that likely is going to come down relative to maybe what you thought it was a year and a half ago or so?\nMark George: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Chris. I am going to tag team this with, Mike. But the reduction in the CapEx is really little bit across the board, not so much on the locomotives, but in other areas, whether it\u2019s IT, a little bit of our maintenance, we have really taken a look at all the various categories and try to bring it down a notch even some of the terminal spends, especially given the volume pressures that we have. So it really went across the board and we know though, like I mentioned earlier, we are going to have pressure to raise from here. But I want, Mike, maybe you can talk a little bit about locomotives and cat 1 versus cat 1 on the ops stuff.\nMike Wheeler: Sure. Yeah. On the locomotive DC to AC conversions, we are committed to that revitalization, because we have got some DC locomotives out there that upgrading to the AC is really cost efficient from a capital standpoint and been really pleased with the reliability from this. So that project will continue on going forward over the next couple of years, it\u2019s the right thing to do and what we did push out, we had taken some opportunistic additional DC to AC conversions that we were looking at this year, we are pushing those out, we are not going to do those. Some rebuild of our yard and local fleet we have pushed out. So the DC to AC conversions will continue at the pace that we have talked about in the past. Relative to the capital expenditures, we are very fortunate that we have got some great technology in our company, particularly on the engineering side. We are making sure that we are putting our rails, ties and ballast in the right locations. We have got technology these days that are they are using machine vision to determine whether ties are good or not. They are even doing X rays internally. So we are making sure that when we put ties in, we will put them in the right place at the right time, same thing with rail where we are using predictive analytics to determine where the rail needs to be replaced at and that\u2019s allowing us to really pinpoint our asset replacements. And we are really comfortable with the fact that we are doing the right thing for maintaining this railroad in a long-term, both on the locomotive reliability front, as well as the track infrastructure.\nChris Wetherbee: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate the color. And then maybe a quick follow-up, Alan, would you think about the truckload market. I think there is a building sense that coming through this downturn when volume comes back, we could be coming into a somewhat tighter truckload market than what we sort of exited. So can you talk about sort of how that kind of plays into the strategy on the intermodal side and what the opportunities might be there for you?\nAlan Shaw: Yeah. Chris, it\u2019s that\u2019s very similar to what you saw in 2009 and 2010, isn\u2019t it, where you saw some pretty considerable supply reactions on the truckload side to a steep downturn and spot prices. And so for us it means continuing to collaborate with our best-in-class supply chain partners, our channel partners on how we give them an exceptional service product, how we look for new opportunities, new lanes for them to grow into and then it\u2019s also selling the things that are going to be pretty darn valuable post-COVID-19, which is capacity, a lower cost structure than truck, its service and its ESG and we have got the best intermodal franchise in the east. So we are in great shape there.\nChris Wetherbee: Got it. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from Justin Long of Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. Maybe to follow-up on that last question, regarding domestic intermodal, obviously, one thing that\u2019s changed is the fall off in fuel prices. So I was wondering if you could comment on the gap in pricing between contractual intermodal pricing and contractual truckload pricing in your network today. And as you think about domestic intermodal going forward, do you feel that it is still a GDP plus growth business, whenever things recover even if fuel prices hang out around the current levels?\nMike Wheeler: Hey, Justin. The gap has certainly closed. The real pressure is coming from that spot truck market. And at some point, as the economy starts to improve and as there are supply of ramifications throughout the truckload market, that\u2019s going to particularly affect the spot market. So it\u2019s important for us to maintain that vision as we are approaching the market and not chase the spot truck. You have heard me talk about that before. That\u2019s not within the long-term best interests of our corporation. So we are focused on what we can deliver and that is a great service product, a great, intermodal franchise that has allowed our customers to outpace the industry and growth over any number of years.\nJustin Long: Okay. And maybe looking bigger picture at the volume performance of the business, obviously, it\u2019s weak across the Board right now, but there is a pretty substantial difference in the year-to-date volumes at in as procedure eastern competitor. I am curious if you could just comment on that gap, if there have been any major market share losses this year that are driving that is, it\u2019s a function of mix? And as you look at that gap, how should we be thinking about the actions you are taking to close that gap and the timing around that going forward? Thank you.\nMike Wheeler: So, Justin, it\u2019s one of the things that I had talked about is, the utility coal franchise, which is last year was 60% of our volume utility -- of our coal volume in the first quarter is down 44%. So that\u2019s having an impact on us. The ethanol markets whether that\u2019s inbound, feedstocks such as corn or outbound ethanol is having an impact on us. Frac sand, we have talked about the energy impact integrated steel mills is having an impact on our franchise. And frankly, the spot trucking market is having an impact on intermodal and we saw an impact on international intermodal in Asia business in February and so all of that contributes to tougher year-over-year comps, as I noted. We are still riding or comparing against pretty elevated volumes of last year. We will get through that in week 20, in which our volumes were at the highest level of last year. And just overall, we understand the markets and we are pretty confident in our knowledge of the markets and we are very confident in our ability to price, to the value of our product and the value of our franchise and make the best long-term decisions for our shareholders and you see that an RPU and revenue per revenue ton-mile trends not just this quarter but over the last three plus years.\nJustin Long: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: The next question is from Jon Chappell of Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question for you, it\u2019s been a lot of time on the CapEx changes. Any comment on capital returns, should we assume that given bit more of a disciplined manner in CapEx that you keep pressing the pause button on the buyback program and give us a little bit more clarity on coming out of this?\nMark George: Yeah. Thank you, John. Certainly, we were -- we continued full steam in Q1 on the share repurchase activity. Now, obviously, as we do see the markets are contracting significantly, we are going to take a more conservative approach to looking at share repurchase, while maintaining flexibility for when depending on the depth of decline but also the pace of recovery. So, I think, we will certainly take a more muted approach here.\nJon Chappell: Okay. Thank you. And then, follow-up from Michael really quickly, you guys talked about the locomotive plan and a lot of the service metrics that have been taken. But -- and you look at the PSR implementation from say May 1st relative to where you were sitting on February 1st. What are some of the other adaptations you have made to the plan for 2020 given the precipitous fall on volume?\nMike Wheeler: Well, I think, the thing that it is beneficial for us is that, that we are able to adapt quickly, right? As volumes come out, we have been able to take the -- take the -- our crew starts out, you saw that in my slide, I will note that in April so far, we have pretty much matched the volume decline against with the crew start decline that\u2019s around 30%, so which matched it pretty well. So the thing that we have come out of this with is a really nimble organization that can adapt quickly to volume changes. Well, that\u2019s on the downside, like, we have shown or on the upside when it occurs and we are going to get a lot of leverage when that happens because of it.\nJon Chappell: Thank you, Michael. Thanks, Mark.\nMike Wheeler: Thank you.\nOperator: The last question comes from Thomas Wadewitz of UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nThomas Wadewitz: Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to follow up a little bit on train starts and leverage, maybe if I can refer Mike to your slide, I think, it\u2019s slide 11. So, you are improving on all the metric that gets the weight expansion or probably moving with train length has been more muted, obviously, a function of tough volume backdrop. So how do you think about coming out the other side what the ratio might be or how rapidly you might need to bring back train starts or is there a period of a couple of quarters where you just really see that metric expand a lot and you don\u2019t have to add train starts back used to run longer trains?\nAlan Shaw: It really will depend on and where the traffic comes back and what type of traffic it is, obviously, if it\u2019s full both you are going to get more of an incremental train starts. But if it\u2019s just across the Board, we have got capacity still in our train lengths to add train lengths before we have to do a lot of train starts. We have got capacity in the terminals as well with both the road crews, the local service crews and the yard crews to handle the capacity. So, we have got a while before we have to make train start deduct or increases. So we are still going to continue to get the upside leverage as this things pulls up, it\u2019s in a great place.\nThomas Wadewitz: But you think there could be we win volumes, I mean, obviously, just looking out to the other side, but you think you could actually run without adding trains for a while, where you see positive volumes?\nAlan Shaw: Correct. Yes. We know where the traffic comes from and that\u2019s our plan. That\u2019s our plan. That\u2019s our goal and that\u2019s the ability of this organization to do that.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Squires for closing comments.\nJim Squires: Thank you for your questions this morning. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Stay safe everyone. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alan Shaw",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter started with the impact of low natural gas prices and mild weather on our coal franchise. In February, we saw the initial impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, impacting international intermodal volume. As COVID-19 evolved into a global pandemic, a majority of our markets experienced volume declines, with business levels further impacted by plummeting energy prices. In the face of this challenging environment, we are flexible and responsive to market changes and customer needs, adjusting our operating plan and resources where necessary. We remain focused on our long-term strategy with an emphasis on superior service to our customers and margin improvement, demonstrated by consistent growth in revenue per unit and revenue per revenue ton-mile over the last three years. Our service is the best in Norfolk Southern history, a testament to the commitment of our employees to respond to rapidly evolving customer requirements and deliver an exceptional service product, while producing structural and volumetric improvements to our cost. Moving to slide seven. The impacts of COVID-19, energy and excess truck capacity lowered our revenue by 8%, with the volume decline partially offset by RPU less fuel growth in all three business groups, marking our 13th consecutive quarter of delivering year-over-year RPU growth. Merchandised revenue was down 1%. As record RPU, partially offset a 5% volume decrease. Automotive car loads declined due to plant shutdowns late in the quarter in response to COVID-19. Steel volumes continued to be impacted by weak demand and frac sand faced pressure from low energy prices, while favorable spreads allowed increases in crude oil volumes. Intermodal revenue declined 9% driven by a loose truck market, lower demand and the early negative impacts of COVID-19 in our International Group. RPU gains propelled by our strong service product offset some of the impacts of the volume decline. Coal volumes and revenue were both down 31% year-over-year, driven by extremely low natural gas prices throughout the mild winter. Our export franchise also experienced slight volume losses due to low seaborne pricing. Moving to our outlook on slide eight. We continue to monitor the combination of COVID-19 pandemic and energy decline and the unprecedented impact on our markets. We project year-over-year volume declines across all business groups with large impacts in the second quarter and future volumes dependent upon the depth of the downturn and the timing of the reopening of the economy, as well as energy prices. We are partnering with our customers to affect necessary short-term adjustments that allow for quick and decisive reactions to market changes, remaining in close collaboration with our customers and economic allies that place their confidence in Norfolk Southern. The chart on slide eight classifies our markets by revenue and the sensitivity to both COVID-19 and energy. The agriculture, forest and consumer group includes among other markets, food products, which remain in high demand and ethanol, which will decline due to demand and energy prices. Lower consumer spending and disruptions in the supply chain will likely continue to impact automotive intermodal and other consumer-driven products. Intermodal will be further influenced by low oil prices and the associated competitive dynamics with truck. Shutdowns in automotive and other manufacturing will drive declines in the already soft steel market. Our crude market will be adversely impacted by low energy prices and decreased demand from COVID-19 disruptions. Natural gas prices and mild weather coupled with declining industrial and commercial load will negatively impact our utility market. Lastly, export coal will continue to be pressured by lower seaborne coal prices and COVID-19. We maintain strong customer relationships, built on a collaboration and constant communication, which facilitated our flawless implementation of PSR last year. We continue this approach as we adjust our network to conserve resources, while continuing to meet our customer's needs. The economic headwinds will significantly impact 2020 revenue. The strength of our franchise, our commitment, the collaboration, deep customer relationships and superior service product provide the foundation for success through this downturn and as economic conditions improve. Our portfolio ranches from the most powerful intermodal franchise in the east to broad participation in over 50% of the consumer, industrial and energy markets that drive the U.S. economy. We are leveraging our deep market knowledge to partner with our customers, innovate logistic solutions for evolving supply chain requirements, securing new opportunities in the near-term and for when markets normalize. I will now turn it over to Mike for an update on operations. Hey. Good morning, Jason. We are staying very tight with our customers and modulating our expenses appropriately because we are going to make sure that we are there as they start to recover. The first step would be say reopening within auto manufacturing and that's generally targeted to start slowly, in the middle of May, that should pull some additional raw materials through the pipeline as well say steel for example and some plastics. And then, as I noted on Slide 8, it really is about just the reopening of the economy and improvement in energy prices. Resolution of that is open-ended and so it remains critical for us to stay close and tight with our customers as we plan going forward. Allison, there are lot of unknowns in the market space right now. Our critical role in the nation's economy and our customer supply chains is clearly evident right now, that is not an unknown. We are pricing the value of our product, we are pricing of the value of our franchise and we are very confident in our understanding of the market. We are maintaining a long-term view of this and we are maintaining a long-term view of our business decisions to benefit our shareholders. We understand that eventually we are going to cycle through this market and we have got a great franchise and a great approach to support our customers' growth when that occurs. Ken, we understand that our utility coal or the nations utility coal franchise is in a secular decline. And so what you see from us is, a response and working with our customers on ways to promote coal dispatch relative to natural gas, but also we are adjusting our franchise as well. You saw that and so with short line activities, you saw that idled of Ashtabula just this quarter you saw in the sale of our Pocahontas Land Corporation assets. Stockpiles in the utility coal franchise right now are incredibly high. They are at about 125 days. Coal burn in March was at a new national record low at 29 million tons. And so, I think, coal is -- our utility coal franchise is going to be pressured for a considerable amount of time. We need to get the economy back running. So industrial and commercial load comes back and we are also going to need to see an overall increase in energy prices, prices in the PJM are in the teens right now for electricity and that is not going to promote coal burn. Yeah. Chris, it's that's very similar to what you saw in 2009 and 2010, isn't it, where you saw some pretty considerable supply reactions on the truckload side to a steep downturn and spot prices. And so for us it means continuing to collaborate with our best-in-class supply chain partners, our channel partners on how we give them an exceptional service product, how we look for new opportunities, new lanes for them to grow into and then it's also selling the things that are going to be pretty darn valuable post-COVID-19, which is capacity, a lower cost structure than truck, its service and its ESG and we have got the best intermodal franchise in the east. So we are in great shape there. It really will depend on and where the traffic comes back and what type of traffic it is, obviously, if it's full both you are going to get more of an incremental train starts. But if it's just across the Board, we have got capacity still in our train lengths to add train lengths before we have to do a lot of train starts. We have got capacity in the terminals as well with both the road crews, the local service crews and the yard crews to handle the capacity. So, we have got a while before we have to make train start deduct or increases. So we are still going to continue to get the upside leverage as this things pulls up, it's in a great place. Correct. Yes. We know where the traffic comes from and that's our plan. That's our plan. That's our goal and that's the ability of this organization to do that."

            "name": "Jim Squires",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Norfolk Southern's first quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. Before we discuss our financial results, I'd first like to thank our employees for their dedication during these unprecedented times. Norfolk Southern employees are proud to be delivering an essential service. In a video message to employees dispatcher Misty Brayton expressed the sentiment well when she said, we supply America with the goods that they are short of right now. And I hope everybody that works for Norfolk Southern feels essential after this. It is truly inspirational to watch our employees rise to the challenge. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we established three simple goals early on, protect our employees, serve our customers and exercise strong financial discipline. I will talk briefly about the steps we are taking in each area. Our first responsibility is to protect our people. We acted quickly based on CDC guidelines and took extensive measures to keep employees safe. We transitioned most of our office employees to remote work in a matter of days. For employees whose jobs require them to work on site, we implemented social distancing and established rigorous cleaning protocols for their work environments. Our preventive measures, combined with the diligence of our employees have kept the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at Norfolk Southern low. I am also pleased to report that our employees are working safely through the many potential distractions. Our thoughts are with all those whose lives have been impacted by the virus. Our second goal is to continue providing an excellent service product for our customers and that's exactly what we are doing. Our customers are making rapid adjustments to their operations due to the impacts of the Coronavirus and we are right there with them every day as a valued partner. They count on us for reliable service, close collaboration and nimble operational adjustments and we are delivering. We will address our third goal, which is to exercise strong financial discipline throughout the balance of this call. The work we have done to implement our strategic plan has made us an even more resilient business, putting us in a good position to navigate the current market disruption. I will now turn to our financial results for the quarter. Allow me to first remind everyone of our announcement on April 16th of a non-cash charge of $385 million related to the ongoing disposition of 703 locomotives. Thanks to the excellent execution of our strategic plan, our fleet today is more efficient and we are able to operate with significantly fewer locomotives. Mark will provide additional color. But as you can see on slide five, we have provided an adjusted view of our financials to exclude this charge. This is what I will reference in the rest of my comments this morning. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.58 and the adjusted operating ratio was 63.7%. These numbers improved upon last year's record results by 3% and 230 basis points, respectively. Within the context of an 11% volume decline, they are remarkable achievements that demonstrate this team's urgency to transform our company. We also set records and metrics such as train performance, terminal dwell and shipment consistency among others and accelerated crew start reductions in excess of declining volumes for a third straight quarter. When coupled with the ongoing realignment of resources around our new operating model, we reduced operating expenses by $202 million in the first quarter when excluding the non-cash locomotive charge. Our team is committed to driving improvements across the network and significantly and consistently lowering our operating ratio. We are focused on the factors within our control and confident that by continuing to adjust and successfully execute our strategic plan, we are building a stronger, more resilient and a more profitable Norfolk Southern. I will now turn the call over to Alan and the team to begin detailing our first quarter results and our progress executing the strategic plan. Alan? Thank you, Mark. There is much for us to be proud of in our report today, from our strong first quarter financial performance to the incredible job the men and women of Norfolk Southern are doing to keep the trains running. Our industry faces a difficult volume environment with an uncertain trajectory. By executing our strategic plan, exercising capital discipline and serving our customers well, Norfolk Southern is poised to emerge stronger and ready for growth as the economy recovers. Thank you for your attention and we will now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Good morning, Jason. It's, Jim. We are committed to managing our volume variable and structural cost through this downturn. So you saw evidence of that in the first quarter with adjusted expense reductions totaling $202 million. We are pulling every lever at our disposal when it comes to cost reductions in this environment and that's the right thing to do given the trend in the revenue this year. Nevertheless, we do believe we are capable of responding to the upturn, which will come as volume growth resumes. We expect to generate significant operating leverage and that will result in rapid margin improvement and bottomline growth. Well, growth will resume and when it does, as I said. We will have the resources in place and we expect to generate significant operating leverage. Let me talk a little bit further about kind of next steps in terms of cost reductions, and I will ask Alan to comment on the topline outlook. So we are pressing the TOP21 accelerator right now. And that, as Mike said, that means crew start reductions going forward, a hard look at our yard and facilities network, blending more trains, the kind of step straight out of the PSR playbook to continue to drive down costs. So, Alan, what about the revenue outlook? We did not pull our guidance for 60 in 2021 and we are still focused on getting to a 60 OR as fast as we can. The timing and shape of the recovery will likely have an impact for sure. But one thing is for certain, as I said, we get to the other side of this and growth resumes, our operating leverage would be very powerful and should drive rapid OR improvement in bottomline growth. Mark? Well, Mike went through the steps that we have taken under TOP21 and essentially we have completed all of the network redesign to this point that we had mapped out through 2021. So all phases of TOP21 that we had initially signaled we would implement, we have implemented at this point. Going forward, our focus, as we have said is on additional crew start reductions, blending more trains and a hard look at the facilities we use, the yards we use to support network operations. Mike, anything to add? Jordan, at Norfolk Southern, we are fierce competitors and we are determined to make decisions in the long-term, best interest of our shareholders. We have got a deep knowledge of our markets and we are confident in our ability to price to the value of our service product, which is outstanding and our franchise, with a focus on margin improvement and also providing our customers with a platform for growth and you can see this in our RPU, in revenue-to-revenue ton-mile trends over the last three years, it's a consistent and a strategic approach for us. There are some specific market forces that are impacting our volumes. Last year, 60% of our coal volume was in the utility coal network. That volume was down 44% in the first quarter of this year. We participate in the energy markets, whether that's frac sand or ethanol and those have been pressured. They have been pressured for much as a year, as I called out. And separately, we also are highly integrated with customers who are the integrated steel mills, so that has taken a hit throughout the year. One thing to point out is, we are running against our toughest year-over-year comps of the year. I believe week 20 of last year, so mid-May was our highest volume week of the year. So that's causing part of the volume decline year-over-year. But we also understand and it's important to note that our opportunities are within that $800 billion plus truck and logistics market. We have got the most powerful intermodal franchise in the east, and as you know, we are aligned with the best channel partners in the industry. We have got a diverse merchandise network with a great service product. We are staying very close to our customers and we are collaborating with them right now, near-term opportunities as they adjust the supply chain dislocations and on longer term opportunity. So we are confident about where we are headed. Well, the question is not if, but when we get to a 60 operating ratio. That remains our goal. We are going to get there as quickly as we can. And yes, that will be through a leaner cost structure, with the kinds of cost structural initiatives that we have been through this morning. And so, yes, that's very much part of the outlook and we believe we will have strong operating leverage when growth resumes, which it will. Well, we do expect to be able to hold the line on many of the costs within our cost structure, as volumes return and there lies the operating leverage in the model. Now, certainly, we will have some volumetric expense increases with volume on the way up as is the case on the way down. But the key will be to hold the line in terms of additions to the asset and resource base as much as we possibly can. We know we can do that and ride that wave of volume upsurge, which should generate rapid and significant operating ratio improvement and bottomline growth. Thank you for your questions this morning. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Stay safe everyone. Thank you."

            "name": "Mike Wheeler",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan. Today, I will update you on the state of our operations. The first quarter continued our story of superior service and improved cost structure, leading to increased operational leverage even in the face of declining volumes. We are continually improving our operating plan and using PSR principles to deliver superior execution. Going to slide 10. Continued improvements in train speed and terminal dwell despite tougher year-over-year comps drove record quarterly terminal dwell, train performance, customer service at the car load level and unprecedented executional success in the service sensitive intermodal segment. We achieved these milestones with fewer assets and lower employment levels, further reducing our cost structure and driving efficiency. These trends have continued into the second quarter. Moving onto our service and productivity metrics on slide 11, which I have shared with you in prior calls. These metrics measure important productivity and customer service levels and are indicators of our success meeting our productivity goals. The service delivery index measures our on-time performance at the shipment level and is indexed to 2018. Our first quarter 2020 performance is at our 2021 goal and we are confident we will maintain these service levels throughout the year. Our lowest T&E headcount on record drive substantial year-over-year productivity, while still providing stellar service. As I will show you on the next slide, we continue to aggressively size our train plan to the changing business levels. We continued our momentum of train weight improvements, showing further progress in the first quarter. Remember that we re-targeted this goal 6,700 tons in light of continued changes in the coal market. Productivity driven by our top 21 operating plan will boost us towards this goal, despite the challenges of the current volume environment. We made considerable progress in locomotive productivity in 2019 by rationalizing our fleet, a trend that continued in the first quarter of 2020. Our active locomotive fleet is almost 15% lower in 2020 than in the first quarter of 2019 and our recent locomotive disposition announcement reinforces our commitment to getting the most out of our fleet. We also thought it would be useful to show you our year-over-year progress in fuel efficiency. This is an area of focus for us and the improvements in gallons per ton-mile reflect the results of efforts on many fronts, including increased train weight, continued rationalization of the DC to AC upgrade of our locomotive fleet, increased use of energy management technology and completion of our full PTC footprint. Finally, even after we raised the bar on the Cars On-Line goal, we continue to beat our targets. First quarter results were measurably better than goal and we set a new record earlier this month. To be clear, this count includes cars in storage that can be brought out as business rebounds. Slide 12 shows our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerated reductions in crew starts. We are continuously improving our TOP21 plan and are now completing Phase 3 of the program. This will deliver the three phases of the program in 18 months, instead of the anticipated three years. The first quarter saw 19% fewer crew starts, showing increased leverage between crew starts and volume. After we complete Phase 3 of TOP21, we will continue to optimize the operating plan, in part by combining traffic of all types on single trains and reviewing our yard network for further rationalization. Before I shift to discussing Norfolk Southern's operational response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I want to emphasize our positive operational momentum. We are making progress long-term structural changes in our asset base, service levels and productivity drivers. We will continue to build on our progress from 2019, following PSR principles while proactively adapting our operating plan to the economic environment. Turning to slide 13. I am very proud of how Norfolk Southern's railroaders have dealt with both the threat and the business impact of the pandemic. We took early proactive measures to protect our workforce and make sure that being at work, continue to be the safest part of an NS employees day, because the railroad was very fluid and service levels were very high, we were able to quickly store surplus equipment, while also mobilize employees to provide extra manpower in hot zones like Northern New Jersey. We made special efforts to assist customers by expediting shipments of goods in short supply or that were urgently needed. All the while, we maintain service levels and the railroad has run even faster in April. As you can see on slide 14, the pandemic also mandated a proactive response to the drop in volume. Tactically, we very quickly over just a few days removed the blocks and trains carrying auto parts and finished vehicles from our TOP21 plan. Crew starts dropped almost as quickly as volume, enabling us to preserve leverage even as shipment count declined. We will again redesign the operating plan as auto volume rebounds, using our operating leverage to handle returning volumes in the most efficient way possible. While we do not yet know the shape of the recovery curve, we are taking this time of lower traffic as an opportunity to challenge ourselves and our capabilities to improve our TOP21 operating plan in the long-term. For example, we are successfully handling carload traffic on premium intermodal trains, lending previously separate service networks in a way that allows us to maintain service frequency and train size while reducing costs. In addition, we are taking hard looks at our yard and terminal network, testing what we can live without. I will now turn it over to Mark, who will cover the financials. Yeah. I mean, it helps your whole material network, because you are managing less, less materials with less models. A lot of these models were smaller type models and so that helped to be efficient. And it's also going to help our sharp footprint going forward as we continue to rationalize that, you have heard some of the things we are doing there and those are coming to fruition now and those will help that as well. So, yeah, there's a lot of ancillary benefits to this going forward. Yeah. We have been talking with you on all the quarters about our blending of our network. We first started talking about blending bulk into the general merchandise and we did that. And then we started blending the automotive into the general merchandise as well and that was a big part of TOP21 last year, very successful. And as we have continued on, we have blended general merchandise and bulk into the intermodal network that's been very successful. And then, now we are in the process of blending traffic even into our premium network. So we have really blended all of the different traffic types into our network. So we are to the point now where a train is a train. So our Phase 3 implementation is really in place. And the beauty of this, as you go forward and traffic comes back, we are blended now that a train is a train, and it can ride on a train that gives us the right service requirement that it needs, but also as efficient as it can be. So we are really in a good place with our network with the TOP21 implementation, and going forward, we are just going to continue to optimize the network as traffic comes back on. Yeah. Brandon, I think, you are going to see some differences in supply chain requirements moving forward. There is going to be potentially more forward positioning. There is going to be more an emphasis on reliability and consistency. And frankly, that benefits Norfolk Southern, because we have got the best intermodal franchise in the East. When the recovery happens, people are going to be focused on capacity, cost, service and ESG and Norfolk Southern offers all of that relative to our primary form of competition, which is truck. So we touch over 50% of the consumption and the manufacturing in the economy. We are staying close to our customers. Even now we are launching innovative service products. So we are pretty confident about where things are headed once the economy re-opens. Yeah. Trucks are very competitive right now. Those are the opportunities for us that is supported by our -- strength of our franchise and those are the service products that we are developing right now is to help our customers and as they deal with changes in their supply chain and we are working on near-term solutions and long-term solutions. I have noted we got wonderful merchandise franchise with broad exposure to the U.S. economy. We have got a great intermodal franchise, the best in the east and we have got an outstanding service product. And just within intermodal, you can go back three years, go back four years, you go back five years and you can see that Norfolk Southern and our customers have paced the growth in the entire industry during that time period. You can go all the way back to recovery from the great recession in 2010. So it's -- as I have talked about before, we are making decisions in the long-term best interest of our shareholders. That includes our market approach and our willingness to partner with our customers to support their growth over the long-term. Yeah. Sure. Thank you. As you have noted, we have been looking at our term loan yards for long-term since a great recession, we have either idled or converted five of our top terminals, we did two of them last year and we are continuing to look at that and those are long-term structural cost reductions and you will see more of that as we go forward. I would also note that we have talked about we have shutdown a lot of our smaller outline yards, brought that traffic in and consolidated it. And as Mark noted, those are assets over time that will go away and take less cost. But we continue to look at it and find out what we can live without and we have got a lot of opportunities out there that we are looking at, more to come and you will hear more about it as we go forward. But yeah, those are things we are looking at and are going to do. Sure. Yeah. On the locomotive DC to AC conversions, we are committed to that revitalization, because we have got some DC locomotives out there that upgrading to the AC is really cost efficient from a capital standpoint and been really pleased with the reliability from this. So that project will continue on going forward over the next couple of years, it's the right thing to do and what we did push out, we had taken some opportunistic additional DC to AC conversions that we were looking at this year, we are pushing those out, we are not going to do those. Some rebuild of our yard and local fleet we have pushed out. So the DC to AC conversions will continue at the pace that we have talked about in the past. Relative to the capital expenditures, we are very fortunate that we have got some great technology in our company, particularly on the engineering side. We are making sure that we are putting our rails, ties and ballast in the right locations. We have got technology these days that are they are using machine vision to determine whether ties are good or not. They are even doing X rays internally. So we are making sure that when we put ties in, we will put them in the right place at the right time, same thing with rail where we are using predictive analytics to determine where the rail needs to be replaced at and that's allowing us to really pinpoint our asset replacements. And we are really comfortable with the fact that we are doing the right thing for maintaining this railroad in a long-term, both on the locomotive reliability front, as well as the track infrastructure. Hey, Justin. The gap has certainly closed. The real pressure is coming from that spot truck market. And at some point, as the economy starts to improve and as there are supply of ramifications throughout the truckload market, that's going to particularly affect the spot market. So it's important for us to maintain that vision as we are approaching the market and not chase the spot truck. You have heard me talk about that before. That's not within the long-term best interests of our corporation. So we are focused on what we can deliver and that is a great service product, a great, intermodal franchise that has allowed our customers to outpace the industry and growth over any number of years. So, Justin, it's one of the things that I had talked about is, the utility coal franchise, which is last year was 60% of our volume utility -- of our coal volume in the first quarter is down 44%. So that's having an impact on us. The ethanol markets whether that's inbound, feedstocks such as corn or outbound ethanol is having an impact on us. Frac sand, we have talked about the energy impact integrated steel mills is having an impact on our franchise. And frankly, the spot trucking market is having an impact on intermodal and we saw an impact on international intermodal in Asia business in February and so all of that contributes to tougher year-over-year comps, as I noted. We are still riding or comparing against pretty elevated volumes of last year. We will get through that in week 20, in which our volumes were at the highest level of last year. And just overall, we understand the markets and we are pretty confident in our knowledge of the markets and we are very confident in our ability to price, to the value of our product and the value of our franchise and make the best long-term decisions for our shareholders and you see that an RPU and revenue per revenue ton-mile trends not just this quarter but over the last three plus years. Well, I think, the thing that it is beneficial for us is that, that we are able to adapt quickly, right? As volumes come out, we have been able to take the -- take the -- our crew starts out, you saw that in my slide, I will note that in April so far, we have pretty much matched the volume decline against with the crew start decline that's around 30%, so which matched it pretty well. So the thing that we have come out of this with is a really nimble organization that can adapt quickly to volume changes. Well, that's on the downside, like, we have shown or on the upside when it occurs and we are going to get a lot of leverage when that happens because of it. Thank you."

            "name": "Mark George",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the review of adjusted financials, just a moment to talk about the locomotive write-down that we disclosed two weeks ago, simply said, it's a capacity dividend of our TOP21 PSR implementation, which has resulted in the decongestion of our yards and road network, allowing cars to turn quicker in the terminals and trains to move faster on the network. The blending of our discrete networks resulted in fewer but longer trains, fewer trains along with better balancing of our routes require fewer locomotives. We enter 2020 with roughly 1,000 locomotives on the sidelines, out of the approximate fleet of 3,900. We spent time this quarter aligning on exactly how many locomotives we would need even at 2018 volume levels. Our operations team essentially modeled the capacity requirements in a post PSR world and determined that of our stored locomotives 703 are deemed excess and available for sale, while the balance are held for surge and in cycle for AC upgrades. In fact, 298 of the 703 were effectively sold in Q1, while the remaining will be marketed for sale or scrapped in the next 12 months. The $385 million is essentially the remaining book value on those locomotives that otherwise would have been depreciated in the P&L in the years to come. In the process, the team targeted removal of the oldest, least reliable and least efficient of the locomotives and eliminated entire model lines, moving us to a more homogenous fleet of 10 models from \u201819. With that we were able to also eliminate inventory and rationalize mechanical resources. So moving now to slide 17 and the remaining slides will reflect adjusted results, excluding the impact from the locomotive rate down. Recall this slide format we introduced last quarter to show large and anomalous events that impact our results. There is just one item in the quarter worth calling out and that is a one-time benefit on an income tax refund related to the 2012 tax year. That provided $0.09 of EPS tailwind in the quarter and contributed to the 12.6% effective tax rate. No other meaningful adjustments in Q1 of 2019 or 2020, so the improvement in the operating ratio of 230 basis points was core. Now moving to the adjusted results on slide 18, a very strong operational quarter, as both Jim and Mike described earlier. Revenue was down 8% driven by an 11% volume contraction that was partially offset by the strong RPU improvement that Alan spoke to. Thanks to our effective yield-up strategy enabled by our enhanced customer service delivery. Operating expenses were 11% lower, almost mitigating the revenue decline in dollar terms and that resulted in the strong 230 basis point OR improvement, which follows the 240 basis point core OR improvement we showed in Q4, despite a softer environment during that time. And you see on the right, very strong free cash flow performance, a record $589 million, which is 42% greater than Q1 of last year. So now drilling into the operating expense categories on slide 19, we drove down compensation and benefits in the quarter, 14% year-over-year on a 19% reduction in employees versus Q1 of 2019. Employee count was down 6% sequentially from Q4. Our employment levels declined throughout the quarter and this along with lower costs associated with benefits, over time, re-crews and incentive compensation saved us $105 million. Fuel was down $61 million from a combination of lower prices, as well as lower consumption from both volume and also efficiency gains. Consumption declined 15% on a 10% decrease in GTMs, despite significant adverse commodity mix. Materials and other spending was down $24 million or 13% led by a $15 million reduction in materials. Gains on operating properties amounted to $11 million, which was lower than the $17 million recorded in Q1 of 2019. Purchased services and rents was down $21 million or 5% with purchase services alone down 7%. Rents were actually up 5% in the quarter due to lower equity income from the TTX joint venture that more than offset savings from lower rent spend. So when looking at the big picture, the underlying change to our cost structure continue to shine through in the first quarter, as we reduce and realigned resources around our new operating model. Moving to slide 20. Let's take a look at our summarized first quarter financial results below the income from operations line. Other income was down $22 million from lower investment returns on corporate-owned life insurance and a lower effective tax rate of 12.6% was driven by the refund I discussed earlier, as well as benefits from stock-based compensation. This first quarter low ETR will provide benefit to the full-year effective tax rate as we expect the remaining quarters to return to the guidance range of 23% to 24%. Moving now to slide 21, as mentioned, we generated a record Q1 free cash flow of $589 million. Thanks to expanding margins, but also from constraining our capital spend, which was $100 million less than last year. And we returned $708 million to shareholders in the quarter, with a solid dividend bolstered by our continued share repurchase activity. Now let's talk outlook on slide 22. Obviously, the economic environment has progressively worsened here in Q2 and while we can't be certain of the severity and duration of the downturn in 2020, we do know that revenue will be much lower than we thought at the beginning of the year. So we pulled our guidance for flat revenue for 2020, as well as the guidance for OR improvement. We are modeling a number of revenue scenarios, so that we are positioned to respond as a scenario starts to play out. We are focused on what we can control, service and costs. We feel that with modest revenue contractions, we can manage to match it with cost takeout. With steep revenue declines, you just can't keep up with certainly not in the short-term. To help you in your modeling and for illustrative purposes, you see the P&L cost categories that provide a general sense, how they correlated the volume changes. Most categories have an element of cost that is directly tied to volume, and on a mostly immediate basis, fuel being the most obvious, but there are also structural components that take longer to move, as well as great areas that are also subject to volume, but pretty dependent on management decisions that are influenced by the expected duration of the downturn and the anticipated pace of recovery. We never want to cut in a way where we can handle volume when a recovery occurs, which would then adversely impact customer service. And we absolutely won't compromise on network safety. In aggregate, roughly 50% to 60% of our costs could be categorized as volume variable and semi-variable. The balance is structural cost and there is a reason I refer to this category as structural instead of fixed which kind of its permanent. We have been and continue to work on structural cost trying to eliminate not just variabilize them and we are looking at all structural buckets including even the biggest one depreciation, a category that many would consider truly fixed. We have to look at how we can keep this bar from getting fatter and certainly adding fewer assets over time helps, but there are even unique opportunities to make it skinnier. Our recent locomotive action for example will generate roughly $25 million of annual depreciation savings going forward, so all structural cost is under constant review by this committed leadership team that's dedicated to evaluating all opportunities. So while our deep revenue decline may put short-term pressure on the OR, I have every confidence that when we are on the other side of this market dislocation, we will be coiled up with great operating leverage to deliver significant OR improvement. Let me wrap up on slide 23. Given the steep drop in the markets and the lack of clarity on the slope of recovery, it's important to share with you a bit about our financial standing. On top of significant expansion of free cash flow generation, we also maintain a solid balance sheet with good debt capacity and robust access to credit markets. We have relatively light levels of debt maturities in the next two years. More importantly, we have already significantly dial-back on our capital spend budget for 2020, recognizing the challenging environment that we are entering. Property additions will be limited to roughly $1.5 billion this year, regardless of revenue, which is a reduction from our 2019 spending levels by $500 million or 25%. If the right thing to do, it would be the lowest level of spend in absolute dollars since 2010, while not jeopardizing the safety, service or near-term revenue opportunities. So we feel real good about our liquidity and our ability to weather this storm. Thank you and I will turn the call back over to, Jim. Yes. Scott, you are right, the comp per employee did move 6% sequentially. But remember, these are quarter-to-quarter in particular is very lumpy. And you are always going to have some noise on the timing of when you have incentive accrual top-ups or write-back. So I think you are got to look at it more over time and when you look at it over time, you are always going to be fighting inflation, wage inflation. So, that's certainly something that we are dealing with every year. And but generally, we are really shifting our focus to the absolute comp and win numbers, which as you know, have gone down and continued to decline in part from the volume, but in particular from the PSR actions that we have taken. Well, look... You had some incentive accrual disparities between quarters. So that's one thing, where in Q4 you had -- based on the way the year ended, you ended up having a benefit or a pickup from writing back some of the incentive accruals. So that certainly dropped the Q4 number and creates a little bit of a tougher compared sequentially. I think from here, you will see that it's going to be more even throughout the year. Sure. I mean, we talk a little bit about the locomotives, first. And again we took out 250 locomotives last year as we launch the TOP21 strategic plan and mainly those were on the sideline, but they were with a lot of other locomotives that we had on the sideline. We knew that every quarter throughout this year, we were probably going to see, we were going to convince ourselves that we were going to have more and more surplus locomotives. So rather than leak it out over time, we really held hands as an organization and said, look, we have got very good progress here on liberating assets in the field. Where can we be in a post-PSR world with regard to locomotive needs? And there were several iterations, I think, the PSR experts that we have in-house, really pushed the envelope and said, look, we know where we can get to. So, we had a 1,000 when we started the year on the sideline, the numbers initially started with 400, maybe 450, the team iterated several times and ultimately got back to a number of 703, where we said that is absolutely doable, even if we go back to 2018 volume levels, we can still manage with the remaining fleet. So we decided, rather than just leak this out over time to take a look at it, it was clearly a significant portion of the -- of that particular asset base. So we decided the right thing to do, the appropriate thing to do is actually pull it out of group accounting and write it off. The benefit of doing that, first off is, we get the organization focused on removing assets and I think that's a very important thing for any company when you have surplus assets is to eradicate them, because assets attract cost. You got yard congestion in our case. You have got network congestion by parking all these excess locomotives, let's commit to get rid of them quickly, and then they will attract less cost, less maintenance and less attention and less property tax whatever you can assign to it will end up being savings. So it's healthier just to get to recognize what surplus upfront and move as quick as possible to remove them from the company's properties. And then by removing them from group accounting, you also now have taken that $385 million asset and you avoid depreciating it over many years and absorbing it into your remaining assets, it seems like it's a very unusual form of accounting that's relatively unique to our industry, where you have group accounting attaching excess book value from discarded assets to remaining assets and depreciating further over time. So we avoid doing that, we get rid of it, we get depreciation benefit in the future. So that's really how this came about. Yes. Clearly, they attract less maintenance and part of that $385 million was a little bit of inventory that went for the model lines that are no longer here, the seven model lines we eliminated. So that's another trailing benefit that we have. And but, yes, clearly, we are going to have some mechanical benefit from this, savings that arise from having fewer locomotives and a more streamlined fleet model. Maybe, Mike, you want to make some comments. And remember, Brian, we got rid of 300 of those already in Q1. So the physical assets have been removed and there is just the remaining 400 now, that over the next 12 months, hopefully in the next 9 months or so we will follow. And David, if I could add one thing, it also benefits us and our customers and that it provides us with a broader product offering, and no longer do we need to find enough density for a point to point intermodal train. We could find smaller blocks of intermodal and put it on a merchandise train and open up some lanes, which we are doing. Thanks, Bascome. So we have modeled a number of different scenarios and we haven't picked one, because we know whatever one we pick will be wrong. But we have modeled high single-digit declines to mid-upper teen declines on revenue and volumes to \u201820s and \u201830s. And in all those circumstances and cases, you are going to see that we have modeled free positive cash flow contribution, we are going to grow cash flow this year regardless. But one thing we are doing is to preserve cash, you would have noticed, we have really taken a significant chunk out of capital expenditures this year to make sure that we maintain the proper balance and we augment our liquidity and certainly what is going to be an uncertain time, because we don't know how deep this will go and how long it will last before recovery begins again. So in pretty much all the scenarios we have modeled we are still generating positive cash flow and positive free cash flow and we feel actually very good about our whole liquidity equation as well as you can see from the slide I shared. We have got plenty of plenty of vehicles to go for credit, if we needed, and again, the capital reduction is also very, very meaningful to us as well as frankly, a very strong cash balance opportunity. Yeah. I mean, I think, you see a little bit of evidence of that here with the capital reduction that we have done very early in the year. You don't cut $500 million or 25% out of your annual capital spend easily. So we really got together as a team and similar to the whole locomotive discussion, I just went through, we iterated several times on what we could do to reduce capital spend and get to a new baseline level. For which to be honest, we are at -- this is a low level, we haven't been here since 2010 in absolute dollars. But we felt it was the right thing to do because we sense that there was going to be volume pressure, sure enough, it's come and it's, it's real in front of us, so I am glad we have gone through this exercise. From here though as revenue grows, I would hope that we are able to contain growth in CapEx at a more moderate pace below the pace of revenue growth in the future and maybe grow into a lower percentage of revenue below the 16 to 18 at some point. So that's one thing that I think the organization is very keen on and then the second frankly is what we talked about with regard to the locomotive rationalization itself. We took a long hard look at the assets and in that particular pool, and frankly, we are going to shift over and now look at other pools of assets we have as well and make sure, one of the perils of group depreciation is that you are not necessarily motivated or incentivized to be looking at the assets once they are on the books. In this case, I think we have to look at that, because they do attract cost. Do we have a lot of buildings out there along the network that maybe we don't need any more, structures that again attract maintenance cost, they attract electricity costs, they attract property assessments, those are like one area we might look at, we have seen our coal franchise shrinks considerably. Do we have surplus assets in coal that we need to re-examine and re-look at. So we are asking these questions as a team, the team is open-minded about it, and I think, again, you see in the first quarter some evidence of that. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Chris. I am going to tag team this with, Mike. But the reduction in the CapEx is really little bit across the board, not so much on the locomotives, but in other areas, whether it's IT, a little bit of our maintenance, we have really taken a look at all the various categories and try to bring it down a notch even some of the terminal spends, especially given the volume pressures that we have. So it really went across the board and we know though, like I mentioned earlier, we are going to have pressure to raise from here. But I want, Mike, maybe you can talk a little bit about locomotives and cat 1 versus cat 1 on the ops stuff. Yeah. Thank you, John. Certainly, we were -- we continued full steam in Q1 on the share repurchase activity. Now, obviously, as we do see the markets are contracting significantly, we are going to take a more conservative approach to looking at share repurchase, while maintaining flexibility for when depending on the depth of decline but also the pace of recovery. So, I think, we will certainly take a more muted approach here."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce Meghan Achimasi Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Ms. Achimasi, please go ahead.\nMeghan Achimasi: Thank you, operator. And good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section along with our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures.  Along those lines, recall two adjustments during 2020, including a non-cash charge in the first quarter of 2020 related to the sale of 703 locomotives for $385 million and a $99 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2020 related to an equity method investment. We will speak to full year comparisons excluding those charges from 2020. A full transcript and download will be posted after the call It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman and CEO, Jim Squires.\nJim Squires: Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. I\u2019m pleased to be joined by Alan Shaw, President; Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer, Ed Elkins, Chief Marketing Officer, and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer.  Let me start by acknowledging and thanking the entire NS team for the tremendous effort that's gone into the fulfillment of our financial targets established in our 3-year strategic plan. 2021 serves as the pinnacle of the plan and is marked by the achievement of our 60% full year operating ratio and record productivity levels across our operation. Through a multiyear effort, we delivered on our commitments, overcoming significant headwinds associated with first a freight recession and then a global pandemic over the course of our plan. In the past 3 years, we've produced industry-leading total shareholder return. We've grown EPS by 27%, reduced our operating ratio by 530 basis points and return nearly $10 billion back to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We met and exceeded our goals, albeit with a very different formula than originally anticipated, given the volume headwinds demonstrating our ability to adapt and innovate and our dedication to deliver upon our commitments. I'm so proud to be a part of this team and humbled to serve as its leader.  We're poised to build upon our momentum and write a new record book. The company is in rock solid position. And we have the right team to guide our next chapter of success. With that, I welcome Ed to his new role as Chief Marketing Officer and congratulate Alan on his appointment as President. It's my pleasure now to turn the discussion over to Alan for a detailed look at the fourth quarter and full year results. Alan?\nAlan Shaw : Thank you, Jim. As Jim noted, 2021 represents the culmination of our multiyear plan. And I'm pleased to share with you the progress we made in the fourth quarter.  As you see from our results on Slide 5, revenue growth of 11%, outpaced our expense increase of 8%, producing an 18% improvement in earnings per share and a fourth quarter record operating ratio of 60.4%. For the full year, revenues improved 14%, which more than offset the 6% increase in operating expenses. We delivered the hallmark 60% operating ratio for the full year, an improvement of 430 basis points over the adjusted full year 2020 result, and our sixth consecutive year of improvement. We are excited to share more details of our results. And you'll hear from both Cindy and Ed about work to iterate on the next phase of our thoroughbred operating plan that will serve as the framework for our continued progress on service, productivity and growth. Now first turn to Cindy for a review of our operations. Cindy.\nCindy Sanborn : Thank you, Alan and good morning. During the fourth quarter, headwinds from the tight labor market created acute operational challenges across several parts of our network. While working to overcome the workforce planning hurdles, we remain focused on leveraging productivity initiatives to move freight for our customers.  These efforts did bear fruit, but our service quality was significantly below where we needed it to be. I'm going to discuss with you today the strategic approach we are taking to change this. Turning to Slide 7, pronounced changes in business mix were evidenced by the unit volume decline 4%, while GTMs were up 1%. Productivity gains were key to handling volumes in the quarter as the transportation workforce contracted by 8%. The reduction in crew starts a 4%, growth in train weight of 10% and growth in train length of 8% were critical elements of this productivity formula as well.  There were active locomotive count increased by 5%. As the network slowed, we kept focused on efficiently deploying those locomotives on the larger trains, which helped drive the 3% improvement in fuel efficiency. As I mentioned a few moments ago, you can see the degradation of network fluidity on Slide 8. We regained a modest amount of ground over the holidays. And as we're entering the first quarter, our improvements have been sporadic as COVID related absences have more than doubled from where they were in December. Let me be clear, our top priority is to drive the service improvements our customers expect and need and we will get there. We are working very hard to leverage an increased hiring pipeline as well as productivity initiatives to drive our performance. Next, I'll provide more details on the hiring process on Slide 9. We've made significant progress in ramping up resources to improve the pace of hiring while pursuing productivity. And as shown on the slide, we are pulling 5 key levers to do so including: number one, incorporating additional recruiting and training resources to increase hiring; employees from across the company have volunteered to provide support and our principal training facility and it's all hands on deck.  Number two, streamlining the hiring and onboarding process. We trimmed weeks from the process of first identifying a candidate to have them on board. Three, increasing trainee pay and offering incentives such as signing, retention and referral bonuses. Four, lengthening and combining trains. We've made solid progress in this regard. And finally five, we're using a variety of techniques to optimize our existing crews, including realigning crew districts and making crew basis more fungible. Our people are getting creative and rising to the challenge. And resource additions are bearing fruit as we've on boarded over 3 times more conductor trainees in January than any month in 2021. These trainees will promote throughout the second quarter, which is when we expect to start improving train and engine service staffing levels.  We do expect to see some relief and critical crew bases during Q1, as trainees that started in 2021 became promoted. Though, we are still experiencing high levels of attrition in those same areas. On average we expect the number of certified train and engine employees in 2022, to approximate that of 2021 and are expecting GTMs per employee to increase. So when looking at the year as a whole, our plan is to leverage productivity gains to absorb volume growth, while getting the workforce rebalanced to drive improvements in service quality.  Let's unpack the productivity discussion a little more on Slide 10. We've improved average train weight and length 21% and 20% respectively since mid-2019, when TOP21 was launched. This has been a key to our success and will continue to be so going forward. Larger trains, reduced labor intensity, improved locomotive productivity, improved fuel efficiency, and provide our customers with a platform for growth. We have efforts in the pipeline to continue this trend.  First on the infrastructure front. In 2021, we launched work on 9 citing extensions, one of which was quickly completed and in service by the fourth quarter. Most of the others will be completed throughout 2022. Second, our very capital efficient and high performing DC to AC locomotive modernization program is ongoing. As a reminder, this is a dual purpose program to rebuild engines at the end of their life, while converting them to the latest and greatest technology.  In 2021, we improved our fleet composition to nearly 60% AC power and 65% of our road fleet is capable of distributed power. Both of these aid with running larger trains. Lastly, our operating plan and growth initiatives must be well aligned to add capacity to existing trains which brings me to Slide 11.  In 2022, we have already kicked off the next generation of our PSR-based operating plan which we are calling TOP SPG. While you may be familiar with NS\u2019s legacy of Thoroughbred Operating Plans, or TOP the next generation SPG represents a new era of service productivity and growth 3 equally important facets of our new operating plan. We are embarking on this next era because we have significant improvements that need to be made in each of these areas service, productivity and growth to reach our full potential.  We are taking a ground up approach to the development of the plan in order to explore what is possible when we remove historical constraints and take a fresh look at our business. We are leveraging lessons learned from the first 3 years of PSR operations under TOP 21. And using a rich data set to execute in a customer-centric collaborative process. We look forward to keeping you updated as this initiative unfolds throughout the year.  Thank you and I'll now turn it over to Ed.\nEd Elkins : Thank you, Cindy. And good morning, everyone. Now beginning on Slide 13, I will highlight our results for the fourth quarter. Total revenue improved 11% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, as strong demand and favorable price conditions more than offset the 4% volume decline in the fourth quarter.  Volume was impacted by the continuation of the extraordinary global supply chain disruptions and slower network velocity. Pricing strength across all markets contributed to the 50% increase in revenue per unit and we reached record revenue per unit less fuel across all of our markets. This demonstrates our ongoing commitment to execute our yield up strategy and drive value for both our customers and our shareholders.  Within merchandize, volume growth in the fourth quarter was led by our Chemicals franchise, as rising economic activity drove demand for chemical products, particularly for crude oil and natural gas liquids. Gains in our Metals business also contributed to growth, with volume in these markets up 6% year-over-year on sustained high demand from the strengthening manufacturing sector.  Partially offsetting merchandize growth was a decline in automotive shipments which were down 9% year-over-year due to slower velocity coupled with strong comps in the fourth quarter of 2020 when the industry was boosted by pent up demand.  Merchandize revenue per unit increased 6% year-over-year, driving total revenue growth of 8% to $1.7 billion for the quarter. Revenue per unit less fuel for this market reached record level in the fourth quarter. We've demonstrated year-over-year growth in this metric for 26 of the last 27 quarters, which further demonstrates our ability to drive sustainable revenue growth.  Our Animal franchise continued to face pressure from supply chain volatility, resulting in a volume decline of 7% year-over-year. Strong consumer demand and elevated imports stressed the supply chains and exceeded drayage capacity and equipment availability. This negatively affected both our domestic and our international markets.  But despite these headwinds, we achieved record intermodal revenue in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year, and that was driven by increased fuel revenue storage revenue and price gains. Revenue per unit less fuel grew for the 20th consecutive quarter.  Now, turning to coal. Revenue increased 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, which was driven by price gains and higher demand in a tightly supplied market. Coal revenue per unit reached near record levels and increased 16% year-over-year. Our export markets continue to benefit from high seaborne coal prices, which increased the competitiveness of U.S. coals in the global market. Shipments of domestic mat and coke are particularly strong this quarter on higher demand to support steel production.  If you'll turn to Slide 14, full year 2021 revenue grew 14% to $11.1 billion on 5% volume growth. All of our markets posted gains, reflecting strong demand for our product coming out of the pandemic tempered by supply chain pressures experienced throughout the year. Revenue growth was strongest and our merchandize franchise, where all lines of business, but particularly metals and construction benefited from higher demand and favorable price conditions associated with the economic recovery. Intermodal growth was driven by elevated consumer activity and tight truck capacity.  Coal revenue increased on higher seaborne coal prices and growth in steel production activity. We reached record levels of both revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel. Both metrics were up year-over-year due to price gains, storage charges, and higher fuel revenue in the case of total revenue per unit. And as markets have evolved, we've leveraged favorable conditions to drive improvement for our bottom line.  Now, let's look ahead to our outlook for 2022 on Slide 15. We're optimistic that our business will continue to grow. Despite the ongoing uncertainty in the economy, we're increasingly confident that supply chain conditions, including rail network velocity will improve as the year progresses. Overall, the demand environment for our service strong. We're committed to working with our customers and channel partners to develop sustainable solutions to maximize our opportunities ahead. We remain focused on our ability to deliver value for our customers and leverage market conditions throughout 2022.  As Cindy explained, both our hiring plan and the development and implementation of TOP SPG will deliver increased fluidity, efficiency and network capacity as the year progresses. And our volume pattern will follow that same sequential improvement trend. This will allow our customers to provide additional value to their customers for their product and build a strong platform for future growth. Market conditions for our merchandize franchise are expected to be favorable, with several customers announcing expansions and the New Year that will create opportunities.  In addition, industrial production is projected to grow 4% in 2022, which will drive demand for most of our markets, particularly for our steel markets. Residential construction spending is forecasted to grow more than 6% this year, following the sharp increase in 2021 supporting continued gains in several of our industrial markets. U.S. light vehicle production is expected to reach 10.3 million units this year, which is approaching pre-pandemic levels of 2019. This recovery will have a positive impact on both our automotive and our metals volumes in 2022.  Demand for our intermodal markets is expected to remain favorable, despite continued headwinds associated with supply chain congestion, impacting our ability to capture new opportunities. These headwinds are expected to ease in the second half of the year, creating more favorable environs for growth. And furthermore a robust consumer economy elongated inventory replenishment cycles and a tight cut market support our growth plan.  Durable goods consumption is expected to improve 3%, and that\u2019s on top of the near record 19% growth in 2021. This also goes well for our intermodal franchise. Our outlook for coal is more guarded as some of the drivers of 2021 growth shows signs of easing in 2022 despite some potential opportunities in the near term.  Seaborne prices remain high. However, they have begun to decline, leading subdued optimism going into the New Year. Expected increases in global production will likely contribute to downward pressure on these seaborne coal prices and lower the demand for export coal.  In the utility markets, while there's been strength associated with higher natural gas prices, that upside will be determined by coal supply as production levels remain high. Now before I turn it over to Mark, I would like to highlight our new NSites portal on Slide 16. The pandemic has pushed manufacturers to redesign their supply chains in favor of certainty of supply and locating inventory closer to customers. Our best-in-class industrial development team is at the forefront of these efforts. And they launched an innovative solution to drive value for our customers and support development in the communities that we serve.  NSites is a comprehensive search tool for rail, search industrial sites and transload facilities on our network. It allows users to create customized search parameters to quickly identify industrial sites that meet their unique needs. And more importantly, this portal makes it easier to do business with NS and helps our customers make informed long-term investment decisions that will promote economic activity and create jobs. We're excited to provide this product to our customers and help them expand their business on Norfolk Southern.  Overall, we are grateful for our strong customer partnerships. And we look forward to growing our business in 2022 with a continued emphasis on improving our service and driving value for our customers and for our shareholders. Now I'll turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results. Thank you.\nMark George : Thank you. Starting with Slide 18. As Ed noted, revenue was up 11% despite a 4% volume decline. This more than offset an 8% increase in operating expense, which led to 140 basis points of operating ratio improvement to a fourth quarter record of 60.4%. Improvements in RPU, coupled with strong productivity led to a record Q4 operating income with growth of 15% or $145 million. And we set another record for free cash flow, up 30% or $642 million for the full year. Moving to a drill down of operating expenses on Slide 19. While operating expense grew $134 million or 8%. It is up less than 3% or $44 million, apart from fuel cost increases. The $90 million headwind for fuel is driven almost entirely by price. You'll see purchase services and rents of $46 million with the majority of the year-over-year increase driven by the same drivers we talked about on the Q3 call. Higher expenses associated with Conrail, higher technology spend associated with our technology strategy, higher drayage expense associated with more hourly drivers used to alleviate terminal congestion primarily in Chicago, and we continue to see inflationary pressure on lift expenses going forward as it relates to contractor labor availability. Moving on to compensation and benefits. It is up 2%, but you'll note the $33 million in savings from 6% lower headcount. And that more than offset increases in pay rates and overtime. Meanwhile, incentive compensation comparisons in the quarter are a headwind of $24 million. Materials claims and other expenses were all down year-over-year. Turning now to Slide 20. Taking a look at the rest of the P&L below op income, you will see that other income of $21 million is unfavorable year-over-year by $22 million, due in part to lower net returns from company-owned life insurance, but also fewer gains on the dispositions of non-operating properties.  Our effective tax rate in the quarter was in our expected range at 23% and similar to last year. Net income increased 13%, while earnings per share grew by 18%, supported by 3.3 million shares we repurchased in the quarter. Turning to full year highlights on Slide 21. As a reminder, these highlights are compared to adjusted results for 2020, which excludes both the non-cash charge for locomotive rationalization in 1Q and the impairment charge in 3Q. Increased demand across all markets and strong results through yield up resulted in 14% year-over-year revenue improvement.  Expenses increased at less than half that rate, up 6% compared to 2020 as we continued our operational transformation while responding to market changes. We produced record operating income of over $4.4 billion, up 28% or $961 million versus the adjusted 2020 results. And as Jim noted in his opening remarks, we brought our operating ratio down to 60.1%, a record milestone for our company. That is 430 basis points of year-over-year improvement in line with the guidance we provided. Rounding out the results, net income increased 27%, while diluted EPS increased 31%, augmented by our strong share repurchase program, enabled a record free cash flow that we will wrap with on Slide 22. Free cash flow is a record $2.8 billion for 2021, up 30% year-over-year and we reported a strong 93% free cash flow conversion for the year. Property additions were about $100 million lower than our $1.6 billion guidance due to timing issues related to the continued supply chain disruptions. This shortfall in 2021 will carry over into 2022.  The sharply higher profitability in the company in '21 allowed for an over $2 billion increase in shareholder distributions for the year. We had 2 dividend increases in 2021 and more than doubled our share repurchase spend. And I'll point out, we just increased our dividend again by $0.15 or 14% in 2022. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Alan.\nAlan Shaw : Thank you, Mark. Turning to Slide 24. I will wrap up with our 2022 expectations. As you heard from Ed, based on our assessment of economic indicators, we expect markets related to manufacturing and consumer activity to drive growth.  We expect total revenue to deliver upper single-digit growth with merchandise and intermodal both increasing solidly, and coal, resuming its long-term secular decline. We will develop and leverage our new TOP SPG operating plan to accelerate our service recovery and drive additional efficiency into the organization in support of Norfolk Southern\u2019s and our customers' growth. You'll hear a lot more about TOP SPG and our upcoming second quarter Investor Day.  From an operating ratio perspective, we expect the first half of this year to look similar to the back half of 2021, with robust demand and service improvement driving stronger performance in the second half of this year. With this positive momentum in revenue, productivity and efficiency and based on our current expense projections, we expect to achieve greater than 50 basis points of OR improvement in 2022 and we won't stop there. In addition, we expect a dividend payout ratio range of 35% to 40% and capital expenditures in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. We anticipate using remaining cash flow and financial leverage to repurchase shares.  As you've heard from Cindy, Ed and Mark, we are optimistic about service, productivity and growth in the year ahead. And we'll advance productivity initiatives to attract business to Norfolk Southern more profitably than ever. We are committed to further efficiency improvements to create long-term sustained value for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for your attention. We'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski : Hey. Good morning, everyone. And congrats, Jim on quite a career. Alan, congrats as well moving up here. I guess coming out with this SPG approach. And I guess I heard there was going to be an analyst meeting, but how can you tell us -- how does this differ from the PSR journey that you guys have taken in the last few years? And is this a view that balances growth and cost efficiency and price?\nAlan Shaw : Good morning, Brandon. It's a continuation of our PSR journey. It's the next generation of it. We implemented TOP21 was really largely focused on our merchandise network. This is going to be focused on all of our service products. It's a comprehensive plan. We are really expecting and challenging ourselves and demanding of ourselves to have an output that delivers longer trains, a balanced network that's going to promote better resource efficiency, which is going to give us the room to grow. It's going to deliver an operating plan that our field can execute on a daily basis. So it's going to improve our service product as well.\nBrandon Oglenski : Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please procced with your question.\nJordan Alliger : Yeah, hi. Good morning. Just sort of curious as you sort of think about yields, revenue per carload as we look forward over the coming year and taking into account price and mix and everything else. I guess, a, how do you see the opportunity around price, particularly with the tightness continuing? And then how do you think about overall yield has certainly moved throughout the year? Thank you.\nAlan Shaw : Thank you for the question. And it's an inflationary environment out there in the U.S. There's a lot of demand. The U.S. consumer wants to grow. And we intend on delivering value to our customers. So we expect as the year progresses, we're going to see a balance of volume and price that will accelerate as the year moves on.\nJordan Alliger : Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee : Great. Hey, thanks. Good morning. And congrats guys. I guess -- I wanted to maybe dig into that volume and service relationship a little bit deeper. So it sounds like the first half of the year, both service and volume will be a little bit muted, but do you expect to see improvements as it goes forward.  Can you give us a sense of maybe where you're going to see some of those opportunities or some of the improvements in the service side hit first? And what that means or unlocks in terms of opportunity on the volume side. Just want to get a little bit of a better sense of how much volume is sort of included in that upper single-digit revenue growth target for the year?\nAlan Shaw : So, why don't you take the efficiency piece of that? And talk about what you view as the trajectory for operations and service improvements throughout the year? And then, Ed, maybe you can tackle the revenue implications.\nCindy Sanborn : Yeah. Okay, Chris. So from a service standpoint, we are really focused on improving our availability of crew resources to help us with service. We had some accelerated attrition in several core locations of our network that we had to really increase the pipeline for those locations. And that's largely in place.  In fact, of the conductor trainees we have out right now, whether in classroom or in the field, 50% are aimed at those core locations. So as they onboard into the Q2 and the rest of the hiring plan that we have as well, I think we'll start to see our service measures improve and in the back half kind of accelerate. I would also add that TOP SPG is an accelerant as well as we take a look at our service product and take a look at our service plan. As Alan noted, will also be helpful as we think through train length balance for our crews and how we operate the railroad and improve executability, which is also a catalyst.\nEd Elkins : And when we look out in 2022, what we see is really with the exception of coal, very healthy commodity markets. There's a lot of demand out there right now as we are able to deliver more payload capacity to our customers, they're going to move it.  And I've already said that we have a strong U.S. consumer, we have a record low inventory sales ratios. We believe that there's going to be continued demand, particularly for durable goods that will bode well for us and for our customers as we're able to deliver more and more value to them as the year progresses.\nChris Wetherbee : Okay. Thank you. Appreciated. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell : Thank you. Ed, sticking with you, I've been trying to tie some of these things together. First of all, the high single digit -- just a clarification from the high single-digit revenue, should we think kind of mid-single digit RPU and mid-single-digit volume?  And secondly, to plan to that again, capacities at a premium here, you're clearly ramping up the trainees. It sounds like that's the second quarter, maybe you're not rightsized from an employment standpoint for a few more months. Are you being more selective in the carload you're willing to move right now in an attempt to maximize mix margin and maintain or improve fluidity with the hope that there's more of an inflection in the second half of the year volumes?\nEd Elkins : Yeah. We stay very close to our markets and to our customers in those markets. And I think we have a pretty good handle on where the demand is. There's pretty strong demand really from every market that we serve currently. And what we intend to do is, as the year progresses again, we're going to be able to deliver more and more value to those markets and to those customers, whether it's on the bulk side, where we have strong demand or on the consumer product side, which includes both portions of our industrial products business and of course, our intermodal and automotive franchise.\nJon Chappell : But are you maybe not taking on as much freight as the demand get pace just in order to get that service to where it needs to be and the network right size from a labor standpoint?\nEd Elkins : Well, I think Alan said and Cindy, we're going to get our network running the way we needed to run with SPG -- that's going to be able -- that's going to offer us the opportunity to deliver more value to our customers through service that they need. The productivity that everyone expects and frankly, a long-term platform for growth across all the markets we serve.\nJon Chappell : Appreciate it. Thanks guys. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker : Thanks. Can you just unpack the pricing environment a little bit more kind of what do you expect in terms of core price on a relative basis fine for '22? Kind of how do we think about kind of accessorials kind of impacting the trajectory of RPU, especially in the back half of '22? Thanks.\nAlan Shaw : When you look at the indices out there, there's clearly a lot of inflation in the U.S. and global economy. There's a lot of demand -- and currently, we are servicing our customers. And we're going to continue to deliver value to them in the long term.  Price is a substantial portion of our plan. It is an intent focus of us going forward as we're able to deliver value to our customers, we want to be able to deliver value for our company and our shareholders. And that's the combination and the recipe that we're focused on.\nRavi Shanker : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe for you, Cindy. We've seen a couple of facilities have engaged shutdown. I hear you're trying to hire a lot more on labor just as everybody else across the industry. Is there an equipment shortage issue or maybe a volume balance that you're also trying to work through? And can that be can all that be solved by labor. What else has to go right to get things kind of back on balance? And then maybe a quick follow up for Ed. I hear you on the secular decline for coal in '22, probably a good place to start expectations. But given that coal inventory levels and the utility side are pretty low, could we see some potential restocking this year or maybe just not going to count on that. Thank you.\nJim Squires: I think your first question was on intermodal, and I'll start there. We are part of a network that spans not only in the United States but also the global economy. And we are working really hard to make ourselves more efficient on the intermodal side. That includes of course, everything we've done to deliver value to our customers by reconfiguring some of our terminals, adding chassis and working very, very closely with our customers.  As warehouses are able to develop more throughput and more productivity on their side, it will help us not only absorb the volume that wants to move that way, but also help us deliver additional value and improve the velocity of our own network. Same is true on the other end, on the port side as imports are able to become more fluid, we're able to deliver more value in conjunction with them. I think your second question was on coal. Would you mind repeating that part?\nBrian Ossenbeck : Sure. Just given where utility stockpiles are right now. Obviously, a lot depends how much demand there will be. But could there be a scenario where you see some restocking here on the utility side in the U.S. throughout the rest of the year?\nJim Squires: Still utility stockpiles are low. And it's really going to be a combination of the expectation for weather and demand. And frankly, the utility's appetite for inventory replenishment is going to dictate where that goes. I would characterize our position on coal pretty simply as we're trying to be very realistic but also opportunistic when it arises.\nBrian Ossenbeck : Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. \nScott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Any thoughts on just some of the extreme volume weakness to start the year and when it gets better? And then, Mark, maybe just some thoughts on some of the individual costs items for 2022, the outlook. I think you've got some tough comps on gains on sales. Maybe just some color on what you're assuming there?  And then lastly, anything in terms of first half or second half margin expectations would be helpful.\nJim Squires: I'll start and talk about volumes to start off the year. I think every U.S. railroad was slow out of the block so to speak. Intermodal was particularly, I think that was really a combination of some weather there around the holidays. A holiday that fell on a weekend and probably some COVID impact, either upstream or downstream with warehouses, et cetera, and truckers. But we've seen that demand ramp up since a slow start. On the commodity side of the business, on the bulk side, there's a lot of demand out there. And we're working hard to put every available resource against it.\nMark George : Yeah. And Scott, just to get to some of the cost items, typically, you would ask about say comp being [ph] on a per employee basis. And I think I guided this past year to 33 being the area to expect in that back half, and that's where it ended up being coming out for 2021.  And I would say it's probably going to be in that same vicinity here in 2022 is we're going to have a little bit of inflation in wages, but that will be largely offset by tailwinds from lower incentive comp assumptions. So that's probably the best way to think about the comp and ben line.  Purchased services had ramped throughout the year. As we told you, we started light in 2021. There were things being pushed out with some of the dynamics that were going on. So I would look at the kind of back half of 2021 as a good run rate to assume for 2022 there. Similarly, I would say where we ended up on materials, if we could avoid growth off of that 2021 base that would be great.  But you have to expect there's inflation that we're fighting there. So I would expect a little bit of creep there. And similarly, with rents kind of ramp toward the back half of the year now. And I think the current levels here where we're looking at rents, with network velocity down, it puts pressure on our rents. As the velocity starts to increase, we'll be taking on more volume, which will replace that. So I think pretty flat rents here from Q4 levels. So hopefully, that helps. And I think from a margin perspective. As Alan said, we're probably going to be sideways here to start the year. And we're going to see some sequential improvement from there as volume starts to come onboard the network -- more volume, I should say.\nScott Group : Just when you say sideways, can you just clarify maybe I missed what you meant?\nJim Squires: No. Sideways from the Q4 levels here of OR. We've got a 60.4% OR we posted. We had something similar there in Q3. I think we're going to go a little bit sideways from those levels until we start taking on more volume. And that's when we'll see that improvement in the operating ratio.\nScott Group : Okay, helpful. Thank you, guys. \nJim Squires: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKen Hoexter : Hey, great. Good morning. Jim, congrats on the next phase. I always enjoy the trips, and congrats to Alan and Ed as well.  Just Alan or Ed, just to clarify on those numbers on the volume side there. Volumes are down 14%. Can you parse that by the crew shortage, weather or COVID? Should we still expect to see negative first quarter volumes and then kind of ramping up. I just want to understand your kind of cadence as you look at those volumes, just conflicting with kind of the strong demand comments. And then, Cindy, you mentioned the locomotives and storage -- pulled out of storage. What do you still have left? And is that for the CapEx plan? Or is there still plenty as you pull those from there?\nJim Squires: Sure. I'll start with the volume comment. We're watching the volumes very closely and staying very close to our customers as this month has evolved and as this quarter continues. I think we're going to continue to see the relative acceleration of strength that we've seen so far on the intermodal side continue. And we're putting resources up against demand on the bulk side. And that's really where we expect to see TOP SPG help us deliver additional value.\nCindy Sanborn : And Ken, on the locomotive question. The engines that we pulled out were really kind of what we would call kind of a dynamic storage environment where we would have them as protect units in case. We had some sort of line outage that would prevent a terminal from operating on time with its outbound trains because the inbound trains were impacted from coming in.  And so we activate units. And then as the backlog came into the terminal, we would then lay down different units. So it was fairly dynamic. And it's a good process for us to have to help us deal with variability on the network that we have from time to time.  So essentially, we activated all of those units. And there are still units in storage that we would need to do a little bit more work on to activate them, but we have not done so.\nKen Hoexter : Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Spracklin : Yeah. Thanks very much, operator. Good morning, everyone. So on the operating ratio improvement of 50 to 100 basis points. Generally, that's something that given the pricing that you're achieving and some block and tackling that you do through the year that, that's a more kind of normalized annual level that we would expect to see of a railroad. Curious if that's your view on it. Are you in the steady state now level of operating ratio with any major improvements or closing the gap kind of done and really just kind of on that standard level? Or do you see upside to that 50 to 100 basis points if some of your initiatives take hold here in 2022 and allow you to achieve something better than that?\nAlan Shaw : Walter, the operating ratio guidance for this year is reflective of what Mark talked about in terms of just the trajectory of OR, particularly in the first half of the year. We're going to fix our service product. And we're going to get resources in place, and we're going to implement top SPG, which is going to make us less resource intensive. It's going to allow us to grow and provide value to the market and it's going to allow us to provide a very efficient product.  What that does is that gives you kind of a sideways OR in the first half of the year and then some pretty meaningful change in improvement in the second half of the year.\nWalter Spracklin : Okay. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. Just want to ask about technology. I guess, firstly, how impactful is it to support your SPG initiatives going forward? And I guess, along with that, do we assume technology investment starts to accelerate here, if that's the case or does it just get pivoted to different initiatives under that operational plan. Any color there?\nAlan Shaw : We've got a fairly robust operations planning model that we will utilize with TOP SPG. And frankly, TOP SPG is clean slate. We're going to put everything out on the table, we're going to redesign our network based on what's best for Norfolk Southern. And the outcomes of that are going to be a balance between service productivity and growth. We've -- Jim started us on our digital transformation.  And you've heard us talk about technology improvements and customer facing technology, technology improvements and our efforts to improve our efficiency on line of road and in our intermodal terminals. And we're going to continue that because we fully believe that, that is going to help us better utilize our resources and make us more consistent and more reliable going forward.  A great example is the one that Ed highlighted with NSites.\nAllison Poliniak: Does that mean that some of those -- I know productivity is important there, but does it -- some of those more customer-facing technology investments, do they start to take more precedence here? Or is it still very well balanced under all of that?\nAlan Shaw : It continues to be a balance. We will continue to recognize that our relationships with our customers are shifting from B2B to B2C. And Cindy has really helped us focus our technology on operations and productivity improvements as well.\nCindy Sanborn : And Allison, I would put the operating side or the operating improvements into 3 big buckets. They'd be mobility, automation and predictive analytics. And we've got a robust set of initiatives in each of those areas. And we've talked about them in the prior earnings calls. So that is a big part of our productivity opportunity.\nAllison Poliniak : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz : Yeah, good morning. So I guess I'll give you -- I've got kind of 2 broader things. The SPG, I'm wondering, we think about PSR having train schedule focus, running longer trains. I know there are a lot of different pieces to it and we have certain metrics that we'll watch to see how you're doing. Should we be considering different metrics for the output of SPG, train length velocity, dwell time. Are those going to be the kind of the right metrics or are there different things that we would look at for kind of outputs of SPG. And then I guess the other topic would just be on labor. Do you think you're at steady state on labor or when you talk about elevated attrition is there still risk that you don't make the progress because you're kind of fighting against that attrition and that remains a challenge? Thank you. \nAlan Shaw : I'll start first. With respect to the metrics for TOP SPG and what we'll be looking for as what we outlined to improve service, improve productivity and a platform for growth. And then I'll let Cindy talk about the specifics of that.\nCindy Sanborn : So Tom, from an SPG perspective, we think it's very PSR-based at its core. It's three main things. It's driving train length, it's driving balance and it's driving executability which then provides service. So as you put those together with SPG, meaning service productivity and growth, all three of those initiatives drive growth in the future as well as service in the present.  So we're really excited about it. We had a TOP21 in 2019. A lot has changed since 2019. And so it's really a good timing for us to take on this initiative as well.  Let me go to the labor side. I think we are an attractive company to work for. And we are able to attract people to work for us. And I think as I've described, our hiring plan is very robust as we head into the first quarter. But a lot of that work has been done in 2021. In fact, 6 straight months of increased conductor trainees. And 10 out of the last 12 months, we had an increase in conductor trainees.  So we're going to continue working towards getting onboarding folks that want to be here. We have folks that do come and are excited about working for us as a company, our benefits that we provide and enjoy working on the railroad. So we'll find those folks and bring them on board. It is a challenging environment, but we feel like we'll be able to get the people that we need.  And from a measurements perspective, when we look at dwell and train velocity, I mean, those really are the key ingredients to seeing how we're performing. We have a lot of internal measures, both customer-facing and network performance and specific customer measures. So I don't know that SPG changes the measurement outlook. I think what you will see is an improved service product. And you will see that in the measures that we -- that you can see publicly now.\nTom Wadewitz : Has the attrition stabilized? Can you give a quick comment on that? That seems like kind of a key variable.\nCindy Sanborn : It's about the same. I think it's very hard to predict. We looking at the challenges of last year and did a lot of introspection about what we could have figured out, what could we have done differently. And we have about -- it is right out of 100 hiring locations and saw some outpace out -- unusual attrition at 12 of those hiring locations.  And those are still challenging locations to -- from an attrition standpoint, but think we've got our hiring plans aimed to manage through that the best we can. We've got some that we're really seeing an improvement in our pipeline. Some are staying about the same, but we've got our great HR team working on sourcing folks even in a challenging environment because, again, we have a very compelling -- we're a compelling company to work for.\nTom Wadewitz : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Jim, Alan and Ed, congrats on all the transitions. I had a two part question. First for Cindy. Just curious when you think service can get back to pre-pandemic levels when you put all the pieces together. And then for Mark, when you look at the implied incremental margins, excluding the big gain on sale from last year of $55 million. It seems to imply incrementals in the mid-50s. I know the network challenges are weighing on that number. But any thoughts on where incremental margins could normalize once we get through some of these network challenges in the second half of this year and into 2023?\nCindy Sanborn : Justin, I'll start with service levels. I think we'll be challenged in the first quarter. I think we'll start to see some improvement in the second. And as our new employees come on board. And then I think we'll be back to planned levels of what velocity we have in our plan and what dwell we have in our plan. And that should look close to what you described as pre-pandemic levels. So that's what we're aiming for. And I think TOP SPG helps us with that as well.\nMark George : Yeah. And Justin, I would say to the incremental margin question, your math is right. That's the way it calculates. And look we have a little bit less tailwind than we did last year when you think about incrementals.  A little bit on the coal side. Coal pricing and coal volumes won't be as robust. We've got that property gain compare that also impacts the year-over-year look at the incrementals. And as volumes increase, some of the accessorials come down, and that is also an impact as well. And look, the inflationary environment is certainly stronger than it was last year, although we're hoping that incremental pricing will help mitigate that.  So that's -- those are really the drivers here and why you see the step down in incrementals from say last year full year to this year. Although incrementals in the fourth quarter is kind of consistent with what you're seeing in the guidance for next year.\nJustin Long: Okay. Thank you.\nMark George : You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Hey, thanks a lot. Hi, everyone. Mark, I just wanted to follow up on that question, maybe just ask it a little bit of a different way because I know there's a lot of focus on operating ratio on incremental margins which is perfectly valid. But the industry, and I think you guys are also kind of moving to more of an investment for growth phase. And so I'm just trying to think about maybe the right way to think about prospective performance is really about earnings growth potential and total earnings growth potential as opposed to just exclusively on operating ratio expansion.  And I'm wondering to get your thoughts on that. And it looks like kind of low double-digit earnings growth is what you guys are pointing to for this year? And if you think that type of level or trajectory is kind of sustainable over the course of many years.\nMark George : Yeah. Amit, the bottom line growth is obviously a function of margin expansion and the top-line growth. So as the runway for margin expansion lessens, you're going to have to rely more on top-line growth. And that's why there is a G in the SPG. We're looking to grow this business, and we're not waiting until we get to margins at the right level to do that.  So the incremental this year, for example, that we're guiding to. If we can outperform on the top-line and even get more revenue and more volume onto this railroad that should really help the incremental equation. So every extra point of revenue growth you get, I do believe, you'll have stronger incrementals.  And certainly, as we look out from 2022 and when we're back to where we want to be from a service level perspective, provided the external environment is supportive from an economic growth perspective, we would hope to be able to outperform on the top-line and have that be a primary catalyst for that bottom line growth in conjunction with continued improvement on the OR. Because you are going to have accretive incrementals. It's just I think your incrementals will be larger the larger your top-line growth is.\nAmit Mehrotra: So just if I understand what you're saying, I guess, the optics around the muted incrementals this year, the answer to your previous question, is really reflective of the first half. But the operating leverage in the business in terms of 60% to 70% incrementals, that's still the right way to think about prospective incrementals in a more growth year environment. Is that correct?\nMark George : I mean I'm not going to range bound it for the future. But yeah, I do believe incrementals should be better when we don't have some of the headwinds that we're dealing with this year.\nAmit Mehrotra: Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. \nMark George : Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Nolan : Yeah, thanks. I was a little curious on the coal side. Certainly, from what we've heard from some of your competitors, you have a lot more optimism for this year with respect to exports and just coal volumes in general. Is this something that you're hearing from your clients or just macro view, maybe just a differentiated opinion? I wonder if you could put a little color around that.\nEd Elkins : Sure. This is Ed. Thanks for the question. If you look at the futures, they're all pointing in a downward direction for '22 as it progresses and into '23. The indices are already down a little bit from where they were in the Q4. Mix is going to play a part of course.  And on the seaborne side, in particular, for export, I think there's 20 million tons of new capacity that's coming online globally. And while demand right now I think is being held up by some supply issues, will we keep up with that additional production that's coming online. We're very guarded on that.\nBen Nolan : Okay. All right. So it is just macro then. I appreciate it. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nBascome Majors : Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Alan, you've been at the railroad for 27 years. You've been in the marketing officer seat for 7. There's probably not a big customer you hadn't met with multiple times. So I know you're probably not going to have the traditional kind of 100 days to start the CEO role in a couple of months here in May when you take over. But can you give us a little view on really what your near term objectives are, and what constituencies you want to engage with when you do initially take the reins?\nAlan Shaw : Yeah. The near term objectives are improving service, continuing the phenomenal momentum that we've had with our efficiency. And when you provide a safe and efficient and reliable service product, you can grow. We've got this fantastic franchise that faces the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. economy.  We're positioned really well over the long-term. The folks that I've been spending the most time with right now have been our ops team. And it's the ops leadership and our craft employees out in the field. And I'm really engaging in conversations with them, I'm listening and getting their feedback on how we continue to focus on efficiency improvements and restoring our service levels to where we all want it. Because that's going to be a big boost to our efficiency and our margins as well, as Mark noted.\nBascome Majors : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kaufman with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question. \nJeff Kauffman : Thank you for taking my question. And congratulations, Jim. And congratulations, Alan on the executive changes. Just 2 quick modeling questions. I'll grab it on the same one. So did I understand you're right on the share repurchases going forward are more a function of over cash flow after dividends and free cash and that you're not really looking to lever up to repurchase shares? And then the second part of that, just any guidance on tax rate for 2022.\nMark George : Yeah. Jeff, that's exactly right. The share repurchase is a function of leftover cash. So as earnings grow we're also growing our CapEx, but whatever money is left over, being committed to our credit rating. Whatever money is left over, we distribute to shareholders in the form of dividends, which we've increased and share repurchase. So that's that.  And then with regard to the tax rate, we typically guide to 23% to 24%. And we're not anticipating any change to the corporate tax rate in 2022. So that maintains -- that guidance is maintained.\nJeff Kauffman : That\u2019s my one and half. Thank you \nMark George : Okay. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon : Hey, good morning, guys. Jim, I'd love to get your perspective on a couple of regulatory issues. Obviously, there's more discussions around the access to date, open access and hearings coming up in the next couple of quarters here. How worried should investors be about this issue? Can you help kind of frame your perspective on what the proposed changes could mean from a business impact standpoint for Norfolk Southern?  And then if you could also kind of comment a little bit around kind of what the objectives are around the responsive application filed in CPKCS? Like what is the size of the opportunity that you're seeing there from looking for more access over the Meridian and potentially more of the KCS? Thanks.\nJim Squires: To tell you what, David, let me take the first part of that regarding the STB proceedings in flight. And then I'll ask Alan to address the CPKC matter. With respect to the STB proceedings, we've made known to the STB that we oppose 7-Eleven forced access. I personally was in front of the vent sitting commissioners late last year and made the case with our team. Based on the potential for operational disruption, supply chains in flux, the outdated nature of the evidence in the record much of it years old. And we think stale.  And so we made our case. And we will continue to do so as these proceedings unfold. Alan, talk a little bit about CPKC.\nAlan Shaw : Yeah. So the STB provides us a form to protect our customers and our shareholders' interest. We've had a very constructive dialogue. And for us, it's really centered around the Meridian Speedway, which is part of the fastest route between the Southeast and the Southwest, which are the two fastest growing regions in the country.

            "content": "Thank you, Jim. As Jim noted, 2021 represents the culmination of our multiyear plan. And I'm pleased to share with you the progress we made in the fourth quarter.  As you see from our results on Slide 5, revenue growth of 11%, outpaced our expense increase of 8%, producing an 18% improvement in earnings per share and a fourth quarter record operating ratio of 60.4%. For the full year, revenues improved 14%, which more than offset the 6% increase in operating expenses. We delivered the hallmark 60% operating ratio for the full year, an improvement of 430 basis points over the adjusted full year 2020 result, and our sixth consecutive year of improvement. We are excited to share more details of our results. And you'll hear from both Cindy and Ed about work to iterate on the next phase of our thoroughbred operating plan that will serve as the framework for our continued progress on service, productivity and growth. Now first turn to Cindy for a review of our operations. Cindy. Thank you, Mark. Turning to Slide 24. I will wrap up with our 2022 expectations. As you heard from Ed, based on our assessment of economic indicators, we expect markets related to manufacturing and consumer activity to drive growth.  We expect total revenue to deliver upper single-digit growth with merchandise and intermodal both increasing solidly, and coal, resuming its long-term secular decline. We will develop and leverage our new TOP SPG operating plan to accelerate our service recovery and drive additional efficiency into the organization in support of Norfolk Southern's and our customers' growth. You'll hear a lot more about TOP SPG and our upcoming second quarter Investor Day.  From an operating ratio perspective, we expect the first half of this year to look similar to the back half of 2021, with robust demand and service improvement driving stronger performance in the second half of this year. With this positive momentum in revenue, productivity and efficiency and based on our current expense projections, we expect to achieve greater than 50 basis points of OR improvement in 2022 and we won't stop there. In addition, we expect a dividend payout ratio range of 35% to 40% and capital expenditures in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. We anticipate using remaining cash flow and financial leverage to repurchase shares.  As you've heard from Cindy, Ed and Mark, we are optimistic about service, productivity and growth in the year ahead. And we'll advance productivity initiatives to attract business to Norfolk Southern more profitably than ever. We are committed to further efficiency improvements to create long-term sustained value for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for your attention. We'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Good morning, Brandon. It's a continuation of our PSR journey. It's the next generation of it. We implemented TOP21 was really largely focused on our merchandise network. This is going to be focused on all of our service products. It's a comprehensive plan. We are really expecting and challenging ourselves and demanding of ourselves to have an output that delivers longer trains, a balanced network that's going to promote better resource efficiency, which is going to give us the room to grow. It's going to deliver an operating plan that our field can execute on a daily basis. So it's going to improve our service product as well. Thank you for the question. And it's an inflationary environment out there in the U.S. There's a lot of demand. The U.S. consumer wants to grow. And we intend on delivering value to our customers. So we expect as the year progresses, we're going to see a balance of volume and price that will accelerate as the year moves on. So, why don't you take the efficiency piece of that? And talk about what you view as the trajectory for operations and service improvements throughout the year? And then, Ed, maybe you can tackle the revenue implications. When you look at the indices out there, there's clearly a lot of inflation in the U.S. and global economy. There's a lot of demand -- and currently, we are servicing our customers. And we're going to continue to deliver value to them in the long term.  Price is a substantial portion of our plan. It is an intent focus of us going forward as we're able to deliver value to our customers, we want to be able to deliver value for our company and our shareholders. And that's the combination and the recipe that we're focused on. Walter, the operating ratio guidance for this year is reflective of what Mark talked about in terms of just the trajectory of OR, particularly in the first half of the year. We're going to fix our service product. And we're going to get resources in place, and we're going to implement top SPG, which is going to make us less resource intensive. It's going to allow us to grow and provide value to the market and it's going to allow us to provide a very efficient product.  What that does is that gives you kind of a sideways OR in the first half of the year and then some pretty meaningful change in improvement in the second half of the year. We've got a fairly robust operations planning model that we will utilize with TOP SPG. And frankly, TOP SPG is clean slate. We're going to put everything out on the table, we're going to redesign our network based on what's best for Norfolk Southern. And the outcomes of that are going to be a balance between service productivity and growth. We've -- Jim started us on our digital transformation.  And you've heard us talk about technology improvements and customer facing technology, technology improvements and our efforts to improve our efficiency on line of road and in our intermodal terminals. And we're going to continue that because we fully believe that, that is going to help us better utilize our resources and make us more consistent and more reliable going forward.  A great example is the one that Ed highlighted with NSites. It continues to be a balance. We will continue to recognize that our relationships with our customers are shifting from B2B to B2C. And Cindy has really helped us focus our technology on operations and productivity improvements as well. I'll start first. With respect to the metrics for TOP SPG and what we'll be looking for as what we outlined to improve service, improve productivity and a platform for growth. And then I'll let Cindy talk about the specifics of that. Yeah. The near term objectives are improving service, continuing the phenomenal momentum that we've had with our efficiency. And when you provide a safe and efficient and reliable service product, you can grow. We've got this fantastic franchise that faces the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. economy.  We're positioned really well over the long-term. The folks that I've been spending the most time with right now have been our ops team. And it's the ops leadership and our craft employees out in the field. And I'm really engaging in conversations with them, I'm listening and getting their feedback on how we continue to focus on efficiency improvements and restoring our service levels to where we all want it. Because that's going to be a big boost to our efficiency and our margins as well, as Mark noted. Yeah. So the STB provides us a form to protect our customers and our shareholders' interest. We've had a very constructive dialogue. And for us, it's really centered around the Meridian Speedway, which is part of the fastest route between the Southeast and the Southwest, which are the two fastest growing regions in the country. We're convinced that, that is only going to continue to grow. And we're going to make sure that we protect our shareholders and our customers' interest there. It's a big part of our plans moving forward."

            "name": "Jim Squires",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. I'm pleased to be joined by Alan Shaw, President; Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer, Ed Elkins, Chief Marketing Officer, and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer.  Let me start by acknowledging and thanking the entire NS team for the tremendous effort that's gone into the fulfillment of our financial targets established in our 3-year strategic plan. 2021 serves as the pinnacle of the plan and is marked by the achievement of our 60% full year operating ratio and record productivity levels across our operation. Through a multiyear effort, we delivered on our commitments, overcoming significant headwinds associated with first a freight recession and then a global pandemic over the course of our plan. In the past 3 years, we've produced industry-leading total shareholder return. We've grown EPS by 27%, reduced our operating ratio by 530 basis points and return nearly $10 billion back to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We met and exceeded our goals, albeit with a very different formula than originally anticipated, given the volume headwinds demonstrating our ability to adapt and innovate and our dedication to deliver upon our commitments. I'm so proud to be a part of this team and humbled to serve as its leader.  We're poised to build upon our momentum and write a new record book. The company is in rock solid position. And we have the right team to guide our next chapter of success. With that, I welcome Ed to his new role as Chief Marketing Officer and congratulate Alan on his appointment as President. It's my pleasure now to turn the discussion over to Alan for a detailed look at the fourth quarter and full year results. Alan? I think your first question was on intermodal, and I'll start there. We are part of a network that spans not only in the United States but also the global economy. And we are working really hard to make ourselves more efficient on the intermodal side. That includes of course, everything we've done to deliver value to our customers by reconfiguring some of our terminals, adding chassis and working very, very closely with our customers.  As warehouses are able to develop more throughput and more productivity on their side, it will help us not only absorb the volume that wants to move that way, but also help us deliver additional value and improve the velocity of our own network. Same is true on the other end, on the port side as imports are able to become more fluid, we're able to deliver more value in conjunction with them. I think your second question was on coal. Would you mind repeating that part? Still utility stockpiles are low. And it's really going to be a combination of the expectation for weather and demand. And frankly, the utility's appetite for inventory replenishment is going to dictate where that goes. I would characterize our position on coal pretty simply as we're trying to be very realistic but also opportunistic when it arises. I'll start and talk about volumes to start off the year. I think every U.S. railroad was slow out of the block so to speak. Intermodal was particularly, I think that was really a combination of some weather there around the holidays. A holiday that fell on a weekend and probably some COVID impact, either upstream or downstream with warehouses, et cetera, and truckers. But we've seen that demand ramp up since a slow start. On the commodity side of the business, on the bulk side, there's a lot of demand out there. And we're working hard to put every available resource against it. No. Sideways from the Q4 levels here of OR. We've got a 60.4% OR we posted. We had something similar there in Q3. I think we're going to go a little bit sideways from those levels until we start taking on more volume. And that's when we'll see that improvement in the operating ratio. Thank you. Sure. I'll start with the volume comment. We're watching the volumes very closely and staying very close to our customers as this month has evolved and as this quarter continues. I think we're going to continue to see the relative acceleration of strength that we've seen so far on the intermodal side continue. And we're putting resources up against demand on the bulk side. And that's really where we expect to see TOP SPG help us deliver additional value. To tell you what, David, let me take the first part of that regarding the STB proceedings in flight. And then I'll ask Alan to address the CPKC matter. With respect to the STB proceedings, we've made known to the STB that we oppose 7-Eleven forced access. I personally was in front of the vent sitting commissioners late last year and made the case with our team. Based on the potential for operational disruption, supply chains in flux, the outdated nature of the evidence in the record much of it years old. And we think stale.  And so we made our case. And we will continue to do so as these proceedings unfold. Alan, talk a little bit about CPKC. Thank you, everyone. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter."

            "name": "Ed Elkins",
            "content": "Thank you, Cindy. And good morning, everyone. Now beginning on Slide 13, I will highlight our results for the fourth quarter. Total revenue improved 11% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, as strong demand and favorable price conditions more than offset the 4% volume decline in the fourth quarter.  Volume was impacted by the continuation of the extraordinary global supply chain disruptions and slower network velocity. Pricing strength across all markets contributed to the 50% increase in revenue per unit and we reached record revenue per unit less fuel across all of our markets. This demonstrates our ongoing commitment to execute our yield up strategy and drive value for both our customers and our shareholders.  Within merchandize, volume growth in the fourth quarter was led by our Chemicals franchise, as rising economic activity drove demand for chemical products, particularly for crude oil and natural gas liquids. Gains in our Metals business also contributed to growth, with volume in these markets up 6% year-over-year on sustained high demand from the strengthening manufacturing sector.  Partially offsetting merchandize growth was a decline in automotive shipments which were down 9% year-over-year due to slower velocity coupled with strong comps in the fourth quarter of 2020 when the industry was boosted by pent up demand.  Merchandize revenue per unit increased 6% year-over-year, driving total revenue growth of 8% to $1.7 billion for the quarter. Revenue per unit less fuel for this market reached record level in the fourth quarter. We've demonstrated year-over-year growth in this metric for 26 of the last 27 quarters, which further demonstrates our ability to drive sustainable revenue growth.  Our Animal franchise continued to face pressure from supply chain volatility, resulting in a volume decline of 7% year-over-year. Strong consumer demand and elevated imports stressed the supply chains and exceeded drayage capacity and equipment availability. This negatively affected both our domestic and our international markets.  But despite these headwinds, we achieved record intermodal revenue in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year, and that was driven by increased fuel revenue storage revenue and price gains. Revenue per unit less fuel grew for the 20th consecutive quarter.  Now, turning to coal. Revenue increased 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, which was driven by price gains and higher demand in a tightly supplied market. Coal revenue per unit reached near record levels and increased 16% year-over-year. Our export markets continue to benefit from high seaborne coal prices, which increased the competitiveness of U.S. coals in the global market. Shipments of domestic mat and coke are particularly strong this quarter on higher demand to support steel production.  If you'll turn to Slide 14, full year 2021 revenue grew 14% to $11.1 billion on 5% volume growth. All of our markets posted gains, reflecting strong demand for our product coming out of the pandemic tempered by supply chain pressures experienced throughout the year. Revenue growth was strongest and our merchandize franchise, where all lines of business, but particularly metals and construction benefited from higher demand and favorable price conditions associated with the economic recovery. Intermodal growth was driven by elevated consumer activity and tight truck capacity.  Coal revenue increased on higher seaborne coal prices and growth in steel production activity. We reached record levels of both revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel. Both metrics were up year-over-year due to price gains, storage charges, and higher fuel revenue in the case of total revenue per unit. And as markets have evolved, we've leveraged favorable conditions to drive improvement for our bottom line.  Now, let's look ahead to our outlook for 2022 on Slide 15. We're optimistic that our business will continue to grow. Despite the ongoing uncertainty in the economy, we're increasingly confident that supply chain conditions, including rail network velocity will improve as the year progresses. Overall, the demand environment for our service strong. We're committed to working with our customers and channel partners to develop sustainable solutions to maximize our opportunities ahead. We remain focused on our ability to deliver value for our customers and leverage market conditions throughout 2022.  As Cindy explained, both our hiring plan and the development and implementation of TOP SPG will deliver increased fluidity, efficiency and network capacity as the year progresses. And our volume pattern will follow that same sequential improvement trend. This will allow our customers to provide additional value to their customers for their product and build a strong platform for future growth. Market conditions for our merchandize franchise are expected to be favorable, with several customers announcing expansions and the New Year that will create opportunities.  In addition, industrial production is projected to grow 4% in 2022, which will drive demand for most of our markets, particularly for our steel markets. Residential construction spending is forecasted to grow more than 6% this year, following the sharp increase in 2021 supporting continued gains in several of our industrial markets. U.S. light vehicle production is expected to reach 10.3 million units this year, which is approaching pre-pandemic levels of 2019. This recovery will have a positive impact on both our automotive and our metals volumes in 2022.  Demand for our intermodal markets is expected to remain favorable, despite continued headwinds associated with supply chain congestion, impacting our ability to capture new opportunities. These headwinds are expected to ease in the second half of the year, creating more favorable environs for growth. And furthermore a robust consumer economy elongated inventory replenishment cycles and a tight cut market support our growth plan.  Durable goods consumption is expected to improve 3%, and that's on top of the near record 19% growth in 2021. This also goes well for our intermodal franchise. Our outlook for coal is more guarded as some of the drivers of 2021 growth shows signs of easing in 2022 despite some potential opportunities in the near term.  Seaborne prices remain high. However, they have begun to decline, leading subdued optimism going into the New Year. Expected increases in global production will likely contribute to downward pressure on these seaborne coal prices and lower the demand for export coal.  In the utility markets, while there's been strength associated with higher natural gas prices, that upside will be determined by coal supply as production levels remain high. Now before I turn it over to Mark, I would like to highlight our new NSites portal on Slide 16. The pandemic has pushed manufacturers to redesign their supply chains in favor of certainty of supply and locating inventory closer to customers. Our best-in-class industrial development team is at the forefront of these efforts. And they launched an innovative solution to drive value for our customers and support development in the communities that we serve.  NSites is a comprehensive search tool for rail, search industrial sites and transload facilities on our network. It allows users to create customized search parameters to quickly identify industrial sites that meet their unique needs. And more importantly, this portal makes it easier to do business with NS and helps our customers make informed long-term investment decisions that will promote economic activity and create jobs. We're excited to provide this product to our customers and help them expand their business on Norfolk Southern.  Overall, we are grateful for our strong customer partnerships. And we look forward to growing our business in 2022 with a continued emphasis on improving our service and driving value for our customers and for our shareholders. Now I'll turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results. Thank you. And when we look out in 2022, what we see is really with the exception of coal, very healthy commodity markets. There's a lot of demand out there right now as we are able to deliver more payload capacity to our customers, they're going to move it.  And I've already said that we have a strong U.S. consumer, we have a record low inventory sales ratios. We believe that there's going to be continued demand, particularly for durable goods that will bode well for us and for our customers as we're able to deliver more and more value to them as the year progresses. Yeah. We stay very close to our markets and to our customers in those markets. And I think we have a pretty good handle on where the demand is. There's pretty strong demand really from every market that we serve currently. And what we intend to do is, as the year progresses again, we're going to be able to deliver more and more value to those markets and to those customers, whether it's on the bulk side, where we have strong demand or on the consumer product side, which includes both portions of our industrial products business and of course, our intermodal and automotive franchise. Well, I think Alan said and Cindy, we're going to get our network running the way we needed to run with SPG -- that's going to be able -- that's going to offer us the opportunity to deliver more value to our customers through service that they need. The productivity that everyone expects and frankly, a long-term platform for growth across all the markets we serve. Sure. This is Ed. Thanks for the question. If you look at the futures, they're all pointing in a downward direction for '22 as it progresses and into '23. The indices are already down a little bit from where they were in the Q4. Mix is going to play a part of course.  And on the seaborne side, in particular, for export, I think there's 20 million tons of new capacity that's coming online globally. And while demand right now I think is being held up by some supply issues, will we keep up with that additional production that's coming online. We're very guarded on that."

            "name": "Cindy Sanborn",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan and good morning. During the fourth quarter, headwinds from the tight labor market created acute operational challenges across several parts of our network. While working to overcome the workforce planning hurdles, we remain focused on leveraging productivity initiatives to move freight for our customers.  These efforts did bear fruit, but our service quality was significantly below where we needed it to be. I'm going to discuss with you today the strategic approach we are taking to change this. Turning to Slide 7, pronounced changes in business mix were evidenced by the unit volume decline 4%, while GTMs were up 1%. Productivity gains were key to handling volumes in the quarter as the transportation workforce contracted by 8%. The reduction in crew starts a 4%, growth in train weight of 10% and growth in train length of 8% were critical elements of this productivity formula as well.  There were active locomotive count increased by 5%. As the network slowed, we kept focused on efficiently deploying those locomotives on the larger trains, which helped drive the 3% improvement in fuel efficiency. As I mentioned a few moments ago, you can see the degradation of network fluidity on Slide 8. We regained a modest amount of ground over the holidays. And as we're entering the first quarter, our improvements have been sporadic as COVID related absences have more than doubled from where they were in December. Let me be clear, our top priority is to drive the service improvements our customers expect and need and we will get there. We are working very hard to leverage an increased hiring pipeline as well as productivity initiatives to drive our performance. Next, I'll provide more details on the hiring process on Slide 9. We've made significant progress in ramping up resources to improve the pace of hiring while pursuing productivity. And as shown on the slide, we are pulling 5 key levers to do so including: number one, incorporating additional recruiting and training resources to increase hiring; employees from across the company have volunteered to provide support and our principal training facility and it's all hands on deck.  Number two, streamlining the hiring and onboarding process. We trimmed weeks from the process of first identifying a candidate to have them on board. Three, increasing trainee pay and offering incentives such as signing, retention and referral bonuses. Four, lengthening and combining trains. We've made solid progress in this regard. And finally five, we're using a variety of techniques to optimize our existing crews, including realigning crew districts and making crew basis more fungible. Our people are getting creative and rising to the challenge. And resource additions are bearing fruit as we've on boarded over 3 times more conductor trainees in January than any month in 2021. These trainees will promote throughout the second quarter, which is when we expect to start improving train and engine service staffing levels.  We do expect to see some relief and critical crew bases during Q1, as trainees that started in 2021 became promoted. Though, we are still experiencing high levels of attrition in those same areas. On average we expect the number of certified train and engine employees in 2022, to approximate that of 2021 and are expecting GTMs per employee to increase. So when looking at the year as a whole, our plan is to leverage productivity gains to absorb volume growth, while getting the workforce rebalanced to drive improvements in service quality.  Let's unpack the productivity discussion a little more on Slide 10. We've improved average train weight and length 21% and 20% respectively since mid-2019, when TOP21 was launched. This has been a key to our success and will continue to be so going forward. Larger trains, reduced labor intensity, improved locomotive productivity, improved fuel efficiency, and provide our customers with a platform for growth. We have efforts in the pipeline to continue this trend.  First on the infrastructure front. In 2021, we launched work on 9 citing extensions, one of which was quickly completed and in service by the fourth quarter. Most of the others will be completed throughout 2022. Second, our very capital efficient and high performing DC to AC locomotive modernization program is ongoing. As a reminder, this is a dual purpose program to rebuild engines at the end of their life, while converting them to the latest and greatest technology.  In 2021, we improved our fleet composition to nearly 60% AC power and 65% of our road fleet is capable of distributed power. Both of these aid with running larger trains. Lastly, our operating plan and growth initiatives must be well aligned to add capacity to existing trains which brings me to Slide 11.  In 2022, we have already kicked off the next generation of our PSR-based operating plan which we are calling TOP SPG. While you may be familiar with NS's legacy of Thoroughbred Operating Plans, or TOP the next generation SPG represents a new era of service productivity and growth 3 equally important facets of our new operating plan. We are embarking on this next era because we have significant improvements that need to be made in each of these areas service, productivity and growth to reach our full potential.  We are taking a ground up approach to the development of the plan in order to explore what is possible when we remove historical constraints and take a fresh look at our business. We are leveraging lessons learned from the first 3 years of PSR operations under TOP 21. And using a rich data set to execute in a customer-centric collaborative process. We look forward to keeping you updated as this initiative unfolds throughout the year.  Thank you and I'll now turn it over to Ed. Yeah. Okay, Chris. So from a service standpoint, we are really focused on improving our availability of crew resources to help us with service. We had some accelerated attrition in several core locations of our network that we had to really increase the pipeline for those locations. And that's largely in place.  In fact, of the conductor trainees we have out right now, whether in classroom or in the field, 50% are aimed at those core locations. So as they onboard into the Q2 and the rest of the hiring plan that we have as well, I think we'll start to see our service measures improve and in the back half kind of accelerate. I would also add that TOP SPG is an accelerant as well as we take a look at our service product and take a look at our service plan. As Alan noted, will also be helpful as we think through train length balance for our crews and how we operate the railroad and improve executability, which is also a catalyst. And Ken, on the locomotive question. The engines that we pulled out were really kind of what we would call kind of a dynamic storage environment where we would have them as protect units in case. We had some sort of line outage that would prevent a terminal from operating on time with its outbound trains because the inbound trains were impacted from coming in.  And so we activate units. And then as the backlog came into the terminal, we would then lay down different units. So it was fairly dynamic. And it's a good process for us to have to help us deal with variability on the network that we have from time to time.  So essentially, we activated all of those units. And there are still units in storage that we would need to do a little bit more work on to activate them, but we have not done so. And Allison, I would put the operating side or the operating improvements into 3 big buckets. They'd be mobility, automation and predictive analytics. And we've got a robust set of initiatives in each of those areas. And we've talked about them in the prior earnings calls. So that is a big part of our productivity opportunity. So Tom, from an SPG perspective, we think it's very PSR-based at its core. It's three main things. It's driving train length, it's driving balance and it's driving executability which then provides service. So as you put those together with SPG, meaning service productivity and growth, all three of those initiatives drive growth in the future as well as service in the present.  So we're really excited about it. We had a TOP21 in 2019. A lot has changed since 2019. And so it's really a good timing for us to take on this initiative as well.  Let me go to the labor side. I think we are an attractive company to work for. And we are able to attract people to work for us. And I think as I've described, our hiring plan is very robust as we head into the first quarter. But a lot of that work has been done in 2021. In fact, 6 straight months of increased conductor trainees. And 10 out of the last 12 months, we had an increase in conductor trainees.  So we're going to continue working towards getting onboarding folks that want to be here. We have folks that do come and are excited about working for us as a company, our benefits that we provide and enjoy working on the railroad. So we'll find those folks and bring them on board. It is a challenging environment, but we feel like we'll be able to get the people that we need.  And from a measurements perspective, when we look at dwell and train velocity, I mean, those really are the key ingredients to seeing how we're performing. We have a lot of internal measures, both customer-facing and network performance and specific customer measures. So I don't know that SPG changes the measurement outlook. I think what you will see is an improved service product. And you will see that in the measures that we -- that you can see publicly now. It's about the same. I think it's very hard to predict. We looking at the challenges of last year and did a lot of introspection about what we could have figured out, what could we have done differently. And we have about -- it is right out of 100 hiring locations and saw some outpace out -- unusual attrition at 12 of those hiring locations.  And those are still challenging locations to -- from an attrition standpoint, but think we've got our hiring plans aimed to manage through that the best we can. We've got some that we're really seeing an improvement in our pipeline. Some are staying about the same, but we've got our great HR team working on sourcing folks even in a challenging environment because, again, we have a very compelling -- we're a compelling company to work for. Justin, I'll start with service levels. I think we'll be challenged in the first quarter. I think we'll start to see some improvement in the second. And as our new employees come on board. And then I think we'll be back to planned levels of what velocity we have in our plan and what dwell we have in our plan. And that should look close to what you described as pre-pandemic levels. So that's what we're aiming for. And I think TOP SPG helps us with that as well."

This more than offset an 8% increase in operating expense, which led to 140 basis points of operating ratio improvement to a fourth quarter record of 60.4%. Improvements in RPU, coupled with strong productivity led to a record Q4 operating income with growth of 15% or $145 million. And we set another record for free cash flow, up 30% or $642 million for the full year. Moving to a drill down of operating expenses on Slide 19. While operating expense grew $134 million or 8%. It is up less than 3% or $44 million, apart from fuel cost increases. The $90 million headwind for fuel is driven almost entirely by price. You'll see purchase services and rents of $46 million with the majority of the year-over-year increase driven by the same drivers we talked about on the Q3 call. Higher expenses associated with Conrail, higher technology spend associated with our technology strategy, higher drayage expense associated with more hourly drivers used to alleviate terminal congestion primarily in Chicago, and we continue to see inflationary pressure on lift expenses going forward as it relates to contractor labor availability. Moving on to compensation and benefits. It is up 2%, but you'll note the $33 million in savings from 6% lower headcount. And that more than offset increases in pay rates and overtime. Meanwhile, incentive compensation comparisons in the quarter are a headwind of $24 million. Materials claims and other expenses were all down year-over-year. Turning now to Slide 20. Taking a look at the rest of the P&L below op income, you will see that other income of $21 million is unfavorable year-over-year by $22 million, due in part to lower net returns from company-owned life insurance, but also fewer gains on the dispositions of non-operating properties.  Our effective tax rate in the quarter was in our expected range at 23% and similar to last year. Net income increased 13%, while earnings per share grew by 18%, supported by 3.3 million shares we repurchased in the quarter. Turning to full year highlights on Slide 21. As a reminder, these highlights are compared to adjusted results for 2020, which excludes both the non-cash charge for locomotive rationalization in 1Q and the impairment charge in 3Q. Increased demand across all markets and strong results through yield up resulted in 14% year-over-year revenue improvement.  Expenses increased at less than half that rate, up 6% compared to 2020 as we continued our operational transformation while responding to market changes. We produced record operating income of over $4.4 billion, up 28% or $961 million versus the adjusted 2020 results. And as Jim noted in his opening remarks, we brought our operating ratio down to 60.1%, a record milestone for our company. That is 430 basis points of year-over-year improvement in line with the guidance we provided. Rounding out the results, net income increased 27%, while diluted EPS increased 31%, augmented by our strong share repurchase program, enabled a record free cash flow that we will wrap with on Slide 22. Free cash flow is a record $2.8 billion for 2021, up 30% year-over-year and we reported a strong 93% free cash flow conversion for the year. Property additions were about $100 million lower than our $1.6 billion guidance due to timing issues related to the continued supply chain disruptions. This shortfall in 2021 will carry over into 2022.  The sharply higher profitability in the company in '21 allowed for an over $2 billion increase in shareholder distributions for the year. We had 2 dividend increases in 2021 and more than doubled our share repurchase spend. And I'll point out, we just increased our dividend again by $0.15 or 14% in 2022. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Alan. Yeah. And Scott, just to get to some of the cost items, typically, you would ask about say comp being [ph] on a per employee basis. And I think I guided this past year to 33 being the area to expect in that back half, and that's where it ended up being coming out for 2021.  And I would say it's probably going to be in that same vicinity here in 2022 is we're going to have a little bit of inflation in wages, but that will be largely offset by tailwinds from lower incentive comp assumptions. So that's probably the best way to think about the comp and ben line.  Purchased services had ramped throughout the year. As we told you, we started light in 2021. There were things being pushed out with some of the dynamics that were going on. So I would look at the kind of back half of 2021 as a good run rate to assume for 2022 there. Similarly, I would say where we ended up on materials, if we could avoid growth off of that 2021 base that would be great.  But you have to expect there's inflation that we're fighting there. So I would expect a little bit of creep there. And similarly, with rents kind of ramp toward the back half of the year now. And I think the current levels here where we're looking at rents, with network velocity down, it puts pressure on our rents. As the velocity starts to increase, we'll be taking on more volume, which will replace that. So I think pretty flat rents here from Q4 levels. So hopefully, that helps. And I think from a margin perspective. As Alan said, we're probably going to be sideways here to start the year. And we're going to see some sequential improvement from there as volume starts to come onboard the network -- more volume, I should say. Yeah. And Justin, I would say to the incremental margin question, your math is right. That's the way it calculates. And look we have a little bit less tailwind than we did last year when you think about incrementals.  A little bit on the coal side. Coal pricing and coal volumes won't be as robust. We've got that property gain compare that also impacts the year-over-year look at the incrementals. And as volumes increase, some of the accessorials come down, and that is also an impact as well. And look, the inflationary environment is certainly stronger than it was last year, although we're hoping that incremental pricing will help mitigate that.  So that's -- those are really the drivers here and why you see the step down in incrementals from say last year full year to this year. Although incrementals in the fourth quarter is kind of consistent with what you're seeing in the guidance for next year. You're welcome. Yeah. Amit, the bottom line growth is obviously a function of margin expansion and the top-line growth. So as the runway for margin expansion lessens, you're going to have to rely more on top-line growth. And that's why there is a G in the SPG. We're looking to grow this business, and we're not waiting until we get to margins at the right level to do that.  So the incremental this year, for example, that we're guiding to. If we can outperform on the top-line and even get more revenue and more volume onto this railroad that should really help the incremental equation. So every extra point of revenue growth you get, I do believe, you'll have stronger incrementals.  And certainly, as we look out from 2022 and when we're back to where we want to be from a service level perspective, provided the external environment is supportive from an economic growth perspective, we would hope to be able to outperform on the top-line and have that be a primary catalyst for that bottom line growth in conjunction with continued improvement on the OR. Because you are going to have accretive incrementals. It's just I think your incrementals will be larger the larger your top-line growth is. I mean I'm not going to range bound it for the future. But yeah, I do believe incrementals should be better when we don't have some of the headwinds that we're dealing with this year. Okay. Yeah. Jeff, that's exactly right. The share repurchase is a function of leftover cash. So as earnings grow we're also growing our CapEx, but whatever money is left over, being committed to our credit rating. Whatever money is left over, we distribute to shareholders in the form of dividends, which we've increased and share repurchase. So that's that.  And then with regard to the tax rate, we typically guide to 23% to 24%. And we're not anticipating any change to the corporate tax rate in 2022. So that maintains -- that guidance is maintained. Okay."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Meghan Achimasi Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Ms. Achimasi, please go ahead.\nMeghan Achimasi: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section.  Along with our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. Along those lines, recall that in the third quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of 99 million related to an equity method investment. So, we will speak to the quarterly results, excluding that charge. A full transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.\nJim Squires: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's third quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer, Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer, and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. Our third quarter results reflect a strong performance from the team. As we delivered third quarter records for operating ratio, net income, income from railway operations, and earnings per share. While volume held steady with last year, revenue grew an impressive 14%.  And our 60.2% operating ratio reflects a 230 improvement on a year-over-year adjusted basis. Our second best or our performance ever outpaced only by last quarter's 58.3% mark. In the midst of significance supply chain disruptions in labor shortages across the country, we're delivering upon our commitments. And we could not have achieved those milestones without the tireless work of our employees, who day-in and day-out keep our customers goods moving, safely and efficiently. To our employees, thank you for your efforts to keep our economy moving. Now let's turn to Cindy to go through our operations, Cindy.\nCindy Sanborn: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. In the quarter, we continue to successfully drive productivity improvement throughout the network. We work to be as efficient as possible as we adjusted to accommodate demand shifts and many of our markets. This quarter shows continued progress as we attack our cost structure while positioning ourselves for further improvement in both cost and service levels. The quarterly operating metrics on slide 6 clearly show that once again, we generated positive operating leverage on flat unit volumes and GTMs that were up 5%. While we're proactively hiring train crews, efficiency in all areas of our operations, including engineering, mechanical, and communications and signals enabled us to run the network with 7% fewer people in the quarter compared to a year ago.  Because assets drive activity, reducing the number of active locomotives was an important lever in managing the size of the workforce. Both train weight and train length continue to improve, driven by a focus on improving the productivity in our bulk network. Coal, grain and other single commodity unit trains offer real opportunity for gains through collaborating with our customers on operating trains with more cars per set and by doubling up existing trains over portions of their route. I expect we will show continued progress in the fourth quarter as we see the fruits of our efforts.  While strong coal traffic helped drive train weight more than length, train length continued to improve and set another quarterly record. After seven consecutive quarters of fuel efficiency improvements, we saw a modest deterioration this quarter despite the increase in train size as our horsepower leverage was challenged at times due to volatile traffic flows and we had modestly fewer of the very heavy, highly fuel-efficient trains. I'm pushing the team to respond more quickly in the phase of change and we're committed to closing the gap with our peers over time and are redoubling our efforts in this critical area.  As you can see on Slide 7, train speed and terminal dwell were generally flat versus second quarter and do not reflect performance at desired levels. While there were some effects from Hurricane Ida, those impacts were localized and I'm extremely proud of how the team, specially engineering and our signal forces helped us return our routes in Louisiana to operation and reopen the New Orleans gateway very quickly. As I mentioned last quarter, we are experiencing hiring and retention conditions that are increasingly challenging, especially in some of our more critical locations, and it is having an impact on our network.  Despite hiring all year long, attrition has been accelerating in each of the last two quarters in several of those critical areas. In many of these locations, we've been able to absorb the impact by executing upon productivity initiatives and this will be very much a part of the equation going forward as we grow capacity, which I'll talk about more in a moment. Some of the things we're doing to create relief, we've more than tripled our conductor trainee rank since the first quarter so that we can effectively back fill in critical areas.  We've implemented tools such as perfect attendance bonuses, referral bonuses, and signing incentives to improve the stickiness of our current and future workforce. And we continue to leverage the valuable go teams to quickly respond to business opportunities where needed. People are the backbone of the railroad, and we need to make progress on these initiatives to better manage the effects of a tight labor market. We are committed to having the right amount of resources in the right place at the right time, which will drive both cost control and service quality.  As our business mix continues to evolve, creating capacity across our market segments has become an even more significant area of focus as highlighted on slide 8. Some shippers are looking to take advantage of unexpected market opportunities by shipping extra volume. Others are looking for us to help them adjust to volatility coming from other parts of their supply chains and of course, all place a high value and service predictability. We're adjusting our network and operations to generate the various types of capacity that customers are looking for. For example, increases in both train sizes gives shippers extra lift without further demands on our crew base.  Train size increases often require connecting railroads, customers, and Norfolk Southern to change processes and we have found those process changes are worth the effort because they improve asset turns and capacity. We also continue to focus on terminal efficiency, whether helping to drive dwell at our biggest [Indiscernible] yard, Elkhart, to very low levels or tactically redirecting trains to intermodal terminals that have the capacity to unload quickly. Moving to Slide 9, I want to show how we can use these capacity efforts to drive productivity. We've had great success over the past two years driving train size.  And in doing so, have addressed a handful of infrastructure bottlenecks. Fast-tracking instead of siding improvements the first of which went into service at the end of the third quarter so we can keep making progress. Bigger trains unlocked by siding extensions helped drive locomotive utilization because it allows us to fully match train size to available pulling power. And because locomotives are at their most efficient when pulling hard, this is a key level to our fuel efficiency improvement.  While I've used locomotives and fuel as my primary example, capacity additions have a similar effect on recruit productivity, more cars per crew, asset turns, keeping trains moving with greater train capacity, and also helps our customers with improved train and car performance. On Slide 10, we are complementing our investment in physical capacity with a comprehensive technology strategy that makes our crews more efficient and our assets more productive. Virtually all of our routines signal and track maintenance is now scheduled via the mobile track authority app.  A process that used to be measured in minutes can now be accomplished in seconds. It is inherently more efficient than the radio process of the past and most importantly, safer because it reduces transcription errors. And the words of our Chief Engineer, the app has been a game changer for the productivity of his forces. We're doing the same with our mobile train reporting app, which enables our train crews to quickly report completed work and to receive updated customer work requests while en route. This takes a lot of hands out of the process including significant re-typing and delay and enables our crews to be more productive.  We're still early in the deployment of this application with rollout to the local trains that do the preponderance of pickups and set offs just beginning. The use cases for this technology in the field are numerous and driving adoption and innovation around this platform is a focal point that will allow us to capture additional benefit. The common use thread in these apps is that better information allows people to plan. Our track supervisors can better plan their schedule, knowing the availability of track time, and our customers can better plan their plain operations, in product pipeline with up-to-date shipment information. Now, I will turn it over to Alan.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we continued to execute on our growth plan, yielding double-digit revenue gains in each of our three markets, further demonstrating our ability to deliver value before our customers and shareholders. Beginning on Slide 12, I will highlight our results for the third quarter. We achieved total revenue of $2.9 billion representing a 14% increase from the same period last year despite flat volumes.  Our revenue performance this quarter was driven by significant gains in revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel, both reaching record levels with double-digit year-over-year growth. This reflects the success of our ongoing efforts the yield up and improve revenue quality, a strategy that enhances our long-term potential for revenue and margin growth as conditions improve. Revenue in our merchandise segment improved 10% year-over-year while volume increased 5%. Growth was led by our Chemicals franchise that benefited from recovering energy demand that drove higher shipments of crude oil and natural gas liquids.  Also contributing to merchandise growth was sustained strength of steel markets due to record high commodity prices and growth in manufacturing activity. Steel shipments were up an impressive 34% from the same period a year ago. Partially offsetting these gains were declines in shipments of finished vehicles and vehicle parts due to the ongoing semi-conductor shortage. This limited automotive production activity and further depleted finished vehicle inventories to new lows. Both revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel improved year-over-year due to price increases.  Our intermodal franchise experienced several headwinds related to supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted volume and our domestic and international business lines. In both segments, unprecedented demand from inventory restocking and consumer spending outpaced available capacity in the supply chain ecosystem. The combination of drayage shortages, warehouse productivity, equipment availability, labor force participation, and rail network fluidity, pressured intermodal volume throughout the quarter, resulting in a 4% year-over-year decline.  Overcoming these headwinds, we delivered revenue growth of 16% in the third quarter due to higher revenue from storage services, increased fuel surcharge revenue, and price strength. Coal revenue increased 32% in the third quarter as both domestic and global economies continued to recover from the pandemic and drive demand for electric power. Export coal shipments increased significantly as strong demand and record high seaborne prices, increased opportunities for U.S. producers. Utility volumes declined in the third quarter as coal supply was limited as some crossover tons moved into the higher-rated export market.  The mix shift from utility to export, coupled with price gains, led to a 20% increase in revenue per unit, less fuel for coal in the third quarter. A new record for the franchise. Moving to our Outlook on Slide 13, we expect the third quarter environment to continue through the end of the year. Strong consumer demand will continue while pressures from material shortages and labor issues remain, challenging global supply chains. Inventory levels remain at historic lows despite the continued push to replenish stock, providing a boost to transportation demand.  We remain confident in our ability to leverage our strengths in these market conditions and deliver robust revenue growth for the full year. We expect merchandise business will continue to benefit from recovering economic activity as conditions that limited business and recreational activities in the fourth quarter of last year have been much less impactful in the fourth quarter of 2021. We anticipate our markets for crude oil, natural gas liquids, and waste to experience higher volume as a result.  Ongoing demand for steel will also be a growth driver with forecast for industrial production up more than 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and steel prices currently above 1900 bucks a ton. A projected 4% year-over-year, fourth-quarter decline in U.S. light vehicle production will remain a headwind as the industry remains challenged by the chip shortage. Within intermodal, we continue to see strong demand from consumer spending and tightness in the truck sector. These favorable conditions are offset by constraints from supply chain congestion and equipment availability.  We are working closely with our customers and our channel partners to mitigate these challenges. However, we do not see meaningful improvement in these headwinds before the end of the year. Coal demand is expected to remain strong with extremely favorable market conditions. Although coal supply will be the governor on year-over-year growth, natural gas prices continue to climb and declining inventory levels leading into the winter months are the current focus of utility customers. Seaborne prices are a decade long highs in the export market, creating demand beyond capacity and supply abilities.  Overall, we're optimistic about the opportunities in the fourth quarter and confident in our ability to execute our plan, to generate value, and grow our business. Turning to Slide 14, there are several factors impacting the supply chain in which we participate. This includes external factor, such as the chip shortage and intensifying congestion in the intermodal supply chain. Coal supply availability continues to be a constraint to meet the higher demand in every market as both thermal and net production remained tight.  NSC is taking the action to mitigate some of these factors and effectively position us for revenue growth. As Drayage challenges affected international intermodal, we provided an alternative storage solution to our customers. We're working diligently to add chassis capacity to support demand and alleviate shortages across the supply chain. Last quarter, we outlined our plan to repair a portion of our chassis fleet that was impacted by a manufacturing defect. I appreciate the quick action and effort from our team and I'm pleased to report that this issue is effectively behind us.  As we have repaired and returned approximately 95% of the recall chassis back to service. We're also in the process of taking delivery of lease chassis to augment our fleet. We've added terminal capacity to support growth driven by e-commerce and a recovering economy, as well as reduced terminal congestion and improved network fluidity. We remain focused on growth opportunities across our network. We are continuously innovating to compete in $800 billion plus truck and logistics market as shown by our thoroughbred freight transfer or TFT service launched earlier this year.  TFT is one of our initiatives to drive growth by targeting opportunities for highway conversions to rail. This service combines the efficiency of our intermodal trains, the capacity of our boxcar assets, and the last mile flexibility of trucks to provide an innovative door-to-door service. We're also leveraging our sustainability advantage to propel long-term growth. The choice of transportation mode is one of the most powerful levers any shipper has to reduce the size of its carbon footprint, and we're working closely with our customers to deliver additional value through sustainability. We have proven our ability to deliver results despite challenging market conditions by providing innovative solutions that are customers value and position us for future market demands. I will now turn it over to Mark, who will cover our financial results.\nMark George: Thanks. On Slide 16, as Elon just detailed, revenues were up 14% on flat volumes. With operating expenses up 10% we delivered strong incremental margins leading to 230 basis points of operating ratio improvement, driving us to a Q3 record of 60.2% The improvement LN detailed and RPU, coupled with strong productivity led to record Q3 operating income with growth of 21% or nearly $200 million. And our free cash flow is also at record levels, a 33% increase during these 9 months compared to last year. Moving to slide 17, let's drill down into the change and operating expenses.  While operating expenses grew a 149 million or 10%, it's up only 4% or 67 million apart from fuel cost increases. The fuel cost increase of 82 million is driven mainly by price, but the 5% increase in GTMs also drove more consumption. You'll see purchase services up 35 million with a majority of the year-over-year increase in 3 areas. We have an increase in technology spend, which is consistent with our technology strategy, and you've heard a couple project examples in Cindy's remarks. There are also headwinds from Conrail operating expenses, and there are increases in intermodal costs.  More specifically, we had trucking costs associated with shuttling longer dwell containers to satellite parking lots in order to reduce congestion at our terminals and keep the freight moving. Lift expenses were actually up in the quarter despite fewer lifts and that is primarily because of inflation we absorbed on lift rates associated with contractor labor availability. This is an area we do expect to see continued inflationary pressure going forward. And we also absorbed costs in the quarter related to our chassis repairs. Moving on to compensation and benefits, it is up 5% which you'll note the $40 million in savings from 7% lower headcount that more than offsets increase in pay rates and overtime.  Meanwhile, incentive compensation comparisons in the quarter are a headwind of $43 million. Similar to what we reported in the second quarter, reflecting our strong 2021 financial outlook compared to lower accrual rates last year. Materials, claims, and other expenses were all down year-over-year. Turning now to slide 18, and looking at the rest of the P&L below operating income, you'll see that other income of 14 million is 25 million unfavorable year-over-year. And that is due almost entirely to lower net returns from Company-owned life insurance.  Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.6%, close to our federal and state statutory rates. But unlike Q3 last year where the rate was 21.9%, and benefited from tax advantages related to both Coly investment gains, and higher stock-based compensation. Net income increased by 17% while earnings per share grew by 22%, supported by 3.6 million shares, we repurchased in the quarter. Wrapping up with our free cash flow on slide 19. As I have mentioned, free cash flow is a record through nine months of 2021 at $2.3 billion buoyed by very strong operating cash generation and that translates into a 102% free cash flow conversion.  While property additions are trending a bit lower than run rate for our $1.6 billion guidance number, capital spend is never linear and we expect fourth quarter property additions will get us close to the 1.6 billion. Shareholder distributions through 9 months exceeds 3.2 billion, an increase of over 1.5 billion versus prior year, thanks to our higher dividend and a meaningful increase in our share repurchase activity. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jim.\nJim Squires: Thank you, Mark. We first demonstrated our commitment to sustainability with our visionary appointment of a Chief Sustainability Officer back in 2007, the first in the industry. And our efforts to support a low carbon supply chain have greatly accelerated since then. Building upon the momentum earlier this year with the approval of our science-based targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction and our launch of 500 million in green bonds in the second quarter, we are excited to report another set of milestones on our sustainability journey.  In August, we released our 2021 ESG report, our 14th annual report on corporate responsibility, highlighting the transformational role sustainability is having on our business as we further integrate sustainable practices into daily operations. We celebrated our 500th modernized locomotive unit in partnership with Wabtec in August and announced our collaboration with Progress Rail in September on a first of its kind, Tier four locomotive prototype for yard and terminal operations.  And just earlier this month, we announced our decision to purchase 100% renewable energy to power Company operations in Altoona and Reading, Pennsylvania. Our commercial and sustainability teams work hand-in-hand to provide demonstrable low-carbon solutions to a wide variety of current and prospective customers, providing a compelling value proposition as we convert more freight from truck to rail, simultaneously benefiting our customers, our communities, and our shareholders. Before we open the call to Q&A, I will take a moment to provide an update to our outlook based on the current economic environments.  As shared previously, we expect to achieve an operating ratio improvement above 400 basis points for the full year versus our adjusted 2020 results. And there's likely upside to the 12% year-over-year revenue growth as strength in our consumer oriented in manufacturing markets drive the majority of the growth. Newer-term upside in coal markets provides a boost for the balance of the year as well, though coal remains challenged in the long term. We're delivering on our financial commitments and remain focused on creating long-term sustainable value for our customers and shareholders. So, with that, we'll open the call to your questions. Operator.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, [Operator Instructions], a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. [Operator Instructions]. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, we will be limiting everyone to one question to accommodate as many participants as possible. Our first question comes from the line off Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl : Thank you, Operator, and good morning everybody. I wanted to talk a little bit about the pricing side, several of your peers have mentioned rising cost if you will, and the need to take pricing up another notch. I wanted to get your opinion on that and what Norfolk Southern's plans are for 2022.\nJim Squires : Thanks, Jason. Alan?\nAlan Shaw : Good morning, Jason. As you know, Jason, we price to the market. And right now, the market opportunities for our ability to price are pretty strong, and you've seen that with respect to our yields. You saw us in that [Indiscernible] of our top-line, earlier this year we're very confident in our ability to deliver 9% revenue growth as the demand environment and pricing environment strengthen, we bumped that up to at least 12%. Our primary competitor is truck and you saw that spot rates in the truck market were up 21% year-over-year in the third quarter.  As we have an opportunity to revisit our contracts and the relative value of our product, we're going to price the market as we've always done, which is why we've delivered RPU ex-fuel increases in intermodal for 19 consecutive quarters and in merchandise 25 of the last 26. As commodity prices go up, Jason, it also means more demand for that product as well, so we feel good about the demand and the pricing environment.\nJason Seidl : So, Alan, maybe can you remind us the percentage of your business that rolls over in 4Q and 1Q?\nAlan Shaw : It's a majority of the business rolls over in those two quarters, Jason. And as you know, about 50% of it rolls over every year. It's a good environment for us to revisit our price plan.\nJason Seidl : It seems to be, well, listen, appreciate the time, as always nice quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Jordan Alger with Goldman Sachs, please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alger : Yeah, hi. You talked a little bit about need to hire crews and the tough environment. One question of course is where [Indiscernible] headcount go from here, but maybe the right question is, in an optimal environment, how much headcount do you think you need? Are you okay where you're at or would you like a 1,000 more people, 500 more people? Thanks.\nCindy Sanborn : Good morning, Jordan. Thanks for the question. I think broadly, let me just put a broad perspective on it. We're really managing through a very disrupted labor market and it's been a challenge from the beginning of this year, but we've been able to really continue to find productivity improvements up to this point that the team I think has done a great job of and really, you're seeing it flowing through our financial results.  So, when I think about where headcount should be, it's really a function of volume that we have on the network as well as our productivity initiatives of which we have quite a few with longer trains and other opportunities for productivity. So, I think from where we are right now, we'd like to see headcount up maybe a little bit to take out some of the lumpiness of what we're seeing. But longer-term, we're going to be focusing on using technology and other things, focusing on continuing to bring that down. But at this point with where we are, we'd like to see it come up.\nJordan Alger : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz : Good morning. Wanted to get your thoughts on capacity expansion, I guess we could talk about intermodal or if you want to talk about broader network, and how that would translate to your view on volume growth in 2022. It seems to me that there's certainly areas where if you had more capacity or the system had more capacity, you'd have stronger volume and intermodal is obvious on that, but how you think about capacity additions in the network capacity? And is it reasonable to expect volume growth in 2022, supported by more capacity?\nJim Squires : Cindy, why don't you take the network side of that, the line of road side of the capacity question, then Alan talks about terminal capacity -- intermodal terminal capacity a little bit.\nCindy Sanborn : Sure. So, from a line of road perspective, as you know, Tom, we have had a discussion on these calls around siding extensions. We've gotten our first siding extension in service on the third quarter I mentioned that in my prepared remarks and we have about four, five more that are under your way and then studying some others to make sure we have good capability in our single-track locations, predominantly in the southern part of our network to be able to drive longer trains, and improve the capacity overall the network by taking total number of trains down because we can run longer trains.  The technology of distributed power has been an enabler for that. And also, as you know, we're doing DC to AC conversions that increased the fleet size of the capability of our fleet to do more of that. So, we really see some good opportunities to continue to allow for great throughput on our network.\nAlan Shaw : Tom, with respect to the intermodal terminals, we absolutely need to improve the throughput through the terminals. There's some self-help there that's running trains on time, that's making sure that we've got the right amount of labor in the terminals with our terminal contractors. It's the chassis issue. Now that was a headwind for us in the third quarter with the safety recall, we've addressed that. However, we're still short chassis. So, we're taking delivery of 1,100 lease chassis in the fourth quarter of this year. Our customers are short chassis too and so our -- so as the international community as well.  And that's really driven by the dislocation and the Drayage and in the warehousing community. If you look at a record, there's a record number of job openings and warehousing and trucking for each of the last 3months. And so that has put a lot of pressure on throughput through the intermodal terminals. We're working on things we can fix ourselves, as I talked about our own mitigation efforts, whether that's reopening a couple of terminals leasing chassis offering dual mission incentives to make the Drayage network more productive, and we're also working with our customers to see how we can help mitigate some of their own issues.\nTom Wadewitz : So, I guess to bring that to point though, are you optimistic about intermodal volume growth given what you see on the capacity side, in '22?\nAlan Shaw : Yes, because we've taken some very concrete steps to address what is under our control and we're hopeful that at some point the Drayage community gets a little healthier and the warehousing community gets healthier as well.\nTom Wadewitz : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI, please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Alan, sticking with you, you mentioned improving revenue quality, which I know has been a big focus for you guys over the years and capacity is clearly at a premium, not just in the rails, but in every part of the transport supply chain right now. Are you being increasingly more selective in the freight that you're willing to move right now, and attempt to maximize your capacity in the mix and margin associated with that? And if so, how does that play into your long-term volume outlook sacrificing yield potentially for volume?\nAlan Shaw : And John, part of yield up is -- it really is the heart of it is allocating resources to the market signals that we get which would indicate where the best home for those resources is. So that involves making sure that we're on-boarding the right type of business onto our network to make sure that we're not adding complexity. and may -- it's involves making sure that we are being compensated for the value of the product that we're delivering. And as you noted, our primary competitor is extremely stressed and truck just does not have the overflow capacity that rail does add into that environment more interest from our customer base on sustainability.  I was talking to a customer the other day about it. Effectively cut me off mid-sentence and said, yes, we all know that rail is much more sustainable than truck and we're doing everything we can to shift more towards rail. So, I think there is a prolonged opportunity to make sure that we continue to post improvements in our yields, I will tell you that one area in which I'm a little concerned is within the coal network with export prices is at record highs. I think it'd be irresponsible for us to feel like they're going to continue to rise into next year, so that might be an area in which you see a decline in yields.\nJon Chappell : That makes sense. Thanks, Alan.\nAlan Shaw : You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning everyone. I apologize you missed this, but can you unpack the yield growth you saw on the quarter in terms of core price versus as fuel charges versus next?\nAlan Shaw : Ravi, certainly the storage solution that we provided in the international community was a driver of RPU growth as was fuel surcharge. We also saw much better pricing environment in the third quarter than in the second which is of no surprise and we've got a lot of momentum with respect to the price.\nRavi Shanker : Okay. Maybe as a follow-up on just switching gears a little bit. How do you see the regulatory environment next year, particularly around price? And maybe as related question, can you and all the other rails have been cutting headcount of airbeds over the last several years, what would you say to shippers and other folks in the industry who will say that you cut too deep? And now that you're like you and everybody else are struggling to hire again that you maybe shouldn't have been this iteration to begin with. Obviously, hindsight 2020, who knew how the recovery will work out and such, but just again, trying to figure out from a regulatory perspective. Thanks.\nMark George : Well, let me take the second part of that first, and the first part second. We've been hiring aggressively since the beginning of the year and we've ramped that program up throughout the year. So, we're putting a lot of people into the pipeline, through the pipeline, and into the field even as we speak and we'll continue to do so. Recognizing that at least in some locations we are short of people and we need more help.  In terms of regulatory environments, I think it's worth emphasizing that there is a good deal of overlap between what we do and what the administration and Congress are seeking. That overlap is in the area of sustainability. It's widely recognized in Washington today, on both sides of the aisle, that rails are the sustainable ground transportation. And so, we see eye to eye with the administration on that. We're all about economic development and creating good jobs for people and helping the American economy growth.  That lines up very well with what the Administration and Congress are trying to do as well. Now we don't see eye-to-eye on everything where we disagree with policymakers. We maintain a very active dialogue and we make sure that our point-of-view, that our needs that our importance to the American economy are widely understood.\nRavi Shanker : Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. Jim, I guess following up from that, given that you guys are hiring, I guess that speaks to a pretty positive economic outlook in 2022, if I'm hearing that correctly. And I guess as you guys talk about improving to industry level of profitability, is that still a lot of leverage on the labor line looking forward? Is it fuel efficiency? I guess where do you guys see the biggest opportunities there? Thank you.\nJim Squires : Sure. Well, let me say first, we're proud of the progress our employees have achieved so far this year. We still have a quarter ago, but we're definitely on pace to hit our goals. So, a 60 OR run rate for the full year. Now, the work isn't done. We recognize that we have more room to run and we're very excited about the margin opportunities, the topline growth we see ahead. We will continue to drive the OR lower over time and continue to narrow the gap. We'll do that with the combination of revenue growth and continuing emphasis on productivity and sustainability throughout our Company. That includes fixed costs, that includes employee productivity, that includes fuel efficiency, and so on and so forth. Cindy, anything to add?\nCindy Sanborn : And I would add, Brandon, I put in my prepared remarks, technology is really very helpful to us, whether it's mobile applications that allow employees to be in the field as opposed to managing the input of information through a traditional keyboard and computer, whether it's predictive analytics, or whether it's pure automation. So, there's plenty of opportunity out there in addition to train length and some of the other items that I've already talked about so far.\nBrandon Oglenski : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi, please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee : Thanks. Good morning. Maybe a question about service on the broad supply chain dynamics. So, Cindy you talked about some of the efforts that you guys are undertaking to improve service and bounce back a little bit here, obviously the quarter you saw some pretty decent metrics as well, but maybe mixed with what Alan talking about in terms of the supply chain, I guess. When do we see Norfolk service improve in a meaningful way, which may be a precursor to a broader improvement in the supply chain. I think Alan, you talked about maybe nothing before the end of the year, but maybe what are some early indicators that the process is turning and maybe some of this congestion can clear, we can improve fluidity a little bit more, which could be like I said, the precursor to a broader congestion alleviation.\nCindy Sanborn : So as far as where we are with service levels that are public that I talked through, I really see the big linchpin obviously being people talk about this is a fairly disrupted labor environment. We are hiring people as Jim has noted, but bringing on people to is long lead time. We have streamlined our process of hiring and also our training process, taking advantage of technology to do so. Obviously, we're not going to compromise safety and anything that we do with that regard.  And we've doubled our class size since July, and other type issues, but that is going to be what is helps us to see our service levels improve. But this is a national issue and it's, as you know, it's at the heart of the supply chain overall and it's been building for a while and it'll for months and will probably take a few months for us to clear through it. Alan, I don't know if you have anything you want to add.\nAlan Shaw : Yeah. With respect to the entire supply chain ecosystem, Chris, warehouses are full, that's what we're hearing from the VCOs and I think you need about 25% more warehouse capacity than what's available right now. There's just not enough labor and frankly, a lot of the e-commerce giants are just now in the process of starting to hire for the holiday season. So, I think that's going to further stress things going forward. We've actually seen in Chicago a degradation in street dwell on international chassis over the last couple weeks which would indicate more stress in that first-mile, last-mile component of the ecosystem.\nChris Wetherbee : Okay. Now, let's talk to your customers its maybe next year is what they are talking, any indication for them in terms of timing and what they feel a little bit better?\nAlan Shaw : That we're not because it's reliant on so many different components. And frankly, they are asking about the same questions that Cindy addressed too. We've got to improve our piece of it. We're having those discussions with them, but they also recognize there are a lot of things out there that are well outside of our control that -- I just don't have a timeline as to when the Drayage community and the warehouse community start to get healthy. On the top 20 Drayage markets, most of them are in our footprint. That's a great thing that those have stronger inter-modal franchises. It also indicates that when the Drayage community is stressed, it puts stress on our network.\nChris Wetherbee : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck : Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to maybe follow up on that last question with you, Alan. Just thinking about the pace of truckload conversion industrial development project wins. Clear, there's a ton of demand but challenging across the board as you've been talking about. Can you go into the TFT product you mentioned a little bit more? Is that something you feel like you need to expand to get more of a door-to-door service, a longer-term, and to make some of these wins really sticky? And do you think you have to do any more investment there in terms of maybe looking at some more non-rail assets?\nAlan Shaw : Hey, Brian, yes, TFT for us is a pilot program. We're in our early stages, but it seems to be working pretty well. We're testing it with a number of customers who have been displaced out of the LTL market. It uses a lot of the principles of PSR. i.e., you're putting boxcars on intermodal trains and we're using a partnership with a Drayage Company to provide first mile, last mile. It's all part of our core competency of innovating to provide solutions that will drive highway to rail conversions in that $800 billion plus on truck and logistics market. The regulatory agency over us took notice of it and it's complementary of our efforts to try and drive truck conversions. So, we're happy with the way it's going so far, we're testing in a number of markets, and its indicative of our overall strategy.\nBrian Ossenbeck : And is this something you think could scale pretty rapidly in '22 or is this more of a pilot borne sort of out necessity of the current market?\nAlan Shaw : I think long term, there's going to be opportunity for this because e-commerce isn't going away. And it's an -- e-commerce itself is a boon to us as well because it's highly intermodal intensive, so it's something that we're going to continue to look to add dots on the math in a low-risk manner to drive incremental margins.\nBrian Ossenbeck : That's helpful. Thanks, Alan.\nAlan Shaw : Welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Mark, maybe can you give us some thoughts on operating ratio sequentially in fourth quarter and any thoughts on specific cost items in fourth quarter heading into next year? And then Jim, it sounds like we haven't heard anything from the rails, this earnings season with respect to vaccine mandates and just curious your thoughts there and what you guys are doing there.\nJim Squires : Okay thanks Scott, I'd tell you what. Why don't I take that one first and then we'll turn it over to Mark for some color around the expense trends? With respect to the vaccine mandate, I want to say first that we sincerely hope we won't lose a single Norfolk Southern employee as a result of that government mandate. That our employees will consider vaccination, those who aren't vaccinated or will seek an accommodation to which they're entitled under the law. And we didn't -- this was not our idea.  This was not our initiative. This is a mandate. We reviewed it, we studied it, we went over it with a fine-tooth comb. We determined that we are federal contractors subject to the executive order because of the business we do for the Department of Defense, principally. So, we're now in the process of implementing it. It's a tough, tough decision that's being imposed on some of our employees as result. And we do regret that, however, we will follow the law it clearly applies to us and we must comply. The next -- and so what's next?  Well, we get the information out there, we owe it to our employees to be clear about where we stand and what happens next, leading up to the December 8th deadline, for compliance. And people have time to go out because we announced we would comply with a lot and we've given people time to get vaccinated or to seek a combinations. We're keeping a very close eye on the impact. As I said, I hope we don't lose a single person. We will probably lose some employees as a result of this, and we will work very hard to retain them first, but second, if not back fill the positions with all of the measures that Cindy went through. So, Mark talks a little bit about the expense trends.\nMark George : Okay. Scott well, first I think your question was on sequential OR as we look to Q4. Q3, we did see pretty much stable OR from Q2 when you back out the land size, the outside land sale that we had last quarter. Now, I think we were about 10 basis points better in Q3 and then we expect to see basically more of the same here in Q4. Some of that will depend on the volume outlook as we navigate through Q4. I do expect that the expense side of the equation should also be roughly consistent with what we've experienced here this quarter. So, it just feels like more of the same as we close out the year and that will stay on this run rate like we talked about earlier in the year.\nScott Group : That's helpful. Jim, if I can just follow-up on the vaccine for one second, it feels like everyone in the supply chain thinks that this is a bad idea or at least a big risk to further supply chain disruptions. Do you -- is there any sense that maybe some of this could get pushed out or get rid of all together? Just everyone seems to think it's a big risk.\nJim Squires : Well, our strategy there is to communicate clearly with policymakers about the risks associated with this mandate. And we are doing that actively making sure that those who are in a position to shift policy understand what the consequences could be. So, whether we agree with the policy or not, we are implementing it as we are required to do. Meanwhile though, we're being very vocal about the possible consequences to the supply chain into the economy.\nScott Group : Okay. Thank you, guys, appreciate it.\nJim Squires : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets, please proceed with your question.\nWalter Spracklin : Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to go back to the regulatory question, just wondering if there's a bit of a silver lining here with supply chain issues and the very delicate capacity environment that this is proven our entire transportation network has. And my question, I guess for Jim here is things like reciprocal switching which eat up capacity with a different objective in mind but the consequence being that it eats up capacity.  You think the White House is aware of this? Do you think the regulator recognizes that messing around with regulations that have one intended consequence could have a very detrimental one when it comes to capacity? And some of the indications that we've seen with where the capacity is, puts that at significant rise. Do you think that's lost on regulators or is it something that they become acutely aware of now and we'll rethink when potentially designing new forms of regulation for the railroad industry?\nJim Squires : I think you summarized it pretty well and there is growing sensitivity and awareness on the part of regulators and policymakers regarding the state of affairs in the supply chain and the risks associated with policy changes at this stage. So, my message is at the very least, consider gathering additional facts and evidence, the supply chain is clearly in flux right now. It's in the process of reorganizing itself. And we don't know exactly what the future freight supply chains will look like. So given that the record in the relevant STB proceedings predates all of that, Well, let's at least take a look at the current state of play and understand how freight is moving in today's economy and may move in the future before we make any significant policy changes.\nWalter Spracklin : And just on that, Jim, as the supply chain reorganizes, do you think that railroads will either play an increasing role outside of their railroad focus? In other words, if despite your best efforts to -- unsuccessful efforts to manage your own house, if there's problems outside of your control, outside of your rail network that you could address if you had ownership of that, those pieces further up or down the supply chain, would that be something Norfolk Southern would consider? Would you be willing to or interested in going outside of your rail focus if it means addressing some of these items that are outside of your control?\nJim Squires : I would put it this way, we see so many opportunities within our core business today. So many opportunities for organic growth by converting freight from road-to-rail within our existing franchise that we don't see a need to pursue businesses or approaches outside our core. And our -- because there are always risks associated with that M&A risks. And we've tried that before if you look back in history, as a Company, we have owned trucking companies, and it didn't end well. So, our approach will be to stick to what we know best and what we can execute best in light of all of the growth opportunities we have there.\nWalter Spracklin : Great. I appreciate the time. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank, please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra : Thanks, Operator. Hi, everybody. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Alan, I just wanted to follow up on the intermodal growth questions. Obviously, we fully appreciate the challenges around Drayage capacity and labor and warehouses, but just looking from the outside in, it's pretty clear that there have been some market share shifts in intermodal with your direct competitor, I mean, the chassis issue explains some of it but -- and we've seen a little bit of an uptake in weekly intermodal carloads but there seems to be some market share shift.  I don't know if you think that's a fair characterization and if it is what the root cause is and you can address it but if you can just talk about that and then my second question, Mark, you use to provide this great slide that talked about fixed versus variable cost structures that spoke to the underlying operating leverage in the business. The cost structure is very different today, given all the good work that Cindy and her team have done, and the whole team have done. So, I was wondering if you can baseline where you think incremental for the business are given maybe a more volume variable cost structure than maybe you had a couple of years ago? Thanks a lot.\nAlan Shaw : Amit, I'll cover the first part. In third quarter there were some international customer specific actions with respect to inland positioning of containers that impacted our volumes. That's starting to unwind itself and so we should see a lift there. Although ultimately international volumes are going to be limited by the Drayage community in the warehouse community. Look, we've got the most powerful inter-modal franchise in the east. It is a key component of our plan going forward to lever that in the growth. We prove we can do it over time. 2017, our revenue was up 11%, 2018, it was up 18%. 2019, it was only down 2% of freight recession and it pivoted back to growth in the fourth quarter of 2019. This year, our revenue in intermodal was up 21%. And compared to 2016, our revenue and intermodal was up 43%. So, we know it's a growth driver for us. We've done a lot to improve the productivity there, just in the third quarter, our train weight and intermodal was up 4%, and yet our train length was down 3%. So, we've got some things that we need to do to provide our customers with a better service product, they deserve that. We also have some things that we need to do at the interface with our customers to collaborate with them on making the whole supply chain efficient.\nJim Squires : And Amit I'll talk to you about the incremental. We had 57% incremental this quarter. I just want to point out that would be about 70% if not for the headwind that higher fuel costs and surcharge gave to us this quarter. So, I think 70% core incremental margins are pretty good, think we've done a very good job absorbing a lot of the volume growth that we've seeing this year without adding on the resource side. In some areas like you mentioned, the incremental costs have risen in some lines and other lines they've held flat.  We have changed our cost structure quite a bit in the past year and so some of those drivers have varied, but I do think net-net. If we can continue, our goal here is to continue holding costs while we absorb incremental volume, and certainly the drop-through from other revenue contributors. We're going to be in a good place to help drive us down on OR side.\nAmit Mehrotra : Got it. Okay, very helpful. Thank you very much.\nJim Squires : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter : Thanks. Good morning, Jim and team. Great job on the improvement. Just a follow on the -- you gave before the fourth quarter outlook on operating ratio. I want to make it maybe just a little bit bigger. Your initial thoughts on 2022, just given your 400 basis points at least to improvement in the OR, maybe the scale of gains. And I know you're not necessarily going to give a number and you don't typically, but maybe Cindy, can you talk about the additional cost programs that you're looking at? Alan, maybe your thoughts on growth off of this higher base and the sustainability, just maybe some general thoughts to put a picture on to '22 as we close out '21.\nMark George : Sure. Okay, Ken, thanks. Let me take the first part of that. As we look ahead to 2022 and beyond, as I said, we're committed to driving the OR lower and we will do that with a combination of emphasis on productivity and efficiency measures at top-line growth and there's a lot of opportunity for us there. We will get more specific with our 2022 guidance in January when we come back to you with our fourth quarter results. In terms of a new set of goals for the longer term, look for an investor day on our part sometime next year, we'll get more specific with regard to dates in the near future, but it's clearly time for us to update our longer-range goals as well.\nCindy Sanborn : So that one would to be a broken record, but we do have opportunities for train size and train length with our siding extensions, but also with growth being able to add into existing trains. We see great opportunity there to continue productivity and great drop-through on that revenue. We've got extra board consolidations, we just constricting crews\u2019 segments, those types of activities. Continued improvement in our processes and I can't underemphasize technology. I made some remarks about that earlier, so I will repeat those but the technological advances that will help us be much more efficient in how we go about our business. So, there's a great pipeline and I'm more excited about getting on the railroad.\nAlan Shaw : Ken with respect to the macro environment, it's unique. it's uniquely strong. You take a look at inventory sales ratios, historic lows, and the consumer has a healthy balance sheet and the retail sales are continuing to increase, and so that inventory replenishment cycle is going to be a boost to transportation demand into -- well into 2022. PMI is at 61.1, which is well into expansionary phase right now.  Demand is really high, the only thing that indicates that -- the only thing holding it back are supply chain challenges, which we need to help solve for our customers. Steel prices are at record highs in a really weak auto environment. So, think about what happens when auto starts a rebound next year and potentially you sprinkle on a little bit of an infrastructure package before the mid-terms, and we expect to have a robust environment for our product, our consumer-facing franchise next year as well.\nKen Hoexter : Really helpful. Appreciate the insight. Jim, just can I just get one quick clarification? The impact on KCISCP on the Meridian Speedway, I presume there is no impact to your network and your ability to run in everything. I just wanted -- if you have any quick thought on that.\nJim Squires : Let me say this, we will be active participants in that STB proceeding, making sure that our customers interests and our shareholders\u2019 interests are protected throughout that. We expect to continue to utilize the Meridian Speedway as part of our joint venture, and to grow traffic on that line is a great route. The best of the business from LA, Long Beach to the Southeast. So, we think that the transaction you mentioned gives us every opportunity to grow our business over that line.\nKen Hoexter : All right. Appreciate the climate around. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens, please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long : Thanks. Good morning. Mark, I wanted to clarify a statement you made earlier about volumes in the fourth quarter. Were you saying your expectation is for fourth quarter volumes to be relatively flat sequentially? And then on the headcount topic, Cindy, you mentioned that you'd like to see headcount up a little bit. So similar clarification question is the expectation that headcount will be up slightly in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis. And thinking about next year is the view that if hypothetically we see volume growth in the low to mid-single-digits headcount is probably up a little but not up as much as volumes.\nMark George : Justin I'll tackle your volume question first. I mean, if you do look at the weekly trends on volumes, you'll see it's going sideways and we expect that trend to carry out for the full quarter.\nCindy Sanborn : On headcount, just not -- what I would basically say is that we are still seeing attrition and replenishment as part of our challenge. So, we will probably see headcount come down a little bit more. I would like to see it stabilize and come up because we are replenishing for attrition. So that's what I'm -- my comments earlier. What that meant, are still our long-term opportunities, again, on train size and other process improvements on our terminals and few other things I mentioned are very, very beneficial to us to bring headcount down longer-term.\nJustin Long : Okay. So, headed into 2022, just hypothetically, if you saw low to mid-single-digit volume growth, do you feel like you could keep headcount relatively flat sequentially, given the productivity opportunity?\nCindy Sanborn : I think it would be along those lines, maybe up slightly, but yes, along those lines.\nJustin Long : Okay. Great, thank you so much.\nCindy Sanborn : Not one for one, Justin I guess it's what I'm getting at.\nJustin Long : Understood. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Nolan : Thanks. I wanted to circle back a little bit on the coal front and appreciating that next year could be very different than the market is at the moment. But if natural gas prices were to stay high internationally, and there's good demand, I was just curious if you can maybe frame in what your potential to grow is within the coal franchise if the market conditions persist as they are currently.\nAlan Shaw : Ben, as you know, the market is quite hot and cold, whether it's domestic or export. And really where our volumes are limited right now is on the production side. This has been a severe under-investment, frankly, in anything that generates our BTUs over the last 18 months. The export market, prices are at record highs. China, the early indications are that China will need to import more coal next year than it did this year. It's China's trade tensions with Australia are certainly driving some of the demand on higher prices. But China hasn't shown any indication to unwind that.  And with steel prices so high, China can afford to pay the higher input prices. So, we're watching it very closely. We're continuing to talk to our customers about it. We're hopeful that production improves and we would certainly be a beneficiary of that. Just, you take a look at, in the utility market. Coal burn is up 73 million tons this year, but coal shipments are up 16 million tons. So that kind of tells you what's going on there. Stockpiles, at least in our region are down 55% year-over-year. So there just is not enough production to satisfy the demand with all the geopolitical issues that are going on, and then as the substitute fuels being so -- priced so high right now, as you noted.\nBen Nolan : Right. Perfect. I appreciate the color. Thanks. [Indiscernible]\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes in line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nBascome Majors : Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. One point of clarification, can you share the current sense of vaccination rate across the network?\nJim Squires : Well, we're gathering that information as we speak, and -- but it's really too soon to tell. We will have a better sense of that in the next month or so and we'll be better positioned to understand what the impact could be, what the attrition as a result of the government mandate might be. So, we're keeping a very close eye on that.\nBascome Majors : Thanks for that, Jim and I want to clarify some of the labor situation more broadly. Cindy, could you -- is there a way you could frame how the attrition is picking up in focus on any regions or functions where it's been most acute. In any feedback you're getting is to why people are leaving or where they're going, just to understand the problem you're dealing with. Thank you.\nCindy Sanborn : [Indiscernible] in a couple of buckets. One bucket is where we have a very, very tight labor market broadly in the region. And that is affecting those [Indiscernible] employees finding alternative places to work, as well as being very difficult to find new conductor training. And there's a corridor too that it's affecting us more broadly in the Midwest part of our network in that particular scenario.  And then there's the scenario where we're able to generate trainees and bring them in, they are not quite the numbers that we like. And we have some attrition of those trainees little higher than our historical norm. So that has affected us being able to continue that replenishment type pipeline like we'd like. So, we saw this, starting in the third quarter and we've increased the number of people in our pipeline in those locations where we're able to track folks to are really good Company here by about 240%.  And we've also seen conductor trainees increased by about actual training on the property increased by about 53%. So, that's a different kind of bucket. Now, we are -- we have doubled the class size since probably June, and we expect to also add additional class size in classes by the end of the year to again, attract those in the door and allow for that train process to occur, but there's a lag time here, is what I'm really telling you. And so, we see that persisting into the first part of 2022.\nBascome Majors : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon : Thanks, Operator. And good morning, team. Mark, I'd like to talk a little bit about intermodal profitability. I want to make sure I understand what the drop-through is on some of the fee revenue? Should we be thinking that's cost-neutral right now? And then if you think about where rates are sort of ex-fuel or ex-surcharges, are you getting enough to cover some of those costs you mentioned around terminal costs and things like that? What I'm really trying to get at here is if we think about contribution from intermodal today, should we be expecting that to be limited by some of the supply chain disruptions and fee issues? And that it will accelerate from here or are we already starting to see some of that improvement sort of in contribution from intermodal in the OR development during -- despite the fact that we have these supply chain disruptions?\nMark George : Thanks, David. So, look, I think one way to think about intermodal is we've increased our profitability considerably over the past decade as we've grown volumes and we've been able to demonstrate value to our customers and basically bring our pricing up to where it should be. So, I would say that incremental intermodal business brings to it -- brings with it a creative OR, and we feel like that will continue. It will continue to accrete to the business as we grow our intermodal business. We're providing more and more solutions to our customers, including, the storage service solutions that we've really built up during this period of intense supply chain congestion. So, we are finding new ways to make that business even more profitable.\nDavid Vernon : And should we expect that to accelerate as things start to loosen up across the supply chain into '22 and '23?\nMark George : Yeah. I think as we get more fluidity in that network and we can take on more volume, because I think the volume is out there. We just need the entire ecosystem to start moving again and loosen up. And I think we have the capacity. We can start moving more and more volume, and there'll be changes, perhaps between -- you might not have quite as much storage revenue, but you'll have more on the volume side. And so overall we feel good about our intermodal prospects for the future. It's a great franchise. We've got the capacity, we've got terminals in the right locations, and we're -- we got great partners on the -- channel partners on the intermodal side. So, we're feeling good about our position.\nDavid Vernon : Alright, thanks for the time, guys.\nMark George : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nCherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. On International intermodal, could you talk about whether you're seeing volumes start to divert to the East Coast to avoid the congestion on LA, Long Beach currently whether customers are planning to do more of that as the union contract negotiation on the West Coast gets closer. And just if that create different capacity challenges when you get the volume directly on the East Coast versus via interchange with the Western roads.\nAlan Shaw : Cherilyn, as you noted, customers are seeking optionality. Both short-term and long-term on their supply chain and port diversity is an approach that retailers are employing. We've seen a prolonged shift from West Coast to East Coast over the last 10, 15 years, such that a majority of our international business either originates, or terminates on an East Coast port. The East Coast ports right now are faring much better than LA, Long Beach. I saw something the other day where LA, Long Beach had 96 vessels stacked up outside.  We'll see some more business move over to the East Coast. We've proven the ability to handle that, and handle that well. And one of our -- take a look at our inland port up at Greer, and we pulled 760,000 trucks off the highway since that opened in 2013. And one of our highest volume orders is between Atlantans and Savannah. So, to short-haul moves however, with that added revenue density and incremental volume on existing trains service that Mark and Cindy talked about earlier, it's proven successful for us and for our customers.\nCherilyn Radbourne : Thank you. That's all for me.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our Q&A session. I will turn the floor back to Mr. Squires for any final comments.\nJim Squires : Thank you, everyone for your questions today, we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we continued to execute on our growth plan, yielding double-digit revenue gains in each of our three markets, further demonstrating our ability to deliver value before our customers and shareholders. Beginning on Slide 12, I will highlight our results for the third quarter. We achieved total revenue of $2.9 billion representing a 14% increase from the same period last year despite flat volumes.  Our revenue performance this quarter was driven by significant gains in revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel, both reaching record levels with double-digit year-over-year growth. This reflects the success of our ongoing efforts the yield up and improve revenue quality, a strategy that enhances our long-term potential for revenue and margin growth as conditions improve. Revenue in our merchandise segment improved 10% year-over-year while volume increased 5%. Growth was led by our Chemicals franchise that benefited from recovering energy demand that drove higher shipments of crude oil and natural gas liquids.  Also contributing to merchandise growth was sustained strength of steel markets due to record high commodity prices and growth in manufacturing activity. Steel shipments were up an impressive 34% from the same period a year ago. Partially offsetting these gains were declines in shipments of finished vehicles and vehicle parts due to the ongoing semi-conductor shortage. This limited automotive production activity and further depleted finished vehicle inventories to new lows. Both revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel improved year-over-year due to price increases.  Our intermodal franchise experienced several headwinds related to supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted volume and our domestic and international business lines. In both segments, unprecedented demand from inventory restocking and consumer spending outpaced available capacity in the supply chain ecosystem. The combination of drayage shortages, warehouse productivity, equipment availability, labor force participation, and rail network fluidity, pressured intermodal volume throughout the quarter, resulting in a 4% year-over-year decline.  Overcoming these headwinds, we delivered revenue growth of 16% in the third quarter due to higher revenue from storage services, increased fuel surcharge revenue, and price strength. Coal revenue increased 32% in the third quarter as both domestic and global economies continued to recover from the pandemic and drive demand for electric power. Export coal shipments increased significantly as strong demand and record high seaborne prices, increased opportunities for U.S. producers. Utility volumes declined in the third quarter as coal supply was limited as some crossover tons moved into the higher-rated export market.  The mix shift from utility to export, coupled with price gains, led to a 20% increase in revenue per unit, less fuel for coal in the third quarter. A new record for the franchise. Moving to our Outlook on Slide 13, we expect the third quarter environment to continue through the end of the year. Strong consumer demand will continue while pressures from material shortages and labor issues remain, challenging global supply chains. Inventory levels remain at historic lows despite the continued push to replenish stock, providing a boost to transportation demand.  We remain confident in our ability to leverage our strengths in these market conditions and deliver robust revenue growth for the full year. We expect merchandise business will continue to benefit from recovering economic activity as conditions that limited business and recreational activities in the fourth quarter of last year have been much less impactful in the fourth quarter of 2021. We anticipate our markets for crude oil, natural gas liquids, and waste to experience higher volume as a result.  Ongoing demand for steel will also be a growth driver with forecast for industrial production up more than 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and steel prices currently above 1900 bucks a ton. A projected 4% year-over-year, fourth-quarter decline in U.S. light vehicle production will remain a headwind as the industry remains challenged by the chip shortage. Within intermodal, we continue to see strong demand from consumer spending and tightness in the truck sector. These favorable conditions are offset by constraints from supply chain congestion and equipment availability.  We are working closely with our customers and our channel partners to mitigate these challenges. However, we do not see meaningful improvement in these headwinds before the end of the year. Coal demand is expected to remain strong with extremely favorable market conditions. Although coal supply will be the governor on year-over-year growth, natural gas prices continue to climb and declining inventory levels leading into the winter months are the current focus of utility customers. Seaborne prices are a decade long highs in the export market, creating demand beyond capacity and supply abilities.  Overall, we're optimistic about the opportunities in the fourth quarter and confident in our ability to execute our plan, to generate value, and grow our business. Turning to Slide 14, there are several factors impacting the supply chain in which we participate. This includes external factor, such as the chip shortage and intensifying congestion in the intermodal supply chain. Coal supply availability continues to be a constraint to meet the higher demand in every market as both thermal and net production remained tight.  NSC is taking the action to mitigate some of these factors and effectively position us for revenue growth. As Drayage challenges affected international intermodal, we provided an alternative storage solution to our customers. We're working diligently to add chassis capacity to support demand and alleviate shortages across the supply chain. Last quarter, we outlined our plan to repair a portion of our chassis fleet that was impacted by a manufacturing defect. I appreciate the quick action and effort from our team and I'm pleased to report that this issue is effectively behind us.  As we have repaired and returned approximately 95% of the recall chassis back to service. We're also in the process of taking delivery of lease chassis to augment our fleet. We've added terminal capacity to support growth driven by e-commerce and a recovering economy, as well as reduced terminal congestion and improved network fluidity. We remain focused on growth opportunities across our network. We are continuously innovating to compete in $800 billion plus truck and logistics market as shown by our thoroughbred freight transfer or TFT service launched earlier this year.  TFT is one of our initiatives to drive growth by targeting opportunities for highway conversions to rail. This service combines the efficiency of our intermodal trains, the capacity of our boxcar assets, and the last mile flexibility of trucks to provide an innovative door-to-door service. We're also leveraging our sustainability advantage to propel long-term growth. The choice of transportation mode is one of the most powerful levers any shipper has to reduce the size of its carbon footprint, and we're working closely with our customers to deliver additional value through sustainability. We have proven our ability to deliver results despite challenging market conditions by providing innovative solutions that are customers value and position us for future market demands. I will now turn it over to Mark, who will cover our financial results. Good morning, Jason. As you know, Jason, we price to the market. And right now, the market opportunities for our ability to price are pretty strong, and you've seen that with respect to our yields. You saw us in that [Indiscernible] of our top-line, earlier this year we're very confident in our ability to deliver 9% revenue growth as the demand environment and pricing environment strengthen, we bumped that up to at least 12%. Our primary competitor is truck and you saw that spot rates in the truck market were up 21% year-over-year in the third quarter.  As we have an opportunity to revisit our contracts and the relative value of our product, we're going to price the market as we've always done, which is why we've delivered RPU ex-fuel increases in intermodal for 19 consecutive quarters and in merchandise 25 of the last 26. As commodity prices go up, Jason, it also means more demand for that product as well, so we feel good about the demand and the pricing environment. It's a majority of the business rolls over in those two quarters, Jason. And as you know, about 50% of it rolls over every year. It's a good environment for us to revisit our price plan. Tom, with respect to the intermodal terminals, we absolutely need to improve the throughput through the terminals. There's some self-help there that's running trains on time, that's making sure that we've got the right amount of labor in the terminals with our terminal contractors. It's the chassis issue. Now that was a headwind for us in the third quarter with the safety recall, we've addressed that. However, we're still short chassis. So, we're taking delivery of 1,100 lease chassis in the fourth quarter of this year. Our customers are short chassis too and so our -- so as the international community as well.  And that's really driven by the dislocation and the Drayage and in the warehousing community. If you look at a record, there's a record number of job openings and warehousing and trucking for each of the last 3months. And so that has put a lot of pressure on throughput through the intermodal terminals. We're working on things we can fix ourselves, as I talked about our own mitigation efforts, whether that's reopening a couple of terminals leasing chassis offering dual mission incentives to make the Drayage network more productive, and we're also working with our customers to see how we can help mitigate some of their own issues. Yes, because we've taken some very concrete steps to address what is under our control and we're hopeful that at some point the Drayage community gets a little healthier and the warehousing community gets healthier as well. And John, part of yield up is -- it really is the heart of it is allocating resources to the market signals that we get which would indicate where the best home for those resources is. So that involves making sure that we're on-boarding the right type of business onto our network to make sure that we're not adding complexity. and may -- it's involves making sure that we are being compensated for the value of the product that we're delivering. And as you noted, our primary competitor is extremely stressed and truck just does not have the overflow capacity that rail does add into that environment more interest from our customer base on sustainability.  I was talking to a customer the other day about it. Effectively cut me off mid-sentence and said, yes, we all know that rail is much more sustainable than truck and we're doing everything we can to shift more towards rail. So, I think there is a prolonged opportunity to make sure that we continue to post improvements in our yields, I will tell you that one area in which I'm a little concerned is within the coal network with export prices is at record highs. I think it'd be irresponsible for us to feel like they're going to continue to rise into next year, so that might be an area in which you see a decline in yields. You're welcome. Ravi, certainly the storage solution that we provided in the international community was a driver of RPU growth as was fuel surcharge. We also saw much better pricing environment in the third quarter than in the second which is of no surprise and we've got a lot of momentum with respect to the price. Yeah. With respect to the entire supply chain ecosystem, Chris, warehouses are full, that's what we're hearing from the VCOs and I think you need about 25% more warehouse capacity than what's available right now. There's just not enough labor and frankly, a lot of the e-commerce giants are just now in the process of starting to hire for the holiday season. So, I think that's going to further stress things going forward. We've actually seen in Chicago a degradation in street dwell on international chassis over the last couple weeks which would indicate more stress in that first-mile, last-mile component of the ecosystem. That we're not because it's reliant on so many different components. And frankly, they are asking about the same questions that Cindy addressed too. We've got to improve our piece of it. We're having those discussions with them, but they also recognize there are a lot of things out there that are well outside of our control that -- I just don't have a timeline as to when the Drayage community and the warehouse community start to get healthy. On the top 20 Drayage markets, most of them are in our footprint. That's a great thing that those have stronger inter-modal franchises. It also indicates that when the Drayage community is stressed, it puts stress on our network. Hey, Brian, yes, TFT for us is a pilot program. We're in our early stages, but it seems to be working pretty well. We're testing it with a number of customers who have been displaced out of the LTL market. It uses a lot of the principles of PSR. i.e., you're putting boxcars on intermodal trains and we're using a partnership with a Drayage Company to provide first mile, last mile. It's all part of our core competency of innovating to provide solutions that will drive highway to rail conversions in that $800 billion plus on truck and logistics market. The regulatory agency over us took notice of it and it's complementary of our efforts to try and drive truck conversions. So, we're happy with the way it's going so far, we're testing in a number of markets, and its indicative of our overall strategy. I think long term, there's going to be opportunity for this because e-commerce isn't going away. And it's an -- e-commerce itself is a boon to us as well because it's highly intermodal intensive, so it's something that we're going to continue to look to add dots on the math in a low-risk manner to drive incremental margins. Welcome. Amit, I'll cover the first part. In third quarter there were some international customer specific actions with respect to inland positioning of containers that impacted our volumes. That's starting to unwind itself and so we should see a lift there. Although ultimately international volumes are going to be limited by the Drayage community in the warehouse community. Look, we've got the most powerful inter-modal franchise in the east. It is a key component of our plan going forward to lever that in the growth. We prove we can do it over time. 2017, our revenue was up 11%, 2018, it was up 18%. 2019, it was only down 2% of freight recession and it pivoted back to growth in the fourth quarter of 2019. This year, our revenue in intermodal was up 21%. And compared to 2016, our revenue and intermodal was up 43%. So, we know it's a growth driver for us. We've done a lot to improve the productivity there, just in the third quarter, our train weight and intermodal was up 4%, and yet our train length was down 3%. So, we've got some things that we need to do to provide our customers with a better service product, they deserve that. We also have some things that we need to do at the interface with our customers to collaborate with them on making the whole supply chain efficient. Ken with respect to the macro environment, it's unique. it's uniquely strong. You take a look at inventory sales ratios, historic lows, and the consumer has a healthy balance sheet and the retail sales are continuing to increase, and so that inventory replenishment cycle is going to be a boost to transportation demand into -- well into 2022. PMI is at 61.1, which is well into expansionary phase right now.  Demand is really high, the only thing that indicates that -- the only thing holding it back are supply chain challenges, which we need to help solve for our customers. Steel prices are at record highs in a really weak auto environment. So, think about what happens when auto starts a rebound next year and potentially you sprinkle on a little bit of an infrastructure package before the mid-terms, and we expect to have a robust environment for our product, our consumer-facing franchise next year as well. Ben, as you know, the market is quite hot and cold, whether it's domestic or export. And really where our volumes are limited right now is on the production side. This has been a severe under-investment, frankly, in anything that generates our BTUs over the last 18 months. The export market, prices are at record highs. China, the early indications are that China will need to import more coal next year than it did this year. It's China's trade tensions with Australia are certainly driving some of the demand on higher prices. But China hasn't shown any indication to unwind that.  And with steel prices so high, China can afford to pay the higher input prices. So, we're watching it very closely. We're continuing to talk to our customers about it. We're hopeful that production improves and we would certainly be a beneficiary of that. Just, you take a look at, in the utility market. Coal burn is up 73 million tons this year, but coal shipments are up 16 million tons. So that kind of tells you what's going on there. Stockpiles, at least in our region are down 55% year-over-year. So there just is not enough production to satisfy the demand with all the geopolitical issues that are going on, and then as the substitute fuels being so -- priced so high right now, as you noted. Cherilyn, as you noted, customers are seeking optionality. Both short-term and long-term on their supply chain and port diversity is an approach that retailers are employing. We've seen a prolonged shift from West Coast to East Coast over the last 10, 15 years, such that a majority of our international business either originates, or terminates on an East Coast port. The East Coast ports right now are faring much better than LA, Long Beach. I saw something the other day where LA, Long Beach had 96 vessels stacked up outside.  We'll see some more business move over to the East Coast. We've proven the ability to handle that, and handle that well. And one of our -- take a look at our inland port up at Greer, and we pulled 760,000 trucks off the highway since that opened in 2013. And one of our highest volume orders is between Atlantans and Savannah. So, to short-haul moves however, with that added revenue density and incremental volume on existing trains service that Mark and Cindy talked about earlier, it's proven successful for us and for our customers."

            "name": "Jim Squires",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's third quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer, Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer, and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. Our third quarter results reflect a strong performance from the team. As we delivered third quarter records for operating ratio, net income, income from railway operations, and earnings per share. While volume held steady with last year, revenue grew an impressive 14%.  And our 60.2% operating ratio reflects a 230 improvement on a year-over-year adjusted basis. Our second best or our performance ever outpaced only by last quarter's 58.3% mark. In the midst of significance supply chain disruptions in labor shortages across the country, we're delivering upon our commitments. And we could not have achieved those milestones without the tireless work of our employees, who day-in and day-out keep our customers goods moving, safely and efficiently. To our employees, thank you for your efforts to keep our economy moving. Now let's turn to Cindy to go through our operations, Cindy. Thank you, Mark. We first demonstrated our commitment to sustainability with our visionary appointment of a Chief Sustainability Officer back in 2007, the first in the industry. And our efforts to support a low carbon supply chain have greatly accelerated since then. Building upon the momentum earlier this year with the approval of our science-based targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction and our launch of 500 million in green bonds in the second quarter, we are excited to report another set of milestones on our sustainability journey.  In August, we released our 2021 ESG report, our 14th annual report on corporate responsibility, highlighting the transformational role sustainability is having on our business as we further integrate sustainable practices into daily operations. We celebrated our 500th modernized locomotive unit in partnership with Wabtec in August and announced our collaboration with Progress Rail in September on a first of its kind, Tier four locomotive prototype for yard and terminal operations.  And just earlier this month, we announced our decision to purchase 100% renewable energy to power Company operations in Altoona and Reading, Pennsylvania. Our commercial and sustainability teams work hand-in-hand to provide demonstrable low-carbon solutions to a wide variety of current and prospective customers, providing a compelling value proposition as we convert more freight from truck to rail, simultaneously benefiting our customers, our communities, and our shareholders. Before we open the call to Q&A, I will take a moment to provide an update to our outlook based on the current economic environments.  As shared previously, we expect to achieve an operating ratio improvement above 400 basis points for the full year versus our adjusted 2020 results. And there's likely upside to the 12% year-over-year revenue growth as strength in our consumer oriented in manufacturing markets drive the majority of the growth. Newer-term upside in coal markets provides a boost for the balance of the year as well, though coal remains challenged in the long term. We're delivering on our financial commitments and remain focused on creating long-term sustainable value for our customers and shareholders. So, with that, we'll open the call to your questions. Operator. Thanks, Jason. Alan? Cindy, why don't you take the network side of that, the line of road side of the capacity question, then Alan talks about terminal capacity -- intermodal terminal capacity a little bit. Sure. Well, let me say first, we're proud of the progress our employees have achieved so far this year. We still have a quarter ago, but we're definitely on pace to hit our goals. So, a 60 OR run rate for the full year. Now, the work isn't done. We recognize that we have more room to run and we're very excited about the margin opportunities, the topline growth we see ahead. We will continue to drive the OR lower over time and continue to narrow the gap. We'll do that with the combination of revenue growth and continuing emphasis on productivity and sustainability throughout our Company. That includes fixed costs, that includes employee productivity, that includes fuel efficiency, and so on and so forth. Cindy, anything to add? Okay thanks Scott, I'd tell you what. Why don't I take that one first and then we'll turn it over to Mark for some color around the expense trends? With respect to the vaccine mandate, I want to say first that we sincerely hope we won't lose a single Norfolk Southern employee as a result of that government mandate. That our employees will consider vaccination, those who aren't vaccinated or will seek an accommodation to which they're entitled under the law. And we didn't -- this was not our idea.  This was not our initiative. This is a mandate. We reviewed it, we studied it, we went over it with a fine-tooth comb. We determined that we are federal contractors subject to the executive order because of the business we do for the Department of Defense, principally. So, we're now in the process of implementing it. It's a tough, tough decision that's being imposed on some of our employees as result. And we do regret that, however, we will follow the law it clearly applies to us and we must comply. The next -- and so what's next?  Well, we get the information out there, we owe it to our employees to be clear about where we stand and what happens next, leading up to the December 8th deadline, for compliance. And people have time to go out because we announced we would comply with a lot and we've given people time to get vaccinated or to seek a combinations. We're keeping a very close eye on the impact. As I said, I hope we don't lose a single person. We will probably lose some employees as a result of this, and we will work very hard to retain them first, but second, if not back fill the positions with all of the measures that Cindy went through. So, Mark talks a little bit about the expense trends. Well, our strategy there is to communicate clearly with policymakers about the risks associated with this mandate. And we are doing that actively making sure that those who are in a position to shift policy understand what the consequences could be. So, whether we agree with the policy or not, we are implementing it as we are required to do. Meanwhile though, we're being very vocal about the possible consequences to the supply chain into the economy. Thank you. I think you summarized it pretty well and there is growing sensitivity and awareness on the part of regulators and policymakers regarding the state of affairs in the supply chain and the risks associated with policy changes at this stage. So, my message is at the very least, consider gathering additional facts and evidence, the supply chain is clearly in flux right now. It's in the process of reorganizing itself. And we don't know exactly what the future freight supply chains will look like. So given that the record in the relevant STB proceedings predates all of that, Well, let's at least take a look at the current state of play and understand how freight is moving in today's economy and may move in the future before we make any significant policy changes. I would put it this way, we see so many opportunities within our core business today. So many opportunities for organic growth by converting freight from road-to-rail within our existing franchise that we don't see a need to pursue businesses or approaches outside our core. And our -- because there are always risks associated with that M&A risks. And we've tried that before if you look back in history, as a Company, we have owned trucking companies, and it didn't end well. So, our approach will be to stick to what we know best and what we can execute best in light of all of the growth opportunities we have there. And Amit I'll talk to you about the incremental. We had 57% incremental this quarter. I just want to point out that would be about 70% if not for the headwind that higher fuel costs and surcharge gave to us this quarter. So, I think 70% core incremental margins are pretty good, think we've done a very good job absorbing a lot of the volume growth that we've seeing this year without adding on the resource side. In some areas like you mentioned, the incremental costs have risen in some lines and other lines they've held flat.  We have changed our cost structure quite a bit in the past year and so some of those drivers have varied, but I do think net-net. If we can continue, our goal here is to continue holding costs while we absorb incremental volume, and certainly the drop-through from other revenue contributors. We're going to be in a good place to help drive us down on OR side. Thank you. Let me say this, we will be active participants in that STB proceeding, making sure that our customers interests and our shareholders' interests are protected throughout that. We expect to continue to utilize the Meridian Speedway as part of our joint venture, and to grow traffic on that line is a great route. The best of the business from LA, Long Beach to the Southeast. So, we think that the transaction you mentioned gives us every opportunity to grow our business over that line. Well, we're gathering that information as we speak, and -- but it's really too soon to tell. We will have a better sense of that in the next month or so and we'll be better positioned to understand what the impact could be, what the attrition as a result of the government mandate might be. So, we're keeping a very close eye on that. Thank you, everyone for your questions today, we look forward to talking to you again next quarter."

The quarterly operating metrics on slide 6 clearly show that once again, we generated positive operating leverage on flat unit volumes and GTMs that were up 5%. While we're proactively hiring train crews, efficiency in all areas of our operations, including engineering, mechanical, and communications and signals enabled us to run the network with 7% fewer people in the quarter compared to a year ago.  Because assets drive activity, reducing the number of active locomotives was an important lever in managing the size of the workforce. Both train weight and train length continue to improve, driven by a focus on improving the productivity in our bulk network. Coal, grain and other single commodity unit trains offer real opportunity for gains through collaborating with our customers on operating trains with more cars per set and by doubling up existing trains over portions of their route. I expect we will show continued progress in the fourth quarter as we see the fruits of our efforts.  While strong coal traffic helped drive train weight more than length, train length continued to improve and set another quarterly record. After seven consecutive quarters of fuel efficiency improvements, we saw a modest deterioration this quarter despite the increase in train size as our horsepower leverage was challenged at times due to volatile traffic flows and we had modestly fewer of the very heavy, highly fuel-efficient trains. I'm pushing the team to respond more quickly in the phase of change and we're committed to closing the gap with our peers over time and are redoubling our efforts in this critical area.  As you can see on Slide 7, train speed and terminal dwell were generally flat versus second quarter and do not reflect performance at desired levels. While there were some effects from Hurricane Ida, those impacts were localized and I'm extremely proud of how the team, specially engineering and our signal forces helped us return our routes in Louisiana to operation and reopen the New Orleans gateway very quickly. As I mentioned last quarter, we are experiencing hiring and retention conditions that are increasingly challenging, especially in some of our more critical locations, and it is having an impact on our network.  Despite hiring all year long, attrition has been accelerating in each of the last two quarters in several of those critical areas. In many of these locations, we've been able to absorb the impact by executing upon productivity initiatives and this will be very much a part of the equation going forward as we grow capacity, which I'll talk about more in a moment. Some of the things we're doing to create relief, we've more than tripled our conductor trainee rank since the first quarter so that we can effectively back fill in critical areas.  We've implemented tools such as perfect attendance bonuses, referral bonuses, and signing incentives to improve the stickiness of our current and future workforce. And we continue to leverage the valuable go teams to quickly respond to business opportunities where needed. People are the backbone of the railroad, and we need to make progress on these initiatives to better manage the effects of a tight labor market. We are committed to having the right amount of resources in the right place at the right time, which will drive both cost control and service quality.  As our business mix continues to evolve, creating capacity across our market segments has become an even more significant area of focus as highlighted on slide 8. Some shippers are looking to take advantage of unexpected market opportunities by shipping extra volume. Others are looking for us to help them adjust to volatility coming from other parts of their supply chains and of course, all place a high value and service predictability. We're adjusting our network and operations to generate the various types of capacity that customers are looking for. For example, increases in both train sizes gives shippers extra lift without further demands on our crew base.  Train size increases often require connecting railroads, customers, and Norfolk Southern to change processes and we have found those process changes are worth the effort because they improve asset turns and capacity. We also continue to focus on terminal efficiency, whether helping to drive dwell at our biggest [Indiscernible] yard, Elkhart, to very low levels or tactically redirecting trains to intermodal terminals that have the capacity to unload quickly. Moving to Slide 9, I want to show how we can use these capacity efforts to drive productivity. We've had great success over the past two years driving train size.  And in doing so, have addressed a handful of infrastructure bottlenecks. Fast-tracking instead of siding improvements the first of which went into service at the end of the third quarter so we can keep making progress. Bigger trains unlocked by siding extensions helped drive locomotive utilization because it allows us to fully match train size to available pulling power. And because locomotives are at their most efficient when pulling hard, this is a key level to our fuel efficiency improvement.  While I've used locomotives and fuel as my primary example, capacity additions have a similar effect on recruit productivity, more cars per crew, asset turns, keeping trains moving with greater train capacity, and also helps our customers with improved train and car performance. On Slide 10, we are complementing our investment in physical capacity with a comprehensive technology strategy that makes our crews more efficient and our assets more productive. Virtually all of our routines signal and track maintenance is now scheduled via the mobile track authority app.  A process that used to be measured in minutes can now be accomplished in seconds. It is inherently more efficient than the radio process of the past and most importantly, safer because it reduces transcription errors. And the words of our Chief Engineer, the app has been a game changer for the productivity of his forces. We're doing the same with our mobile train reporting app, which enables our train crews to quickly report completed work and to receive updated customer work requests while en route. This takes a lot of hands out of the process including significant re-typing and delay and enables our crews to be more productive.  We're still early in the deployment of this application with rollout to the local trains that do the preponderance of pickups and set offs just beginning. The use cases for this technology in the field are numerous and driving adoption and innovation around this platform is a focal point that will allow us to capture additional benefit. The common use thread in these apps is that better information allows people to plan. Our track supervisors can better plan their schedule, knowing the availability of track time, and our customers can better plan their plain operations, in product pipeline with up-to-date shipment information. Now, I will turn it over to Alan. Good morning, Jordan. Thanks for the question. I think broadly, let me just put a broad perspective on it. We're really managing through a very disrupted labor market and it's been a challenge from the beginning of this year, but we've been able to really continue to find productivity improvements up to this point that the team I think has done a great job of and really, you're seeing it flowing through our financial results.  So, when I think about where headcount should be, it's really a function of volume that we have on the network as well as our productivity initiatives of which we have quite a few with longer trains and other opportunities for productivity. So, I think from where we are right now, we'd like to see headcount up maybe a little bit to take out some of the lumpiness of what we're seeing. But longer-term, we're going to be focusing on using technology and other things, focusing on continuing to bring that down. But at this point with where we are, we'd like to see it come up. Sure. So, from a line of road perspective, as you know, Tom, we have had a discussion on these calls around siding extensions. We've gotten our first siding extension in service on the third quarter I mentioned that in my prepared remarks and we have about four, five more that are under your way and then studying some others to make sure we have good capability in our single-track locations, predominantly in the southern part of our network to be able to drive longer trains, and improve the capacity overall the network by taking total number of trains down because we can run longer trains.  The technology of distributed power has been an enabler for that. And also, as you know, we're doing DC to AC conversions that increased the fleet size of the capability of our fleet to do more of that. So, we really see some good opportunities to continue to allow for great throughput on our network. And I would add, Brandon, I put in my prepared remarks, technology is really very helpful to us, whether it's mobile applications that allow employees to be in the field as opposed to managing the input of information through a traditional keyboard and computer, whether it's predictive analytics, or whether it's pure automation. So, there's plenty of opportunity out there in addition to train length and some of the other items that I've already talked about so far. So as far as where we are with service levels that are public that I talked through, I really see the big linchpin obviously being people talk about this is a fairly disrupted labor environment. We are hiring people as Jim has noted, but bringing on people to is long lead time. We have streamlined our process of hiring and also our training process, taking advantage of technology to do so. Obviously, we're not going to compromise safety and anything that we do with that regard.  And we've doubled our class size since July, and other type issues, but that is going to be what is helps us to see our service levels improve. But this is a national issue and it's, as you know, it's at the heart of the supply chain overall and it's been building for a while and it'll for months and will probably take a few months for us to clear through it. Alan, I don't know if you have anything you want to add. So that one would to be a broken record, but we do have opportunities for train size and train length with our siding extensions, but also with growth being able to add into existing trains. We see great opportunity there to continue productivity and great drop-through on that revenue. We've got extra board consolidations, we just constricting crews' segments, those types of activities. Continued improvement in our processes and I can't underemphasize technology. I made some remarks about that earlier, so I will repeat those but the technological advances that will help us be much more efficient in how we go about our business. So, there's a great pipeline and I'm more excited about getting on the railroad. On headcount, just not -- what I would basically say is that we are still seeing attrition and replenishment as part of our challenge. So, we will probably see headcount come down a little bit more. I would like to see it stabilize and come up because we are replenishing for attrition. So that's what I'm -- my comments earlier. What that meant, are still our long-term opportunities, again, on train size and other process improvements on our terminals and few other things I mentioned are very, very beneficial to us to bring headcount down longer-term. I think it would be along those lines, maybe up slightly, but yes, along those lines. Not one for one, Justin I guess it's what I'm getting at. [Indiscernible] in a couple of buckets. One bucket is where we have a very, very tight labor market broadly in the region. And that is affecting those [Indiscernible] employees finding alternative places to work, as well as being very difficult to find new conductor training. And there's a corridor too that it's affecting us more broadly in the Midwest part of our network in that particular scenario.  And then there's the scenario where we're able to generate trainees and bring them in, they are not quite the numbers that we like. And we have some attrition of those trainees little higher than our historical norm. So that has affected us being able to continue that replenishment type pipeline like we'd like. So, we saw this, starting in the third quarter and we've increased the number of people in our pipeline in those locations where we're able to track folks to are really good Company here by about 240%.  And we've also seen conductor trainees increased by about actual training on the property increased by about 53%. So, that's a different kind of bucket. Now, we are -- we have doubled the class size since probably June, and we expect to also add additional class size in classes by the end of the year to again, attract those in the door and allow for that train process to occur, but there's a lag time here, is what I'm really telling you. And so, we see that persisting into the first part of 2022."

            "name": "Mark George",
            "content": "Thanks. On Slide 16, as Elon just detailed, revenues were up 14% on flat volumes. With operating expenses up 10% we delivered strong incremental margins leading to 230 basis points of operating ratio improvement, driving us to a Q3 record of 60.2% The improvement LN detailed and RPU, coupled with strong productivity led to record Q3 operating income with growth of 21% or nearly $200 million. And our free cash flow is also at record levels, a 33% increase during these 9 months compared to last year. Moving to slide 17, let's drill down into the change and operating expenses.  While operating expenses grew a 149 million or 10%, it's up only 4% or 67 million apart from fuel cost increases. The fuel cost increase of 82 million is driven mainly by price, but the 5% increase in GTMs also drove more consumption. You'll see purchase services up 35 million with a majority of the year-over-year increase in 3 areas. We have an increase in technology spend, which is consistent with our technology strategy, and you've heard a couple project examples in Cindy's remarks. There are also headwinds from Conrail operating expenses, and there are increases in intermodal costs.  More specifically, we had trucking costs associated with shuttling longer dwell containers to satellite parking lots in order to reduce congestion at our terminals and keep the freight moving. Lift expenses were actually up in the quarter despite fewer lifts and that is primarily because of inflation we absorbed on lift rates associated with contractor labor availability. This is an area we do expect to see continued inflationary pressure going forward. And we also absorbed costs in the quarter related to our chassis repairs. Moving on to compensation and benefits, it is up 5% which you'll note the $40 million in savings from 7% lower headcount that more than offsets increase in pay rates and overtime.  Meanwhile, incentive compensation comparisons in the quarter are a headwind of $43 million. Similar to what we reported in the second quarter, reflecting our strong 2021 financial outlook compared to lower accrual rates last year. Materials, claims, and other expenses were all down year-over-year. Turning now to slide 18, and looking at the rest of the P&L below operating income, you'll see that other income of 14 million is 25 million unfavorable year-over-year. And that is due almost entirely to lower net returns from Company-owned life insurance.  Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.6%, close to our federal and state statutory rates. But unlike Q3 last year where the rate was 21.9%, and benefited from tax advantages related to both Coly investment gains, and higher stock-based compensation. Net income increased by 17% while earnings per share grew by 22%, supported by 3.6 million shares, we repurchased in the quarter. Wrapping up with our free cash flow on slide 19. As I have mentioned, free cash flow is a record through nine months of 2021 at $2.3 billion buoyed by very strong operating cash generation and that translates into a 102% free cash flow conversion.  While property additions are trending a bit lower than run rate for our $1.6 billion guidance number, capital spend is never linear and we expect fourth quarter property additions will get us close to the 1.6 billion. Shareholder distributions through 9 months exceeds 3.2 billion, an increase of over 1.5 billion versus prior year, thanks to our higher dividend and a meaningful increase in our share repurchase activity. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jim. Well, let me take the second part of that first, and the first part second. We've been hiring aggressively since the beginning of the year and we've ramped that program up throughout the year. So, we're putting a lot of people into the pipeline, through the pipeline, and into the field even as we speak and we'll continue to do so. Recognizing that at least in some locations we are short of people and we need more help.  In terms of regulatory environments, I think it's worth emphasizing that there is a good deal of overlap between what we do and what the administration and Congress are seeking. That overlap is in the area of sustainability. It's widely recognized in Washington today, on both sides of the aisle, that rails are the sustainable ground transportation. And so, we see eye to eye with the administration on that. We're all about economic development and creating good jobs for people and helping the American economy growth.  That lines up very well with what the Administration and Congress are trying to do as well. Now we don't see eye-to-eye on everything where we disagree with policymakers. We maintain a very active dialogue and we make sure that our point-of-view, that our needs that our importance to the American economy are widely understood. Okay. Scott well, first I think your question was on sequential OR as we look to Q4. Q3, we did see pretty much stable OR from Q2 when you back out the land size, the outside land sale that we had last quarter. Now, I think we were about 10 basis points better in Q3 and then we expect to see basically more of the same here in Q4. Some of that will depend on the volume outlook as we navigate through Q4. I do expect that the expense side of the equation should also be roughly consistent with what we've experienced here this quarter. So, it just feels like more of the same as we close out the year and that will stay on this run rate like we talked about earlier in the year. Sure. Okay, Ken, thanks. Let me take the first part of that. As we look ahead to 2022 and beyond, as I said, we're committed to driving the OR lower and we will do that with a combination of emphasis on productivity and efficiency measures at top-line growth and there's a lot of opportunity for us there. We will get more specific with our 2022 guidance in January when we come back to you with our fourth quarter results. In terms of a new set of goals for the longer term, look for an investor day on our part sometime next year, we'll get more specific with regard to dates in the near future, but it's clearly time for us to update our longer-range goals as well. Justin I'll tackle your volume question first. I mean, if you do look at the weekly trends on volumes, you'll see it's going sideways and we expect that trend to carry out for the full quarter. Thanks, David. So, look, I think one way to think about intermodal is we've increased our profitability considerably over the past decade as we've grown volumes and we've been able to demonstrate value to our customers and basically bring our pricing up to where it should be. So, I would say that incremental intermodal business brings to it -- brings with it a creative OR, and we feel like that will continue. It will continue to accrete to the business as we grow our intermodal business. We're providing more and more solutions to our customers, including, the storage service solutions that we've really built up during this period of intense supply chain congestion. So, we are finding new ways to make that business even more profitable. Yeah. I think as we get more fluidity in that network and we can take on more volume, because I think the volume is out there. We just need the entire ecosystem to start moving again and loosen up. And I think we have the capacity. We can start moving more and more volume, and there'll be changes, perhaps between -- you might not have quite as much storage revenue, but you'll have more on the volume side. And so overall we feel good about our intermodal prospects for the future. It's a great franchise. We've got the capacity, we've got terminals in the right locations, and we're -- we got great partners on the -- channel partners on the intermodal side. So, we're feeling good about our position. Thank you."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Meghan Achimasi, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Miss. Achimasi, you may now begin.\nMeghan Achimasi: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today\u2019s call, we will make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section, along with our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. A full transcript and download will be posted after the call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.\nJim Squires: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer, Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. Building upon our momentum to start the year, our team delivered another record setting quarter, as dramatic improvement in both revenue and volume up 34% and 25% respectively, outpaced, an 11% growth in expense, and while the year-over-year improvement is aided by easier comps from last year\u2019s economic shutdown, our performance in the quarter also improved sequentially in a number of ways as shown on Slide 4. Our results include second quarter records for net income and earnings per share and all-time records for operating income and operating ratio, which was 58.3% this quarter. We\u2019re excited to share more details about our results. But first I want to take a moment to thank each and every one of our employees for helping us run a more efficient and safer railroad while serving our customers. And I\u2019ll now turn to Cindy to go through our operations. Cindy?\nCindy Sanborn: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. We accomplished a lot this quarter and I am most pleased with our PSR progress during the past several months. We continue to get more productive, face our challenges head on and seize the opportunities we are creating. In the second quarter, we saw the benefits of a structurally lower operating cost base coupled with an operation that successfully absorbed increased volumes in the networks. Turning to the operating metrics on Slide 6, you can clearly see the operating leverage generated in the quarter, leverage that flows directly to the bottom line. Our operating discipline enabled us to handle a 25% year-over-year volume increase with 8% fewer people in our workforce and a 1% decrease in active locomotives. This success shows our improvements in train size, reflecting our goal of absorbing more business into our existing operating network wherever possible and further driving productivity. These gains were achieved in part by the increased deployment of distributed power and more blending a previously separate traffic types on the same train. We will continue to unlock train size increases through targeted siding extensions on key routes, where train length is currently limited. Terminal capacity enhancements, which we\u2019ve achieved through more efficient operating practices, will also be a key factor in absorbing and processing growth on these larger trains. Increased train size promotes better fuel efficiency and our progress this quarter reflects our commitment to closing the fuel efficiency gap with our peers. Our mechanical team, which manages the maintenance of our highly reliable locomotive fleet, pulling these larger trains has been crucial to many of these accomplishments. And I\u2019ll give you more detail on that a little later in my presentation. On Slide 7, you can see in the second quarter, we showed sequential improvement in terminal dwell and train velocity, after we got through the severe winter weather in the first quarter. However, our progress was uneven and we lost ground in June, in part due to several discreet, but geographically impactful operating disruptions. We aren\u2019t satisfied with our service levels and we were working extremely hard to seize the opportunity PSR presents to recover faster from disruptions. As the graph show, we resumed our improvement in July. We are committed to continuing to improve service levels and running a faster railroad, not just because a faster railroad is a lower cost railroad, but also because speed generates capacity for us to take on additional traffic within our existing train network. I\u2019ll move to Slide 8. During the quarter, we strive to deliver a consistent service product, even with significant volume changes by focusing on the consistency and productivity of our yard and local operations. We are teaching and equipping our field managers to better measure the work, our yard and local crews do and answer some important questions. Does the number of assignments working match the cars volumes flowing through a terminal or territory? Are we getting full value out of each resource in all yards? What\u2019s the right balance of overtime costs? Where are there further automation or process opportunities to help us reduce support costs, including clerical staff and mechanical presence? We are implementing technology to provide better and more timely data to answer these questions, which helps us reduce direct operating cost and improve service consistency. In several locations, we\u2019ve renewed our focus on more efficient remote control operations, which have been facilitated by the changing nature of the work over the last year. Local operations scheduled and properly sized volumes enable us to be more predictable to our customers and move cars quickly. Having a higher balance of crews assigned to road train service while creating capacity within the terminal through process enhancements, makes us nimble when responding to market changes and reducing our fixed costs. Local service is at the core of our service product and these changes are designed to improve that product. So far, we have reduced the cost per yard in local crew 7% versus last year and expect additional progress as the year continues. In a moment, Mark will discuss the benefits of reduced headcount and employee activity levels and constraining overall compensation expense as we absorb volume. Our focus on yard and local productivity has played a pivotal role in driving those benefits. We pursue targeted initiatives, such as these with an eye towards the next generation of modern railroading, which we are bringing to life today. We continue to empower our workforce to the delivery of mobility solutions and have distributed 8,000 smartphones to our T&E employees to facilitate improved reporting and to streamline the process of keeping trains moving. In the third quarter, we will begin rolling out a next generation local train reporting application to improve our visibility and customer service for the first and last mile. We are also in the final months of deployment of our current phase of the mobile track authority application that facilitates more efficient coordination between engineering and dispatching functions for right-of-way maintenance activities. We are at a very exciting time for our company and industry, in which we have ample opportunities to drive customer and shareholder value through both operational improvements and technology, a powerful formula. Earlier I mentioned the role the mechanical team has played in our PSR success. So I thought it would be useful to explain their crucial role on Slide 9. PSR railroads Norfolk Southern included ended up needing fewer locomotives. What our mechanical department has done is to take that initial A&E and use it strategically to call the worst performing units and to make our locomotive fleet more homogeneous. Those changes unlock repair productivity. Think about the benefits of repairing newer and fewer locomotives, which drove down the number of units out of service for repair. That started a virtuous cycle of improved reliability with 175% improvement in the days between unscheduled events to a shop versus pre-PSR levels. Meaning that when units do go into the shop, our craftsmen can spend more time on preventive maintenance instead of triaging issues. This cycle repeats itself and ultimately supports the efficient movement of trains and serving our customers. Fewer more reliable units also require fewer resources. So we need fewer servicing facilities and have fewer people maintaining locomotives. This is just an example, a big example of Norfolk Southern\u2019s PSR transformation. These changes are purposely aligned with our overall fleet strategy, including investments and are fewer but better units through our DC to AC conversion, energy management solutions and predictive analytic tools for maintenance, planning, and failure prevention. When taken as a whole, the benefits of this strategy flow through our materials, fuel and compensation expense lines. While ensuring we have a robust fleet capable of supporting profitable growth. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. You can see on Slide 11 that we are approaching pre-pandemic revenue levels. However, the composition of our business has changed dramatically due to the secular trends in the overall economy that were accelerated by the pandemic. Norfolk Southern is positioned at the forefront of these shifts due to the unique advantages of our powerful consumer oriented franchise and the diverse industrial markets we serve. The progress we have delivered amid dynamic business conditions underscores the value we provide to the markets we serve. Norfolk Southern\u2019s network directly connects to the majority of consumption and manufacturing in the United States, and is a vital resource for maintaining the flow of goods to support the economy. We are building on the inherent value of our network by working to provide our customers with the digital logistics solutions they need to compete and grow in an evolving market. The sustainability advantages of the Norfolk Southern franchise deliver a competitive advantage, provide customers with solutions to their carbon offset goals and are an accelerant to growth. In the second quarter of 2021, we successfully capitalized on opportunities by leveraging productivity enhancements and collaborating with our customers. As a result, second quarter revenue in our non-energy markets exceeded pre-pandemic levels by 4%. Growth this quarter was driven by consumer facing in industrial segments, which helped to offset sustain headwinds in our energy markets. Revenue and our energy related markets returned to just over two-thirds of pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of 2021. Our market position enabled a quick recovery in consumer and industrial markets almost fully offsetting the 50% decline in our energy revenue. Despite the sharp decrease in this historically profitable segment, we reduced operating ratio, levering the strengths of our unique franchise to target segments of the $800 billion truck and logistics markets, with a sharp focus on productivity. Turning to Slide 12, our quarterly volume and revenue improves significantly from pandemic caused in all three business units, reflecting our ability to capitalize and build on the momentum of improving economic conditions. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, up 34% year-over-year on a 25% volume improvement. Rising fuel prices and price gains drove a 7% improvement in revenue per unit, led by our intermodal franchise, which delivered record-breaking revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel. Sequentially, volume and revenue improved in all three business units over the first quarter in line with the accelerating economic recovery. Beginning with our merchandise segment, both volume and revenue improved 29% versus the second quarter of 2020 driven primarily by recovery from COVID-19 related shutdowns in the prior period. While automotive continued to face headwinds associated with the semiconductor chip shortage, shipments in the second quarter were up 122% year-over-year against easy comps associated with near complete shutdown of vehicle production in the second quarter of last year. Our steel franchise also delivered strong growth this quarter, up 67% as record level steel prices and elevated demand, fuel production activity. Combined gains in automotive and steel volume represented roughly 63% of total merchandise growth for the quarter. Revenue per unit was flat while revenue per unit excluding fuel declined slightly, driven by mixed headwinds in chemicals and automotive. Turning to intermodal. Our powerful franchise delivered record breaking revenue, revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel for the quarter. The second quarter of 2021 marks the 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in revenue per unit, excluding fuel for our Intermodal franchise. Strong consumer demand and tightness in the trucking sector drove growth for our domestic service product. Domestic shipments were up 17% year-over-year in the second quarter and up 4% from the same period in 2019. International shipments were also strong in the second quarter, improving 26% year-over-year on sustained high import demand, but were down 3% from the same period in 2019. Revenue per unit gains were driven by increased accessorial revenue, higher fuel surcharge revenue and price gains. Approximately 50% of the revenue per unit gain was driven by higher container storage time on terminal due to supply chain recovery challenges. Lastly, our Coal segment experienced some bright spots in the second quarter due to higher demand levels driven by global economic recovery and weather events. Coal shipments improved 55% year-over-year with strength in both the export and utility markets. Revenue per unit decreased slightly due primarily to negative mix experienced in our export markets where growth was driven by strength in the lower RPU export thermal market. Moving to our outlook on Slide 13. We expect the current economic momentum to continue through the end of the year and are raising our guidance for full year revenue growth to approximately 12% year-over-year. The overall economy continues to surprise to the upside with forecast for 2021 GDP growth now at around 7% and approximately 5% for 2022. Industrial production is forecasted to increase 6% in 2021 and north of 3% in 2020. Increased manufacturing, coupled with record low retail inventories, high savings rates and increased energy consumption, all set the stage for continued growth in the second half of the year. Merchandise growth will be led by strength in steel markets as low business inventory, the sales ratios and sustained demand for durable goods drives manufacturing activity in the second half. We are well positioned to capture opportunities associated with current strength in the steel markets as our network serves more integrated steel mills than any other railroad in North America. Merchandise energy markets will benefit from increased travel and commuting activities as businesses continue to reopen and virus restrictions are lifted. Pulp board and plastics volumes are also expected to increase as personal consumption drives demand for packaging. Merchandise gains will be partially offset by a year-over-year decline in automotive shipments in the third quarter, due to plan production downtime associated with the semiconductor shortage. Demand for international trade to support recovering global economies is expected to leave second half growth in our Intermodal franchise. Domestic intermodal demand will continue to improve as well with consumer spending and e-commerce forecast strengthening through the end of the year and ongoing capacity constraints in the trucking sector driving more opportunity for highway to rail conversions. Our Coal franchise will continue to capitalize our near-term opportunities to support global energy demand and steel production. Volume in the second half of 2021 is expected to improve year-over-year, driven by export markets benefiting from high seaborne coal prices, making U.S. coals more competitive in the global market. Demand for domestic met to support growing steel production activity is also likely to produce year-over-year growth. Gains in these markets will be partially offset by expected year-over-year declines in utility volume as this market deals with unit retirements, coal supply and plan maintenance outages. Volatility is an ever-present risk in the coal market. So we are closely monitoring geopolitical trade tensions and coal production, both of which have the potential to influence results. Overall, we expect economic conditions to be favorable for Norfolk Southern growth through the end of 2021. We are confident in our ability to leverage the strengths of our unique franchise and continue to drive revenue and margin growth. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Mark who will cover our financial results.\nMark George: Thanks, Alan. On Slide 15, you see the reconciliation of our Q2 reported operating ratio and earnings per share versus 2020. The operating ratio of 58.3% represents a 1,240 basis point improvement. We had $67 million of property gains in the quarter of which there was one major transaction that closed at the end of the quarter and resulted in a $55 million gain. We view this single transaction as incremental to our normal yearly operating property gain guidance of $30 million to $40 million and it alone represents 200 basis points of the operating ratio improvement this quarter. Earnings per share of $3.28 was $1.75 higher than prior year aside from the $0.17 goodness from the property gain, there was a state tax law change that resulted in a favorable adjustment to our deferred taxes of $0.09. Moving to Slide 16. Alan walked you through the drivers of the 34% increase in revenues, including the 25% growth in volumes. At the same time, we contain growth in operating expenses to 11% as we harvested additional benefits from workforce and asset productivity. The volume growth coupled with the productivity drove strong incremental margins again this quarter resulting in an operating ratio that was a record low 58.3%, improving 1,240 basis points year-over-year and 320 basis points versus Q1, including the 200 basis point tailwind from the major property gained. Our operating income of $1.167 billion in the quarter is another record up $557 million or 91% year-over-year. And we generated free cash flow of $1.47 billion through six months also a record. And that represents an increase of $447 million or 44% versus the same six months last year. Moving now to a drill down of operating expense performance on Slide 17. You\u2019ll see that operating expenses increased $157 million or 11% and fuel was the biggest driver of the increase with price driving expenses up $83 million. Usage increased due to higher volumes, which was partially offset by another quarter of fuel efficiency gains, a 4% improvement in the quarter. The increase in purchase services and rents is driven by volumes, although we managed to keep the increase in these categories well below the volume growth rates. Comp and ben is up 6% with savings from head count being down 8% year-over-year, offsetting increases in pay rates and overtime. Higher incentive compensation in the quarter was $39 million reflecting the improved outlook for the year and low accrual rates of last year. Despite the 25% growth in volume materials were actually down year-over-year from lower spend associated with fewer, but more productive locomotives. Thanks to the rationalization of the equipment last year and the initiatives that Cindy described earlier. The big item in the materials and other column is the favorable compare on gains from property sales in Q2 and that was $67 million in the quarter versus only $2 million last year. Turning to Slide 18. You\u2019ll see that other income net of $35 million is $14 million or 29% unfavorable year-over-year due primarily to lower net returns on our company owned life insurance investments. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was only 21% lower than we typically modelled and that was primarily from the benefit associated with the state tax law change. Net income increased by 109%, while earnings per share grew 114% supported by the nearly 3.4 million shares we repurchased in the quarter. Wrapping up now with our free cash flow on Slide 19. And as I mentioned, free cash flow was a record for the six months of 2021 at $1.47 billion buoyed by very strong operating cash generation and relatively modest property additions of $627 million thus far in the year. And that translates to a free cash flow conversion of 99% through six months. Although we still expect property additions to ramp up in the balance of the year and hit our $1.6 billion guidance number. Shareholder distributions through six months exceeds $2 billion an increase of $870 million versus prior year. Thanks to our recently increased dividend and the meaningful increase in our share repurchase activity. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jim.\nJim Squires: Thank you, Mark. When we spoke last quarter, I took the opportunity to share our company\u2019s longstanding commitment to sustainability. Along those lines, I\u2019m excited to report two brand new milestones in our journey. Earlier this quarter, we became the first North American Class 1 railroad to issue a green bond, launching $500 million in green bonds to fund sustainable investments, to reduce our carbon emissions and partner with customers to do the same. As outlined in our green financing framework, potential projects range from improving locomotive fuel efficiency to fostering truck to rail conversions, powering company operations with clean energy, to increasing the use of energy efficient buildings and technology and supporting reforestation projects that restore natural landscapes and offset carbon emissions. In addition to our green bonds, we achieved another significant milestone earlier this month with the approval of our science-based target, our commitment to reduce emissions intensity by 42% in the next 15 years. These two steps are a critical part of our shared commitment to sustainability with our investors, customers, partners and communities underscoring our resolve to be an even bigger part of the solution. Before we open the call to Q&A, I\u2019ll take a moment to provide our updated outlook based on the current economic environment. As Alan mentioned, we are even more confident about growth for the balance of this year and we now expect revenue to be up approximately 12% year-over-year. Strength in our consumer-oriented and manufacturing markets will drive the majority of the growth. And the near-term upside in coal markets will provide more of a lift this year than previously expected, though the market remains challenged in the long-term. We are also succeeding in driving productivity into our operations. And as a result we got onto our 60% run rate here in the second quarter. We expect to maintain this level for the balance of the year, which translates to at least 400 basis points of our improvement for the full year versus our adjusted 2020 result. And we\u2019ll build upon this momentum for more improvements in 2022 and long-term sustained value for our shareholders and customers. So with that, we\u2019ll open the call to your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Yes. Thanks and good morning. Maybe if you could just pick up where you left off Jim on the guidance, particularly for the operating ratio guidance. So obviously there have been some service dynamics that have deteriorated in the quarter not just necessarily for Norfolk Southern, certainly it\u2019s more of an industry comment. But I\u2019m kind of curious how you think about resource management in the back half of the year. So it sounds like CapEx is going to ramp back up to sort of get back on run rate for the full year target. How do we think about head count? How do we think about some of the other resources that maybe you have some leverage that you can pull? And kind of how quickly do you think service can kind of ramp up? So a few questions built in there, but really kind of embedded in that OR guidance, which is obviously better than what you gave us before in the context of what we\u2019re seeing with service.\nJim Squires: Good morning, Chris. Let me start, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Cindy to talk about some of the specific actions we\u2019re taking on the workforce front. We continue to see opportunities for workforce and other productivity in the second half of the year. Yes, we are facing some spot labor shortages, but they\u2019re just that. Systemically, we think we\u2019ll manage and that we will continue to generate labor productivity in the second half, in fact. And that should translate into favorable results for expenses and for the bottom line as well. We mentioned as part of the overall OR guidance the expectation for revenue \u2013 revised expectation for revenue, we took that up some too. So you put the two together and that gets you to the new guidance on the OR, which is more than 400 basis points for the year. Cindy talk a little bit more about what we\u2019re doing on the resource side.\nCindy Sanborn: Sure, Jim. Thanks, Chris. So if you think about where we started the year, we had planned to hire, it wasn\u2019t going to be broad-based, we expected to gain productivity in our workforce throughout the year and largely as played out that way. My prepared remarks go into some more detail on that. I will say that from a standpoint of hiring where we are hiring, there were a few hire group locations, the specific areas where the job market is extremely tight. And so we are experiencing that in our ability to bring on new employees. But it\u2019s fairly localized. It\u2019s not broad-based. So to mitigate that, we pull on some of our typical items that we \u2013 how we deploy people through what we call go teams, where we have employees that quickly can go into areas and support the existing crews that are there, temporary transfers, permanent transfers and even craft transfers from let\u2019s say, mechanical craft into transportation. And in terms of hiring some of the areas that we\u2019re working on there to \u2013 to be able to get people to come to us, we\u2019ve increased our training wage and we\u2019ve also have some sign-on and retention bonuses for the new employees as they come on. So we\u2019re working very diligently there. It is a headwind for us, we\u2019re watching it very, very closely. And you tied it to service and I would tell you that, our service as I think about that more broad-based and coming into the beginning of the year, we had fairly strong service measures. We went through a very challenging February and a very strong demand for volume in March on top of a really low demand for service because of the weather in February. And we started coming out of those challenges in late April and May and felt really good about where we are. As we headed into June, we had and I also described this a bit in my prepared remarks, sort of a series of events that couple of derailments, not big derailments, but just locations where they were challenging for us. And then as we\u2019re recovering from that, we had some weather events that just elongated the recovery. So June was just a challenging month. As we came out of the July holiday, July 4 holiday, we have accelerated the gains from May and the run rates that we had from May, and I feel better and good about where we are. We\u2019re not satisfied with where we are. We want to continue to improve service for our customers. But that\u2019s largely how I see the dynamic here between resources and service.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John Saager with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Saager: Thank you. Good morning. Alan, everybody knows about the chip shortage and the impact it\u2019s having on the auto industry. But your comments about being down year-over-year in 3Q, maybe a bit surprising just given your network has been a little bit more immune, given the heavy SUV exposure there. Can you speak to your expectations beyond 3Q especially as you get into that 12% increase in volumes for the full year for the total network? What are you expecting from auto? Is there a massive snap back there where the second half kind of looks the same, even though the third quarter may be a little bit lighter? And how does that kind of pretend into next year\u2019s view on the auto market?\nAlan Shaw: John, the semiconductors are certainly the headline issue. What we\u2019re seeing right now is the impact of the delta variant on producers who are our suppliers, I should say, in Southeast Asia. And so we\u2019ve got a couple of plants that source parts from Southeast Asia and because of issue \u2013 production issues over there, they\u2019ve had to pull forward planned production downtime later this year. And so that has had an impact on our production and our volumes right now. Over time, we feel like we\u2019re going to get back to all the plants operating in August, but John, you know that we\u2019ve talked about that before and had to push it back. And we\u2019re still anticipating by the fourth quarter, we\u2019re going to be in a position where we\u2019re at full production. You\u2019re right, the plants that we serve and the products that we move are in high demand. So they will be the ones that get the first call on any available parts, whether it\u2019s semiconductors or anything else. Right now finished vehicle inventories to normalize sales are in the teens. It\u2019s probably about a third or a fourth of where our customers want them. And so, we serve more U.S. vehicle production than anybody else, and we serve an industry that\u2019s going to be very interested on inventory rebuild both this year and as we move into next year. So we\u2019re pretty confident about the trajectory of our auto franchise once we kind of whether this initial bump.\nJohn Saager: Okay. So just to be clear that the 12% total volume growth is that including a \u201cmade whole\u201d on auto or that\u2019s in spite of auto maybe being weaker than you thought.\nAlan Shaw: Yes. I\u2019m glad you brought that up. It is 12% revenue growth, upper single digit volume growth.\nJohn Saager: Right. Yes. Okay, great. Thank you, Alan.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. On the OR guidance just wanted to clarify, are you including the $55 million gain on sale and the expectation for 400 to 440 basis points of year-over-year improvement. And then maybe just thinking beyond even the second half of this year, we\u2019d love to get your thoughts about incremental margins going forward as we look into 2022 and beyond, and think about the opportunity beyond the 60% OR.\nJim Squires: Mark, why don\u2019t you take that one?\nMark George: Sure. Look, Justin, the guidance does include it\u2019s all in. So it does include this major property gain that we called out or highlighted for you. And look, I think incrementals, we had very, very strong incrementals here in the first half. And the guidance implies we\u2019re going to continue to have very strong instrumentals in the back half, albeit, less than the first half. We do have some unique headwinds here in this second half that would include things like fuel. Fuel is a headwind to us, a lot of the incremental revenue that we\u2019re adding here in our guidance change is coming from fuel. So it\u2019s fuel surcharge, which is mitigating incremental fuel expense. So there\u2019s really no incremental margin from that. So it tends to dilute what we have organically in the back half. And then on top of that, we will have some diminishing accessorial charges, which hopefully help fuel some more volume that comes with it. And of course, we\u2019ve got some IC headwind here in the back half as well. But that said incrementals are good and we continue to believe that going into 2022, we will continue to improve our OR on an incremental basis. And buoyed by some of the productivity initiatives and measures that we\u2019re constantly looking at and sending our team or iterating on the T&E side, as well as fuel efficiency that should help, again, provide us consistent and continued improvement in our overall OR quest.\nJustin Long: Okay. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Thomas Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nThomas Wadewitz: Yes. Good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit about intermodal. I guess, the first component just being, how do you think about the storage fees? I think you alluded to them being a pretty big factor in revenue per unit growth in intermodal. Do you think they continue at that level in third quarter, second half? Is that a big fall off in that? And I guess related to that, how do you think about the terminal operations? Are you constraining volume into Chicago and kind of what\u2019s the chassis impact on your fluidity and how you think that may \u2013 how quickly that may change in terms of capacity constraints. Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: You\u2019re welcome, Tom. Our accessorial programs are designed to align the mutual goals in our customers for more efficient and reliable service product. And with a pressure on the drayage community and the pressure on warehousing due to pandemic protocols and labor shortages, our customers in certain locations needed more space for storage. And so we responded to the market, we\u2019ve added satellite lots in some areas we\u2019ve reconfigured our stack configuration at Landers our heavily international facility in Chicago. And we\u2019ve been able to accommodate a lot more international units dwelling on our terminals because that\u2019s what our customers need. Our accessorials in this case are an activity-based service and price that that we apply to the market. We are absolutely focused on programs that encourage the fluidity of our operations and really our hope clearly is that the accessorials go away because that means that customers are pulling more quickly from our terminals. And as soon as customers pull boxes from our terminals, we can inbound more boxes into our terminals. It\u2019s not an issue of capacity. It\u2019s an issue of throughput and we\u2019re working on some programs to encourage dual missions with the drayage community. So anytime that they get a box, they\u2019re out getting a box as well. You mentioned chassis, I\u2019m glad you brought that up. As you know that about six weeks ago, we determined that over 5,100 of our chassis had a manufacturing defect, it was a supplier issue. And with our uncompromising commitment to safety, we didn\u2019t hesitate to pull those off the street. Now that happened in a tough environment. We were already short of chassis because of a long gated street, well associated with the same warehouse and same drayage community pressures that I noted before. I\u2019m very proud of the way that we have responded and frankly, in collaboration with our customers as well. We stood up a number of different locations, an entire network of vendors to repair these chassis the brand new process, we\u2019ve got 80 different locations in which we are repairing chassis. Some of them are even off of our network and we\u2019re working with foreign roads our Western partners on a number of gateway locations. As a result, we\u2019ve already repaired 40% of our chassis just in the first six weeks. Right now we\u2019re on a run rate where we\u2019re repairing about 10% of those affected chassis. And we fully believe that by the end of August, we will have repaired about three quarters of the effect chassis, which are effectively anything that\u2019s on our network. The rest have kind of migrated off network and we\u2019re working with the foreign roads to get that back \u2013 those back to us, so that we can repair them. We haven\u2019t closed gates. I want to make it very clear. What we\u2019re doing in certain lanes where we \u2013 at the destination we have a shortage of chassis because of this safety recall, we are metering or capping volume. And every day this improves, because every day we\u2019re repairing chassis, putting them back into the market and we are relaxing the metering program. You can see the impact on our volumes sequentially as you move out of May into the first half of June, and then where we are now. And as we continue to repair the chassis, you\u2019ll see volumes pick up.\nThomas Wadewitz: Are you optimistic that improvement is quick or is that going to slow? I think that\u2019s kind of underlying what I was asking.\nAlan Shaw: Improvement in volumes.\nThomas Wadewitz: Throughput. Yes, you said throughput is the key, would you expect quick improvement in throughput or is that pretty gradual throughout the second half?\nAlan Shaw: Well, it\u2019s going to improve as we get more chassis back into the market. As I told you, we\u2019re going to have about three quarters of these, all the ones that are on our network repaired by the end of August. We\u2019re also starting this September, we\u2019re going to inject more of these out of the lease market into our network as well. So we are applying capacity to the growth opportunities that are out there for our customers.\nThomas Wadewitz: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Mark, wanted to ask you about some of the cost lines. We saw a step up in purchase services and comp for employee in the second quarter. How should we think about that going forward from here? And then similarly, Alan, merchandise and coal RPU was, they were both down sequentially, any thoughts on how to think about that into the back half of the year? Thank you.\nMark George: Hey, Scott, let me \u2013 first I\u2019ll tackle comp and ben for employee. It did step up a little bit here in the second quarter. Frankly, we ended up hitting our 60% OR a quarter or two earlier than we thought to get on that run rate, led us to increase our outlook for the year on operating ratio. And I think as you know, our incentive plan is heavily oriented toward OR improvement. So that resulted in an increase to incentive comp accruals beyond what we had initially guided. So you see about an 8% \u2013 well, sorry, 16% increase in the quarter year-over-year in comp and ben for employee. About half of that is from the incentive, the rest is really split between wage inflation over time, payroll taxes. So now I think when you look at the balance of the year, just look at it on an absolute comp for employee basis. First half is roughly around 33,000, between the first quarter, second quarter. And I think it\u2019s going to end up being pretty much in that territory in the back half as well, around 33,000, so pretty specific number there. Purchase services, it did step up. I think we guided you that it would step up. At Q1 it was more of an anomalous drop. There was some deferral of expenses. We were slow out of the gate on some spend. So I do think where we ended the second quarter was in line with what we expected. I do expect a modest pickup here in the balance of the year. For Q3 and Q4 we\u2019re containing it, it\u2019ll be less than revenue growth. But probably a little bit of a modest pickup in the back half, as some of the engineering expenses step up here during the summer months and into the fall. And also some of the IT spend will be coming through in the back half.\nAlan Shaw: The question Scott was on RPU. We are exceeding our price plan that we had established at the end of the year, and we delivered 7% RPU growth for the quarter, despite negative mix in each of our three business units. Within merchandise, Rock Salt was up about 40%. We\u2019re happy to handle the business, but that\u2019s generally lower rated business. PIH, which is a very high rated business was down in the quarter year-over-year. But also within the auto industry, you know how disrupted individual plants have been because of these production issues or supplier issues, I should say. And just as a result of plants that took some downtime, our auto length of haul was down significantly in the second quarter, which impacted overall RPU. And I\u2019ll pivot over to coal, you referenced that and that really is continues to be a function of mix. And I guided to that, that that would be pressure going forward within our export thermal market volume was up 250% year-over-year. We\u2019ve got a really good service product in that lane. And we\u2019re leveraging that to the benefit of our customers and to our shareholders. At the same time, export thermal is up 250%, which as you know is lower rated export met was up 20%. So we handled growth there in any given year we\u2019d be very happy with 20% growth. But that just creates severe negative mix. Frankly, within export last year, three quarters of our business was met this year. It was a 50-50. So there you can see the impact on RPU.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nJim Squires: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my question. Cindy, I guess, I was \u2013 I wanted to talk about network velocity because it does look like you\u2019re running pretty well below where you\u2019ve gotten in 2019 and even early 2020, obviously with less volumes. But can you talk about your road service redesign and how that could be improving things. But is the mix impacting that aggregated number as well?\nCindy Sanborn: Yes. Brandon, so let me start kind of at a high level. I really see we\u2019ve got some very strong building blocks in place. We\u2019ve continued to bring on some talent with PSR experience and Hunt Cary who was running our operations efficiency team has now added to his portfolio of responsibility to include our network operations center. So we have that going for us. We have longer term siding extensions that are going to allow us to continue to grow trains. We are still growing train length, as you heard in my prepared remarks. But there\u2019s still some work to do from a consolidation perspective on our line of road. I do think that that should be a benefit to us because it unlocks capacity, the fewer trains that we have out there and we\u2019re working every day to be better. So as I think about it in a more short-term view, we\u2019re working every day to be better. Our recruits have come down substantially in July. And as I think about even from a capacity perspective, I\u2019ll give you this kind of data point. Last quarter, I talked about the fact that on our intermodal trains at about 10% running above 10,000 feet. That\u2019s actually the same number this quarter even with the train size increases that we\u2019ve seen. So we\u2019re actually starting with this smaller stuff and being able to put that together. And then as we grow the sidings, we\u2019ll be able to even do more. And again, that just unlocks capacity on line of road. So I see bright future here longer-term and then medium-term again, it\u2019s just basic blocking and tackling. And I think Hunt being in the NSC has brought some different thoughts into that work group. And I think we\u2019re seeing those benefits already in July.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions.\nBascome Majors: Yes. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to talk a little bit about intermodal pricing. I know much of that is on long-term contracts and there are some standard escalators in there. But can you talk a little bit, is there a lag benefit where you really do see a lot of what\u2019s happening in the truckload market and your pricing in 2022? Or will that be similar year-over-year? Just any thoughts on how you get paid for how the truckers are getting paid today would be helpful. Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Bascome, there is a lag in our long-term contracts on intermodal price. And so we would expect next year to see more improvement and year-over-year price. Then we see this year on some of those deals. And I\u2019ll just reiterate, we\u2019re not going to see a huge uptick like you see in the spot market. We just are not structured to chase the spot market, either up or down, we take a much more measured approach with our customers. They\u2019re looking for rate surety as they go out into bid season. We want them to be successful. We\u2019re aligning with the best channel partners in the business. They\u2019re focused on growth, and we\u2019re here to support that growth over time that has generated rate increases in intermodal that exceed both the contract market and the spot market within truck. And as I talked about, we\u2019ve got 18 straight quarters of year-over-year growth and RPU less fuel in intermodal both ended up markets and down. So expect a continued improvement as we move through next year. We don\u2019t expect the kind of volatility that you\u2019re seeing in the spot market.\nBascome Majors: I appreciate it. And I\u2019m actually curious to your point about the long-term bias with these partnerships. Has this environment changed the conversation about how you want to convert traffic long-term and work with your partners to do that? I\u2019m just curious, what might be different two to three years down the road?\nAlan Shaw: There are a number of trends that were in place that we believe were accelerated by the pandemic that includes more interest in rail, forward positioning of inventory, shifts from highway to rail. There\u2019s a number of reasons, sustainability. Jim talked about that that is definitely entering into a conversation with our customers. And in the intermodal space with our channel partners, that\u2019s helping them win business as well. I look at our industrial development activities and compared to just two or three years ago, and there was a lot more interest in economic development in rail serve sites. So yes, there is more and more activity, more and more discussion in both the merchandise and in the intermodal sphere for highway to rail conversions. And that\u2019s frankly, the way that we\u2019ve positioned our franchise. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so confident about the future.\nBascome Majors: Thank you for that color.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi everybody, good morning. Alan, just following up on the chassis discussion, I understand I guess the cost to fix the problem is not very material, but I think it\u2019s 15% of the owned fleet for the company. So just for my own curiosity, is there any recourse or claim the customer has if they\u2019re not able to move the boxes out of the terminals due to chassis availability, or is this maybe an issue for that impacts really your channel partners? If you can just give us some color on that. And then just as a follow-up Mark, you\u2019ve been super helpful in the past on OpEx cadence. You\u2019re kind of highlighting some step up in OpEx ex-fuel. Wondering if you could just help us put a finer point on that in the back half relative to the first half of the second quarter, revenue looks like it\u2019s going to be maybe sequentially down a little bit in the back half or flattish at best. So just wondering what the corresponding increase in OpEx ex-fuel we should expect on the back of that. Thank you very much.\nAlan Shaw: Amit, our primary focus is on safety and our primary focus is on injecting capacity to help our customers grow. As the downstream impact associated with this supplier issue is fluid and it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m not going to comment on that right now.\nMark George: Yes. And Amit, just \u2013 the 12% revenue guidance kind of implies, you\u2019re going to see them flattish to maybe modestly down a little in the back half. And in terms of OpEx, I think, fuel is one of the variables where that continues to creep up here in the back half. And then as I mentioned, I think the comp and ben per employee is kind of just that will stabilize and be at that 33,000 per level. Other than that, we do see a little bit of a step up, like I said to Scott on purchased services, a modest step up there. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see continued diminishing material spend. I think we\u2019re kind of hitting a bottom there that will probably be more flattish and rents, I think there will be some pressure as volumes are coming back, there\u2019s a little bit of a lag usually with equipment rents. And I think especially if autos, when auto starts to come back, we\u2019ll see a little bit of pressure on rents from where we are right now.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And Alan, just maybe if I can approach, I respect, you don\u2019t want to comment on it. But maybe I can approach the question in different way. Do you think the impact of this chassis shortage is primarily a volume and service impact that rebounds, when you finish, when the company finishes addressing these issues? Or is there some idiosyncratic cost issue as well that maybe is meeting some of the results that can unwind over the course of the next couple of quarters?\nAlan Shaw: Yes, we\u2019ve been \u2013 we\u2019ve stated that the revenue and the cost impact is not material for us to call out. We are intently focused on standing up a new program, repairing these chassis, serving our customers and injecting more assets into the network so that we can help them grow. And we got a great plan to do that. We responded very quickly to this issue.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question will be coming from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Just longer term, thinking about intermodal, can you maybe talk to or give an update on your thoughts about East Coast versus West Coast ports and some of the issues around the West Coast, maybe even stimulated further conversations, people making more of a shift retailers, et cetera, to the east side. Thanks.\nAlan Shaw: Jordan, we saw or we\u2019ve continued to see kind of a measured shift in market share from West Coast, the East Coast, and that\u2019s due to over the last 10, 15 years, that\u2019s due to a number of issues widening the Suez canal, labor strife on the West Coast, then 2014 widening of the Panama canal, and just basically East Coast, is where you\u2019re seeing a lot of growth in population and consumption. We\u2019re very fortunate that our franchise serves a majority of the consumption and the manufacturing in the United States. And so, yes, we fully expect that our ports, which are very active in attracting new business. We\u2019ll continue to do so. And that\u2019s going to continue to be strength for our unique intermodal franchise.\nJordan Alliger: All right, thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good morning. Jim and Mark, maybe just a little clarification, a great outlook on the 400 to 440 basis points of margin improvement, can you clarify, did you say before Jim, that you were going to stay at the 58 through the rest of the year? I thought you mentioned something about holding these levels? And then just kind of wrapping up with what you\u2019ve just talked about on the last couple of answers. You\u2019re kind of fighting the tide with higher fuel surcharge, which is 100% OR, you\u2019ve got the bump now from the real estate games, incentive comp challenges. So are you looking for a step up in any of the segments in order to get further gains from that two these levels, I\u2019m just trying to understand if we\u2019re looking for any additional gains or if there are real estate gains that are coming or any or is it just the benefits maybe from the higher revenues? Thanks.\nJim Squires: Thanks, Ken. I\u2019ll take the first part of that. The guidance was that we would maintain the 60% run rate in the second half, which puts us for the full year where we had expected to be, but ahead of schedule, having gone to that mark in the second quarter. Mark?\nMark George: Yes. So Ken, just putting a finer point on things, I mean, we don\u2019t expect gains like this to happen again in the back half. So it\u2019s really maintaining the levels, ex-gains is basically implicitly what we\u2019re trying to guide to here.\nKen Hoexter: Wonderful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. One for Cindy, can you just give us a little more context on the yard and local productivity? It seems like it\u2019s a recent effort for both service and on the cost side. How far along are you into this process? Is there any way you can kind of size that up for us? You mentioned you\u2019re getting some headcount reduction benefits from that, but what else do you mostly see potentially coming from this effort and maybe you can help with how long \u2013 how far along you are with executing this initiative?\nCindy Sanborn: Yes. So thanks for the question. Yes, so the team has done a really great job with our operations efficiency team out here, really fine tuning our processes in our operating practices, if you will, within our terminal footprint. And so you\u2019ve seen again broadly the transition from humping to flat switching, which has been \u2013 which has occurred in 2019 and into 2020. And now we\u2019re fine tuning processes in other terminals, as well as our big four humps that are left. So it\u2019s essentially a very, very detailed process around matching big blocks of cars to outbound trains with the shortest amount of time between those big blocks being processed to departure, it\u2019s small things like that. But then to other things that we\u2019ve been working on as well, that with the ability to generate the capacity that we have in our terminals, particularly let\u2019s talk about Elkhart. We\u2019ve actually been able to take in volume that traditionally we had bypass to an immediate switching carriers in Chicago for forwarding to Western destinations. We\u2019ve been able to take those cars into our terminal and make direct connections to our Western carriers, our Western partners with traffic. So it\u2019s really twofold. It is a matter of fining \u2013 fine tuning processes and generating more productivity because we need less crews against the work in the terminal, as well as freeing up capacity in the terminal to bring more work into our higher powered humps that save us in this case, intermediate switching charges with Western folks. So it\u2019s pretty broad based just to what we\u2019re working on. And we will find opportunities as we look to reduce footprints at some of our smaller terminals, so it also \u2013 and also thinking about it, driving service reliability for our customers, because we\u2019re much more consistent as we work on this effort. So it\u2019s fairly broad based.\nBrian Ossenbeck: All right. Thanks for that, Cindy. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. So I just want to follow-up on the intermodal side in the near term. I mean, some of your peers on conference calls this season has said that the current service issues makes it hard to drive incremental truck to rail conversion at this point, kind of do you see things the same way? And if you don\u2019t kind of \u2013 do you see incremental share opportunities to date intermodal share from your rail peers. Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Ravi, as I talked to our intermodal channel partners, one of their primary concerns is overall capacity. They absolutely want to shift business from highway to rail. They are concerned about the overall throughput throughout the supply chain. And frankly, we\u2019re a big part of that, right? And I am confident that as our network fluidity improves, as we resolve these chassis issues as the drayage community, productivity improves as warehousing productivity improves then and we\u2019re going to be able to grow more, because there\u2019s a phenomenal opportunity out there. And our channel partners are starting to talk a lot more confidently about next year as well. So there\u2019s a lot of runway to the macro environment for us. And we\u2019re intent on addressing the issues that are within our control and working with our channel partners on things that we can do to help them grow.\nRavi Shanker: Okay, thanks. A very quick follow-up, did you quantify the accessorial in the quarter at all relative to a normal run rate and got a part of me think about that going forward.\nAlan Shaw: What we said that is about half of the improvement in RPU within intermodal as associated with the activity-based service that we provide, which is accrued under the accessorial program.\nMark George: Incremental accessorial versus last year.\nAlan Shaw: Yes.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nFadi Chamoun: Good morning. Thank you. Maybe a question for Jim, I mean, if I look across the industry, there\u2019s at least two franchises in a rail with a strong indexation to intermodal and these franchises have had a really tough time over the years to achieve and sustain below 60% operating ratio. And I think they attribute that to the intermodal business overall being a little bit more margin diluted compared to other. So my question is, as we kind of now hit that 60% mark, and you start to kind of look beyond that. What is unique about NSC\u2019s intermodal franchise that would allow it to achieve and sustain lower than 60% OR. And secondly, has this pandemic kind of changed maybe the competitive positioning of intermodal versus the other modes and maybe helping make a better line of sight on the 60% OR on a sustained basis.\nJim Squires: Thank you, Fadi. Let me first start by saying that we\u2019re not done. We are \u2013 we have more upside, more room to run when it comes to productivity and growth. So we hit the 60% run rate mark in the second quarter. We\u2019re proud of that. And we got there ahead of schedule and that\u2019s due to the hard work of all of our employees. But we\u2019re not resting on ORs. We\u2019ll continue to push. Now, one of the clear growth engines for our company and for the industry generally is intermodal. And I will say this, the economics of the intermodal business are vastly improved from what they were say 10 years ago. There\u2019s been a lot of work done, hard work done inside our company and in partnership with our companies to really drive the value proposition in intermodal. So there\u2019s lots of opportunity there for incremental margin and improvement in the operating ratio from growth in intermodal volumes going forward. And of course, the same goes for other parts of our business as well, where the incrementals are also excellent. So I think we have a winning formula all in all, growth, opportunities certainly in intermodal and certain parts of merchandise as well, coupled with a continued focus on productivity throughout the company.\nFadi Chamoun: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Spracklin: Thanks so much. Good morning, everyone. So just keeping on the intermodal capacity question, looking back pre-pandemic you guys were hitting about an 85,000 per month carload basis on intermodal and obviously dipping down during the pandemic, but coming right back up in the fourth quarter, again, hitting that 85,000 and then coming back down from that again. So my question here is understand the chassis issue and the efforts there, but given what appeared at least to be given those data is there anything longer or more fundamental from a structural standpoint that you\u2019re looking at outside of chassis that will open up your intermodal capacity after this chassis issue is completed? What would be your growth potential in intermodal after that issue is resolved by your best estimate over the next year or two?\nAlan Shaw: So Walter, you\u2019ve got chassis route safety recall issue that I\u2019ve highlighted. You also have the overall chassis, whether it\u2019s our chassis, our customers\u2019 chassis, the international grade for chassis and box issue. That\u2019s associated with stress on the drayage community and warehousing. When that gets resolved, when that starts to improve and it\u2019s three times decrease by 20%, which is what they\u2019ve been elevated by, then you\u2019re going to see more throughput through the old entire intermodal supply chain ecosystem. With respect to our overall capacity, what we\u2019re doing about it, as we improve our odd time performance at our train network, it allows our customers to schedule their appointments with more specificity, which will help them improve their overall equipment utilization. We\u2019re continuing to invest in our terminals, both physically and with technology to make our terminals more efficient, both for us and for our customers. We\u2019re rolling out a terminal based operating system for intermodal this year, which will help us improve. And we\u2019re working with our lift contractors on how we can help each other improve and make sure we\u2019re all looking at the same sorts of service metrics. So there\u2019s a number of ways in which we can all drive improvements and gains in the intermodal volumes. I\u2019ll tell you that based on our conversations with our customers we\u2019re looking at multiples of GDP growth over the long-term and that\u2019s effectively what we\u2019ve been delivering over the last 10 or 15 years as well.\nCindy Sanborn: And I also think steel will interchange, and it\u2019s has been a benefit to us here as we work with our Western partners to take pressure off the terminals in Chicago and having to drop boxes and drag them across town. So that\u2019s another area that we\u2019d love to see continue into growth. And it helps both parties to be more efficient.\nAlan Shaw: Yes. So Cindy\u2019s highlighting another area in which we\u2019re operating within the entire supply chain ecosystem in order to improve efficiency and fluidity.\nWalter Spracklin: So when this bottleneck of the chassis comes off, you see clear path of getting, I think I said monthly, I meant weekly volumes of north 85,000 on the intermodal side. And timeframe for the chassis issue overall, is that 1Q, two quarters, three quarters?\nAlan Shaw: Walter, I think you\u2019re talking about the street dwell for the chassis. Is that right?\nWalter Spracklin: Yes. Yes.\nAlan Shaw: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know when that gets resolved. I mean, that is a labor issue and that\u2019s a pandemic protocol issue.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes. Understood. Okay. No, I know that\u2019s a tough one to understand. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Landry: Thanks. Good morning. Jim, I wanted to ask about the regulatory environment. Obviously, we have the executive order or the push for reciprocal switching, but also Chairman Oberman has recently expressed concerns about intermodal terminal congestion from your edge as well as whether the rails have sufficient resources in labor in order to meet demand. So could you comment on this and whether you\u2019re concerned about the risks with the broader regulatory backdrop becomes more onerous or challenging and to the extent that you do have concerns, how might you plan to address these to the STB? Thank you.\nJim Squires: Sure, sure. Thank you, Allison. I\u2019ll get to your question about competition policy in our industry in just a minute. But I think it\u2019s worth pointing out to start with that our operations, our business model overlaps nicely with many of the administration\u2019s priorities, and we are very much in sync with what the administration is trying to achieve more broadly. So for example, sustainability as we\u2019ve talked about for a long time, and we talked about today, we are the green form of ground transportation pound for pound, mile for mile, we can handle freights more efficiently using less fuel and emitting less carbon than any other form of transportation. So there\u2019s that. And we\u2019re building on it. I hope you noted the publication of our science-based, our proof science-based target. The green bonds that we issued and many other measures that will be detailed in our ESG report that should come out shortly. Secondly, the administration and Congress are both very interested in infrastructure. Look no further than the rail industry for infrastructure that is in top shape. That\u2019s next to the private investment. That\u2019s been made over many years in infrastructure. So we excel there and what we\u2019re doing is very much in line with what the administration and Congress want to achieve. And third, the majority \u2013 the great majority of our jobs are good paying union jobs to quote the President. So there too, we are a heavily unionized industry. The jobs pay well, they\u2019re good jobs and we\u2019re hiring. So that too lines up nicely with the administration\u2019s priorities. In terms of the STB, first, look, most of what we handle is truck competitive. And most of the freight that\u2019s on our railroad will move by truck, if we move rates above the truck competitive level. For freight, we handle that is less truck competitive. There exists many mechanisms before the STB to challenge the rates and to adjudicate their fairness and the customers utilize those mechanisms all the time. So there\u2019s a way to challenge what we\u2019re doing before the STB, it works for the customers are familiar with it. The STB is familiar with it. It rests on a very sound policy framework. There\u2019s a lot of precedent. And so it\u2019s working and we don\u2019t believe the STB will take measures to change all of that. In the end, the STB has looked reciprocal switching in the past and has concluded a number of times that it\u2019s not the right solution for the industry, would create severe operational disruption. And that\u2019s not good for customers. That\u2019s not good for the railroads. That\u2019s not good for passenger trains either. So in the end, I think, they may invite evidence on that once again, as they have several times in the past. But I think they\u2019ll conclude that that\u2019s not the right measure of the mechanisms that are already in place to determine whether rates are competitive or the best that we have. So thank you.\nAllison Landry: Thank you.\nOperator: Final question for today is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon: Thanks for squeezing me in here. Alan, two quick ones\u2019 for you. Can you comment on the trend in the intermodal RPU sort of ex-fuel and the fee increase and what some of the drivers might\u2019ve been there? And then the second question is really around sort of utility coal, you mentioned is going to be down for the back half of the year. Are we kind of hitting a bottom in as you think about it in a three-year view? Or do we see \u2013\u2013 as you think about the retirement pipeline that\u2019s ahead of you, is there still further kind of room for that to bleed out into 2022, 2023?\nAlan Shaw: So David, the trend on intermodal RPU ex-fuels, as I noted, we\u2019ve got what 4.5 years of quarterly growth year-over-year in that. So I expect that to continue. We, as I noted before, based on our contract structure, we\u2019re going to have a lot of support for pricing into a market next year, not only because the market\u2019s strong next year, but right now intermodal rates lag truck pretty significantly. So there\u2019s a lot of head room for us and as our service product improves there\u2019s going to be even more demand for what we\u2019re putting out there. With respect to utility coal, we\u2019ve got some specific unit outages or retirements on our system. That\u2019s going to impact year-over-year comps. We\u2019ve got some plan maintenance. And then frankly, it\u2019s an issue of overall coal supply. Coal production in United States this year is projected to be down 18% compared to just it\u2019s 2018. There are some unsold tons out there from the producers, but we\u2019re not sure if those are going to go export or domestic with the export thermo markets so hot with API to well above $100. Then there\u2019s a lot of pull for that product overseas. If that happens, we\u2019ll continue to handle it. And that\u2019s was one of the \u2013 certainly one of the drivers of our significant growth in our export franchise in the second quarter.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session, and I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Squires for closing comments.\nJim Squires: Thank you everyone for your questions today. And we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alan Shaw",
            "content": "Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. You can see on Slide 11 that we are approaching pre-pandemic revenue levels. However, the composition of our business has changed dramatically due to the secular trends in the overall economy that were accelerated by the pandemic. Norfolk Southern is positioned at the forefront of these shifts due to the unique advantages of our powerful consumer oriented franchise and the diverse industrial markets we serve. The progress we have delivered amid dynamic business conditions underscores the value we provide to the markets we serve. Norfolk Southern's network directly connects to the majority of consumption and manufacturing in the United States, and is a vital resource for maintaining the flow of goods to support the economy. We are building on the inherent value of our network by working to provide our customers with the digital logistics solutions they need to compete and grow in an evolving market. The sustainability advantages of the Norfolk Southern franchise deliver a competitive advantage, provide customers with solutions to their carbon offset goals and are an accelerant to growth. In the second quarter of 2021, we successfully capitalized on opportunities by leveraging productivity enhancements and collaborating with our customers. As a result, second quarter revenue in our non-energy markets exceeded pre-pandemic levels by 4%. Growth this quarter was driven by consumer facing in industrial segments, which helped to offset sustain headwinds in our energy markets. Revenue and our energy related markets returned to just over two-thirds of pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of 2021. Our market position enabled a quick recovery in consumer and industrial markets almost fully offsetting the 50% decline in our energy revenue. Despite the sharp decrease in this historically profitable segment, we reduced operating ratio, levering the strengths of our unique franchise to target segments of the $800 billion truck and logistics markets, with a sharp focus on productivity. Turning to Slide 12, our quarterly volume and revenue improves significantly from pandemic caused in all three business units, reflecting our ability to capitalize and build on the momentum of improving economic conditions. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, up 34% year-over-year on a 25% volume improvement. Rising fuel prices and price gains drove a 7% improvement in revenue per unit, led by our intermodal franchise, which delivered record-breaking revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel. Sequentially, volume and revenue improved in all three business units over the first quarter in line with the accelerating economic recovery. Beginning with our merchandise segment, both volume and revenue improved 29% versus the second quarter of 2020 driven primarily by recovery from COVID-19 related shutdowns in the prior period. While automotive continued to face headwinds associated with the semiconductor chip shortage, shipments in the second quarter were up 122% year-over-year against easy comps associated with near complete shutdown of vehicle production in the second quarter of last year. Our steel franchise also delivered strong growth this quarter, up 67% as record level steel prices and elevated demand, fuel production activity. Combined gains in automotive and steel volume represented roughly 63% of total merchandise growth for the quarter. Revenue per unit was flat while revenue per unit excluding fuel declined slightly, driven by mixed headwinds in chemicals and automotive. Turning to intermodal. Our powerful franchise delivered record breaking revenue, revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel for the quarter. The second quarter of 2021 marks the 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in revenue per unit, excluding fuel for our Intermodal franchise. Strong consumer demand and tightness in the trucking sector drove growth for our domestic service product. Domestic shipments were up 17% year-over-year in the second quarter and up 4% from the same period in 2019. International shipments were also strong in the second quarter, improving 26% year-over-year on sustained high import demand, but were down 3% from the same period in 2019. Revenue per unit gains were driven by increased accessorial revenue, higher fuel surcharge revenue and price gains. Approximately 50% of the revenue per unit gain was driven by higher container storage time on terminal due to supply chain recovery challenges. Lastly, our Coal segment experienced some bright spots in the second quarter due to higher demand levels driven by global economic recovery and weather events. Coal shipments improved 55% year-over-year with strength in both the export and utility markets. Revenue per unit decreased slightly due primarily to negative mix experienced in our export markets where growth was driven by strength in the lower RPU export thermal market. Moving to our outlook on Slide 13. We expect the current economic momentum to continue through the end of the year and are raising our guidance for full year revenue growth to approximately 12% year-over-year. The overall economy continues to surprise to the upside with forecast for 2021 GDP growth now at around 7% and approximately 5% for 2022. Industrial production is forecasted to increase 6% in 2021 and north of 3% in 2020. Increased manufacturing, coupled with record low retail inventories, high savings rates and increased energy consumption, all set the stage for continued growth in the second half of the year. Merchandise growth will be led by strength in steel markets as low business inventory, the sales ratios and sustained demand for durable goods drives manufacturing activity in the second half. We are well positioned to capture opportunities associated with current strength in the steel markets as our network serves more integrated steel mills than any other railroad in North America. Merchandise energy markets will benefit from increased travel and commuting activities as businesses continue to reopen and virus restrictions are lifted. Pulp board and plastics volumes are also expected to increase as personal consumption drives demand for packaging. Merchandise gains will be partially offset by a year-over-year decline in automotive shipments in the third quarter, due to plan production downtime associated with the semiconductor shortage. Demand for international trade to support recovering global economies is expected to leave second half growth in our Intermodal franchise. Domestic intermodal demand will continue to improve as well with consumer spending and e-commerce forecast strengthening through the end of the year and ongoing capacity constraints in the trucking sector driving more opportunity for highway to rail conversions. Our Coal franchise will continue to capitalize our near-term opportunities to support global energy demand and steel production. Volume in the second half of 2021 is expected to improve year-over-year, driven by export markets benefiting from high seaborne coal prices, making U.S. coals more competitive in the global market. Demand for domestic met to support growing steel production activity is also likely to produce year-over-year growth. Gains in these markets will be partially offset by expected year-over-year declines in utility volume as this market deals with unit retirements, coal supply and plan maintenance outages. Volatility is an ever-present risk in the coal market. So we are closely monitoring geopolitical trade tensions and coal production, both of which have the potential to influence results. Overall, we expect economic conditions to be favorable for Norfolk Southern growth through the end of 2021. We are confident in our ability to leverage the strengths of our unique franchise and continue to drive revenue and margin growth. I'll now turn it over to Mark who will cover our financial results. John, the semiconductors are certainly the headline issue. What we're seeing right now is the impact of the delta variant on producers who are our suppliers, I should say, in Southeast Asia. And so we've got a couple of plants that source parts from Southeast Asia and because of issue \u2013 production issues over there, they've had to pull forward planned production downtime later this year. And so that has had an impact on our production and our volumes right now. Over time, we feel like we're going to get back to all the plants operating in August, but John, you know that we've talked about that before and had to push it back. And we're still anticipating by the fourth quarter, we're going to be in a position where we're at full production. You're right, the plants that we serve and the products that we move are in high demand. So they will be the ones that get the first call on any available parts, whether it's semiconductors or anything else. Right now finished vehicle inventories to normalize sales are in the teens. It's probably about a third or a fourth of where our customers want them. And so, we serve more U.S. vehicle production than anybody else, and we serve an industry that's going to be very interested on inventory rebuild both this year and as we move into next year. So we're pretty confident about the trajectory of our auto franchise once we kind of whether this initial bump. Yes. I'm glad you brought that up. It is 12% revenue growth, upper single digit volume growth. You're welcome, Tom. Our accessorial programs are designed to align the mutual goals in our customers for more efficient and reliable service product. And with a pressure on the drayage community and the pressure on warehousing due to pandemic protocols and labor shortages, our customers in certain locations needed more space for storage. And so we responded to the market, we've added satellite lots in some areas we've reconfigured our stack configuration at Landers our heavily international facility in Chicago. And we've been able to accommodate a lot more international units dwelling on our terminals because that's what our customers need. Our accessorials in this case are an activity-based service and price that that we apply to the market. We are absolutely focused on programs that encourage the fluidity of our operations and really our hope clearly is that the accessorials go away because that means that customers are pulling more quickly from our terminals. And as soon as customers pull boxes from our terminals, we can inbound more boxes into our terminals. It's not an issue of capacity. It's an issue of throughput and we're working on some programs to encourage dual missions with the drayage community. So anytime that they get a box, they're out getting a box as well. You mentioned chassis, I'm glad you brought that up. As you know that about six weeks ago, we determined that over 5,100 of our chassis had a manufacturing defect, it was a supplier issue. And with our uncompromising commitment to safety, we didn't hesitate to pull those off the street. Now that happened in a tough environment. We were already short of chassis because of a long gated street, well associated with the same warehouse and same drayage community pressures that I noted before. I'm very proud of the way that we have responded and frankly, in collaboration with our customers as well. We stood up a number of different locations, an entire network of vendors to repair these chassis the brand new process, we've got 80 different locations in which we are repairing chassis. Some of them are even off of our network and we're working with foreign roads our Western partners on a number of gateway locations. As a result, we've already repaired 40% of our chassis just in the first six weeks. Right now we're on a run rate where we're repairing about 10% of those affected chassis. And we fully believe that by the end of August, we will have repaired about three quarters of the effect chassis, which are effectively anything that's on our network. The rest have kind of migrated off network and we're working with the foreign roads to get that back \u2013 those back to us, so that we can repair them. We haven't closed gates. I want to make it very clear. What we're doing in certain lanes where we \u2013 at the destination we have a shortage of chassis because of this safety recall, we are metering or capping volume. And every day this improves, because every day we're repairing chassis, putting them back into the market and we are relaxing the metering program. You can see the impact on our volumes sequentially as you move out of May into the first half of June, and then where we are now. And as we continue to repair the chassis, you'll see volumes pick up. Improvement in volumes. Well, it's going to improve as we get more chassis back into the market. As I told you, we're going to have about three quarters of these, all the ones that are on our network repaired by the end of August. We're also starting this September, we're going to inject more of these out of the lease market into our network as well. So we are applying capacity to the growth opportunities that are out there for our customers. The question Scott was on RPU. We are exceeding our price plan that we had established at the end of the year, and we delivered 7% RPU growth for the quarter, despite negative mix in each of our three business units. Within merchandise, Rock Salt was up about 40%. We're happy to handle the business, but that's generally lower rated business. PIH, which is a very high rated business was down in the quarter year-over-year. But also within the auto industry, you know how disrupted individual plants have been because of these production issues or supplier issues, I should say. And just as a result of plants that took some downtime, our auto length of haul was down significantly in the second quarter, which impacted overall RPU. And I'll pivot over to coal, you referenced that and that really is continues to be a function of mix. And I guided to that, that that would be pressure going forward within our export thermal market volume was up 250% year-over-year. We've got a really good service product in that lane. And we're leveraging that to the benefit of our customers and to our shareholders. At the same time, export thermal is up 250%, which as you know is lower rated export met was up 20%. So we handled growth there in any given year we'd be very happy with 20% growth. But that just creates severe negative mix. Frankly, within export last year, three quarters of our business was met this year. It was a 50-50. So there you can see the impact on RPU. Bascome, there is a lag in our long-term contracts on intermodal price. And so we would expect next year to see more improvement and year-over-year price. Then we see this year on some of those deals. And I'll just reiterate, we're not going to see a huge uptick like you see in the spot market. We just are not structured to chase the spot market, either up or down, we take a much more measured approach with our customers. They're looking for rate surety as they go out into bid season. We want them to be successful. We're aligning with the best channel partners in the business. They're focused on growth, and we're here to support that growth over time that has generated rate increases in intermodal that exceed both the contract market and the spot market within truck. And as I talked about, we've got 18 straight quarters of year-over-year growth and RPU less fuel in intermodal both ended up markets and down. So expect a continued improvement as we move through next year. We don't expect the kind of volatility that you're seeing in the spot market. There are a number of trends that were in place that we believe were accelerated by the pandemic that includes more interest in rail, forward positioning of inventory, shifts from highway to rail. There's a number of reasons, sustainability. Jim talked about that that is definitely entering into a conversation with our customers. And in the intermodal space with our channel partners, that's helping them win business as well. I look at our industrial development activities and compared to just two or three years ago, and there was a lot more interest in economic development in rail serve sites. So yes, there is more and more activity, more and more discussion in both the merchandise and in the intermodal sphere for highway to rail conversions. And that's frankly, the way that we've positioned our franchise. That's why we're so confident about the future. Amit, our primary focus is on safety and our primary focus is on injecting capacity to help our customers grow. As the downstream impact associated with this supplier issue is fluid and it's \u2013 I'm not going to comment on that right now. Yes, we've been \u2013 we've stated that the revenue and the cost impact is not material for us to call out. We are intently focused on standing up a new program, repairing these chassis, serving our customers and injecting more assets into the network so that we can help them grow. And we got a great plan to do that. We responded very quickly to this issue. Jordan, we saw or we've continued to see kind of a measured shift in market share from West Coast, the East Coast, and that's due to over the last 10, 15 years, that's due to a number of issues widening the Suez canal, labor strife on the West Coast, then 2014 widening of the Panama canal, and just basically East Coast, is where you're seeing a lot of growth in population and consumption. We're very fortunate that our franchise serves a majority of the consumption and the manufacturing in the United States. And so, yes, we fully expect that our ports, which are very active in attracting new business. We'll continue to do so. And that's going to continue to be strength for our unique intermodal franchise. Ravi, as I talked to our intermodal channel partners, one of their primary concerns is overall capacity. They absolutely want to shift business from highway to rail. They are concerned about the overall throughput throughout the supply chain. And frankly, we're a big part of that, right? And I am confident that as our network fluidity improves, as we resolve these chassis issues as the drayage community, productivity improves as warehousing productivity improves then and we're going to be able to grow more, because there's a phenomenal opportunity out there. And our channel partners are starting to talk a lot more confidently about next year as well. So there's a lot of runway to the macro environment for us. And we're intent on addressing the issues that are within our control and working with our channel partners on things that we can do to help them grow. What we said that is about half of the improvement in RPU within intermodal as associated with the activity-based service that we provide, which is accrued under the accessorial program. Yes. So Walter, you've got chassis route safety recall issue that I've highlighted. You also have the overall chassis, whether it's our chassis, our customers' chassis, the international grade for chassis and box issue. That's associated with stress on the drayage community and warehousing. When that gets resolved, when that starts to improve and it's three times decrease by 20%, which is what they've been elevated by, then you're going to see more throughput through the old entire intermodal supply chain ecosystem. With respect to our overall capacity, what we're doing about it, as we improve our odd time performance at our train network, it allows our customers to schedule their appointments with more specificity, which will help them improve their overall equipment utilization. We're continuing to invest in our terminals, both physically and with technology to make our terminals more efficient, both for us and for our customers. We're rolling out a terminal based operating system for intermodal this year, which will help us improve. And we're working with our lift contractors on how we can help each other improve and make sure we're all looking at the same sorts of service metrics. So there's a number of ways in which we can all drive improvements and gains in the intermodal volumes. I'll tell you that based on our conversations with our customers we're looking at multiples of GDP growth over the long-term and that's effectively what we've been delivering over the last 10 or 15 years as well. Yes. So Cindy's highlighting another area in which we're operating within the entire supply chain ecosystem in order to improve efficiency and fluidity. Walter, I think you're talking about the street dwell for the chassis. Is that right? I don't know. I don't know when that gets resolved. I mean, that is a labor issue and that's a pandemic protocol issue. So David, the trend on intermodal RPU ex-fuels, as I noted, we've got what 4.5 years of quarterly growth year-over-year in that. So I expect that to continue. We, as I noted before, based on our contract structure, we're going to have a lot of support for pricing into a market next year, not only because the market's strong next year, but right now intermodal rates lag truck pretty significantly. So there's a lot of head room for us and as our service product improves there's going to be even more demand for what we're putting out there. With respect to utility coal, we've got some specific unit outages or retirements on our system. That's going to impact year-over-year comps. We've got some plan maintenance. And then frankly, it's an issue of overall coal supply. Coal production in United States this year is projected to be down 18% compared to just it's 2018. There are some unsold tons out there from the producers, but we're not sure if those are going to go export or domestic with the export thermo markets so hot with API to well above $100. Then there's a lot of pull for that product overseas. If that happens, we'll continue to handle it. And that's was one of the \u2013 certainly one of the drivers of our significant growth in our export franchise in the second quarter."

            "name": "Jim Squires",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's second quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer, Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. Building upon our momentum to start the year, our team delivered another record setting quarter, as dramatic improvement in both revenue and volume up 34% and 25% respectively, outpaced, an 11% growth in expense, and while the year-over-year improvement is aided by easier comps from last year's economic shutdown, our performance in the quarter also improved sequentially in a number of ways as shown on Slide 4. Our results include second quarter records for net income and earnings per share and all-time records for operating income and operating ratio, which was 58.3% this quarter. We're excited to share more details about our results. But first I want to take a moment to thank each and every one of our employees for helping us run a more efficient and safer railroad while serving our customers. And I'll now turn to Cindy to go through our operations. Cindy? Thank you, Mark. When we spoke last quarter, I took the opportunity to share our company's longstanding commitment to sustainability. Along those lines, I'm excited to report two brand new milestones in our journey. Earlier this quarter, we became the first North American Class 1 railroad to issue a green bond, launching $500 million in green bonds to fund sustainable investments, to reduce our carbon emissions and partner with customers to do the same. As outlined in our green financing framework, potential projects range from improving locomotive fuel efficiency to fostering truck to rail conversions, powering company operations with clean energy, to increasing the use of energy efficient buildings and technology and supporting reforestation projects that restore natural landscapes and offset carbon emissions. In addition to our green bonds, we achieved another significant milestone earlier this month with the approval of our science-based target, our commitment to reduce emissions intensity by 42% in the next 15 years. These two steps are a critical part of our shared commitment to sustainability with our investors, customers, partners and communities underscoring our resolve to be an even bigger part of the solution. Before we open the call to Q&A, I'll take a moment to provide our updated outlook based on the current economic environment. As Alan mentioned, we are even more confident about growth for the balance of this year and we now expect revenue to be up approximately 12% year-over-year. Strength in our consumer-oriented and manufacturing markets will drive the majority of the growth. And the near-term upside in coal markets will provide more of a lift this year than previously expected, though the market remains challenged in the long-term. We are also succeeding in driving productivity into our operations. And as a result we got onto our 60% run rate here in the second quarter. We expect to maintain this level for the balance of the year, which translates to at least 400 basis points of our improvement for the full year versus our adjusted 2020 result. And we'll build upon this momentum for more improvements in 2022 and long-term sustained value for our shareholders and customers. So with that, we'll open the call to your questions. Operator? Good morning, Chris. Let me start, and then I'll turn it over to Cindy to talk about some of the specific actions we're taking on the workforce front. We continue to see opportunities for workforce and other productivity in the second half of the year. Yes, we are facing some spot labor shortages, but they're just that. Systemically, we think we'll manage and that we will continue to generate labor productivity in the second half, in fact. And that should translate into favorable results for expenses and for the bottom line as well. We mentioned as part of the overall OR guidance the expectation for revenue \u2013 revised expectation for revenue, we took that up some too. So you put the two together and that gets you to the new guidance on the OR, which is more than 400 basis points for the year. Cindy talk a little bit more about what we're doing on the resource side. Mark, why don't you take that one? Thank you. Thanks, Ken. I'll take the first part of that. The guidance was that we would maintain the 60% run rate in the second half, which puts us for the full year where we had expected to be, but ahead of schedule, having gone to that mark in the second quarter. Mark? Thank you, Fadi. Let me first start by saying that we're not done. We are \u2013 we have more upside, more room to run when it comes to productivity and growth. So we hit the 60% run rate mark in the second quarter. We're proud of that. And we got there ahead of schedule and that's due to the hard work of all of our employees. But we're not resting on ORs. We'll continue to push. Now, one of the clear growth engines for our company and for the industry generally is intermodal. And I will say this, the economics of the intermodal business are vastly improved from what they were say 10 years ago. There's been a lot of work done, hard work done inside our company and in partnership with our companies to really drive the value proposition in intermodal. So there's lots of opportunity there for incremental margin and improvement in the operating ratio from growth in intermodal volumes going forward. And of course, the same goes for other parts of our business as well, where the incrementals are also excellent. So I think we have a winning formula all in all, growth, opportunities certainly in intermodal and certain parts of merchandise as well, coupled with a continued focus on productivity throughout the company. Sure, sure. Thank you, Allison. I'll get to your question about competition policy in our industry in just a minute. But I think it's worth pointing out to start with that our operations, our business model overlaps nicely with many of the administration's priorities, and we are very much in sync with what the administration is trying to achieve more broadly. So for example, sustainability as we've talked about for a long time, and we talked about today, we are the green form of ground transportation pound for pound, mile for mile, we can handle freights more efficiently using less fuel and emitting less carbon than any other form of transportation. So there's that. And we're building on it. I hope you noted the publication of our science-based, our proof science-based target. The green bonds that we issued and many other measures that will be detailed in our ESG report that should come out shortly. Secondly, the administration and Congress are both very interested in infrastructure. Look no further than the rail industry for infrastructure that is in top shape. That's next to the private investment. That's been made over many years in infrastructure. So we excel there and what we're doing is very much in line with what the administration and Congress want to achieve. And third, the majority \u2013 the great majority of our jobs are good paying union jobs to quote the President. So there too, we are a heavily unionized industry. The jobs pay well, they're good jobs and we're hiring. So that too lines up nicely with the administration's priorities. In terms of the STB, first, look, most of what we handle is truck competitive. And most of the freight that's on our railroad will move by truck, if we move rates above the truck competitive level. For freight, we handle that is less truck competitive. There exists many mechanisms before the STB to challenge the rates and to adjudicate their fairness and the customers utilize those mechanisms all the time. So there's a way to challenge what we're doing before the STB, it works for the customers are familiar with it. The STB is familiar with it. It rests on a very sound policy framework. There's a lot of precedent. And so it's working and we don't believe the STB will take measures to change all of that. In the end, the STB has looked reciprocal switching in the past and has concluded a number of times that it's not the right solution for the industry, would create severe operational disruption. And that's not good for customers. That's not good for the railroads. That's not good for passenger trains either. So in the end, I think, they may invite evidence on that once again, as they have several times in the past. But I think they'll conclude that that's not the right measure of the mechanisms that are already in place to determine whether rates are competitive or the best that we have. So thank you. Thank you everyone for your questions today. And we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Have a good day."

            "name": "Cindy Sanborn",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. We accomplished a lot this quarter and I am most pleased with our PSR progress during the past several months. We continue to get more productive, face our challenges head on and seize the opportunities we are creating. In the second quarter, we saw the benefits of a structurally lower operating cost base coupled with an operation that successfully absorbed increased volumes in the networks. Turning to the operating metrics on Slide 6, you can clearly see the operating leverage generated in the quarter, leverage that flows directly to the bottom line. Our operating discipline enabled us to handle a 25% year-over-year volume increase with 8% fewer people in our workforce and a 1% decrease in active locomotives. This success shows our improvements in train size, reflecting our goal of absorbing more business into our existing operating network wherever possible and further driving productivity. These gains were achieved in part by the increased deployment of distributed power and more blending a previously separate traffic types on the same train. We will continue to unlock train size increases through targeted siding extensions on key routes, where train length is currently limited. Terminal capacity enhancements, which we've achieved through more efficient operating practices, will also be a key factor in absorbing and processing growth on these larger trains. Increased train size promotes better fuel efficiency and our progress this quarter reflects our commitment to closing the fuel efficiency gap with our peers. Our mechanical team, which manages the maintenance of our highly reliable locomotive fleet, pulling these larger trains has been crucial to many of these accomplishments. And I'll give you more detail on that a little later in my presentation. On Slide 7, you can see in the second quarter, we showed sequential improvement in terminal dwell and train velocity, after we got through the severe winter weather in the first quarter. However, our progress was uneven and we lost ground in June, in part due to several discreet, but geographically impactful operating disruptions. We aren't satisfied with our service levels and we were working extremely hard to seize the opportunity PSR presents to recover faster from disruptions. As the graph show, we resumed our improvement in July. We are committed to continuing to improve service levels and running a faster railroad, not just because a faster railroad is a lower cost railroad, but also because speed generates capacity for us to take on additional traffic within our existing train network. I'll move to Slide 8. During the quarter, we strive to deliver a consistent service product, even with significant volume changes by focusing on the consistency and productivity of our yard and local operations. We are teaching and equipping our field managers to better measure the work, our yard and local crews do and answer some important questions. Does the number of assignments working match the cars volumes flowing through a terminal or territory? Are we getting full value out of each resource in all yards? What's the right balance of overtime costs? Where are there further automation or process opportunities to help us reduce support costs, including clerical staff and mechanical presence? We are implementing technology to provide better and more timely data to answer these questions, which helps us reduce direct operating cost and improve service consistency. In several locations, we've renewed our focus on more efficient remote control operations, which have been facilitated by the changing nature of the work over the last year. Local operations scheduled and properly sized volumes enable us to be more predictable to our customers and move cars quickly. Having a higher balance of crews assigned to road train service while creating capacity within the terminal through process enhancements, makes us nimble when responding to market changes and reducing our fixed costs. Local service is at the core of our service product and these changes are designed to improve that product. So far, we have reduced the cost per yard in local crew 7% versus last year and expect additional progress as the year continues. In a moment, Mark will discuss the benefits of reduced headcount and employee activity levels and constraining overall compensation expense as we absorb volume. Our focus on yard and local productivity has played a pivotal role in driving those benefits. We pursue targeted initiatives, such as these with an eye towards the next generation of modern railroading, which we are bringing to life today. We continue to empower our workforce to the delivery of mobility solutions and have distributed 8,000 smartphones to our T&E employees to facilitate improved reporting and to streamline the process of keeping trains moving. In the third quarter, we will begin rolling out a next generation local train reporting application to improve our visibility and customer service for the first and last mile. We are also in the final months of deployment of our current phase of the mobile track authority application that facilitates more efficient coordination between engineering and dispatching functions for right-of-way maintenance activities. We are at a very exciting time for our company and industry, in which we have ample opportunities to drive customer and shareholder value through both operational improvements and technology, a powerful formula. Earlier I mentioned the role the mechanical team has played in our PSR success. So I thought it would be useful to explain their crucial role on Slide 9. PSR railroads Norfolk Southern included ended up needing fewer locomotives. What our mechanical department has done is to take that initial A&E and use it strategically to call the worst performing units and to make our locomotive fleet more homogeneous. Those changes unlock repair productivity. Think about the benefits of repairing newer and fewer locomotives, which drove down the number of units out of service for repair. That started a virtuous cycle of improved reliability with 175% improvement in the days between unscheduled events to a shop versus pre-PSR levels. Meaning that when units do go into the shop, our craftsmen can spend more time on preventive maintenance instead of triaging issues. This cycle repeats itself and ultimately supports the efficient movement of trains and serving our customers. Fewer more reliable units also require fewer resources. So we need fewer servicing facilities and have fewer people maintaining locomotives. This is just an example, a big example of Norfolk Southern's PSR transformation. These changes are purposely aligned with our overall fleet strategy, including investments and are fewer but better units through our DC to AC conversion, energy management solutions and predictive analytic tools for maintenance, planning, and failure prevention. When taken as a whole, the benefits of this strategy flow through our materials, fuel and compensation expense lines. While ensuring we have a robust fleet capable of supporting profitable growth. Now I'll turn it over to Alan. Sure, Jim. Thanks, Chris. So if you think about where we started the year, we had planned to hire, it wasn't going to be broad-based, we expected to gain productivity in our workforce throughout the year and largely as played out that way. My prepared remarks go into some more detail on that. I will say that from a standpoint of hiring where we are hiring, there were a few hire group locations, the specific areas where the job market is extremely tight. And so we are experiencing that in our ability to bring on new employees. But it's fairly localized. It's not broad-based. So to mitigate that, we pull on some of our typical items that we \u2013 how we deploy people through what we call go teams, where we have employees that quickly can go into areas and support the existing crews that are there, temporary transfers, permanent transfers and even craft transfers from let's say, mechanical craft into transportation. And in terms of hiring some of the areas that we're working on there to \u2013 to be able to get people to come to us, we've increased our training wage and we've also have some sign-on and retention bonuses for the new employees as they come on. So we're working very diligently there. It is a headwind for us, we're watching it very, very closely. And you tied it to service and I would tell you that, our service as I think about that more broad-based and coming into the beginning of the year, we had fairly strong service measures. We went through a very challenging February and a very strong demand for volume in March on top of a really low demand for service because of the weather in February. And we started coming out of those challenges in late April and May and felt really good about where we are. As we headed into June, we had and I also described this a bit in my prepared remarks, sort of a series of events that couple of derailments, not big derailments, but just locations where they were challenging for us. And then as we're recovering from that, we had some weather events that just elongated the recovery. So June was just a challenging month. As we came out of the July holiday, July 4 holiday, we have accelerated the gains from May and the run rates that we had from May, and I feel better and good about where we are. We're not satisfied with where we are. We want to continue to improve service for our customers. But that's largely how I see the dynamic here between resources and service. Yes. Brandon, so let me start kind of at a high level. I really see we've got some very strong building blocks in place. We've continued to bring on some talent with PSR experience and Hunt Cary who was running our operations efficiency team has now added to his portfolio of responsibility to include our network operations center. So we have that going for us. We have longer term siding extensions that are going to allow us to continue to grow trains. We are still growing train length, as you heard in my prepared remarks. But there's still some work to do from a consolidation perspective on our line of road. I do think that that should be a benefit to us because it unlocks capacity, the fewer trains that we have out there and we're working every day to be better. So as I think about it in a more short-term view, we're working every day to be better. Our recruits have come down substantially in July. And as I think about even from a capacity perspective, I'll give you this kind of data point. Last quarter, I talked about the fact that on our intermodal trains at about 10% running above 10,000 feet. That's actually the same number this quarter even with the train size increases that we've seen. So we're actually starting with this smaller stuff and being able to put that together. And then as we grow the sidings, we'll be able to even do more. And again, that just unlocks capacity on line of road. So I see bright future here longer-term and then medium-term again, it's just basic blocking and tackling. And I think Hunt being in the NSC has brought some different thoughts into that work group. And I think we're seeing those benefits already in July. Yes. So thanks for the question. Yes, so the team has done a really great job with our operations efficiency team out here, really fine tuning our processes in our operating practices, if you will, within our terminal footprint. And so you've seen again broadly the transition from humping to flat switching, which has been \u2013 which has occurred in 2019 and into 2020. And now we're fine tuning processes in other terminals, as well as our big four humps that are left. So it's essentially a very, very detailed process around matching big blocks of cars to outbound trains with the shortest amount of time between those big blocks being processed to departure, it's small things like that. But then to other things that we've been working on as well, that with the ability to generate the capacity that we have in our terminals, particularly let's talk about Elkhart. We've actually been able to take in volume that traditionally we had bypass to an immediate switching carriers in Chicago for forwarding to Western destinations. We've been able to take those cars into our terminal and make direct connections to our Western carriers, our Western partners with traffic. So it's really twofold. It is a matter of fining \u2013 fine tuning processes and generating more productivity because we need less crews against the work in the terminal, as well as freeing up capacity in the terminal to bring more work into our higher powered humps that save us in this case, intermediate switching charges with Western folks. So it's pretty broad based just to what we're working on. And we will find opportunities as we look to reduce footprints at some of our smaller terminals, so it also \u2013 and also thinking about it, driving service reliability for our customers, because we're much more consistent as we work on this effort. So it's fairly broad based. And I also think steel will interchange, and it's has been a benefit to us here as we work with our Western partners to take pressure off the terminals in Chicago and having to drop boxes and drag them across town. So that's another area that we'd love to see continue into growth. And it helps both parties to be more efficient."

            "content": "Thanks, Alan. On Slide 15, you see the reconciliation of our Q2 reported operating ratio and earnings per share versus 2020. The operating ratio of 58.3% represents a 1,240 basis point improvement. We had $67 million of property gains in the quarter of which there was one major transaction that closed at the end of the quarter and resulted in a $55 million gain. We view this single transaction as incremental to our normal yearly operating property gain guidance of $30 million to $40 million and it alone represents 200 basis points of the operating ratio improvement this quarter. Earnings per share of $3.28 was $1.75 higher than prior year aside from the $0.17 goodness from the property gain, there was a state tax law change that resulted in a favorable adjustment to our deferred taxes of $0.09. Moving to Slide 16. Alan walked you through the drivers of the 34% increase in revenues, including the 25% growth in volumes. At the same time, we contain growth in operating expenses to 11% as we harvested additional benefits from workforce and asset productivity. The volume growth coupled with the productivity drove strong incremental margins again this quarter resulting in an operating ratio that was a record low 58.3%, improving 1,240 basis points year-over-year and 320 basis points versus Q1, including the 200 basis point tailwind from the major property gained. Our operating income of $1.167 billion in the quarter is another record up $557 million or 91% year-over-year. And we generated free cash flow of $1.47 billion through six months also a record. And that represents an increase of $447 million or 44% versus the same six months last year. Moving now to a drill down of operating expense performance on Slide 17. You'll see that operating expenses increased $157 million or 11% and fuel was the biggest driver of the increase with price driving expenses up $83 million. Usage increased due to higher volumes, which was partially offset by another quarter of fuel efficiency gains, a 4% improvement in the quarter. The increase in purchase services and rents is driven by volumes, although we managed to keep the increase in these categories well below the volume growth rates. Comp and ben is up 6% with savings from head count being down 8% year-over-year, offsetting increases in pay rates and overtime. Higher incentive compensation in the quarter was $39 million reflecting the improved outlook for the year and low accrual rates of last year. Despite the 25% growth in volume materials were actually down year-over-year from lower spend associated with fewer, but more productive locomotives. Thanks to the rationalization of the equipment last year and the initiatives that Cindy described earlier. The big item in the materials and other column is the favorable compare on gains from property sales in Q2 and that was $67 million in the quarter versus only $2 million last year. Turning to Slide 18. You'll see that other income net of $35 million is $14 million or 29% unfavorable year-over-year due primarily to lower net returns on our company owned life insurance investments. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was only 21% lower than we typically modelled and that was primarily from the benefit associated with the state tax law change. Net income increased by 109%, while earnings per share grew 114% supported by the nearly 3.4 million shares we repurchased in the quarter. Wrapping up now with our free cash flow on Slide 19. And as I mentioned, free cash flow was a record for the six months of 2021 at $1.47 billion buoyed by very strong operating cash generation and relatively modest property additions of $627 million thus far in the year. And that translates to a free cash flow conversion of 99% through six months. Although we still expect property additions to ramp up in the balance of the year and hit our $1.6 billion guidance number. Shareholder distributions through six months exceeds $2 billion an increase of $870 million versus prior year. Thanks to our recently increased dividend and the meaningful increase in our share repurchase activity. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jim. Sure. Look, Justin, the guidance does include it's all in. So it does include this major property gain that we called out or highlighted for you. And look, I think incrementals, we had very, very strong incrementals here in the first half. And the guidance implies we're going to continue to have very strong instrumentals in the back half, albeit, less than the first half. We do have some unique headwinds here in this second half that would include things like fuel. Fuel is a headwind to us, a lot of the incremental revenue that we're adding here in our guidance change is coming from fuel. So it's fuel surcharge, which is mitigating incremental fuel expense. So there's really no incremental margin from that. So it tends to dilute what we have organically in the back half. And then on top of that, we will have some diminishing accessorial charges, which hopefully help fuel some more volume that comes with it. And of course, we've got some IC headwind here in the back half as well. But that said incrementals are good and we continue to believe that going into 2022, we will continue to improve our OR on an incremental basis. And buoyed by some of the productivity initiatives and measures that we're constantly looking at and sending our team or iterating on the T&E side, as well as fuel efficiency that should help, again, provide us consistent and continued improvement in our overall OR quest. Hey, Scott, let me \u2013 first I'll tackle comp and ben for employee. It did step up a little bit here in the second quarter. Frankly, we ended up hitting our 60% OR a quarter or two earlier than we thought to get on that run rate, led us to increase our outlook for the year on operating ratio. And I think as you know, our incentive plan is heavily oriented toward OR improvement. So that resulted in an increase to incentive comp accruals beyond what we had initially guided. So you see about an 8% \u2013 well, sorry, 16% increase in the quarter year-over-year in comp and ben for employee. About half of that is from the incentive, the rest is really split between wage inflation over time, payroll taxes. So now I think when you look at the balance of the year, just look at it on an absolute comp for employee basis. First half is roughly around 33,000, between the first quarter, second quarter. And I think it's going to end up being pretty much in that territory in the back half as well, around 33,000, so pretty specific number there. Purchase services, it did step up. I think we guided you that it would step up. At Q1 it was more of an anomalous drop. There was some deferral of expenses. We were slow out of the gate on some spend. So I do think where we ended the second quarter was in line with what we expected. I do expect a modest pickup here in the balance of the year. For Q3 and Q4 we're containing it, it'll be less than revenue growth. But probably a little bit of a modest pickup in the back half, as some of the engineering expenses step up here during the summer months and into the fall. And also some of the IT spend will be coming through in the back half. Yes. And Amit, just \u2013 the 12% revenue guidance kind of implies, you're going to see them flattish to maybe modestly down a little in the back half. And in terms of OpEx, I think, fuel is one of the variables where that continues to creep up here in the back half. And then as I mentioned, I think the comp and ben per employee is kind of just that will stabilize and be at that 33,000 per level. Other than that, we do see a little bit of a step up, like I said to Scott on purchased services, a modest step up there. I don't think we'll see continued diminishing material spend. I think we're kind of hitting a bottom there that will probably be more flattish and rents, I think there will be some pressure as volumes are coming back, there's a little bit of a lag usually with equipment rents. And I think especially if autos, when auto starts to come back, we'll see a little bit of pressure on rents from where we are right now. Yes. So Ken, just putting a finer point on things, I mean, we don't expect gains like this to happen again in the back half. So it's really maintaining the levels, ex-gains is basically implicitly what we're trying to guide to here. Incremental accessorial versus last year."

A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star, zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Achimasi, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Norfolk Southern Corporation. Thank you, you may begin.\nMeghan Achimasi: Thank you and good morning. Please note that during today\u2019s call, we will make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section, along with our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. Along those lines, recall that in the first quarter of 2020 we launched a rationalization of our locomotive fleet by 703 units, which resulted in a non-cash charge of $385 million, so we will speak to the quarterly results excluding that charge.  A full transcript and download will be posted after the call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.\nJames Squires: Good morning everyone and welcome to Norfolk Southern\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. Norfolk Southern started strong in 2021. Our successful implementation of precision scheduled railroading translated into solid financial results. Our team delivered all-time records for operating ratio and free cash flow and achieved first quarter records for earnings per share and operating income. Northern Southern employees accomplished this despite significant supply chain disruptions brought on by severe weather nationwide in February. For the quarter, revenue increased 1% due primarily to volume growth up 3% year-over-year. At the same time, expenses declined 3% or $48 million compared to our adjusted first quarter of 2020. Throughout the quarter, we continued to streamline resources resulting in impressive gains in workforce asset and fuel productivity. Looking ahead, we remain intent on achieving strong revenue growth and efficiencies to propel the bottom line and create shareholder value. Investments in technology and sustainability will be critical, and I\u2019ll provide some recent examples of these after we review the quarter. But first, let me turn the call over to the team to go through the quarterly results in more detail, starting with Cindy.\nCindy Sanborn: Good morning. I am excited to share our first quarter achievements and what we have in the hopper looking ahead.  Our team on the ground is proving its capability and motivation to move quickly on advancing efficiency and restoring service reliability. We\u2019ve also introduced a few new team members with PSR experience who are leading initiatives alongside our field team to increase productivity inside our major hump and flat switching terminals. These actions are having an immediate impact for our shareholders and our customers. Slide 6 shows our operational indicators. While volumes were variable in the quarter, efficiency gains were consistent. By absorbing additional volumes within our existing train network, despite how those volumes varied during the quarter, we were able to realize substantial gains in train length and train weight and improve fuel efficiency. Productivity initiatives such as locomotive horsepower optimization and additional usage of distributed power were key to the success. Execution of our efficient scheduled railroading plan enabled us to handle more freight with fewer resources compared to a year ago.  Let me add some more color on train length. We are committed to improving productivity by running longer trains, and accomplishing that involves targeted investments within certain parts of our network. During the quarter, we completed an initial assessment of incremental infrastructure that will aid our long train initiative. As a result, we\u2019ve begun construction on a long siding extension in the Chicago-Atlanta corridor that will be complete ahead of this year\u2019s peak season, and we have identified two others that we will begin construction on this year. We will quickly identify and address opportunities to efficiently deploy capital to support both train consolidation and organic growth. Moving to Slide 7, weekly carload fluctuations tell an important story of the quarter. Volumes rose quickly coming out of the new year\u2019s holiday and were running several percentage points higher than last year, until severe winter weather arrived in February. This affected both railroad operations and our shippers, with Chicago being hit the hardest by both snow and extreme cold. While we kept main lines fluid, overall supply chain congestion slowed traffic through terminals. I would like to especially recognize our field operations, engineering and signals teams for ensuring a safe and efficient operation despite historic cold deep into our network. Their work is critical to the success of NS and our customers. Beyond the weather episodes, we continued to adjust our yard network to handle volume increases expected during the year. We are focusing on driving improved efficiency and reliability at our key terminals, which in turn creates a capacity dividend that enables us to absorb both volume variability and overall growth. We are continuing our yard and terminal focus in the second quarter. Slide 8 shows that to start the year, network fluidity was comparable to 2019 levels, but a condensed winter that followed in February impacted our velocity and terminal dwell and snarled supply chains in general. As you see by the network performance trends over the past seven weeks, we continue to progress and are committed to further improvement to get our service reliability to where we want it to be. Additional progress creating consistent fluidity leads to enhanced rail car velocity, which in turn benefits our shareholders and customers. I\u2019ll finish on Slide 9 by explaining how we continued Norfolk Southern\u2019s operating transformation during the quarter and how it showed up in the results. We\u2019ve undertaken a series of focused initiatives to improve capacity and drive down dwell at our major terminals, including current humps as well as flat switching operations. These improvements support the longer and heavier trains we are running, allowing us to operate efficiently with fewer resources. Finally, Q1 reinforced the benefits of effective interline cooperation, and we are building on that even though the winter weather has passed.  The results show in both productivity and asset usage. These trends have been improving since we implemented Top 21 in mid-2019, but the team has been able to both accelerate and extend the improvement and we are very well positioned to continue these trends, leveraging our efficiency initiatives with rising volumes.  Thank you for your time, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you Cindy, and good morning everyone. Beginning on Slide 11, we experienced significant volume volatility in the first quarter. We delivered a strong start to the year with January volume exceeding last year, while February was challenged with winter weather events that disrupted supply chains cross the country. Progressing into March, business levels improved as supply chain fluidity started to recover and we adjusted to dynamic shifts in the freight environment. I will now turn to Slide 12, highlighting our revenue and volume performance for the first quarter of 2021. Despite the difficult operating conditions, overall revenue improved 1% year-over-year to $2.6 billion while volume grew 3%. Revenue per unit excluding fuel improved in each of our individual business units this quarter, reflecting our commitment to grow yield as part of our long-term strategy, though total revenue per unit and revenue per unit excluding fuel were down slightly due to the mix of intermodal volume growth with declines in merchandise volume. Merchandise revenue fell 4% from prior year levels on a 3% volume decline. This segment faced difficult pre-COVID comps in the energy sector. Partially offsetting these declines were gains in soybean, steel and automotive shipments. March U.S. light vehicle sales surged to a 17.7 million unit seasonally adjusted annual rate, the second highest March ever, while inventories are at a 10-year low. Merchandise revenue per unit excluding fuel reached a record high for the quarter, delivering 24 consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in this market.  Intermodal revenue and volume both increased compared to the first quarter of 2020. Volume growth was driven by a continuation of the inventory replenishment cycle combined with the tight truck market and strength in consumer activity as retail sales grew 9.8% in March, the largest sequential increase since May 2020 when sales initially rebounded as states reopened from shutdowns. Intermodal revenue per unit excluding fuel improved 6% year-over-year, supported by continued strength in the LTL market driven by growth in ecommerce. This marks the 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in this metric and a record high. Our coal business delivered 5% revenue growth in the quarter. Volume gains were driven mostly by export thermal shipments as the global economic recovery continued, as well as tailwinds from China-Australia trade tensions. Domestic met and coke volumes continued to improve as demand for finished product accelerated. Utility demand was down as it continued to be pressured from product substitution and lower industrial load. Revenue per unit improved 3% year-over-year, inclusive of a $9 million incremental gain from volume shortfall revenue. We have an unrivalled consumer-oriented franchise that continued to benefit our customers and shareholders throughout the quarter. Although severe weather certainly impacted business levels particularly in February, our diverse industrial franchise serves the improving manufacturing economy and we saw gains from rising commodity prices. We are delivering sustainable revenue growth in line with our long term strategy to capitalize on the strength of our franchise and provide value-added solutions in the marketplace. Moving to Slide 13, our outlook for the remainder of the year is strong. Consensus for U.S. GDP growth is north of 6%, the highest in the last 40 years. PMI rose to 64.7 in March, hitting the highest level since 1983, while inventories remain low. These are expected to be key factors driving robust economic activity for the rest of 2021. We remain confident that our markets will achieve volume growth in the high single digits this year and our franchise is poised to capitalize on the expected growth that will drive value for both our customers and our shareholders.  Merchandise growth will be driven by continued expansion in the manufacturing sector. Elevated demand levels coupled with low dealer inventories in the automotive segment will drive volume gains; however, the current semiconductor chip shortage creates uncertainty as to the timing of the recovery. U.S. light vehicle production currently is expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels in 2021. That production growth along with the return of total industrial production to pre-pandemic levels will drive steel demand, which is another market where we expect to generate volume growth as the year progresses. We also anticipate our energy markets within merchandise will benefit from the return of gasoline demand in the consumer travel sector as the economy fully reopens.  Our intermodal franchise will continue to build on the momentum associated with the ongoing U.S. economic recovery. An expected rise in consumer spending, low inventory levels, and continued tightness in the trucking sector are all key factors boosting growth opportunities. Spending on durable goods is expected to grow 15% in 2021, which bodes well for our domestic intermodal franchise that is closely correlated with consumption markets. International intermodal will benefit from the resumption of global trade activity.  Coal business will remain challenged in 2021. The export thermal market continues as a near term strength, although with a lower RPU than average. Domestic met and coke volume is expected to improve in line with the economic recovery. Natural gas and renewal energy source conversions will continue to negatively impact the utility markets. Decisions on stockpile levels will be determined by summer weather and gas prices. In summary, we expect to generate revenue growth in 2021 as economic conditions continue to improve. As the needs of our customers constantly evolve, we remain diligent in delivering valuable transportation solutions to the marketplace. We continue to focus on initiatives to drive growth, margin improvement, and a strong service product. We are confident in our ability to leverage our value in the marketplace to secure new opportunities to support our customers\u2019 growth and grow our margins.  I will now turn it over to Mark, who will cover our financial results. \nMark George: Thanks Alan. As Jim mentioned, the OR and EPS records we achieved in the quarter came through disciplined cost control while handling additional volume in the midst of pretty challenging operating conditions.  On Slide 15, walking you through our summarized results compared with an adjusted first quarter 2020, we reported an OR of 61.5%, which was a 220 basis point improvement, and an earnings per share improvement of $0.08. I will note that the $0.08 improvement in EPS was dampened by the absence of a gain recognized last year from a 2012 income tax refund that equated to $0.09, so core EPS improvement in the quarter was $0.17. Moving to Slide 16, revenue grew 1% in the quarter due primarily to the 3% increase in volume year-over-year, with growth in intermodal and coal more than offsetting declines in merchandise. At the same time, we drove operating expenses down by 3% as we harvested additional benefits from workforce and asset productivity. The volume growth coupled with the productivity drove the operating ratio down to a record low 61.5%, improving 220 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially versus Q4. This produced operating income of $1 billion, another record, up $62 million or 7% year-over-year, and we generated first quarter free cash flow of $750 million, also a record, up $161 million or 27% versus the first quarter of 2020. Moving to a drill down of operating expense improvement on Slide 17, the reduction of $48 million or 3% comes with improvements in nearly all expense categories. Material and other were collectively down $15 million or 9% as we continued to see lower spend associated with fewer but more productive locomotives thanks to the rationalization of equipment last year. Fuel expense was down $12 million with benefits evenly split between price and reduced consumption, thanks largely to a 3% improvement in fuel efficiency.  Comp and benefits declined $11 million or 2% from lower employment costs related to a workforce that was 12% smaller than a year ago and 2% smaller than the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting these tailwinds are headwinds this year from higher and stock-based compensation. Purchase services and rents were collectively down $10 million or 2% as reduced freight car expenses more than offset higher spend associated with technology investments and increased intermodal volumes. When matched to a 3% volume increase, the 3% decline in opex provides another quarter of additional productivity, building in the work we\u2019ve done over the past several quarters, as you\u2019ll see here on Slide 18. From the quarter that we launched our Top 21 operating plan, we have made meaningful progress on our workforce productivity with GTMs per employee up 16% since the third quarter of 2019 and a 340 basis point improvement in our operating ratio. We remain intensely focused and committed to drive further improvements. Turning to Slide 19 for the remainder of the P&L below operating income, you\u2019ll see that other income net of $7 million is $15 million of 68% unfavorable year-over-year due primarily to lower net returns on our company-owned life insurance investments. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was just over 22%, and recall last Q1 we had the 2012 tax refund that resulted in a lower effective tax rate. As a result, net income increased by 1% compared to pre-tax earnings growth of 5%. Earnings per share rose by 3%, supported by 2.3 million shares that we repurchased in the quarter at an average price of $254.  Wrapping up now with our free cash flow on Slide 20, free cash flow at $750 million was buoyed by strong operating cash conversion and a relatively modest $265 million in property additions in the quarter, which was below our annual targeted run rate for the year due to timing issues, including weather related delays and capital spend. Shareholder distributions totaled $840 million, an increase of $132 million versus prior year thanks to our recently increased dividend and a meaningful increase in our share repurchase activity to nearly $600 million.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jim.\nJames Squire: Thank you Mark. You\u2019ve heard this morning about all the productivity improvements stemming from our adoption of PSR. Our company is also in the middle of a digital transformation. We expect investments in technology to drive the next phase of improvements in service growth, efficiency and sustainability at Norfolk Southern, and we\u2019re already making great headway. Slide 22 shows a few recent examples.  The introduction of new mobile apps and a redesign of our customer portal are giving customers a more user-friendly and truck-like experience, delivering real time shipment intelligence, facility truck to rail conversions, and reducing emissions. We\u2019re putting an easy-to-use mobile application in the hands of our train conductors, streamlining internal workflow and improving shipment visibility for customers. We\u2019re digitizing our internal and external communications through a new CRM platform, enabling better, faster decision making.  We\u2019re using new information systems to promote intermodal equipment utilization and efficiency at our intermodal terminals. We\u2019re using predictive analytics to reduce locomotive failures and plan maintenance proactively. Machine vision technology is creating a path to automated track and freight car inspections with manifold benefits to safety and efficiency. On Slide 23, we show that NS has been a sustainability leader for over a decade. Years ago, we recognized the importance of reducing our environment footprint, beginning in 2007 when we first established our sustainability program. We\u2019ve been reporting on our results ever since, delivering on the goals we set forth. Here we highlight a few key milestones and also show a few examples of external recognition, including recently being named by the Wall Street Journal as one of the 100 Most Sustainably Managed Companies. In summary, we have a track record of leadership on sustainability which is good for business and the right thing to do for all our stakeholders.  Although we don\u2019t generally update guidance, given the unusual circumstances in the first quarter with February\u2019s extreme cold and a global supply chain disruption, let me wrap up restating our confidence in our ability to meet the market for full year 2021 with the expectation that strength in consumer-oriented and manufacturing markets will drive 9% revenue growth year-over-year. For the full year, we expect to achieve more than 300 basis points of OR improvement versus our adjusted 2020 result, and we expect to end 2021 with a 60% run rate OR. As we\u2019ve said before, once we achieve these targets, we won\u2019t stop improving. We\u2019re optimistic about growth in the year ahead and all the initiatives we have underway to create long-term sustained value for our shareholders.  Before we open the call to Q&A, I want to quickly address the proposed transactions involving another Class 1 railroad. We\u2019re watching the situation closely, but we won\u2019t be discussing the proposals or industry speculation generally. As the regulatory review process unfolds, there will be opportunities for further discussion. As our first quarter performance demonstrates, we remain focused on enhancing operational efficiency and delivering value for our shareholders and customers, and we look forward to addressing your questions about our results and outlook. With that, we\u2019ll open the call to questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, thanks. Good morning everybody. I wanted to see if we could start with the outlook, particularly the operating ratio, so strong performance in the first quarter. If you look at normal seasonality, it actually seems like you\u2019re on kind of a 60 or maybe even sub-60 run rate as it stands right now, based on what you\u2019ve been able to achieve first quarter through the rest of the year in the last five years. Maybe you can give us some thoughts and your view on that progress towards that 60 run rate, and are there some things from a cost perspective that we should keep in mind as the year progresses or maybe is there the opportunity to potentially exceed your expectations?\nJames Squire: Good morning Chris. Let me begin by pointing out that while seasonality certainly hasn\u2019t been repealed, it was a strong first quarter and somewhat anomalous, given the surge of volume we\u2019ve experienced both in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter due to the economies reopening. Also, we were out there with some bullish guidance, some pretty bullish outlook on the economy during 2021 early. In January, we forecast 9% volume growth for the year, so we got ahead of this. We were feeling bullish about the economy and the business opportunity way back in January. So here we are now - we\u2019ve posted a great first quarter, it\u2019s a good start to the year. We\u2019re off and running, and we remain optimistic about the year to come. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll talk a lot more about the specifics during the call, but we remain optimistic and we\u2019re going to continue to push. We expect to be where we said we would be back in January by the end of this year in terms of OR.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it. Then maybe just a follow-up on the progress you\u2019re making in workforce productivity you highlighted on Slide 18 and some of the other efforts you\u2019re making around PSR. It seems like the process is unfolding quite nicely, so can you talk maybe about sort of the bigger picture, maybe beyond 2021 - you know, what maybe the opportunity is for you to continue to improve the cost structure of the business?\nCindy Sanborn: Chris, this is Cindy. I\u2019ll answer your question, and I appreciate the question. You know, as we talked about and you saw in Mark\u2019s notes--slides around GTMs per employee, that was a record for us this quarter even with all the challenges that we face, and we\u2019re going to continue to see opportunities as we consolidate trains, get longer trains. We are making some investments that I called out in my remarks that help us with train length by investing in some sidings. Part of PSR, and as I\u2019ve learned it through the last few years, it is about getting your plan right-sized for the time and then continuing to tweak it, continuing to find efficiencies in places that maybe you don\u2019t expect. I think we\u2019ll be able to see continued improvement in locomotive utilization, fuel, headcount, all of those areas beyond 2021. As Jim described, when we were thinking about where we should be at the end of this year, we\u2019re not going to stop with where we end up.  We\u2019ll continue to find those opportunities, so I feel very, very good about what the team has accomplished so far, even with a very challenging, very volatile first quarter of this year, and that gives me great confidence that we\u2019ll continue through 2021 and into \u201922 with very good efficiency performance. \nChris Wetherbee: Okay, well thanks very much for the time. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. \nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. Jim, I know you said you weren\u2019t going to comment on the proposed mergers from the Canadian rails and KCS, but I did just want to ask generally if you had any thoughts around rail mergers and your willingness to participate in further consolidation if the opportunity were to present itself.\nJames Squire: Well Justin, I recognize that this situation is kind of dominating the airwaves right now, and there are a lot of interested industry stakeholders focused on the proposed transaction, including NS, and we will be protective of our shareholders\u2019 interests and our customers\u2019 interests. We will be active participants in any transaction that may transpire out of this. With that said, I really think it would not be fruitful for us this morning to focus on other people\u2019s deals - you know, hypothetical knock-on effects, what the STB may do, etc., but rather let\u2019s focus on our first quarter, which I humbly submit was pretty spectacular, and our outlook for the rest of the year.\nJustin Long: Fair enough. Maybe for my follow-up, just to circle back to the guidance, the guidance for the OR improvement of 300 basis points, or greater than 300 basis points this year, is somewhat open ended. Mark, I\u2019m curious - has anything changed in terms of your expectation on headcount this year, and then maybe you could comment on yields and what you\u2019re thinking for RPU as well.\nMark George: Sure. With regard to headcount, you may recall back in January, Cindy and I reiterated that we would expect headcount and employment levels to be flat to down over the course of this year despite the volume guidance that we gave, which was high single digits leading to revenue that would be roughly 9%. We\u2019re tracking to that right now and we actually believe that we will continue to stay on that guidance for the balance of this year, so we\u2019re feeling good about the way that\u2019s unfolding and transpiring. Alan, you want to talk a little bit about yields and RPU?\nAlan Shaw: Yes Justin, we had talked about to expect a reduction in revenue per unit in the first quarter and then year-over-year growth in quarters two through four. That\u2019s still our anticipation. I expect that we\u2019ll see RPU growth through the remainder of the year and full year. We\u2019re sticking with our 9% revenue guidance for the year. Most of that is associated with volume increases, so RPU will improve slightly. That\u2019s more of a reflection of mix with intermodal growing pretty rapidly and strength in the lower RPU export thermal market than it is with respect to price.\nJustin Long: Okay, I appreciate the time. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: Yes, thanks. Morning guys. Just a couple things on the cost side. Compensation per employee was up a lot. Any thoughts on how to model that? Then we\u2019ve just seen a little volatility in purchase services costs. Just any thoughts on how to model that, if that stays down year-over-year, if that starts to trend higher. Thank you. \nMark George: Thanks Scott for the question. Comp and ben per employee was up 11% in the first quarter, and really roughly half of that was related to the incentive and stock-based comp headwind that we reported there on the slide in the first quarter. You can expect that that kind of headwind will persist throughout the balance of this year. The other half of the headwind is really split between the increase we saw in the first quarter in overtime, which shouldn\u2019t persist throughout the balance of the year, as well as the normal couple, few points of wage inflation headwind as well as some little uptick in payroll tax that should also persist. There will be some level of comp headwind. It won\u2019t be 11% in the balance of the year, but maybe a little bit more than half of that is probably a good way to model it.  Now for purchase services, it was a low quarter for us for sure. I think the rest of the year is going to depend on kind of the volumetric pieces that we continue to work on, but engineering--remember engineering spend, that will step up during the summer months, and also IT. A lot of the IT investments are going to really start to hit us more in the back half of the year, second, third, fourth quarter, so I do think that you\u2019ll see purchase services up from this level, probably back to where we were in the fourth quarter. That\u2019d probably be a good way to model it quarterly going forward.\nScott Group: Okay, thanks. Then Alan, just quickly for you, can you just talk about the underlying pricing environment and what you\u2019re seeing there?\nAlan Shaw: Yes Scott, it\u2019s improving, as you would anticipate. We\u2019re seeing commodity prices move up, steel prices are at record highs. You\u2019ve seen strength in lumber, you\u2019ve seen strength in grain products, seen strength in plastics, and as we\u2019ve progress through the first couple months of the year, we\u2019ve raised our plan on our transactional business within intermodal.  Now, recognize that\u2019s a very small component of our franchise; however, we are seeing continued strength in the trucking market. Some of the things I\u2019m reading, Scott, are point to the fact that truck capacity is actually projected to tighten throughout the year from a very robust environment right now, so we\u2019re feeling pretty good about the pricing environment for the remainder of this year and as we move into 2022.\nScott Group: Okay, thank you guys. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Landry: Good morning, thanks. Some of the other rails that have implemented PSR provide trip plan compliance metrics for car load and intermodal networks. Is this something that you guys look at closely, and if so, could you just give us a sense for where you might be tracking on this metric or whatever metric you think is most relevant? Just really trying to understand how network reliability has improved and where it stands today, outside of just looking at the public service metrics that we can see.\nCindy Sanborn: Allison, thank you. What I will say is what we share with you is what we\u2019re really working on, and you\u2019ve seen since I\u2019ve been here, not necessarily service related but we added train length to some of the measures that we provide some color on.  On the service piece, we did have service deliver index - SDI, and found that that wasn\u2019t something we\u2019re really managing to. What we\u2019re managing to more as we put in PSR was car velocity, and so that\u2019s going to be the area that we\u2019re focusing on and have developed that measure, broadly created the ability to drill down for accountability at local levels, looked at it beyond just the geographic component, also the car type component of car velocity, what car types are moving faster than others, and that\u2019s really where we\u2019re going to be headed in how we think about that and talk about that. In time to come, we\u2019ll also share that with you. \nAllison Landry: Okay, perfect. Cindy, also you talked about the use of distributed power - obviously that I\u2019m sure is contributing to the improvement in fuel efficiency. Could you give us--like, what percent of the trains are now equipped or running with BPUs, and then just in terms of closing the gap with some of your peers in terms of gallons per GPM, when you think about the ways that you can improve that, are BPUs and expanding the use of them a big driver, or is it more increased train length and weight? If you could sort of speak to the different drivers and if you expect the fuel efficiency or the improvement to accelerate as we move through 2021. Thank you.\nCindy Sanborn: Okay Allison. I would say that all of the above that you mentioned, including energy management, are levers for us to continue to improve in locomotive utilization and therefore fuel demand, so I see a very strong opportunity to continue to run our trains at full capability of locomotives - we call that full pen. I\u2019ve talked about that on earlier calls. In our manifest network, we\u2019re at full pen maybe 13% to 15% of the time at this point on a district by district basis, so we see some opportunity there. You talked about distributed power. We have--actually, we increased distributed power utilization on trains that we didn\u2019t use distributed power by 11%, almost 12% in the first quarter. It is a record for us, and the last record was fourth quarter, so we have real good trajectory with distributed power which, to your point, is also beneficial to us from a fuel perspective. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do on fuel, and those are the areas that we\u2019re working on to get us there.\nAllison Landry: Great, thanks Cindy.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks, good morning everyone. A couple of questions on intermodal, maybe looking out a little bit here. Cindy, what percentage of your carload volumes do you think will be intermodal about maybe three years from now, kind of just looking at the growth trajectory there versus the other end markets? Also, how does the mix in intermodal today compare to where it was a few years ago? Just trying to see if that mix gap that has traditionally existed is closing or not.\nAlan Shaw: Ravi, we\u2019re expecting the intermodal to lead our growth for the next couple years. Actually, I should point to consumer-oriented products. We\u2019ve got an unrivalled intermodal franchise in the east. We also serve more U.S. vehicle production than any other railroad in North America, and we\u2019ve got a consumer oriented merchandise franchise where we\u2019re actively focused on providing a truck-like product there to compete with trucks. We\u2019re really intent on providing the simplicity of trucks coupled with the efficiency of rail, and that revolves around a very highly reliable and predictable service product with very good digital tools for our interface with our customers. That\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see the growth markets from us, and then we\u2019ll participate in the ebbs and flows within the commodity markets. You know, you don\u2019t have to go back that long - 2011, we had $3.5 billion of coal revenue and about 45% of our overall revenue was associated with the energy markets. Now, we\u2019ve got about $1 billion of coal revenue and we\u2019ve got about $2 billion in the energy markets, so despite that mix and despite that shift, we\u2019ve improved our margin profile as well, so we\u2019re very confident in our plan going forward. We\u2019ve got a robust franchise that faces the fastest growing segments of the U.S. economy, which is going to benefit our customers and our shareholders. \nRavi Shanker: Got it, thanks for that update. Also, kind of just following up on the digital update that you gave us, which was very useful, I\u2019m wondering if you guys have spent much time at all thinking about autonomous trucks and how that might come into the network or influence the truck market over the next several years, and just what your view there is.\nJames Squire: It\u2019s a threat and we view it as such. The time horizon is somewhat uncertain, but it\u2019s certainly something to be aware of and to be planning for, and we are. We are doing so through efforts to automate our own operations and to go down the path of more efficient and productive railroading via automation, via digital investments ourselves. \nMark George: That said, we know that in our industry, we\u2019ve got a much more attractive sustainability profile even if trucking goes on an automated fashion. We still provide a better sustainability solution.\nRavi Shanker: Great, thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nThomas Wadewitz: Yes, good morning. I wanted to see if you could comment--I guess this is probably for Cindy. Obviously there\u2019s some constraints across the system, I think we\u2019ve seen it at some of the intermodal terminals. Some of it is kind of in your control, probably a lot of it is not. How do you think about where you\u2019re at from a fluidity perspective at some of your key intermodal terminals, and what needs to be done to see that improve?\nJames Squire: Alan, why don\u2019t you take that one?\nAlan Shaw: Yes. Tom, if you\u2019ll permit, I\u2019d like to cover that because it involves that intersection between our network and our customers\u2019 network. What you\u2019ve seen and what you continue to see is stress across the entire supply chain. That can be with warehouses, which are having trouble with productivity associated with COVID protocols, but they\u2019re also having trouble with labor staffing. You see that in the drayage community as well, and so that could back things up. Despite that, we delivered 13% increase in intermodal revenue ex-fuel surcharge in the quarter on top of 11% improvement in intermodal revenue ex-fuel surcharge in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve got a great franchise, we\u2019ve got the best channel partners in the industry. We are collaborating with them on how to solve some of these issues and help them grow even more.\nCindy Sanborn: I\u2019d add to that, Tom, from the network perspective, we work really closely with intermodal terminal folks to make sure we are moving trains appropriately for the support--with the freight that can actually be offloaded, so there\u2019s good coordination so that any challenges within the terminals do not spill over onto [indiscernible].\nThomas Wadewitz: Right, okay. Then for a follow-up, Cindy, you had implemented some changes in the southeast part of the network, I believe it was fourth quarter. When you make changes, sometimes there are adjustments to the new schedule or new flow of traffic, and then you\u2019ve also had weather and growing volumes. How do you think that that--you know, did that work well, and how do you think about additional schedule changes, or do you think you kind of stick with the current schedule and just execute against that?\nCindy Sanborn: Thanks for the question. The southeast plan that you describe, we actually started implementing in November, very beginning of November, and we\u2019re largely through some of the adjustments that we needed to make as we came into the first part of the year. That was working well, then we kind of hit this volatility that I described in my prepared remarks that was induced by weather, that was--and also volume, and so I step back from the southeast plan and almost go all the way back to the changes with Top 21 and our terminal footprint and how it\u2019s changed, the consolidation of trains to make longer trains and how that\u2019s been beneficial to us, and we really pressure tested it with volume and we had to make some adjustments, some in the southeast plan, certainly across the north. You saw our service product, maybe as we came out of March, we were starting to really see some improvements in dwell and train velocity, but we did have to do some tweaks. We had to get back in there and make some changes. They were highly productive, they helped us be more effective and efficient, and I think we\u2019ll continue to see the service-related measures improve. Real pleased with some of the work particularly at Bellevue and Elkhart, that has taken place over the last couple of weeks and months, and I think we\u2019re really on a good glide path. I will also say that all the changes we made, the volatility that we worked through in the quarter, we didn\u2019t see cars online jump up. We were able to continue to move, continue work with our customers so that we didn\u2019t see a drag on additional car volume that was sitting on the network, so I feel really good about where we are and a lot of good work went into getting us to this point. I\u2019m very, very pleased with the team.\nThomas Wadewitz: Great, thank you for the perspective. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, morning everybody. Mark, you provided that cost structure slide in the past, the fixed versus variable cost structure and kind of the implications for incremental margin. The cost structure, I guess, is obviously evolving as you implement PSR, but there\u2019s obviously a lot of revenue growth year-on-year in the second quarter and hopefully beyond. I know you guys have this OR target out there that\u2019s helpful, but what\u2019s the right calibration for incrementals on that growth, on that outsized growth in Q2 and beyond just relative to the cost structure disclosure you\u2019ve provided in the past?\nMark George: Thanks Amit. Look, our outlook is to generate strong incrementals throughout the balance of the year, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to accrete and grow our operating ratio--sorry, shrink our operating ratio. Our goal here is on pretty much all line items to absorb and hold the--absorb the volume and hold the cost as flat as possible, and that\u2019s kind of the challenge and the mandate we\u2019ve given to the organization. That\u2019s going to really translate into the OR improvement that we\u2019re projecting.  As I mentioned, you\u2019ll have some geography. Purchase services really started off strong. Probably going to see that pop a little bit, for the reasons I just cited a few minutes ago, but when we look at some of the other line items like rents and comp and ben, etc., our goal is really to just try to hold firm and absorb volume, so I think you\u2019re going to see good incrementals the rest of the year.\nAmit Mehrotra: So if I\u2019m just interpreting your comments, this $1.6 billion opex base is kind of the neighborhood you\u2019re going to be in over the course of the year as revenue ramps? Is that correct?\nMark George: That\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re targeting. I\u2019m not going to get more precise than rounding to the hundreds of millions, but yes, that\u2019s our goal, is to sit there and try to hold cost while we absorb the volume. But of course, one of the variables, Amit, is fuel will go up throughout the balance of the year - we are projecting that, but we should have some--hopefully some lag on fuel. Surcharge should help mitigate some of that too. \nAmit Mehrotra: Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thank you. Then just one quick follow-up for Alan, I guess. The coal yields, consistently kind of surprised to the upside, and then just wondering your best guess in terms of where you think coal yields will shake out as we progress through the remainder of the year.\nAlan Shaw: Yes Amit, good morning. I\u2019d prefer to surprise to the upside than the downside on yields.\nAmit Mehrotra: That\u2019s for sure.\nAlan Shaw: We did call out a specific volume shortfall accrual in the quarter that was $9 million ahead of last year, so with that respect, that helped. We had a lot of cross currents with respect to our overall yield in coal as well. I talked a lot about export thermal - for us, we were able to deliver 66% growth in export thermal coal in the quarter, and that\u2019s due very specifically to the great service product that we\u2019ve had into that market. We\u2019re happy to have that business, it\u2019s accretive to our margins, our bottom line, and helps OR; however, it does come with a lower overall RPU. Then within the utility franchise, we actually had more growth in our utility south franchise than utility north, which is positive for overall RPU, so there\u2019s a lot of things going on within coal. With export thermal as the growth driver, going forward that\u2019s primarily going to put pressure on overall RPU and, frankly, we\u2019ll see what happens in the utility franchise. We\u2019ve got a number of plants right now whose stockpiles have deteriorated over the winter, but very few are in the process of rebuilding stockpiles now, which is frankly what you would expect during shoulder months. That\u2019s a point of caution going forward, is utility volumes and how that shakes out, and then what\u2019s the impact on overall RPU.\nAmit Mehrotra: Yes, okay. Makes sense. Thank you very much. Congrats on the good results. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Hi, good morning. Just a quick question on intermodal and the pricing. It seems like the yield-up maybe is turning a real corner - 6% ex-fuel. I\u2019m just curious specifically on intermodal yields, given the truck tightness and hopefully service getting better, as you alluded to, is this a yield number, sort of a core yield number that we could think about going forward from here?\nAlan Shaw: Jordan, we had some positive mix associated with our intermodal franchise. We saw domestic volumes increase more than international volumes through the quarter. Domestic is generally a 53-foot container relative to a 40-foot container but has a higher RPU. Then even within that, you see that supercharge LTL premium market, which is benefiting RPU.  I\u2019ll remind you and everyone else that we\u2019ve got 17 consecutive quarters of overall RPU improvement in our air modal franchise through cycles in the market. There was--contract rates in the truck market went down last year, and yet our intermodal RPU ex-fuel was up 3.4%. There was a truck recession in 2019, and yet our intermodal RPU ex-fuel went up 2.4%, so we take a very steady approach to valuing the quality of our product and in our approach with our channel partners. We really want them to be able to grow and compete, and so what they\u2019re looking for from us is rate surety over the course of the year as they go into their bid cycles. Over time, our intermodal RPU ex-fuel in our pricing has outpaced that of the contract market and the spot market, and we\u2019re leading in growth, so I think we\u2019ve got the right strategy going forward to deliver value for our intermodal channel partners and our shareholders.\nJordan Alliger: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Cindy. Can you just give us a sense as to how you see resources in terms of headcount out in the field, if any of the different regions require a little bit more attention or not, how the recall from furloughs is going, how retention is going, that sort of thing, especially when you look at the strong growth you\u2019re expecting? You mentioned there\u2019s a few, it sounded like leaders maybe a little bit higher up - we saw one announced. Are there any other folks with maybe a bit more PSR experience that you\u2019re looking to bring onboard?\nCindy Sanborn: Yes Brian, on the headcount side on [indiscernible], I mentioned or you saw--I\u2019ll start with this, you saw it in Mark\u2019s slides that we\u2019re continuing to improve in our productivity. We are--and we are guiding to be flat to down from where we ended December. All that is still in play. We are however--we have recalled furloughs in many of our locations where we\u2019re out of furloughs, and we are doing some spot hiring. It\u2019s not broad-based, and frankly it\u2019s to help offset attrition slightly. We do have attrition that continues quarter by quarter, year by year, so we are doing some hiring. We want to make sure we provide a good service product to our customers. We\u2019re very integrated with what the forecast looks like with Alan\u2019s team and have spent a lot of time working on a training plan that gives us a lot more agility in being able to respond when we need to, in places where we do see attrition and we need to backfill. We\u2019ve kind of decentralized our raining and gotten it down to a much shorter period of time, about eight weeks, where we\u2019re actually training folks in the places where they\u2019re going to work, so they\u2019re still going to be a very safe employee but we\u2019re able to condense the amount of--I guess improve the speed to market, if you will, and respond to needs of service. We\u2019ve got to provide a good service product to our customers. With the volume that we\u2019re seeing, we will need to hire, but I feel really good about the process that we have and the ability for us to continue to manage that, and overall still improve our productivity around T&E productivity.  I forgot your second question.\nAlan Shaw: PSR talent.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Yes, sorry - PSR talent. \nCindy Sanborn: Yes, so we did publicly announce Hunt Cary joining from UP. He and I had worked together over several different stops in our career in different railroads. He\u2019s been a real good add, integrated well with the team. There are several others in the organization that we have brought on, and if we have a need, we will continue to find good fits for them within NS. I think part of it is the integration of it, and that\u2019s gone very, very well, and I think the long tenured NS folks are happy to have the additional support and helping them make the changes that we need. I feel really good about where we are, and we\u2019ll always be looking for places where we can bring external folks in with PSR experience that can help us achieve our goals.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Right. Okay, thanks Cindy. One quick one for Mark. Can you just--obviously a very strong quarter, but can you give us some sense as to if you quantify the impact of weather or, I guess more specifically, on fuel with timing lags, how that impacted the quarter would be helpful to put into context as well. Thank you.\nMark George: Yes, we didn\u2019t really quantify weather. I mean, certainly it did have an impact. We felt it in the form of higher overtime, certainly higher re-crews. We had some snow removal costs as well. We just didn\u2019t think it was material enough to break out. Look, overall fuel was a headwind in the quarter because we didn\u2019t really get the lag benefit of the fuel surcharge coming through here in the first quarter, so we had $34 million of headwind in fuel revenue. But we did have very good fuel efficiency performance that provided good tailwind for us on the expense side, and I think you saw the numbers on the slide for fuel. Thanks Brian.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Right, thanks Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning everyone. Alan, I wanted to come back to intermodal pricing, because I think on the January call you did imply that you weren\u2019t going to get a lot of pricing benefit from the tight trucking market until 2022. I think you did mention a few mix impacts on yield - I think the suggestion was that those yields are going to be sustainable throughout the year, but can you talk maybe more explicitly on pricing in that market and any differences between domestic or international?\nAlan Shaw: Yes Brandon, what we\u2019re seeing is the pricing environment continues to improve. The truck capacity tightness we expect is going to last through this year and into next year. I was looking at something last night, and it makes sense - warehousing and trucking are pulling from the same blue collar pool out there, and you know what\u2019s going on in the warehousing market, rates are up 8% year-over-year. As people are forward positioning inventory next to the end markets, that\u2019s a tight market. In our transactional intermodal business, we are updating our price plan; however as I noted, that\u2019s a relatively small component of our overall price. I\u2019ve talked through our rate structure with our customers, and so you can see that over time we\u2019re going to exceed contract and spot rates. As I noted, it\u2019s over time. We have long term contracts, we want to make sure that we provide our channel partners, who are phenomenal at growing, with surety on their rates as they go through bid season. We take a measured approach, it takes time. Over time, it\u2019s the right thing to do for our customers and our shareholders. \nBrandon Oglenski: Okay, so just to clarify, it\u2019s mostly mix then that we saw on the acceleration in yields?\nAlan Shaw: Yes.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay, and then one last quick follow-up for Cindy. Cindy, you mentioned that you guys are really focused on car velocity, which I think I can understand from your perspective; but ultimately don\u2019t your customers care about a service delivery index, or am I just not understanding that correctly? \nCindy Sanborn: Well, I think we all agree that moving a car faster is good for both asset utilization and our customers, so that is really kind of a happy medium with solving all of those issues. We measure our local delivery processes, our in-transit processes as well, but ultimately if any of those break down, you\u2019re going to see that car velocity, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re focusing on that.  We have quite a bit of focus in general on serving our customers well, and Alan and I talk about that quite a bit and make sure we are aligned on that topic.\nAlan Shaw: Yes, Cindy\u2019s focus is on running a highly efficient, highly reliable and fluid network, and within our interactions with our customers, we have shared KPIs that are individual to those customers, not an index, so we\u2019re having conversations every day with our customers that are metrics-based on the quality of the product that we\u2019re delivering and the value we bring into the market. \nMark George: It\u2019s much more granular than SDI ever is.\nAlan Shaw: Yes.\nBrandon Oglenski: Appreciate it, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Great, thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats on the solid job here. Cindy, a lot of information on PSR and the improvement. Where do you think you are on the path here in terms of when you step back, the hump, the flat switching? Is the major stuff done and now it\u2019s the incremental improvements? Do you still see, when you look at this, the opportunity for capital investment? You mentioned some of the sidings. Is there any other projects that you look at, that still need to be implemented to get any more step function gains, or is this just kind of maybe incrementals? Then just a side question - any real estate gains in the quarter, or plans for the year?\nCindy Sanborn: Ken, I think that we still have some structural work that we need to do, whether that\u2019s from a train size perspective or continuing to move forward with some terminal efficiencies beyond the footprint that we have today, but that\u2019s going to depend on volume and where traffic wants to go. We want to make sure that we serve our customers well and we do it in an efficient, reliable way, so I think there\u2019s still more structural work to be done and then we\u2019ll, to your point, continue to tweak and refine from there. But I think I see a great opportunity ahead of us.\nMark George: And Ken, let me answer your question on real estate. We had a pretty light quarter - we only had about $4 million of operating gains this year from the sale of real estate in the first quarter, and that was versus $11 million last Q1, so it was actually down $7 million year-over-year. Again, we\u2019d tell you to guide--to bookmark around $30 million to $40 million over the course of the year, and we\u2019d stick with that. There are years where we do have outsized specific items where when that happens, we\u2019ll call it out and let you know, but for the time being I\u2019d bookmark $30 million to $40 million for the year, even though we\u2019re a little shy of that run rate here in the first quarter.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks Cindy and Mark. Then my follow-up, Jim, you mentioned--I would love to ask about M&A in terms of the impact on the industry, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re going to answer. But on the technology side, the autonomous track and car inspections, is there anything new that you\u2019re working on as we prepare? Do you think going to one-man crews is the next step in this phase? You were asked about autonomous before. Just interested in--and you mentioned a lot of step-up in tech investments, it seems like an opportunity to keep making some strides, so maybe you can follow up on the tech side\nJames Squire: Sure, happy to. Yes, I would say broadly that our focus when it comes to technology-led productivity and efficiency gains has been on the asset base, on the track structure in particular. We\u2019ve put a lot of time and attention into automating, digitizing our track inspection protocols and accumulating that data and using it to more efficiently maintain our track. It\u2019s a huge part of our asset base, so you can understand easily why we would start there.  We have begun to extend out into other parts of what we do. We\u2019re working on automating freight car inspections using machine vision systems. We are working hard on automating our crew room, reporting for duty, how we report out the conductors\u2019 work in the yard and online of road - that gets automated, so many aspects of how we do our work in the field will be automated, put on a handheld.  We\u2019re leveraging the PTC network in a variety of ways as well, the communications network to think about automating train operations too. Next generation automated train operations presents a terrific opportunity for us to operate more efficiently and more safely, and so I\u2019ll close on that note.\nJames Squire: I want to thank everyone for your questions this morning, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nMark George: Take care, all.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "name": "Alan Shaw",
            "content": "Thank you Cindy, and good morning everyone. Beginning on Slide 11, we experienced significant volume volatility in the first quarter. We delivered a strong start to the year with January volume exceeding last year, while February was challenged with winter weather events that disrupted supply chains cross the country. Progressing into March, business levels improved as supply chain fluidity started to recover and we adjusted to dynamic shifts in the freight environment. I will now turn to Slide 12, highlighting our revenue and volume performance for the first quarter of 2021. Despite the difficult operating conditions, overall revenue improved 1% year-over-year to $2.6 billion while volume grew 3%. Revenue per unit excluding fuel improved in each of our individual business units this quarter, reflecting our commitment to grow yield as part of our long-term strategy, though total revenue per unit and revenue per unit excluding fuel were down slightly due to the mix of intermodal volume growth with declines in merchandise volume. Merchandise revenue fell 4% from prior year levels on a 3% volume decline. This segment faced difficult pre-COVID comps in the energy sector. Partially offsetting these declines were gains in soybean, steel and automotive shipments. March U.S. light vehicle sales surged to a 17.7 million unit seasonally adjusted annual rate, the second highest March ever, while inventories are at a 10-year low. Merchandise revenue per unit excluding fuel reached a record high for the quarter, delivering 24 consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in this market.  Intermodal revenue and volume both increased compared to the first quarter of 2020. Volume growth was driven by a continuation of the inventory replenishment cycle combined with the tight truck market and strength in consumer activity as retail sales grew 9.8% in March, the largest sequential increase since May 2020 when sales initially rebounded as states reopened from shutdowns. Intermodal revenue per unit excluding fuel improved 6% year-over-year, supported by continued strength in the LTL market driven by growth in ecommerce. This marks the 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in this metric and a record high. Our coal business delivered 5% revenue growth in the quarter. Volume gains were driven mostly by export thermal shipments as the global economic recovery continued, as well as tailwinds from China-Australia trade tensions. Domestic met and coke volumes continued to improve as demand for finished product accelerated. Utility demand was down as it continued to be pressured from product substitution and lower industrial load. Revenue per unit improved 3% year-over-year, inclusive of a $9 million incremental gain from volume shortfall revenue. We have an unrivalled consumer-oriented franchise that continued to benefit our customers and shareholders throughout the quarter. Although severe weather certainly impacted business levels particularly in February, our diverse industrial franchise serves the improving manufacturing economy and we saw gains from rising commodity prices. We are delivering sustainable revenue growth in line with our long term strategy to capitalize on the strength of our franchise and provide value-added solutions in the marketplace. Moving to Slide 13, our outlook for the remainder of the year is strong. Consensus for U.S. GDP growth is north of 6%, the highest in the last 40 years. PMI rose to 64.7 in March, hitting the highest level since 1983, while inventories remain low. These are expected to be key factors driving robust economic activity for the rest of 2021. We remain confident that our markets will achieve volume growth in the high single digits this year and our franchise is poised to capitalize on the expected growth that will drive value for both our customers and our shareholders.  Merchandise growth will be driven by continued expansion in the manufacturing sector. Elevated demand levels coupled with low dealer inventories in the automotive segment will drive volume gains; however, the current semiconductor chip shortage creates uncertainty as to the timing of the recovery. U.S. light vehicle production currently is expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels in 2021. That production growth along with the return of total industrial production to pre-pandemic levels will drive steel demand, which is another market where we expect to generate volume growth as the year progresses. We also anticipate our energy markets within merchandise will benefit from the return of gasoline demand in the consumer travel sector as the economy fully reopens.  Our intermodal franchise will continue to build on the momentum associated with the ongoing U.S. economic recovery. An expected rise in consumer spending, low inventory levels, and continued tightness in the trucking sector are all key factors boosting growth opportunities. Spending on durable goods is expected to grow 15% in 2021, which bodes well for our domestic intermodal franchise that is closely correlated with consumption markets. International intermodal will benefit from the resumption of global trade activity.  Coal business will remain challenged in 2021. The export thermal market continues as a near term strength, although with a lower RPU than average. Domestic met and coke volume is expected to improve in line with the economic recovery. Natural gas and renewal energy source conversions will continue to negatively impact the utility markets. Decisions on stockpile levels will be determined by summer weather and gas prices. In summary, we expect to generate revenue growth in 2021 as economic conditions continue to improve. As the needs of our customers constantly evolve, we remain diligent in delivering valuable transportation solutions to the marketplace. We continue to focus on initiatives to drive growth, margin improvement, and a strong service product. We are confident in our ability to leverage our value in the marketplace to secure new opportunities to support our customers' growth and grow our margins.  I will now turn it over to Mark, who will cover our financial results. Yes Justin, we had talked about to expect a reduction in revenue per unit in the first quarter and then year-over-year growth in quarters two through four. That's still our anticipation. I expect that we'll see RPU growth through the remainder of the year and full year. We're sticking with our 9% revenue guidance for the year. Most of that is associated with volume increases, so RPU will improve slightly. That's more of a reflection of mix with intermodal growing pretty rapidly and strength in the lower RPU export thermal market than it is with respect to price. Yes Scott, it's improving, as you would anticipate. We're seeing commodity prices move up, steel prices are at record highs. You've seen strength in lumber, you've seen strength in grain products, seen strength in plastics, and as we've progress through the first couple months of the year, we've raised our plan on our transactional business within intermodal.  Now, recognize that's a very small component of our franchise; however, we are seeing continued strength in the trucking market. Some of the things I'm reading, Scott, are point to the fact that truck capacity is actually projected to tighten throughout the year from a very robust environment right now, so we're feeling pretty good about the pricing environment for the remainder of this year and as we move into 2022. Ravi, we're expecting the intermodal to lead our growth for the next couple years. Actually, I should point to consumer-oriented products. We've got an unrivalled intermodal franchise in the east. We also serve more U.S. vehicle production than any other railroad in North America, and we've got a consumer oriented merchandise franchise where we're actively focused on providing a truck-like product there to compete with trucks. We're really intent on providing the simplicity of trucks coupled with the efficiency of rail, and that revolves around a very highly reliable and predictable service product with very good digital tools for our interface with our customers. That's where you're going to see the growth markets from us, and then we'll participate in the ebbs and flows within the commodity markets. You know, you don't have to go back that long - 2011, we had $3.5 billion of coal revenue and about 45% of our overall revenue was associated with the energy markets. Now, we've got about $1 billion of coal revenue and we've got about $2 billion in the energy markets, so despite that mix and despite that shift, we've improved our margin profile as well, so we're very confident in our plan going forward. We've got a robust franchise that faces the fastest growing segments of the U.S. economy, which is going to benefit our customers and our shareholders. Yes. Tom, if you'll permit, I'd like to cover that because it involves that intersection between our network and our customers' network. What you've seen and what you continue to see is stress across the entire supply chain. That can be with warehouses, which are having trouble with productivity associated with COVID protocols, but they're also having trouble with labor staffing. You see that in the drayage community as well, and so that could back things up. Despite that, we delivered 13% increase in intermodal revenue ex-fuel surcharge in the quarter on top of 11% improvement in intermodal revenue ex-fuel surcharge in the fourth quarter. We've got a great franchise, we've got the best channel partners in the industry. We are collaborating with them on how to solve some of these issues and help them grow even more. Yes Amit, good morning. I'd prefer to surprise to the upside than the downside on yields. We did call out a specific volume shortfall accrual in the quarter that was $9 million ahead of last year, so with that respect, that helped. We had a lot of cross currents with respect to our overall yield in coal as well. I talked a lot about export thermal - for us, we were able to deliver 66% growth in export thermal coal in the quarter, and that's due very specifically to the great service product that we've had into that market. We're happy to have that business, it's accretive to our margins, our bottom line, and helps OR; however, it does come with a lower overall RPU. Then within the utility franchise, we actually had more growth in our utility south franchise than utility north, which is positive for overall RPU, so there's a lot of things going on within coal. With export thermal as the growth driver, going forward that's primarily going to put pressure on overall RPU and, frankly, we'll see what happens in the utility franchise. We've got a number of plants right now whose stockpiles have deteriorated over the winter, but very few are in the process of rebuilding stockpiles now, which is frankly what you would expect during shoulder months. That's a point of caution going forward, is utility volumes and how that shakes out, and then what's the impact on overall RPU. Jordan, we had some positive mix associated with our intermodal franchise. We saw domestic volumes increase more than international volumes through the quarter. Domestic is generally a 53-foot container relative to a 40-foot container but has a higher RPU. Then even within that, you see that supercharge LTL premium market, which is benefiting RPU.  I'll remind you and everyone else that we've got 17 consecutive quarters of overall RPU improvement in our air modal franchise through cycles in the market. There was--contract rates in the truck market went down last year, and yet our intermodal RPU ex-fuel was up 3.4%. There was a truck recession in 2019, and yet our intermodal RPU ex-fuel went up 2.4%, so we take a very steady approach to valuing the quality of our product and in our approach with our channel partners. We really want them to be able to grow and compete, and so what they're looking for from us is rate surety over the course of the year as they go into their bid cycles. Over time, our intermodal RPU ex-fuel in our pricing has outpaced that of the contract market and the spot market, and we're leading in growth, so I think we've got the right strategy going forward to deliver value for our intermodal channel partners and our shareholders. PSR talent. Yes Brandon, what we're seeing is the pricing environment continues to improve. The truck capacity tightness we expect is going to last through this year and into next year. I was looking at something last night, and it makes sense - warehousing and trucking are pulling from the same blue collar pool out there, and you know what's going on in the warehousing market, rates are up 8% year-over-year. As people are forward positioning inventory next to the end markets, that's a tight market. In our transactional intermodal business, we are updating our price plan; however as I noted, that's a relatively small component of our overall price. I've talked through our rate structure with our customers, and so you can see that over time we're going to exceed contract and spot rates. As I noted, it's over time. We have long term contracts, we want to make sure that we provide our channel partners, who are phenomenal at growing, with surety on their rates as they go through bid season. We take a measured approach, it takes time. Over time, it's the right thing to do for our customers and our shareholders. Yes. Yes, Cindy's focus is on running a highly efficient, highly reliable and fluid network, and within our interactions with our customers, we have shared KPIs that are individual to those customers, not an index, so we're having conversations every day with our customers that are metrics-based on the quality of the product that we're delivering and the value we bring into the market. Yes."

            "name": "Cindy Sanborn",
            "content": "Good morning. I am excited to share our first quarter achievements and what we have in the hopper looking ahead.  Our team on the ground is proving its capability and motivation to move quickly on advancing efficiency and restoring service reliability. We've also introduced a few new team members with PSR experience who are leading initiatives alongside our field team to increase productivity inside our major hump and flat switching terminals. These actions are having an immediate impact for our shareholders and our customers. Slide 6 shows our operational indicators. While volumes were variable in the quarter, efficiency gains were consistent. By absorbing additional volumes within our existing train network, despite how those volumes varied during the quarter, we were able to realize substantial gains in train length and train weight and improve fuel efficiency. Productivity initiatives such as locomotive horsepower optimization and additional usage of distributed power were key to the success. Execution of our efficient scheduled railroading plan enabled us to handle more freight with fewer resources compared to a year ago.  Let me add some more color on train length. We are committed to improving productivity by running longer trains, and accomplishing that involves targeted investments within certain parts of our network. During the quarter, we completed an initial assessment of incremental infrastructure that will aid our long train initiative. As a result, we've begun construction on a long siding extension in the Chicago-Atlanta corridor that will be complete ahead of this year's peak season, and we have identified two others that we will begin construction on this year. We will quickly identify and address opportunities to efficiently deploy capital to support both train consolidation and organic growth. Moving to Slide 7, weekly carload fluctuations tell an important story of the quarter. Volumes rose quickly coming out of the new year's holiday and were running several percentage points higher than last year, until severe winter weather arrived in February. This affected both railroad operations and our shippers, with Chicago being hit the hardest by both snow and extreme cold. While we kept main lines fluid, overall supply chain congestion slowed traffic through terminals. I would like to especially recognize our field operations, engineering and signals teams for ensuring a safe and efficient operation despite historic cold deep into our network. Their work is critical to the success of NS and our customers. Beyond the weather episodes, we continued to adjust our yard network to handle volume increases expected during the year. We are focusing on driving improved efficiency and reliability at our key terminals, which in turn creates a capacity dividend that enables us to absorb both volume variability and overall growth. We are continuing our yard and terminal focus in the second quarter. Slide 8 shows that to start the year, network fluidity was comparable to 2019 levels, but a condensed winter that followed in February impacted our velocity and terminal dwell and snarled supply chains in general. As you see by the network performance trends over the past seven weeks, we continue to progress and are committed to further improvement to get our service reliability to where we want it to be. Additional progress creating consistent fluidity leads to enhanced rail car velocity, which in turn benefits our shareholders and customers. I'll finish on Slide 9 by explaining how we continued Norfolk Southern's operating transformation during the quarter and how it showed up in the results. We've undertaken a series of focused initiatives to improve capacity and drive down dwell at our major terminals, including current humps as well as flat switching operations. These improvements support the longer and heavier trains we are running, allowing us to operate efficiently with fewer resources. Finally, Q1 reinforced the benefits of effective interline cooperation, and we are building on that even though the winter weather has passed.  The results show in both productivity and asset usage. These trends have been improving since we implemented Top 21 in mid-2019, but the team has been able to both accelerate and extend the improvement and we are very well positioned to continue these trends, leveraging our efficiency initiatives with rising volumes.  Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it over to Alan. Chris, this is Cindy. I'll answer your question, and I appreciate the question. You know, as we talked about and you saw in Mark's notes--slides around GTMs per employee, that was a record for us this quarter even with all the challenges that we face, and we're going to continue to see opportunities as we consolidate trains, get longer trains. We are making some investments that I called out in my remarks that help us with train length by investing in some sidings. Part of PSR, and as I've learned it through the last few years, it is about getting your plan right-sized for the time and then continuing to tweak it, continuing to find efficiencies in places that maybe you don't expect. I think we'll be able to see continued improvement in locomotive utilization, fuel, headcount, all of those areas beyond 2021. As Jim described, when we were thinking about where we should be at the end of this year, we're not going to stop with where we end up.  We'll continue to find those opportunities, so I feel very, very good about what the team has accomplished so far, even with a very challenging, very volatile first quarter of this year, and that gives me great confidence that we'll continue through 2021 and into '22 with very good efficiency performance. Allison, thank you. What I will say is what we share with you is what we're really working on, and you've seen since I've been here, not necessarily service related but we added train length to some of the measures that we provide some color on.  On the service piece, we did have service deliver index - SDI, and found that that wasn't something we're really managing to. What we're managing to more as we put in PSR was car velocity, and so that's going to be the area that we're focusing on and have developed that measure, broadly created the ability to drill down for accountability at local levels, looked at it beyond just the geographic component, also the car type component of car velocity, what car types are moving faster than others, and that's really where we're going to be headed in how we think about that and talk about that. In time to come, we'll also share that with you. Okay Allison. I would say that all of the above that you mentioned, including energy management, are levers for us to continue to improve in locomotive utilization and therefore fuel demand, so I see a very strong opportunity to continue to run our trains at full capability of locomotives - we call that full pen. I've talked about that on earlier calls. In our manifest network, we're at full pen maybe 13% to 15% of the time at this point on a district by district basis, so we see some opportunity there. You talked about distributed power. We have--actually, we increased distributed power utilization on trains that we didn't use distributed power by 11%, almost 12% in the first quarter. It is a record for us, and the last record was fourth quarter, so we have real good trajectory with distributed power which, to your point, is also beneficial to us from a fuel perspective. We've got a lot of work to do on fuel, and those are the areas that we're working on to get us there. I'd add to that, Tom, from the network perspective, we work really closely with intermodal terminal folks to make sure we are moving trains appropriately for the support--with the freight that can actually be offloaded, so there's good coordination so that any challenges within the terminals do not spill over onto [indiscernible]. Thanks for the question. The southeast plan that you describe, we actually started implementing in November, very beginning of November, and we're largely through some of the adjustments that we needed to make as we came into the first part of the year. That was working well, then we kind of hit this volatility that I described in my prepared remarks that was induced by weather, that was--and also volume, and so I step back from the southeast plan and almost go all the way back to the changes with Top 21 and our terminal footprint and how it's changed, the consolidation of trains to make longer trains and how that's been beneficial to us, and we really pressure tested it with volume and we had to make some adjustments, some in the southeast plan, certainly across the north. You saw our service product, maybe as we came out of March, we were starting to really see some improvements in dwell and train velocity, but we did have to do some tweaks. We had to get back in there and make some changes. They were highly productive, they helped us be more effective and efficient, and I think we'll continue to see the service-related measures improve. Real pleased with some of the work particularly at Bellevue and Elkhart, that has taken place over the last couple of weeks and months, and I think we're really on a good glide path. I will also say that all the changes we made, the volatility that we worked through in the quarter, we didn't see cars online jump up. We were able to continue to move, continue work with our customers so that we didn't see a drag on additional car volume that was sitting on the network, so I feel really good about where we are and a lot of good work went into getting us to this point. I'm very, very pleased with the team. Yes Brian, on the headcount side on [indiscernible], I mentioned or you saw--I'll start with this, you saw it in Mark's slides that we're continuing to improve in our productivity. We are--and we are guiding to be flat to down from where we ended December. All that is still in play. We are however--we have recalled furloughs in many of our locations where we're out of furloughs, and we are doing some spot hiring. It's not broad-based, and frankly it's to help offset attrition slightly. We do have attrition that continues quarter by quarter, year by year, so we are doing some hiring. We want to make sure we provide a good service product to our customers. We're very integrated with what the forecast looks like with Alan's team and have spent a lot of time working on a training plan that gives us a lot more agility in being able to respond when we need to, in places where we do see attrition and we need to backfill. We've kind of decentralized our raining and gotten it down to a much shorter period of time, about eight weeks, where we're actually training folks in the places where they're going to work, so they're still going to be a very safe employee but we're able to condense the amount of--I guess improve the speed to market, if you will, and respond to needs of service. We've got to provide a good service product to our customers. With the volume that we're seeing, we will need to hire, but I feel really good about the process that we have and the ability for us to continue to manage that, and overall still improve our productivity around T&E productivity.  I forgot your second question. Yes, so we did publicly announce Hunt Cary joining from UP. He and I had worked together over several different stops in our career in different railroads. He's been a real good add, integrated well with the team. There are several others in the organization that we have brought on, and if we have a need, we will continue to find good fits for them within NS. I think part of it is the integration of it, and that's gone very, very well, and I think the long tenured NS folks are happy to have the additional support and helping them make the changes that we need. I feel really good about where we are, and we'll always be looking for places where we can bring external folks in with PSR experience that can help us achieve our goals. Well, I think we all agree that moving a car faster is good for both asset utilization and our customers, so that is really kind of a happy medium with solving all of those issues. We measure our local delivery processes, our in-transit processes as well, but ultimately if any of those break down, you're going to see that car velocity, so that's why we're focusing on that.  We have quite a bit of focus in general on serving our customers well, and Alan and I talk about that quite a bit and make sure we are aligned on that topic. Ken, I think that we still have some structural work that we need to do, whether that's from a train size perspective or continuing to move forward with some terminal efficiencies beyond the footprint that we have today, but that's going to depend on volume and where traffic wants to go. We want to make sure that we serve our customers well and we do it in an efficient, reliable way, so I think there's still more structural work to be done and then we'll, to your point, continue to tweak and refine from there. But I think I see a great opportunity ahead of us."

            "content": "Good morning everyone and welcome to Norfolk Southern's first quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. Norfolk Southern started strong in 2021. Our successful implementation of precision scheduled railroading translated into solid financial results. Our team delivered all-time records for operating ratio and free cash flow and achieved first quarter records for earnings per share and operating income. Northern Southern employees accomplished this despite significant supply chain disruptions brought on by severe weather nationwide in February. For the quarter, revenue increased 1% due primarily to volume growth up 3% year-over-year. At the same time, expenses declined 3% or $48 million compared to our adjusted first quarter of 2020. Throughout the quarter, we continued to streamline resources resulting in impressive gains in workforce asset and fuel productivity. Looking ahead, we remain intent on achieving strong revenue growth and efficiencies to propel the bottom line and create shareholder value. Investments in technology and sustainability will be critical, and I'll provide some recent examples of these after we review the quarter. But first, let me turn the call over to the team to go through the quarterly results in more detail, starting with Cindy."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Mark George",
            "content": "Thanks Alan. As Jim mentioned, the OR and EPS records we achieved in the quarter came through disciplined cost control while handling additional volume in the midst of pretty challenging operating conditions.  On Slide 15, walking you through our summarized results compared with an adjusted first quarter 2020, we reported an OR of 61.5%, which was a 220 basis point improvement, and an earnings per share improvement of $0.08. I will note that the $0.08 improvement in EPS was dampened by the absence of a gain recognized last year from a 2012 income tax refund that equated to $0.09, so core EPS improvement in the quarter was $0.17. Moving to Slide 16, revenue grew 1% in the quarter due primarily to the 3% increase in volume year-over-year, with growth in intermodal and coal more than offsetting declines in merchandise. At the same time, we drove operating expenses down by 3% as we harvested additional benefits from workforce and asset productivity. The volume growth coupled with the productivity drove the operating ratio down to a record low 61.5%, improving 220 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially versus Q4. This produced operating income of $1 billion, another record, up $62 million or 7% year-over-year, and we generated first quarter free cash flow of $750 million, also a record, up $161 million or 27% versus the first quarter of 2020. Moving to a drill down of operating expense improvement on Slide 17, the reduction of $48 million or 3% comes with improvements in nearly all expense categories. Material and other were collectively down $15 million or 9% as we continued to see lower spend associated with fewer but more productive locomotives thanks to the rationalization of equipment last year. Fuel expense was down $12 million with benefits evenly split between price and reduced consumption, thanks largely to a 3% improvement in fuel efficiency.  Comp and benefits declined $11 million or 2% from lower employment costs related to a workforce that was 12% smaller than a year ago and 2% smaller than the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting these tailwinds are headwinds this year from higher and stock-based compensation. Purchase services and rents were collectively down $10 million or 2% as reduced freight car expenses more than offset higher spend associated with technology investments and increased intermodal volumes. When matched to a 3% volume increase, the 3% decline in opex provides another quarter of additional productivity, building in the work we've done over the past several quarters, as you'll see here on Slide 18. From the quarter that we launched our Top 21 operating plan, we have made meaningful progress on our workforce productivity with GTMs per employee up 16% since the third quarter of 2019 and a 340 basis point improvement in our operating ratio. We remain intensely focused and committed to drive further improvements. Turning to Slide 19 for the remainder of the P&L below operating income, you'll see that other income net of $7 million is $15 million of 68% unfavorable year-over-year due primarily to lower net returns on our company-owned life insurance investments. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was just over 22%, and recall last Q1 we had the 2012 tax refund that resulted in a lower effective tax rate. As a result, net income increased by 1% compared to pre-tax earnings growth of 5%. Earnings per share rose by 3%, supported by 2.3 million shares that we repurchased in the quarter at an average price of $254.  Wrapping up now with our free cash flow on Slide 20, free cash flow at $750 million was buoyed by strong operating cash conversion and a relatively modest $265 million in property additions in the quarter, which was below our annual targeted run rate for the year due to timing issues, including weather related delays and capital spend. Shareholder distributions totaled $840 million, an increase of $132 million versus prior year thanks to our recently increased dividend and a meaningful increase in our share repurchase activity to nearly $600 million.  With that, I'll turn it back over to Jim. Sure. With regard to headcount, you may recall back in January, Cindy and I reiterated that we would expect headcount and employment levels to be flat to down over the course of this year despite the volume guidance that we gave, which was high single digits leading to revenue that would be roughly 9%. We're tracking to that right now and we actually believe that we will continue to stay on that guidance for the balance of this year, so we're feeling good about the way that's unfolding and transpiring. Alan, you want to talk a little bit about yields and RPU? Thanks Scott for the question. Comp and ben per employee was up 11% in the first quarter, and really roughly half of that was related to the incentive and stock-based comp headwind that we reported there on the slide in the first quarter. You can expect that that kind of headwind will persist throughout the balance of this year. The other half of the headwind is really split between the increase we saw in the first quarter in overtime, which shouldn't persist throughout the balance of the year, as well as the normal couple, few points of wage inflation headwind as well as some little uptick in payroll tax that should also persist. There will be some level of comp headwind. It won't be 11% in the balance of the year, but maybe a little bit more than half of that is probably a good way to model it.  Now for purchase services, it was a low quarter for us for sure. I think the rest of the year is going to depend on kind of the volumetric pieces that we continue to work on, but engineering--remember engineering spend, that will step up during the summer months, and also IT. A lot of the IT investments are going to really start to hit us more in the back half of the year, second, third, fourth quarter, so I do think that you'll see purchase services up from this level, probably back to where we were in the fourth quarter. That'd probably be a good way to model it quarterly going forward. That said, we know that in our industry, we've got a much more attractive sustainability profile even if trucking goes on an automated fashion. We still provide a better sustainability solution. Thanks Amit. Look, our outlook is to generate strong incrementals throughout the balance of the year, and that's how we're going to accrete and grow our operating ratio--sorry, shrink our operating ratio. Our goal here is on pretty much all line items to absorb and hold the--absorb the volume and hold the cost as flat as possible, and that's kind of the challenge and the mandate we've given to the organization. That's going to really translate into the OR improvement that we're projecting.  As I mentioned, you'll have some geography. Purchase services really started off strong. Probably going to see that pop a little bit, for the reasons I just cited a few minutes ago, but when we look at some of the other line items like rents and comp and ben, etc., our goal is really to just try to hold firm and absorb volume, so I think you're going to see good incrementals the rest of the year. That's kind of where we're targeting. I'm not going to get more precise than rounding to the hundreds of millions, but yes, that's our goal, is to sit there and try to hold cost while we absorb the volume. But of course, one of the variables, Amit, is fuel will go up throughout the balance of the year - we are projecting that, but we should have some--hopefully some lag on fuel. Surcharge should help mitigate some of that too. Yes, we didn't really quantify weather. I mean, certainly it did have an impact. We felt it in the form of higher overtime, certainly higher re-crews. We had some snow removal costs as well. We just didn't think it was material enough to break out. Look, overall fuel was a headwind in the quarter because we didn't really get the lag benefit of the fuel surcharge coming through here in the first quarter, so we had $34 million of headwind in fuel revenue. But we did have very good fuel efficiency performance that provided good tailwind for us on the expense side, and I think you saw the numbers on the slide for fuel. Thanks Brian. It's much more granular than SDI ever is. And Ken, let me answer your question on real estate. We had a pretty light quarter - we only had about $4 million of operating gains this year from the sale of real estate in the first quarter, and that was versus $11 million last Q1, so it was actually down $7 million year-over-year. Again, we'd tell you to guide--to bookmark around $30 million to $40 million over the course of the year, and we'd stick with that. There are years where we do have outsized specific items where when that happens, we'll call it out and let you know, but for the time being I'd bookmark $30 million to $40 million for the year, even though we're a little shy of that run rate here in the first quarter. Take care, all."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Nichols, you may begin.\nLuke Nichols: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full disclosure of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section along with our reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. Turning to Slide 3. It's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw.\nAlan Shaw : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Norfolk Southern's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Here with me today are Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer. I'm also pleased to welcome Paul Duncan, who moved into the role of Chief Operating Officer on January 1. At our Investor Day last month, we shared our strategy to create long-term shareholder value through a balanced approach of reliable and resilient service, continuous productivity improvement and smart and sustainable growth. At the heart of that strategy is a service product that allows us to compete in that $860 billion truck in logistics market and gives our customers the confidence to build Norfolk Southern into their supply chain. I was at the Midwest Association of Rail shippers winter meeting last week, talking with customers about our new strategy. and the reactions were extremely positive. Now our job is to prove it consistently. With performance, we made great strides to close the year and are encouraged by our progress. We will continue to refine and evolve to provide a service product to market values. Service is at the best it's been in more than 2 years, and customers are noticing. Volumes in December were at 52-week highs, outperforming typical seasonality as Ed and Paul's teams work collaboratively with our customers to attract business to Norfolk Southern, overcoming headwinds associated with a slower network in the first 3 quarters that constricted our capacity. Our team persevered adapted and achieved strong results in a challenging year. For both the fourth quarter and full year 2022, we were able to achieve double-digit growth in both revenue and EPS. We established new records for full year revenue, operating income, and other metrics that the team will detail later this morning. Also this quarter, we finalized national contracts with the unions representing our craft colleagues. These agreements recognize the hard work and dedication of our frontline railroaders with historic wage increases in an unparalleled health and welfare benefits package. With national bargaining now complete, we started discussions at the local level to address important quality of life issues. I would like to thank the entire Norfolk Southern team for their incredible effort during the fourth quarter and throughout all of 2022. I'm proud of the improvement our team has delivered and the momentum we have created. Our relentless focus on service continues in 2023. You'll hear more from Paul momentarily about how our across-the-board improvement is now allowing us to target specific opportunities for service and productivity enhancements. We recognize that the macroeconomic environment in which we operate is uncertain, and you'll hear more about the impact of that from Ed and Mark. Longer term, we are building on the momentum we carry into 2023. And of course, we've charted in our new strategy. As you heard at our Investor Day, we believe Norfolk Southern is uniquely positioned to deliver long-term shareholder value through top-tier revenue and earnings growth, industry competitive margins and balanced capital deployment. We will get there by being a customer-centric operations-driven service organization, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you. Now I'll turn it over to Paul for more detail on the improved service we are providing to our customers. Paul?\nPaul Duncan : Thank you, Alan, and good morning. I am excited to be leading the operating team as we implement the vision set forth this last quarter. My focus since assuming the role of Chief Operating Officer has been in 2 areas: collaborating with marketing and our customers to convert improved service into increased volume on the network; and getting out to talk with our field leaders about our new strategy to be a customer-centric operations-driven organization. The team has tremendous pride in Norfolk Southern and the feedback we are hearing is overwhelmingly positive. When we talk about growth, our people hear stability and opportunity. One 40-year Norfolk Southern veteran in Birmingham told me last week, he has never been more optimistic about the direction and culture of the company. I'll begin with a safety discussion on Slide 5. Our injury frequency rate improved 22%. Every conversation will begin with safety in 2023 and beyond. Operating safely is the the communities that we serve. This is an area where we have made great strides, but even one serious incident is too many. Thank you to those closest to the ballast line for the gains we achieved in safety in 2022 and and for the efforts we will all make safely delivering in 2023. Moving to Slide 6. Since we spoke last at our Investor Day, our service is the best it has been in more than 2 years. Our leadership, the implementation of our simpler, more executable operating plan top SPG and our continued resource adds have contributed to significant improvements in service for all of our customers. For premium intermodal, we safely delivered a perfect peak season for our largest parcel customer. Domestic intermodal performance has improved. Average container transit times have been reduced by 12 hours between Chicago and the Northeast, our largest corridor, with consistency also now meeting expectations. Merchandise performance is consistent, and this is another segment where our improved velocity is creating capacity. Both trains are cycling at historic best transit turn times, maximizing our asset utilization across commodities. You'll note that train speed has continued to climb from our low point last year with terminal dwell also creating capacity for growth. Our service product has turned the corner, and we are focused on building further reliability and resiliency into our network that our customers expect moving forward. Moving to our productivity update on Slide 7. We are committed to our balanced approach to service, productivity and growth. Let's start with locomotives. We have made solid progress on getting more productive use out of our fleet. You can see that here in terms of increasing our locomotive miles per day. At Investor Day, I referenced the flywheel effect that speeding up the network will produce. This is the start of that flywheel, which produced a 6% improvement last quarter and has improved 12% so far in January. Getting our locomotives moving more efficiently ensures we are creating capacity for growth. Next, we have grown our workforce, and that has been a critical element to our service improvement. Our GTMs were flat versus last year while our training pipeline has remained above steady state levels, pressuring workforce productivity. This is a good news story looking forward. as we are building the capacity we need to be reliable and resilient with the gains in service that we have made. We will build upon this foundation to drive greater workforce productivity as we bring volume back on the railroad. Lastly, we have set another quarterly record for fuel efficiency. Our increasing fluidity certainly has played a role alongside our portfolio of fuel efficiency initiatives including our fleet modernizations and idling compliance initiatives. Improving productivity is key to our balanced plan, and we are going to continue driving sustainable efficiency gains to provide value for our shareholders and our customers. On Slide 8, I will recap the industry-leading progress that we have made on hiring in 2022 and talk about what we see ahead. We entered the year in the very early stages of priming the conductor training pipeline and ramped up in record time, which was no easy task given the tightness in the labor market. We increased training wages, drove efficiencies into our onboarding process Jump started a grassroots campaign leveraging referral incentives and more. These efforts have paid off with much of our network reaching the minimum staffing levels determined by our data-driven approach. We are now focused on shoring up the remaining crew bases that are short, and we are determined to do so in 2023. As we make progress, we are deploying go teams more effectively and are executing the resiliency vision laid out at Investor Day by cross-qualifying crews and expanding training efforts. Moving to Slide 9. I will cover a few items that we are working on as we enter the new year. First, let's talk about the culture of continuous improvement we are building. We have greatly improved service and to bring our vision of long-term service resilience to reality. We know we have to keep getting better. Let me provide a few examples. With Intermodal, we are using the initial rollout and learnings from our high-frequency operating plan discussed at Investor Day, along with our perfect peak season to improve capacity and reliability across our intermodal franchise. On the merchandise side, we are applying continuous improvement principles identifying and implementing those next levers that will drive even greater resiliency and resource productivity to move cars faster and more consistently. We are building tools as part of our digital transformation to provide more actionable and timely information to a more empowered workforce. These are just a few examples of how we are driving continuous improvement into our DNA. Next, we are slated to modernize another 115 locomotives this year, converting them from DC to AC traction technology and giving them a full rejuvenation. These 115 rebuilds will reduce locomotive hauling capability equivalent to 150 DC locomotives, providing additional capacity for growth with fewer assets. Our DC to AC conversions will continue to provide even greater fuel efficiency and added pulling power to increase train productivity further. Our DC to AC conversion strategy will provide further opportunities to grow train size and increased train productivity, which we discussed at Investor Day. We have made marked progress on this long-term initiative. And just this month, we increased train size 53% in 1 of our 2 highest volume export cholines which will provide greater capacity and resiliency in our customer supply chain. Next up, let's talk about our capital investments. Our best-in-class engineering team safely delivered a productive year with more than 520 track miles of rail replaced, the most NS has done in 3 decades. We installed 10% more ties in 2022 than in 2021 with the same level of production teams and our servicing teams worked 27% more track than in 2021. We are committed to safely building and maintaining a reliable and resilient infrastructure for our customers productively. We're primed to execute on our capital plan in support of safety, resiliency, growth and productivity -- this will include a longer siding between Cincinnati and Fort Wayne, which will incorporate additional resilience into our train network. This is just one of the efforts we will highlight as the year progresses. Lastly, we are intensely focused on converting the capacity gains that we have made with top SPG and our disciplined execution of the plan into additional volume moving over the railroad in 2023. Our intermodal, merchandise and bulk service are all now consistently performing at high levels of service across our network. I will now hand it to Ed to expand on the market outlook and talk about how we can put this capacity to work. Thank you.\nEd Elkins: Thank you, Paul. It's great to have you with us, and good morning to everyone. Let's review our results for the fourth quarter, starting on Slide 11. Overall, revenue grew 13% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, with higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price improvements more than offsetting a 1% decline in volume. The pricing environment remains strong and we capitalize by delivering our 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year RPU less fuel growth in intermodal and our 30th out of 31 quarters in merchandise. Speaking of merchandise, Volumes recovered to prior year levels as service improved in the fourth quarter, enhancing our ability to drive value for our customers. Our largest gains were in the sand and proppants market to support the recent surge in demand for natural gas production followed by corn and soybeans also driven by exceptionally high demand. We saw declines in our steel and automotive markets where equipment availability was particularly challenged. As Paul highlighted earlier, we are making meaningful progress on improving car velocity in our merchandise fleets, and we started to see the results of that increased velocity toward the end of the quarter. Merchandise revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $1.9 billion and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, reached a record level from price gains and positive mix. Shifting to Intermodal. Total revenue improved 10% year-over-year as higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price gains more than offset a 4% decline in volume. The volume decline was concentrated within our domestic lines of business where headwinds from a loosening truck market and higher inventories heading into the holiday season negatively impacted demand. Conversely, our international lines of business grew in the fourth quarter. Our international intermodal volume rose 5% year-over-year as several of our customers shifted back to inland Point intermodal services amid lower ocean rates and easing supply chain congestion. Total intermodal revenue per unit and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, were up year-over-year on higher fuel revenue and price gains. If we turn to coal, our results for the quarter reflect both our success in capturing upside revenue potential from the market dynamics as well as our ability to create capacity for growth through improved service. Coal revenue for the quarter increased 28%, driven by price gains, volume growth, higher revenue from fuel surcharge and liquidated damages from prior volume shortfalls. Both revenue per unit and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, reached record levels, reflecting the value of our market-based pricing approach in these volatile energy markets. We were able to leverage increased equipment availability from improved cycle times to capture more utility coal business, which led to 9% volume gain in utility coal in the fourth quarter. Our export coal markets also grew due to higher demand driven by geopolitical conflict. Overall, coal volumes increased 8% in the quarter, and this volume growth was partially offset by year-over-year declines in coke shipments resulting from facility closures. Let's move to Slide 12 for the full year of 2022. Total revenue for the year reached $12.7 billion, a 14% increase from 2021 driven by higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price gains, partially offset by volume declines. We delivered record level total revenue and revenue less fuel, revenue per unit and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, despite 3% decline in total volume. Volume headwinds were strongest in our intermodal franchise, where a weakening truck market and supply chain congestion led to declines in annual volume. We saw growth in our coal business as a strong export market and a strong global market for energy increased volumes for coal on NS. Our performance as the year progressed into 2022 provides evidence that our recovering service product is providing momentum to the commercial side of our business. We're working together internally to enhance our offerings in the marketplace and to ensure that we are delivering the value our customers need to be successful. Lastly, if you will join me on Slide 13, our outlook for 2023 is cautiously optimistic amid uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and some signals of a slowdown in activity. Our improving service levels will drive opportunities for modal conversion from truck and increase our capacity to address unmet demand. At the same time, economic conditions could be a headwind to volume. At least in the near term, while lower fuel prices and accessorial revenues will temper our revenue per unit. Within merchandise, we anticipate that macroeconomic conditions will pressure a variety of the markets that we participate in. We're mindful of recent weakness in industrial production, particularly with respect to manufacturing, and that drives many of our markets. Current forecast for manufacturing in the U.S. shows contraction in 2023 as businesses rightsize inventories to demand. Additionally, the weak housing market will be a headwind to many of our industrial businesses and we expect this weakness to persist in 2023 as the housing market adjusts to higher interest rates. Volumes will also be supported by increased equipment availability and overall network fluidity. Looking at intermodal, volume growth will be dependent on the macroeconomic environment, although our improving service levels will create capacity for growth. Total revenue will be pressured by lower fuel surcharges and reduced storage revenue as supply chains continue to normalize throughout the year. Household balance sheets are supported by excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and credit remains available for many despite becoming more expensive. And so long as the U.S. consumer remains resilient, we would expect supportive demand for intermodal. Weakness in the truck market at the start of the year, along with housing will be a headwind but we anticipate the truck market to rebalance supply and demand later this year. Our international business will continue to benefit from lower ocean rates and improving supply chain fluidity at inland points, prompting a return of our customers to Inland Point Intermodal. Turning to coal. The current outlook for the utility and export coal markets supports a flat to modest year-over-year volume improvement. While overall utility demand is likely to remain flat, our capacity to handle more of that demand will increase with efficiency and productivity improvements on our network. For export, Norfolk Southern will benefit from additional coal supply coming online despite softening seaborne prices. We expect the global supply of met coal to continue to be restricted by geopolitical factors which should support demand for U.S.-sourced coal. We will experience tough coal pricing comps in the first half of the year, which will pressure export met ARPUs on a year-over-year basis. Overall, we are energized by our recent momentum heading into '23, and we are focused on leveraging that momentum to drive value for our customers and grow our business. Uncertainty and downside risks are certainly still present, but we're going to continue to focus on the things that we can control to successfully execute our strategic plan and results for our customers and for our shareholders. And lastly, I'd like once again to recognize our customers for their partnership throughout 2022 and thank them for their business. We appreciate all of their support as we move forward in 2023 with sustained momentum toward delivering the service product that they need to succeed. I will now turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results.\nMark George : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 15. As you heard from Ed, we had another quarter of strong revenue performance, up 13%. Operating expenses in the quarter were up $333 million or 19% year-on-year, driven primarily by elevated fuel prices and some significant adverse accrual adjustments that I will describe shortly which had an outsized impact on the operating ratio. Operating income at $1.18 billion set a fourth quarter record. EPS was $3.42, up double digits year-over-year. Moving to Slide 16. Let's reconcile the drivers of the changes in operating income, operating ratio and earnings per share. Talking specifically to operating income, the $52 million improvement was aided by the first row in the bottom section, a favorable wage accrual true-up related to our commitment to getting retroactive wages distributed to our employees before the end of the year. It was not only the right thing to do, but the acceleration created the added benefit of saving payroll taxes for employees as well as for the company. That adjustment provided a $16 million expense savings, which equates to 50 basis point tailwind to the OR and a nickel boost to EPS. But in the second row of the reconciliation at the bottom you will see that there was a $57 million expense headwind from numerous unexpected adverse items in the claims category that I'll put in 3 buckets. Accrual adjustments related to personal injury reserves based on actuarial studies, adjustments to environmental reserves based on activity and costs associated with derailments that occurred during the quarter. Combined, these adverse items versus a smaller positive adjustment last Q4 results in $57 million of year-over-year headwind in the fourth quarter, which equates to 180 basis points OR drag and $0.19 of EPS. Absent those 2 reconciling items I just detailed, core operating income growth was actually $93 million, and that translates to EPS growth of $0.44. The OR contraction at 180 basis points reflects lower incrementals driven by the net inflation impact as well as service-related costs. So let's drill into the operating expenses for the quarter now on Slide 17. Fuel was again a primary expense driver this quarter, up $141 million or 62% due to elevated fuel prices. Materials & Other was up $78 million, which included the $71 million increase in claims that was heavily impacted by the items we just discussed. Compensation and benefits were up $55 million or 9%, driven by elevated wages from the new labor contracts as well as higher employment levels. Purchased services were up $48 million or 10% in the quarter, driven primarily from continued inflationary pressures, costs related to our service environment as well as technology-related costs as we progress our digital transformation. Some of the inflation impacts are associated with intermodal operations that more than offset savings from lower intermodal volumes. Depreciation was up $11 million year-over-year, consistent with prior quarters. But let me point out that we are nearing completion of our periodic roadway depreciation study and the findings will result in a quarterly step-up in our 2023 depreciation expense. You can expect in 2023 that the quarterly year-over-year growth will be around double what you see here, meaning that the full year impact will be a step-up in the $40 million to $50 million range. Shifting to Slide 18. Let's look at the results below the line. After spending much of the year as a net expense, other income flipped back to a more normal profile and amounted to $34 million, an increase of $13 million over last year. Net income in the quarter was up $30 million or 4%. EPS growth at 10% exceeded the net income growth due to strong share repurchase activity. Turning now to Slide 19 and looking at the full year results. EPS was $13.88, an increase of $1.77 or 15% relative to 2021 and driven by record revenues of $12.7 billion, which was up 14% compared to 2021. As you look at the full year OpEx and operating ratio headwinds versus prior year, Recall the adverse impact of the wage settlement. Moving to Slide 20. Property additions at $1.9 billion ended the year exactly as we had been guiding. We had another strong year for shareholder distributions with over $4 billion returned again in 2022, with over 12.6 million shares repurchased. Dividend distributions were up 14%, and you will have read about our Board just approving a 9% or $0.11 increase to our quarterly dividend here in the first quarter. All this demonstrates our commitment to return capital to shareholders. And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Alan.\nAlan Shaw : Thanks, Mark. Let's turn to Slide 21. Our outlook for 2023 reflects the uncertainty of a challenging macro landscape in which the path of the demand environment and inflation are unclear. At this time, we see full year revenue level with 2022 performance. We expect to be able to absorb volume pressure with share recapture. Thanks to our improving service product. ARPU will be down to flat as we deal with pressure from softening coal pricing, lower fuel surcharge revenue and the eventual unwinding of accessorial revenues as supply chains unlock. ARPU will benefit from another strong year in core pricing gains. There are a lot of variables that are hard to predict in this uncertain environment. But in a flat revenue environment, it will be difficult to grow operating income in 2023. With the cost benefits from an improving service product being more than neutralized by inflation as well as the ARPU headwinds I just described. As you heard from Mark at Investor Day, we're expecting CapEx in to be roughly $2.1 billion for 2023. This is consistent with and supportive of the balanced and disciplined spending plan that Mark detailed in December. Despite the uncertainty, we entered 2023 with great confidence and momentum. When we look ahead, we see more than cyclical economic challenges in front of us. We see long-term macro trends that create opportunities for a franchise built for growth like Norfolk Southern. We have the right strategy, balancing service, productivity and growth. We have a strong and still improving service product. We have the right team of talented, dedicated railroads, and we are just getting started. We will now open the call to questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Great. Wanted to see if you could offer some more, I don't know, some more detail some additional perspective on the yields, revenue per car in intermodal and also in coal. I guess on intermodal, you sound pretty constructive, but -- just wondering if on domestic intermodal, you see some flow-through of potentially lower market pricing into what you get paid or whether you think your contracts protect you on that? And then I guess on coal, just a little more detail on the kind of how we ought to model things given some of the puts and takes.\nAlan Shaw : Tom, I'm going to turn it over to Ed and let him address your questions on our yield and RPU.\nEd Elkins: You listen to some of our customers on their earnings calls, and you've heard their outlook, it's no doubt of the loose truck market right now. I'm not going to get into any individual contracts. But we see some, what I would call, green shoots out there in terms of bottoming perhaps in the spot market, it's reached what we think is a sustained bottom for the last few weeks. We've also seen a decrease in the total number of motor carriers that are licensed in the U.S. We think that's a very positive development sustained for the last 3 months. and export of used trucks is continuing to increase. So as we go forward, I think that we reached a point of stability and the market is going to rebalance, we feel okay about RPU going into -- and our opportunities for RPU going into '23 in the market space for truck. On the coal side, fourth quarter, we had a liquidated damage claim, which beefed up that RPU in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, as you can see the forward curves just as well we do, we're going to have a tough comp and a tough road ahead, particularly in the second quarter, in terms of comparisons. But there's still support out there for export met coal in the market, and we're going to handle more utility coal than we did last year.\nTom Wadewitz: Can you ballpark the LD impact in 4Q? Just frame it a little bit for us.\nEd Elkins: I think without the LD, you would have seen a slight downward RPU sequentially.\nTom Wadewitz: Downward. Sequentially, okay. Great.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger: I think you mentioned on the call at the end that the macro backdrop, it might be tough from a full year perspective to grow EBIT dollars. I'm just sort of curious, as you think about your big picture outlook. Is there a differential first half, second half? Do you expect EBIT growth to be possible at some point as we move through the year?\nAlan Shaw : There are, as you noted, a lot of uncertainties out there and some cross cuts. There's some tailwinds for us, but also we've got a number of headwinds and Ed just articulated a couple of those rate pressures. I'm going to let Mark talk a little bit about the cadence of what we're seeing through the year on revenue and expense.\nMark George : Yes, really, it's going to depend a lot on the way the top line evolves. And if, in fact, there is a recession that we have to deal with, with some demand destruction. But as we think about -- we've got a lot of tailwinds in the year, including really strong core pricing that we anticipate as well as fuel efficiency. We had 3% fuel efficiency this year. We expect another good year next year. And I do expect that we'll have a wind down of some of the service-related costs now that our service product has improved. However, that would probably start to manifest more in the back half. And then, of course, we'll have the absence of some of the wage adjustment that we booked in the third quarter related to prior years. And this quarter, I would expect that big claims impact that we had in the fourth quarter was truly anomalous, and I wouldn't expect it to be of repeating nature at all. So those are some of the tailwinds as we look into the year. But we are swimming against some pretty heavy headwinds. As we talked about on the call, we do have meaningful inflation to absorb, including the wage increases. And we've got some level of diminishing coal RPU and accessorial revenues as we go through the year, again, mainly in the back half. And then the depreciation step-up that I mentioned, which will be more evenly spaced throughout the year. So -- but again, a lot of good tailwinds. We've got good core pricing and -- but the headwinds are kind of what I laid out. The biggest variable is really going to be volumes. So how much we get win.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.\nChris Wetherbee: Maybe I can pick up on that last comment. So in terms of the volume, I know you expect to be able to get some share recapture here. Do you think that ultimately yield a positive volume outcome for the year? And I guess, Mark have been helpful in terms of laying out the OR expectations, particularly a little bit more close in. So certainly, I would love to understand sort of your view on the potential for OR improvement or maybe holding the line in 2023. But if not, sort of first quarter, first half sort of how do we think about how things are trending out, just given some of the puts and takes you just outlined.\nEd Elkins: I'll take a swing at it. This is Ed. We finally have our service back to a place where we were able to take on additional volume. And we're seeing the benefits of that improved service right now. So yes, I think we're going to be able to claw back some volume effect as I'm certain of it. The question I think that we're all trying to answer is, can we claw back enough to overcome the demand instruction that's present or might be present in the market in '23. I know I don't have to, but just to give you a flavor for what we look at -- you start with inflation, you go to interest rates and what that is doing to many markets, including housing, which is very important for our business. We've seen manufacturing inflect in the past 3 months to a negative there's a lot of uncertainty. The way I would describe our position is we are guarded, but we are poised for opportunity. We have the right service right now. We're building the capacity as soon as the opportunity manifests itself, we're going to be able to deliver. And when I think about what are the positives, the tailwinds for us, service recovery starts right there, which leads to network fluidity and capacity improvement, there's some chance that there might be a soft landing. There's a lot of people that think there could be. The customer that we talk to our customers, they're poised for growth, and they want to grow. They're investing for growth. And we're going to look at all those factors, and we'll be ready.\nMark George : Yes. And Chris, we don't really want to get into quarterly guidance because there are a lot of variables. But I can just point you back to the tailwinds we talk of. Right now here in the first quarter, we're going to have probably a pretty good compare given where volumes were last year. So I think that's -- that will be -- that will probably represent one of our better year-over-year quarters, but we're really looking at a very uncertain outlook here in the second and third quarter. And we don't want to get into projecting right now at that level of granularity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Mark, just a couple -- just quick follow-ups for me. So one, the flat operating income translates to EPS growth this year. I suppose you can still eke out some earnings growth under that scenario given maybe some share repurchase and then the other income kind of coming back. If you could just talk about that? And then totally get the uncertainty and it's one of the most uncertain that I've ever seen. But I wanted to ask you about what you can control, which is the OpEx base ex the fuel. So you mentioned the depreciation step up, you have some visibility on labor per the PEB or the agreement. I also think you said in the past, there's like $40 million a quarter of inefficiencies that you endured last year. So I assume that some of that can unwind. So So I'm just trying to understand how do you think the OpEx base ex fuel moves relative to that $6.4 billion that you did in 2022. So EPS growth relative to EBIT growth and then OpEx base ex-fuel expectations for '23?\nMark George : Thanks, Amit. I think if you go back to our financial framework, we would expect that if we have kind of flattish earnings that EPS growth should exceed that and be positive, for sure. So that just fits right into the framework we talked about back in December at Investor Day. The $40 million ex -- sorry, the $40 million of service-related costs will start to unwind here. I mean, right now, we've got much improved service, although we are spending money to compensate for the fact that many of our locations are still below minimum staffing levels. So there is still a fair amount of overtime, recrews and incentives out there. But as the head count starts to increase in many of those core locations, I do expect toward the back half, especially that these costs will start to unwind from the $40 million per quarter significantly lower, like I said, more into the back half. And then we've got inflation in a lot of the other P&L line items, but we're working to mitigate a lot of those costs through more stringent control. I think equipment rents, as an example, that's one area where higher network speed, that should help us try to keep a lid on the growth on equipment rents. And even purchase services is an area where we've had a significant escalation due to the cost of service as well as inflation impacts. As inflation moderates, I do believe that, that will come under control as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Just want to go back to the comment on labor and the crew basis. I know you said you were targeting stopping those at a minimum level. Any way to quantify is it sort of less than 10% of those at this point that you need to go? And then I guess with respect to that, staffing levels at the bases that are fully staffed, are you starting to look at maybe building incremental staff there to potentially capture any inflection as we go forward given the growth opportunities?\nAlan Shaw : Yes. Allison, we had talked about in the fourth quarter a number that was about 1/4 of our crew base is below minimum staffing levels. It's roughly in that neighbourhood right now. And frankly, as we move forward, it's going to be highly dependent upon where we see markets headed in overall demand. So we are continuing to hire into our environment or into that environment. Pardon me, our conductor training pipeline remains very robust. And certainly, you've seen the improvements in our service product as we've addressed both resources leadership and plan, and our service is now the best it's been in over 2 years. Paul, why don't you talk a little bit more specificity on what we're doing with respect to our craft colleagues.\nPaul Duncan : Yes, absolutely, Alan. As you stated, we remain on pace to continue and hit our hiring targets. And as Ed alluded to, we're going to continue to match that towards the forecast as we go. As we've come out of the contract negotiations, now it's a matter of focusing on what the future looks like as far as conductive redeployment, predictive work schedules as well as quality of life and those discussions are taking place as we speak.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens Inc.\nJustin Long: I wanted to see if you could give any additional color on the potential impact from assessorial fees winding down this year. And Mark, maybe compare the timing of that wind down to the timing of the moderation in the service-related costs that you talked about? I'm just trying to figure out what the net impact from that could be over the balance of this year.\nEd Elkins: This is Ed. Thanks for the question. We look at this very carefully along with our customers and stakeholders. When we look globally, we see that the congestion at the ports that both coasts has really alleviated itself. And that's also true at most of our intermodal ramps on the inland side. But you look at good spending in the U.S., which has plateaued for the consumer, but it's plateaued at a level that essentially is where we should be in like 2025 or 2026. So there's still a tremendous number of goods being brought into the country, trying to fit through a pipeline that was designed for arguably 2023. And so that congestion still exists in some places, really around the warehousing on the Hinterland and Inland locations. We think it's going to unwind. In terms of the timing of that unwinding we're watching very carefully. We think it will happen in '23 at some point.\nMark George : Yes, Justin, probably more like the back half, and it won't be necessarily precipitous the way we're assuming. But I would say it's roughly on par with kind of the timing we're thinking about the relief on service-related costs as well.\nJustin Long: That's helpful. And any color on the net impact from a dollar perspective.\nMark George : No, no. Why don't you start getting out that far, the margin for OR is too big.\nAlan Shaw : I mean we'll lose asset [soil] revenue will gain in freight revenue because our customer supply chains will be more fluid, and we'll be able to move more business.\nMark George : That's right.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group : I just want to make sure I'm understanding the guidance right. So it sounds like flattish revenue, not growing operating income, but not really declining a lot. So sort of flattish revenue, flattish operating income, flattish OR, plus or minus a little bit, but no big growth or declines. Is that ultimately what you guys are trying to say at this point? I just want to make sure I understand that. And then just 1 just thing I just want to clarify, where do you think head count goes from the January levels you gave us in the slides?\nAlan Shaw : Scott, this is Alan. Thanks for the question. Yes. Flattish is in the ballpark for revenue. I think Mark talked a little bit about some of the cross currents that we have, both on the top line and on the expense category. Can you repeat your second question? We had a break up quite a little bit in the middle. Yes, associated with headcount.\nScott Group : Yes. Just where do we go from the January levels you have in the slides.\nAlan Shaw : Paul, why don't you talk about that?\nPaul Duncan : Yes. Scott, as of this morning, we're north of 7,500 T&E. And our target right now for May is to be in the 76-plus -- 7,600-plus range. And as stated earlier, we'll continue to adjust that target as we see the markets play out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: So I guess, Alan or Mark, I mean, we just had your Investor Day a month ago where you guys talked about resiliency, and I don't think anyone's faulting you here for a week macro. But is this the environment where you want to build in the resiliency into the network, maybe kind of piggybacking off that view on headcount. Is this where you add in capacity and really look to set up for growth potential in '24 and beyond?\nAlan Shaw : Yes. This is exactly what the environment we were contemplating. Here we are, we're continuing to hire. We're hiring aggressively. We need to because in some locations, as we talked about, were short of cruise. Resiliency is also about investing consistently in our assets, which includes our technology, it includes locomotives, track, intermodal terminals. It includes freight cars designed to help us compete with truck. And it includes -- yes, it includes our people as well. It also includes processes and a continuous improvement plan as we lift our service is the best it's been in over 2 years. But we're not stopping there. We're going to continue to evolve our product and we're going to continue to improve. And we're looking a couple of years out, how do we position ourselves so that our customers can compete and grow and we can compete and grow with them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shankar: Two-parter, if I may, please. You said that you expect share gains to offset some of the natural macro volume deterioration. Can you help us understand how much of that is \"in the bag\" with kind of new contract wins or kind of contracts have signed versus prospective as your service improves? And second question is, there has been some chatter on regulatory scrutiny on train length obviously, is a big part of top SPG and also for some of your peers. Can you talk about kind of how real that risk might be over time?\nEd Elkins: Thank you, Ravi. For volume, we are going to -- we are producing a service that's allowing us to take back share that should be on Norfolk Southern. And that includes from the highway. And that's where we're really focused. It's how can we add value for our customers so that their top selection is Norfolk Southern. And over the past couple of years, our customers have to make difficult decisions. and we are helping them come back to the place where we can add the most value for them. And we're confident sure there's going to be lots of macro headwinds, but we're seeing it now, we can earn back some of that freight even in a down environment.\nAlan Shaw : Yes. Ravi, let me talk about the regulatory environment, if you will, for just a second. What we -- we're fully engaged with the STB. We've met with 4 of the 5 members just since our Investor Day on December 6. And they're really encouraged. What we told them as we spoke with them last year is we were fully committed to restoring service. They've seen that. They see it in the metrics and they hear it from our customers as well. And now, they're seeing us start to grow a little bit. And so we're aligned with them, and we're delivering on our promises for service and our promises to help our customers compete and grow.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.\nWalter Spracklin: Just coming back on the trucking market, your long-term approach to gaining share against truck through higher service and just curious whether with the capacity, the slippery cap capacity and pricing environment that you're seeing right now and should that persist? Does that provide you with a significant challenge with regards to gaining market share given that price dynamic. And I know at least 2 of your competitors have started acquiring trucking companies, OR CN but H&R and TransX, and then Coaster Home, your TSX by quality. Is that something that you would envision doing as a way to offset some of that challenge by buying a trucking company and then converting it to rail? Is that something you'd consider? Just curious as to all that -- how that pertains to your [indiscernible] strategy?\nAlan Shaw : Walter, let me address the second question first, then I'll turn it over to Ed on how we compete with truck. Look, we got a franchise built for growth. And there are a lot of unique strengths about Norfolk Southern's franchise, the markets we serve and the customers with whom we are aligned. And so we are extremely confident and our ability to deliver organic growth. And we laid out that investment thesis in our Investor Day. And why don't you talk about how we're going to grow and compete with truck.\nEd Elkins: Sure. Well, first of all, we have a fantastic partnership with our key customers. And that includes our key customers in that trucking space. I say all the time, we are not competing against trucks. We're competing against the highway. Truckers are our customers. and that's a great place to be. Sure, the current environment is challenging, but we've been there before. We've seen these cycles play out time and time again. The market is rebalancing right now. And I think when you look out past '23, it's clear that rail intermodal, specifically on Norfolk Southern is going to be a very compelling place to be for customers. We talk all the time internally about the -- all the innovation that's going into reducing the carbon footprint for transportation But if you want to reduce your carbon footprint by about 70% to 90%, just put it on a train on Norfolk Southern. It's the easiest way to do it. So we think the value prop long term is compelling. And even in the short term, we think we are very well positioned to compete with our customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI.\nJon Chappell: Thank circling back to yield a little bit. I mean the identifiable headwinds of fuel and accessory unwinds are very clear. It sounds like you think the core can still offset a lot of that, which has been really Norfolk's bread and butter for the last several years. But in this loosening truckload market, weaker economic backdrop, are you finding that there's any areas where your pricing power it's coming under pressure a little bit due to customers' unwillingness especially in the loosening truckload market as we think to intermodal.\nEd Elkins: I think what makes me optimistic about our ability to continue to price in the same way that we have for years and years is the increasing value of the service that we're providing. Right now, we're producing a service that is very valuable to our customers we're supplying capacity that allows them to move that freight from the highway back to the railroad. And you know what, we're going to continue to develop and enhance that value just like just like Alan talked about. We're not stopping in terms of understanding what our customers need and what sort of service will provide value to them. We're really looking at the 3-, 5-, 7-year horizon on how we can deliver value for our customers, that's how we're going to continue to produce the results that we have so far, and we're confident in that.\nJon Chappell: So does that mean core is a little bit stickier than in intermodal since there's more little conversion potential there as opposed to maybe economically sensitive merchandise?\nEd Elkins: You're breaking up just a hair. Can you repeat that?\nJon Chappell: Yes, so does that mean that core is maybe a bit stickier in intermodal, given the potential for share gain as opposed to more economically sensitive merchandise?\nEd Elkins: I don't know. I think when I look across the markets that we serve, I think we've got potential to continue to produce -- leaving coal out of this for the time being because of the year-over-year headwind -- we've got a great track record. We're going to continue to do that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck: One for Mark. Can you just give us a little bit of color on the average comp per employee going forward. Obviously, this quarter, you got the accrual, the incentive comp tailwind. You probably got some mix of new hires still in there. So any color you can provide on the OpEx side when we look at that throughout the rest of 2023 would be helpful. And then for Paul, I know we're talking a lot about grounded conductors in the headlines, and this is a big thing that's starting in the industry. But maybe you can just level set the time line that you think this could progress to the extent you can offer one because it does seem like it's a new event, but we'll obviously, I think, at least take quite a bit of time for this to really get past pilot program and implementation to be more meaningful that we might see something live and in the field?\nMark George : I'll start with the comp and ben per employee. Brian, we ended pretty much where we had signaled we'd be on a per employee basis, excluding the adjustment there that deflated it a little bit. I would expect in '23, you'll see that number step up in Q1, like we talked about due to the payroll tax resets, and it will probably be in that 35 and change range. And while it would normally step up again in Q3 due to the wage accrual or the wage increases that take effect there in the third quarter. That will probably get offset to a large degree by the unwinding of some of these service-related costs. So I would expect kind of flat in that 35,000 and change territory throughout the year.\nPaul Duncan : Yes. And just adding to the second question on that. As we stated, national bargaining was complete here in December. We've already begun negotiations with our labor unions on conductor redeployment. From the fact of the time line we're in negotiations, but there's certainly a regulatory piece of this. But as we have the discussions and we think about the long-term future of where we want to be, there are benefits from a predictive work standpoint. There are certainly benefits from a work-life balance and quality of life standpoint that have been challenges in the industry for a number of years that we feel get addressed through some level of conductor redeployment. So we think there's a compelling reason certainly for the industry and the regulations to move forward in support of conductor redeployment. And certainly, back to what Ed was talking about. We have to continue to find through our balanced approach of service productivity and growth those next opportunities to drive greater value for our customers and bring that volume on our railroad. So we think that's all a part of our value proposition in the long term.\nBrian Ossenbeck: And do you think you could see a pilot program for one of those initiatives starting this year? Or is that a little too soon to expect?\nMark George : It's too soon to say at this point. we're ongoing negotiations. We want to have those discussions first and cross that bridge when it comes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities.\nCherilyn Radbourne: I was hoping you could speak to the kind of visibility that you have in automotive for 2023? And how far out you think that goes? And perhaps looking at a little further, you could also comment on any changes that you anticipate in that franchise as far as routing, et cetera, as the industry converts to electric vehicles?\nMark George : Sure. There's clearly a bow wave of unmet demand out there for automobiles in North America. And the industry is really focused on delivering and trying to work that off. We are, too. We've invested in new cars for that fleet, and our fluidity has improved significantly. We are continuing to refine that. That's going to offer us the opportunity to help our automotive customers meet some of that unmet demand. Going forward, I think it takes a while to work that off. I don't know that it ends this year. Turning to the question. I think your question was about EVs and future supply chains. We've seen a tremendous amount of investment in new capability for whether it's EVs, construction, whether it's battery construction, whether it's battery recycling, there's a tremendous amount of interest out there and some investment going forward that we are working to make sure that we can support.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ariel Rosa with Credit Suisse.\nAriel Rosa: So I wanted to ask about the state of labor relations as you see it. To what extent has it moved -- or has it improved since moving past the PEB? Obviously, negotiations had gone a little bit contentious, but wanted to hear your perspective on if that's improved since then? And then to what extent do you think you might have to make further concessions on benefits or sick leaves or anything around that sort of thing? And then given the benefits you're describing around kind of the flywheel effect and the service improvements that you're seeing, I'm wondering if volumes do come in a little bit weaker than expected for this year, given the aggressive hiring, what do you do with those excess employees? Or do you see yourself in an environment where maybe you have a little bit more head count than what's needed and what do you do with those employees?\nAlan Shaw : I'll address part of that and then turn it over to Paul. Now that we're done with national negotiations, we can turn to local negotiations in which we are collaborating with our craft colleagues to modernize our labor agreements to improve their quality of life, enhance operational flexibility and provide more predictable work schedules. That benefits us, that benefits our craft colleagues and benefits employee engagement. And we're seeing that as we get out into the field and talk to our employees about the future of Norfolk Southern, a balanced approach on service, productivity and growth. In respect to what would happen were we to enter into a downturn, that is factored into our thinking. And it certainly provides an opportunity for enhanced training and enhanced flexibility for our employees. Paul, do you want to talk a little bit about what you're seeing out in the field?\nPaul Duncan : Yes, Alan, I mean, you touched very well on the very first level the lever would certainly be investing in our workforce, cross qualification, extended training board consolidations, et cetera, where we have opportunities there. But we also have the lever of attrition. And we've seen what has taken place in the industry with furloughs, we just have not seen for those come back. It's very expensive in the long term, and we do not see that as certainly one, if any lever that we want to pull. We want to ensure, again, if there is a volume downturn, we are in a position as that volume comes back to handle it and handle it well. So that is how we are going to approach a downturn in potential volume.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.\nBascome Majors: If you look at the senior management incentives, they've recently been very much in the short term tied to OR and operating income with the long term tied to returns on capital with the TSR multiplier. At the Investor Day a few weeks ago, Andy Adam said that she was working with the Board to really redo the incentives both for senior management and for some other employees subject to the incentive program to really align with this new strategy that you guys laid out for us a few weeks back. Can you talk a little more about the changes that are being made and what you're doing at the compensation structure level to really encourage the behavior you're looking for in the long-term strategy?\nAlan Shaw : Bascome, thanks for the question. We are, as Andy noted, we're in discussions with our Board to make sure that our compensation plan is aligned with our strategic goals. We've always done that, right? And as we noted at Investor Day, our strategic goal is to deliver top-tier revenue and earnings growth through industry competitive margins and a balanced capital deployment.\nMark George : And I think you'll end up seeing in '23 that the structure has been amended a bit to reflect the alignment with our strategy.\nBascome Majors: Can you talk a little more specifically about those changes?\nMark George : Not right now, we can't. No. still in discussion with the [indiscernible].\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Kauffman : There were a lot of odd issues that occurred this year, and I think you hit some of them in terms of accessorials and in terms of liquidated damages. I'm kind of curious, with the big shift that we saw with West Coast to East Coast shipments from customers and now we're dealing with this inventory overhang. How do you think that affected our business in the Eastern U.S. Is it better for you if these containers dock in the west and get handed over in Chicago? And do your customers see a return to the West Coast at some point this year, maybe when labor situation settles? Is my understanding is it still tends to be a little cheaper to dock West than East. Just kind of curious how you thought that, that shift that's probably a little more transient impacted your business?\nEd Elkins: This is Ed. Thank you for the question. I love talking about the business. The shift from West Coast to East Coast has been ongoing for the better part of 20 years. And that evolution has occurred because of economics over time as manufacturing has shifted south and west from Japan to Korea to China and now towards Vietnam and Myanmar, et cetera. it makes those all-water sailings more attractive. When you look at the population center of the U.S., which is East of Mississippi. The expansion of the Panama Canal and now the use of Suez is also a compelling reason why those economics tend to work more. Our position is pretty simple. We want to be able to handle those shipments effectively, whether they come in through the West Coast, [indiscernible] quite a few to will or whether it comes through the East Coast. There's no doubt that there is a lot of inland infrastructure associated with transloading on the West Coast that makes that compelling. And we're perfectly positioned to help our customers deliver that volume to the population centers in the east. At the same time, we've invested a lot of money to make sure that we're a compelling partner for our ports and for our steamship lines as they come through the East Coast. We've invested a lot of money in some of our largest lanes are those shorter lengths of all that emanate from whether it's Savanna, Charles or Norfolk or from New York, et cetera, that allow us to add value to those shipments.\nJeff Kauffman : And just to follow up to that. What are your customers telling you in terms of their plans on inventory reduction where you may see more normalized shipment levels?\nEd Elkins: I think the outlook from our customers is that there's been a work down in inventory recently after that run-up. I think many of their customers are now getting their inventories in much better shape. And it really comes down to having the right product, not necessarily the right number of any given product, but the right type. And so we're encouraged by those recent work downs. And as we move into '23, again, guarded in terms of economic outlook, but poised for opportunity as soon as they manifest themselves.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: So one sort of detailed question and then I had a question for you, Ed, on sort of rail share. So just to start off, if you think about the starting off point for flattish EBIT guidance, can you just let us help us understand is that from a GAAP basis or adjusting for some of the accruals? And then as you think about the last couple of quarters, have noticed the carload traffic, particularly chemicals in ag, you guys have been outperforming CSX. And I'd love to get your perspective on how important sort of rail share is to you and the growth strategy going forward. CSX has historically had a little bit bigger carload footprint. I think that you guys have had as you've been investing a lot in intermodal over the last decade. How do you think about that sheer situation playing out, right? Are you guys outgrowing them because of some specific network advantages? Are you winning them in the marketplace? Any thoughts on that would be really helpful.\nMark George : Yes, real quick, David. I mean we're talking on a GAAP basis and -- go ahead, Ed.\nEd Elkins: Sure. Yes. The market that we really study is that $860 billion truck and logistics market. There's 5 trillion-ton miles moving in North America. And majority of those move adverse to railroads. We -- that's where I'm focused is how do we convert that business -- more of that business to Norfolk Southern. Railroads are, in some ways, defined by geography, but we are defined by our customer base, and that's what we're focused on.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our last question today comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKen Hoexter : Great. So just a follow up -- a couple of clarifications. On staffing, are you saying you're only 100 off your T&E target, and that's your goal there? And then I guess, the total employees, you ended with about 19,250, up about 1,200 from a year ago. Maybe give your thoughts on where that is a year from now. And then maybe -- I don't know, Mark, can you talk about what service level costs are still embedded in there, given the service gains versus inflation? I'm just trying to figure out where the opportunity is?\nAlan Shaw : Ken, for now, based on the economic outlook of 7,600 target that we had still exists. We're going to continue to hire in locations where we're tight And going forward, as you look here into 2024, obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty out there. we've talked about that. And so I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. I will tell you that right now, the conductor training pipeline is elevated, but it will remain so until we get to target and feel like we're recruiting, hiring and training at a steady state.\nMark George : And certainly, volume growth profile will mean that, that number is constantly moving. The target headcount number is constantly moving. And Specific to your question on where the service costs reside, Ken, I'd say roughly half of those sit in comp and ben between overtime, recrews, incentive expenses, as well as recruiting and training. That's really where, I'd say, half of it said. There's also a fair amount in purchased services. A lot of the disruption cost sits there. And there's also a little bit sitting in materials as well with regard to locomotives. So it's battered throughout the rest of the P&L, but half of it sits in component.\nKen Hoexter : And is there a total dollar amount that you're pointing to that you're looking to offset with the inflation?\nPaul Duncan : Well, what we indicated was it's roughly $40 million a quarter that we're dealing with. And I would expect that, that number to come back down closer to, but not all the way to 0, by the time you get to the end of the year. So that's it.\nKen Hoexter : Great. And then just a follow-up for me, if I can. Paul, you noted 202 locomotive miles per day. Can you talk about targets there, given the service improvements where you think we end the year with?\nPaul Duncan : We are just now beginning to get the service back to where we wanted it to be here within the past several weeks and if not the past couple of months. So we described at Investor Day the flywheel effect that is going to take place, fully expect as we continue to resource up to the group piece that we spoke to and the service gains that we have made that we're going to continue to see that improve throughout the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Alan Shaw for any final comments.\nAlan Shaw : I'd like to thank everyone for their interest in Norfolk Southern and for joining us today. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Alan Shaw",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Norfolk Southern's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Here with me today are Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer. I'm also pleased to welcome Paul Duncan, who moved into the role of Chief Operating Officer on January 1. At our Investor Day last month, we shared our strategy to create long-term shareholder value through a balanced approach of reliable and resilient service, continuous productivity improvement and smart and sustainable growth. At the heart of that strategy is a service product that allows us to compete in that $860 billion truck in logistics market and gives our customers the confidence to build Norfolk Southern into their supply chain. I was at the Midwest Association of Rail shippers winter meeting last week, talking with customers about our new strategy. and the reactions were extremely positive. Now our job is to prove it consistently. With performance, we made great strides to close the year and are encouraged by our progress. We will continue to refine and evolve to provide a service product to market values. Service is at the best it's been in more than 2 years, and customers are noticing. Volumes in December were at 52-week highs, outperforming typical seasonality as Ed and Paul's teams work collaboratively with our customers to attract business to Norfolk Southern, overcoming headwinds associated with a slower network in the first 3 quarters that constricted our capacity. Our team persevered adapted and achieved strong results in a challenging year. For both the fourth quarter and full year 2022, we were able to achieve double-digit growth in both revenue and EPS. We established new records for full year revenue, operating income, and other metrics that the team will detail later this morning. Also this quarter, we finalized national contracts with the unions representing our craft colleagues. These agreements recognize the hard work and dedication of our frontline railroaders with historic wage increases in an unparalleled health and welfare benefits package. With national bargaining now complete, we started discussions at the local level to address important quality of life issues. I would like to thank the entire Norfolk Southern team for their incredible effort during the fourth quarter and throughout all of 2022. I'm proud of the improvement our team has delivered and the momentum we have created. Our relentless focus on service continues in 2023. You'll hear more from Paul momentarily about how our across-the-board improvement is now allowing us to target specific opportunities for service and productivity enhancements. We recognize that the macroeconomic environment in which we operate is uncertain, and you'll hear more about the impact of that from Ed and Mark. Longer term, we are building on the momentum we carry into 2023. And of course, we've charted in our new strategy. As you heard at our Investor Day, we believe Norfolk Southern is uniquely positioned to deliver long-term shareholder value through top-tier revenue and earnings growth, industry competitive margins and balanced capital deployment. We will get there by being a customer-centric operations-driven service organization, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you. Now I'll turn it over to Paul for more detail on the improved service we are providing to our customers. Paul? Thanks, Mark. Let's turn to Slide 21. Our outlook for 2023 reflects the uncertainty of a challenging macro landscape in which the path of the demand environment and inflation are unclear. At this time, we see full year revenue level with 2022 performance. We expect to be able to absorb volume pressure with share recapture. Thanks to our improving service product. ARPU will be down to flat as we deal with pressure from softening coal pricing, lower fuel surcharge revenue and the eventual unwinding of accessorial revenues as supply chains unlock. ARPU will benefit from another strong year in core pricing gains. There are a lot of variables that are hard to predict in this uncertain environment. But in a flat revenue environment, it will be difficult to grow operating income in 2023. With the cost benefits from an improving service product being more than neutralized by inflation as well as the ARPU headwinds I just described. As you heard from Mark at Investor Day, we're expecting CapEx in to be roughly $2.1 billion for 2023. This is consistent with and supportive of the balanced and disciplined spending plan that Mark detailed in December. Despite the uncertainty, we entered 2023 with great confidence and momentum. When we look ahead, we see more than cyclical economic challenges in front of us. We see long-term macro trends that create opportunities for a franchise built for growth like Norfolk Southern. We have the right strategy, balancing service, productivity and growth. We have a strong and still improving service product. We have the right team of talented, dedicated railroads, and we are just getting started. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Tom, I'm going to turn it over to Ed and let him address your questions on our yield and RPU. There are, as you noted, a lot of uncertainties out there and some cross cuts. There's some tailwinds for us, but also we've got a number of headwinds and Ed just articulated a couple of those rate pressures. I'm going to let Mark talk a little bit about the cadence of what we're seeing through the year on revenue and expense. Yes. Allison, we had talked about in the fourth quarter a number that was about 1/4 of our crew base is below minimum staffing levels. It's roughly in that neighbourhood right now. And frankly, as we move forward, it's going to be highly dependent upon where we see markets headed in overall demand. So we are continuing to hire into our environment or into that environment. Pardon me, our conductor training pipeline remains very robust. And certainly, you've seen the improvements in our service product as we've addressed both resources leadership and plan, and our service is now the best it's been in over 2 years. Paul, why don't you talk a little bit more specificity on what we're doing with respect to our craft colleagues. I mean we'll lose asset [soil] revenue will gain in freight revenue because our customer supply chains will be more fluid, and we'll be able to move more business. Scott, this is Alan. Thanks for the question. Yes. Flattish is in the ballpark for revenue. I think Mark talked a little bit about some of the cross currents that we have, both on the top line and on the expense category. Can you repeat your second question? We had a break up quite a little bit in the middle. Yes, associated with headcount. Paul, why don't you talk about that? Yes. This is exactly what the environment we were contemplating. Here we are, we're continuing to hire. We're hiring aggressively. We need to because in some locations, as we talked about, were short of cruise. Resiliency is also about investing consistently in our assets, which includes our technology, it includes locomotives, track, intermodal terminals. It includes freight cars designed to help us compete with truck. And it includes -- yes, it includes our people as well. It also includes processes and a continuous improvement plan as we lift our service is the best it's been in over 2 years. But we're not stopping there. We're going to continue to evolve our product and we're going to continue to improve. And we're looking a couple of years out, how do we position ourselves so that our customers can compete and grow and we can compete and grow with them. Yes. Ravi, let me talk about the regulatory environment, if you will, for just a second. What we -- we're fully engaged with the STB. We've met with 4 of the 5 members just since our Investor Day on December 6. And they're really encouraged. What we told them as we spoke with them last year is we were fully committed to restoring service. They've seen that. They see it in the metrics and they hear it from our customers as well. And now, they're seeing us start to grow a little bit. And so we're aligned with them, and we're delivering on our promises for service and our promises to help our customers compete and grow. Walter, let me address the second question first, then I'll turn it over to Ed on how we compete with truck. Look, we got a franchise built for growth. And there are a lot of unique strengths about Norfolk Southern's franchise, the markets we serve and the customers with whom we are aligned. And so we are extremely confident and our ability to deliver organic growth. And we laid out that investment thesis in our Investor Day. And why don't you talk about how we're going to grow and compete with truck. I'll address part of that and then turn it over to Paul. Now that we're done with national negotiations, we can turn to local negotiations in which we are collaborating with our craft colleagues to modernize our labor agreements to improve their quality of life, enhance operational flexibility and provide more predictable work schedules. That benefits us, that benefits our craft colleagues and benefits employee engagement. And we're seeing that as we get out into the field and talk to our employees about the future of Norfolk Southern, a balanced approach on service, productivity and growth. In respect to what would happen were we to enter into a downturn, that is factored into our thinking. And it certainly provides an opportunity for enhanced training and enhanced flexibility for our employees. Paul, do you want to talk a little bit about what you're seeing out in the field? Bascome, thanks for the question. We are, as Andy noted, we're in discussions with our Board to make sure that our compensation plan is aligned with our strategic goals. We've always done that, right? And as we noted at Investor Day, our strategic goal is to deliver top-tier revenue and earnings growth through industry competitive margins and a balanced capital deployment. Ken, for now, based on the economic outlook of 7,600 target that we had still exists. We're going to continue to hire in locations where we're tight And going forward, as you look here into 2024, obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty out there. we've talked about that. And so I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. I will tell you that right now, the conductor training pipeline is elevated, but it will remain so until we get to target and feel like we're recruiting, hiring and training at a steady state. I'd like to thank everyone for their interest in Norfolk Southern and for joining us today. Thanks."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Mark George",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 15. As you heard from Ed, we had another quarter of strong revenue performance, up 13%. Operating expenses in the quarter were up $333 million or 19% year-on-year, driven primarily by elevated fuel prices and some significant adverse accrual adjustments that I will describe shortly which had an outsized impact on the operating ratio. Operating income at $1.18 billion set a fourth quarter record. EPS was $3.42, up double digits year-over-year. Moving to Slide 16. Let's reconcile the drivers of the changes in operating income, operating ratio and earnings per share. Talking specifically to operating income, the $52 million improvement was aided by the first row in the bottom section, a favorable wage accrual true-up related to our commitment to getting retroactive wages distributed to our employees before the end of the year. It was not only the right thing to do, but the acceleration created the added benefit of saving payroll taxes for employees as well as for the company. That adjustment provided a $16 million expense savings, which equates to 50 basis point tailwind to the OR and a nickel boost to EPS. But in the second row of the reconciliation at the bottom you will see that there was a $57 million expense headwind from numerous unexpected adverse items in the claims category that I'll put in 3 buckets. Accrual adjustments related to personal injury reserves based on actuarial studies, adjustments to environmental reserves based on activity and costs associated with derailments that occurred during the quarter. Combined, these adverse items versus a smaller positive adjustment last Q4 results in $57 million of year-over-year headwind in the fourth quarter, which equates to 180 basis points OR drag and $0.19 of EPS. Absent those 2 reconciling items I just detailed, core operating income growth was actually $93 million, and that translates to EPS growth of $0.44. The OR contraction at 180 basis points reflects lower incrementals driven by the net inflation impact as well as service-related costs. So let's drill into the operating expenses for the quarter now on Slide 17. Fuel was again a primary expense driver this quarter, up $141 million or 62% due to elevated fuel prices. Materials & Other was up $78 million, which included the $71 million increase in claims that was heavily impacted by the items we just discussed. Compensation and benefits were up $55 million or 9%, driven by elevated wages from the new labor contracts as well as higher employment levels. Purchased services were up $48 million or 10% in the quarter, driven primarily from continued inflationary pressures, costs related to our service environment as well as technology-related costs as we progress our digital transformation. Some of the inflation impacts are associated with intermodal operations that more than offset savings from lower intermodal volumes. Depreciation was up $11 million year-over-year, consistent with prior quarters. But let me point out that we are nearing completion of our periodic roadway depreciation study and the findings will result in a quarterly step-up in our 2023 depreciation expense. You can expect in 2023 that the quarterly year-over-year growth will be around double what you see here, meaning that the full year impact will be a step-up in the $40 million to $50 million range. Shifting to Slide 18. Let's look at the results below the line. After spending much of the year as a net expense, other income flipped back to a more normal profile and amounted to $34 million, an increase of $13 million over last year. Net income in the quarter was up $30 million or 4%. EPS growth at 10% exceeded the net income growth due to strong share repurchase activity. Turning now to Slide 19 and looking at the full year results. EPS was $13.88, an increase of $1.77 or 15% relative to 2021 and driven by record revenues of $12.7 billion, which was up 14% compared to 2021. As you look at the full year OpEx and operating ratio headwinds versus prior year, Recall the adverse impact of the wage settlement. Moving to Slide 20. Property additions at $1.9 billion ended the year exactly as we had been guiding. We had another strong year for shareholder distributions with over $4 billion returned again in 2022, with over 12.6 million shares repurchased. Dividend distributions were up 14%, and you will have read about our Board just approving a 9% or $0.11 increase to our quarterly dividend here in the first quarter. All this demonstrates our commitment to return capital to shareholders. And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Alan. Yes, really, it's going to depend a lot on the way the top line evolves. And if, in fact, there is a recession that we have to deal with, with some demand destruction. But as we think about -- we've got a lot of tailwinds in the year, including really strong core pricing that we anticipate as well as fuel efficiency. We had 3% fuel efficiency this year. We expect another good year next year. And I do expect that we'll have a wind down of some of the service-related costs now that our service product has improved. However, that would probably start to manifest more in the back half. And then, of course, we'll have the absence of some of the wage adjustment that we booked in the third quarter related to prior years. And this quarter, I would expect that big claims impact that we had in the fourth quarter was truly anomalous, and I wouldn't expect it to be of repeating nature at all. So those are some of the tailwinds as we look into the year. But we are swimming against some pretty heavy headwinds. As we talked about on the call, we do have meaningful inflation to absorb, including the wage increases. And we've got some level of diminishing coal RPU and accessorial revenues as we go through the year, again, mainly in the back half. And then the depreciation step-up that I mentioned, which will be more evenly spaced throughout the year. So -- but again, a lot of good tailwinds. We've got good core pricing and -- but the headwinds are kind of what I laid out. The biggest variable is really going to be volumes. So how much we get win. Yes. And Chris, we don't really want to get into quarterly guidance because there are a lot of variables. But I can just point you back to the tailwinds we talk of. Right now here in the first quarter, we're going to have probably a pretty good compare given where volumes were last year. So I think that's -- that will be -- that will probably represent one of our better year-over-year quarters, but we're really looking at a very uncertain outlook here in the second and third quarter. And we don't want to get into projecting right now at that level of granularity. Thanks, Amit. I think if you go back to our financial framework, we would expect that if we have kind of flattish earnings that EPS growth should exceed that and be positive, for sure. So that just fits right into the framework we talked about back in December at Investor Day. The $40 million ex -- sorry, the $40 million of service-related costs will start to unwind here. I mean, right now, we've got much improved service, although we are spending money to compensate for the fact that many of our locations are still below minimum staffing levels. So there is still a fair amount of overtime, recrews and incentives out there. But as the head count starts to increase in many of those core locations, I do expect toward the back half, especially that these costs will start to unwind from the $40 million per quarter significantly lower, like I said, more into the back half. And then we've got inflation in a lot of the other P&L line items, but we're working to mitigate a lot of those costs through more stringent control. I think equipment rents, as an example, that's one area where higher network speed, that should help us try to keep a lid on the growth on equipment rents. And even purchase services is an area where we've had a significant escalation due to the cost of service as well as inflation impacts. As inflation moderates, I do believe that, that will come under control as well. Yes, Justin, probably more like the back half, and it won't be necessarily precipitous the way we're assuming. But I would say it's roughly on par with kind of the timing we're thinking about the relief on service-related costs as well. No, no. Why don't you start getting out that far, the margin for OR is too big. That's right. I'll start with the comp and ben per employee. Brian, we ended pretty much where we had signaled we'd be on a per employee basis, excluding the adjustment there that deflated it a little bit. I would expect in '23, you'll see that number step up in Q1, like we talked about due to the payroll tax resets, and it will probably be in that 35 and change range. And while it would normally step up again in Q3 due to the wage accrual or the wage increases that take effect there in the third quarter. That will probably get offset to a large degree by the unwinding of some of these service-related costs. So I would expect kind of flat in that 35,000 and change territory throughout the year. It's too soon to say at this point. we're ongoing negotiations. We want to have those discussions first and cross that bridge when it comes. Sure. There's clearly a bow wave of unmet demand out there for automobiles in North America. And the industry is really focused on delivering and trying to work that off. We are, too. We've invested in new cars for that fleet, and our fluidity has improved significantly. We are continuing to refine that. That's going to offer us the opportunity to help our automotive customers meet some of that unmet demand. Going forward, I think it takes a while to work that off. I don't know that it ends this year. Turning to the question. I think your question was about EVs and future supply chains. We've seen a tremendous amount of investment in new capability for whether it's EVs, construction, whether it's battery construction, whether it's battery recycling, there's a tremendous amount of interest out there and some investment going forward that we are working to make sure that we can support. And I think you'll end up seeing in '23 that the structure has been amended a bit to reflect the alignment with our strategy. Not right now, we can't. No. still in discussion with the [indiscernible]. Yes, real quick, David. I mean we're talking on a GAAP basis and -- go ahead, Ed. And certainly, volume growth profile will mean that, that number is constantly moving. The target headcount number is constantly moving. And Specific to your question on where the service costs reside, Ken, I'd say roughly half of those sit in comp and ben between overtime, recrews, incentive expenses, as well as recruiting and training. That's really where, I'd say, half of it said. There's also a fair amount in purchased services. A lot of the disruption cost sits there. And there's also a little bit sitting in materials as well with regard to locomotives. So it's battered throughout the rest of the P&L, but half of it sits in component."

            "name": "Ed Elkins",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. It's great to have you with us, and good morning to everyone. Let's review our results for the fourth quarter, starting on Slide 11. Overall, revenue grew 13% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, with higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price improvements more than offsetting a 1% decline in volume. The pricing environment remains strong and we capitalize by delivering our 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year RPU less fuel growth in intermodal and our 30th out of 31 quarters in merchandise. Speaking of merchandise, Volumes recovered to prior year levels as service improved in the fourth quarter, enhancing our ability to drive value for our customers. Our largest gains were in the sand and proppants market to support the recent surge in demand for natural gas production followed by corn and soybeans also driven by exceptionally high demand. We saw declines in our steel and automotive markets where equipment availability was particularly challenged. As Paul highlighted earlier, we are making meaningful progress on improving car velocity in our merchandise fleets, and we started to see the results of that increased velocity toward the end of the quarter. Merchandise revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $1.9 billion and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, reached a record level from price gains and positive mix. Shifting to Intermodal. Total revenue improved 10% year-over-year as higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price gains more than offset a 4% decline in volume. The volume decline was concentrated within our domestic lines of business where headwinds from a loosening truck market and higher inventories heading into the holiday season negatively impacted demand. Conversely, our international lines of business grew in the fourth quarter. Our international intermodal volume rose 5% year-over-year as several of our customers shifted back to inland Point intermodal services amid lower ocean rates and easing supply chain congestion. Total intermodal revenue per unit and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, were up year-over-year on higher fuel revenue and price gains. If we turn to coal, our results for the quarter reflect both our success in capturing upside revenue potential from the market dynamics as well as our ability to create capacity for growth through improved service. Coal revenue for the quarter increased 28%, driven by price gains, volume growth, higher revenue from fuel surcharge and liquidated damages from prior volume shortfalls. Both revenue per unit and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, reached record levels, reflecting the value of our market-based pricing approach in these volatile energy markets. We were able to leverage increased equipment availability from improved cycle times to capture more utility coal business, which led to 9% volume gain in utility coal in the fourth quarter. Our export coal markets also grew due to higher demand driven by geopolitical conflict. Overall, coal volumes increased 8% in the quarter, and this volume growth was partially offset by year-over-year declines in coke shipments resulting from facility closures. Let's move to Slide 12 for the full year of 2022. Total revenue for the year reached $12.7 billion, a 14% increase from 2021 driven by higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price gains, partially offset by volume declines. We delivered record level total revenue and revenue less fuel, revenue per unit and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, despite 3% decline in total volume. Volume headwinds were strongest in our intermodal franchise, where a weakening truck market and supply chain congestion led to declines in annual volume. We saw growth in our coal business as a strong export market and a strong global market for energy increased volumes for coal on NS. Our performance as the year progressed into 2022 provides evidence that our recovering service product is providing momentum to the commercial side of our business. We're working together internally to enhance our offerings in the marketplace and to ensure that we are delivering the value our customers need to be successful. Lastly, if you will join me on Slide 13, our outlook for 2023 is cautiously optimistic amid uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and some signals of a slowdown in activity. Our improving service levels will drive opportunities for modal conversion from truck and increase our capacity to address unmet demand. At the same time, economic conditions could be a headwind to volume. At least in the near term, while lower fuel prices and accessorial revenues will temper our revenue per unit. Within merchandise, we anticipate that macroeconomic conditions will pressure a variety of the markets that we participate in. We're mindful of recent weakness in industrial production, particularly with respect to manufacturing, and that drives many of our markets. Current forecast for manufacturing in the U.S. shows contraction in 2023 as businesses rightsize inventories to demand. Additionally, the weak housing market will be a headwind to many of our industrial businesses and we expect this weakness to persist in 2023 as the housing market adjusts to higher interest rates. Volumes will also be supported by increased equipment availability and overall network fluidity. Looking at intermodal, volume growth will be dependent on the macroeconomic environment, although our improving service levels will create capacity for growth. Total revenue will be pressured by lower fuel surcharges and reduced storage revenue as supply chains continue to normalize throughout the year. Household balance sheets are supported by excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and credit remains available for many despite becoming more expensive. And so long as the U.S. consumer remains resilient, we would expect supportive demand for intermodal. Weakness in the truck market at the start of the year, along with housing will be a headwind but we anticipate the truck market to rebalance supply and demand later this year. Our international business will continue to benefit from lower ocean rates and improving supply chain fluidity at inland points, prompting a return of our customers to Inland Point Intermodal. Turning to coal. The current outlook for the utility and export coal markets supports a flat to modest year-over-year volume improvement. While overall utility demand is likely to remain flat, our capacity to handle more of that demand will increase with efficiency and productivity improvements on our network. For export, Norfolk Southern will benefit from additional coal supply coming online despite softening seaborne prices. We expect the global supply of met coal to continue to be restricted by geopolitical factors which should support demand for U.S.-sourced coal. We will experience tough coal pricing comps in the first half of the year, which will pressure export met ARPUs on a year-over-year basis. Overall, we are energized by our recent momentum heading into '23, and we are focused on leveraging that momentum to drive value for our customers and grow our business. Uncertainty and downside risks are certainly still present, but we're going to continue to focus on the things that we can control to successfully execute our strategic plan and results for our customers and for our shareholders. And lastly, I'd like once again to recognize our customers for their partnership throughout 2022 and thank them for their business. We appreciate all of their support as we move forward in 2023 with sustained momentum toward delivering the service product that they need to succeed. I will now turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results. You listen to some of our customers on their earnings calls, and you've heard their outlook, it's no doubt of the loose truck market right now. I'm not going to get into any individual contracts. But we see some, what I would call, green shoots out there in terms of bottoming perhaps in the spot market, it's reached what we think is a sustained bottom for the last few weeks. We've also seen a decrease in the total number of motor carriers that are licensed in the U.S. We think that's a very positive development sustained for the last 3 months. and export of used trucks is continuing to increase. So as we go forward, I think that we reached a point of stability and the market is going to rebalance, we feel okay about RPU going into -- and our opportunities for RPU going into '23 in the market space for truck. On the coal side, fourth quarter, we had a liquidated damage claim, which beefed up that RPU in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, as you can see the forward curves just as well we do, we're going to have a tough comp and a tough road ahead, particularly in the second quarter, in terms of comparisons. But there's still support out there for export met coal in the market, and we're going to handle more utility coal than we did last year. I think without the LD, you would have seen a slight downward RPU sequentially. I'll take a swing at it. This is Ed. We finally have our service back to a place where we were able to take on additional volume. And we're seeing the benefits of that improved service right now. So yes, I think we're going to be able to claw back some volume effect as I'm certain of it. The question I think that we're all trying to answer is, can we claw back enough to overcome the demand instruction that's present or might be present in the market in '23. I know I don't have to, but just to give you a flavor for what we look at -- you start with inflation, you go to interest rates and what that is doing to many markets, including housing, which is very important for our business. We've seen manufacturing inflect in the past 3 months to a negative there's a lot of uncertainty. The way I would describe our position is we are guarded, but we are poised for opportunity. We have the right service right now. We're building the capacity as soon as the opportunity manifests itself, we're going to be able to deliver. And when I think about what are the positives, the tailwinds for us, service recovery starts right there, which leads to network fluidity and capacity improvement, there's some chance that there might be a soft landing. There's a lot of people that think there could be. The customer that we talk to our customers, they're poised for growth, and they want to grow. They're investing for growth. And we're going to look at all those factors, and we'll be ready. This is Ed. Thanks for the question. We look at this very carefully along with our customers and stakeholders. When we look globally, we see that the congestion at the ports that both coasts has really alleviated itself. And that's also true at most of our intermodal ramps on the inland side. But you look at good spending in the U.S., which has plateaued for the consumer, but it's plateaued at a level that essentially is where we should be in like 2025 or 2026. So there's still a tremendous number of goods being brought into the country, trying to fit through a pipeline that was designed for arguably 2023. And so that congestion still exists in some places, really around the warehousing on the Hinterland and Inland locations. We think it's going to unwind. In terms of the timing of that unwinding we're watching very carefully. We think it will happen in '23 at some point. Thank you, Ravi. For volume, we are going to -- we are producing a service that's allowing us to take back share that should be on Norfolk Southern. And that includes from the highway. And that's where we're really focused. It's how can we add value for our customers so that their top selection is Norfolk Southern. And over the past couple of years, our customers have to make difficult decisions. and we are helping them come back to the place where we can add the most value for them. And we're confident sure there's going to be lots of macro headwinds, but we're seeing it now, we can earn back some of that freight even in a down environment. Sure. Well, first of all, we have a fantastic partnership with our key customers. And that includes our key customers in that trucking space. I say all the time, we are not competing against trucks. We're competing against the highway. Truckers are our customers. and that's a great place to be. Sure, the current environment is challenging, but we've been there before. We've seen these cycles play out time and time again. The market is rebalancing right now. And I think when you look out past '23, it's clear that rail intermodal, specifically on Norfolk Southern is going to be a very compelling place to be for customers. We talk all the time internally about the -- all the innovation that's going into reducing the carbon footprint for transportation But if you want to reduce your carbon footprint by about 70% to 90%, just put it on a train on Norfolk Southern. It's the easiest way to do it. So we think the value prop long term is compelling. And even in the short term, we think we are very well positioned to compete with our customers. I think what makes me optimistic about our ability to continue to price in the same way that we have for years and years is the increasing value of the service that we're providing. Right now, we're producing a service that is very valuable to our customers we're supplying capacity that allows them to move that freight from the highway back to the railroad. And you know what, we're going to continue to develop and enhance that value just like just like Alan talked about. We're not stopping in terms of understanding what our customers need and what sort of service will provide value to them. We're really looking at the 3-, 5-, 7-year horizon on how we can deliver value for our customers, that's how we're going to continue to produce the results that we have so far, and we're confident in that. You're breaking up just a hair. Can you repeat that? I don't know. I think when I look across the markets that we serve, I think we've got potential to continue to produce -- leaving coal out of this for the time being because of the year-over-year headwind -- we've got a great track record. We're going to continue to do that. This is Ed. Thank you for the question. I love talking about the business. The shift from West Coast to East Coast has been ongoing for the better part of 20 years. And that evolution has occurred because of economics over time as manufacturing has shifted south and west from Japan to Korea to China and now towards Vietnam and Myanmar, et cetera. it makes those all-water sailings more attractive. When you look at the population center of the U.S., which is East of Mississippi. The expansion of the Panama Canal and now the use of Suez is also a compelling reason why those economics tend to work more. Our position is pretty simple. We want to be able to handle those shipments effectively, whether they come in through the West Coast, [indiscernible] quite a few to will or whether it comes through the East Coast. There's no doubt that there is a lot of inland infrastructure associated with transloading on the West Coast that makes that compelling. And we're perfectly positioned to help our customers deliver that volume to the population centers in the east. At the same time, we've invested a lot of money to make sure that we're a compelling partner for our ports and for our steamship lines as they come through the East Coast. We've invested a lot of money in some of our largest lanes are those shorter lengths of all that emanate from whether it's Savanna, Charles or Norfolk or from New York, et cetera, that allow us to add value to those shipments. I think the outlook from our customers is that there's been a work down in inventory recently after that run-up. I think many of their customers are now getting their inventories in much better shape. And it really comes down to having the right product, not necessarily the right number of any given product, but the right type. And so we're encouraged by those recent work downs. And as we move into '23, again, guarded in terms of economic outlook, but poised for opportunity as soon as they manifest themselves. Sure. Yes. The market that we really study is that $860 billion truck and logistics market. There's 5 trillion-ton miles moving in North America. And majority of those move adverse to railroads. We -- that's where I'm focused is how do we convert that business -- more of that business to Norfolk Southern. Railroads are, in some ways, defined by geography, but we are defined by our customer base, and that's what we're focused on."

            "content": "Thank you, Alan, and good morning. I am excited to be leading the operating team as we implement the vision set forth this last quarter. My focus since assuming the role of Chief Operating Officer has been in 2 areas: collaborating with marketing and our customers to convert improved service into increased volume on the network; and getting out to talk with our field leaders about our new strategy to be a customer-centric operations-driven organization. The team has tremendous pride in Norfolk Southern and the feedback we are hearing is overwhelmingly positive. When we talk about growth, our people hear stability and opportunity. One 40-year Norfolk Southern veteran in Birmingham told me last week, he has never been more optimistic about the direction and culture of the company. I'll begin with a safety discussion on Slide 5. Our injury frequency rate improved 22%. Every conversation will begin with safety in 2023 and beyond. Operating safely is the the communities that we serve. This is an area where we have made great strides, but even one serious incident is too many. Thank you to those closest to the ballast line for the gains we achieved in safety in 2022 and and for the efforts we will all make safely delivering in 2023. Moving to Slide 6. Since we spoke last at our Investor Day, our service is the best it has been in more than 2 years. Our leadership, the implementation of our simpler, more executable operating plan top SPG and our continued resource adds have contributed to significant improvements in service for all of our customers. For premium intermodal, we safely delivered a perfect peak season for our largest parcel customer. Domestic intermodal performance has improved. Average container transit times have been reduced by 12 hours between Chicago and the Northeast, our largest corridor, with consistency also now meeting expectations. Merchandise performance is consistent, and this is another segment where our improved velocity is creating capacity. Both trains are cycling at historic best transit turn times, maximizing our asset utilization across commodities. You'll note that train speed has continued to climb from our low point last year with terminal dwell also creating capacity for growth. Our service product has turned the corner, and we are focused on building further reliability and resiliency into our network that our customers expect moving forward. Moving to our productivity update on Slide 7. We are committed to our balanced approach to service, productivity and growth. Let's start with locomotives. We have made solid progress on getting more productive use out of our fleet. You can see that here in terms of increasing our locomotive miles per day. At Investor Day, I referenced the flywheel effect that speeding up the network will produce. This is the start of that flywheel, which produced a 6% improvement last quarter and has improved 12% so far in January. Getting our locomotives moving more efficiently ensures we are creating capacity for growth. Next, we have grown our workforce, and that has been a critical element to our service improvement. Our GTMs were flat versus last year while our training pipeline has remained above steady state levels, pressuring workforce productivity. This is a good news story looking forward. as we are building the capacity we need to be reliable and resilient with the gains in service that we have made. We will build upon this foundation to drive greater workforce productivity as we bring volume back on the railroad. Lastly, we have set another quarterly record for fuel efficiency. Our increasing fluidity certainly has played a role alongside our portfolio of fuel efficiency initiatives including our fleet modernizations and idling compliance initiatives. Improving productivity is key to our balanced plan, and we are going to continue driving sustainable efficiency gains to provide value for our shareholders and our customers. On Slide 8, I will recap the industry-leading progress that we have made on hiring in 2022 and talk about what we see ahead. We entered the year in the very early stages of priming the conductor training pipeline and ramped up in record time, which was no easy task given the tightness in the labor market. We increased training wages, drove efficiencies into our onboarding process Jump started a grassroots campaign leveraging referral incentives and more. These efforts have paid off with much of our network reaching the minimum staffing levels determined by our data-driven approach. We are now focused on shoring up the remaining crew bases that are short, and we are determined to do so in 2023. As we make progress, we are deploying go teams more effectively and are executing the resiliency vision laid out at Investor Day by cross-qualifying crews and expanding training efforts. Moving to Slide 9. I will cover a few items that we are working on as we enter the new year. First, let's talk about the culture of continuous improvement we are building. We have greatly improved service and to bring our vision of long-term service resilience to reality. We know we have to keep getting better. Let me provide a few examples. With Intermodal, we are using the initial rollout and learnings from our high-frequency operating plan discussed at Investor Day, along with our perfect peak season to improve capacity and reliability across our intermodal franchise. On the merchandise side, we are applying continuous improvement principles identifying and implementing those next levers that will drive even greater resiliency and resource productivity to move cars faster and more consistently. We are building tools as part of our digital transformation to provide more actionable and timely information to a more empowered workforce. These are just a few examples of how we are driving continuous improvement into our DNA. Next, we are slated to modernize another 115 locomotives this year, converting them from DC to AC traction technology and giving them a full rejuvenation. These 115 rebuilds will reduce locomotive hauling capability equivalent to 150 DC locomotives, providing additional capacity for growth with fewer assets. Our DC to AC conversions will continue to provide even greater fuel efficiency and added pulling power to increase train productivity further. Our DC to AC conversion strategy will provide further opportunities to grow train size and increased train productivity, which we discussed at Investor Day. We have made marked progress on this long-term initiative. And just this month, we increased train size 53% in 1 of our 2 highest volume export cholines which will provide greater capacity and resiliency in our customer supply chain. Next up, let's talk about our capital investments. Our best-in-class engineering team safely delivered a productive year with more than 520 track miles of rail replaced, the most NS has done in 3 decades. We installed 10% more ties in 2022 than in 2021 with the same level of production teams and our servicing teams worked 27% more track than in 2021. We are committed to safely building and maintaining a reliable and resilient infrastructure for our customers productively. We're primed to execute on our capital plan in support of safety, resiliency, growth and productivity -- this will include a longer siding between Cincinnati and Fort Wayne, which will incorporate additional resilience into our train network. This is just one of the efforts we will highlight as the year progresses. Lastly, we are intensely focused on converting the capacity gains that we have made with top SPG and our disciplined execution of the plan into additional volume moving over the railroad in 2023. Our intermodal, merchandise and bulk service are all now consistently performing at high levels of service across our network. I will now hand it to Ed to expand on the market outlook and talk about how we can put this capacity to work. Thank you. Yes, absolutely, Alan. As you stated, we remain on pace to continue and hit our hiring targets. And as Ed alluded to, we're going to continue to match that towards the forecast as we go. As we've come out of the contract negotiations, now it's a matter of focusing on what the future looks like as far as conductive redeployment, predictive work schedules as well as quality of life and those discussions are taking place as we speak. Yes. Scott, as of this morning, we're north of 7,500 T&E. And our target right now for May is to be in the 76-plus -- 7,600-plus range. And as stated earlier, we'll continue to adjust that target as we see the markets play out. Yes. And just adding to the second question on that. As we stated, national bargaining was complete here in December. We've already begun negotiations with our labor unions on conductor redeployment. From the fact of the time line we're in negotiations, but there's certainly a regulatory piece of this. But as we have the discussions and we think about the long-term future of where we want to be, there are benefits from a predictive work standpoint. There are certainly benefits from a work-life balance and quality of life standpoint that have been challenges in the industry for a number of years that we feel get addressed through some level of conductor redeployment. So we think there's a compelling reason certainly for the industry and the regulations to move forward in support of conductor redeployment. And certainly, back to what Ed was talking about. We have to continue to find through our balanced approach of service productivity and growth those next opportunities to drive greater value for our customers and bring that volume on our railroad. So we think that's all a part of our value proposition in the long term. Yes, Alan, I mean, you touched very well on the very first level the lever would certainly be investing in our workforce, cross qualification, extended training board consolidations, et cetera, where we have opportunities there. But we also have the lever of attrition. And we've seen what has taken place in the industry with furloughs, we just have not seen for those come back. It's very expensive in the long term, and we do not see that as certainly one, if any lever that we want to pull. We want to ensure, again, if there is a volume downturn, we are in a position as that volume comes back to handle it and handle it well. So that is how we are going to approach a downturn in potential volume. Well, what we indicated was it's roughly $40 million a quarter that we're dealing with. And I would expect that, that number to come back down closer to, but not all the way to 0, by the time you get to the end of the year. So that's it. We are just now beginning to get the service back to where we wanted it to be here within the past several weeks and if not the past couple of months. So we described at Investor Day the flywheel effect that is going to take place, fully expect as we continue to resource up to the group piece that we spoke to and the service gains that we have made that we're going to continue to see that improve throughout the year."

It's now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Nichols. You may now begin.\nLuke Nichols: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full disclosure of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section, along with our reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. A full transcript and download will be posted after the call. Turning to Slide 3, it's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw.\nAlan Shaw: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Norfolk Southern's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. The Norfolk Southern team delivered strong financial results in the third quarter, achieving quarterly records for revenue, net income and earnings per share. We also demonstrated our focus on productivity and efficiency with significant OR improvement, as Mark will describe in a moment. Thank you to all the men and women of Norfolk Southern for their remarkable work this quarter and throughout the year, proudly serving our customers and improving the quality of our product. We are qualifying conductors at a robust pace, executing and refining our TOP|SPG operating plan and further strengthening our leadership team and operations. The impact is evident across our network. We see improved operating metrics, such as higher train speeds and shorter dwells. We see improved customer-facing service metrics. We hear improve feedback from customers who are talking to us about adding business. Volume is the lagging indicator, and we are confident our broad and continuing service improvement will drive growth opportunities in the months ahead. Today, the NS team is providing better service, creating network capacity for growth and demonstrating the customer-centric operations-driven approach. That is the foundation of our success. During the quarter, we reached tentative agreements with the unions that represent our craft colleagues. This was a critical first step. The tentative agreements recognize the significant contributions of our people and keep them among the highest paid craft workers in any industry. In my continuing field visits with frontline railroaders and local supervisors, I've been able to express my appreciation for the vital work they do for Norfolk Southern, our customers and the U.S. economy. Working on the railroad has always been a great opportunity to build a fulfilling career, and we want to keep it that way. In the final days of the cooling off period is the possibility of service disruption . We took a transparent no-surprises approach to communicating with our customers, which help them make informed decisions about how to keep their goods and materials moving. This is an excellent illustration of what it means to be customer-centric. Even though it created a modest headwind on volume, as Ed will describe, we received positive feedback from many of our customers. We'll take that same no surprises approach every time, because it's how we will deepen customer trust and enhance long-term value creation and growth. Now, I'll turn the discussion to Cindy for additional detail on our strong operating progress during the quarter. Cindy?\nCynthia Sanborn: Good morning. Turning to Slide 5, our resolve to improve service levels is paying off. During the quarter, we executed a smooth rollout of the latest evolution of our PSR-based operating plan, TOP|SPG, and ended the quarter with network velocity more than 20% improved from where it was entering the quarter. As a result, the service recovery glide path we charted earlier this year for the STB is trending well ahead of schedule. We have more improvements to make with progress being fueled by staffing initiatives, TOP|SPG and disciplined field execution. We are gaining momentum and will continue to drive to enhance our customer service and create capacity. Slide 6 highlights where we are with staffing levels of our transportation workforce. Our pipeline of trainees remains robust, and we have reached the waypoint target of approximately 7,300 qualified T&E staff a month ahead of schedule. This was accomplished through our innovative approach to recruiting and reinforces the advantage we have to recruit a high-quality craft workforce that takes pride in moving the economy forward. As you heard from Alan, we are pleased to have reached tentative agreements in the quarter to keep that workforce among the highest paid in the nation. Slide 7 continues the discussion on service improvements we are making. Last quarter, we shared with you the decision to adjust a couple of our existing major terminals from flat switching to humping. Those shifts went smoothly and are paying dividends today. We are leveraging a similar number of crew starts as we had entering this year inside our yards and terminals and are now moving cars more fluidly through those facilities. As a result, the railcar fleet is moving faster through our terminals. We're operating at high levels of productivity and creating capacity within our switching resources to drive further growth and productivity. As I said last quarter, we will remain flexible to most optimally manage assets, control costs, serve our customers and do so safely. Moving to Slide 8. GTMs were flat year-over-year, coupled with crew starts that were up 1%, produced flat train length and weight. We are very focused on the implementation of TOP|SPG in the quarter and are now poised for growth on our train network. Active Locomotives were up for the fourth consecutive quarter in support of service recovery. And I am pleased to say that as we regain fluidity over the last couple of months, Active Locomotives are trending down on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. The skill of our mechanical workforce, coupled with our DC to AC modernization strategy, allowed us to deploy search fleet capacities to support service recovery at historic levels of reliability. As I've discussed, we're continuing the modernization program in support of reliability and capacity in the future. Lastly, this marked our fourth consecutive quarter of fuel efficiency gains, again, due in part to our fleet investments along with shutdown compliance initiatives, augmented with enhanced communications technology and many more efforts. Slide 9 hits on a pillar of our digital strategy, Empower the Workforce, which crosses our entire operations group. Through Empower the Workforce, we provide mobile, self-service capabilities to our field forces and enable them to better manage their work with modern mobile applications. They are no longer tied to fixed base reporting and can input and retrieve information when they need it in modern, user-friendly mobile applications. We have a mobility group of technology specialists that are responsible for providing consistent, consumer-grade mobile applications to our transportation, engineering and mechanical forces. Whether it's an application for reporting railcar pickups and set-offs, obtaining track authority or recording bridge inspections, we are providing information where and when our employees need it in order to better manage their workday. To wrap up, Slide 10 is a snapshot of our progress on operating safely. We've been aggressively hiring and have a strong focus on equipping our workforce with the training and tools to perform safely and efficiently. I want to thank our entire workforce for their focus on the job at hand throughout the very dynamic third quarter. I am pleased with our progress, but we'll never be satisfied until we reach zero accidents and injuries. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Ed.\nClaude Elkins: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. All right. Turning to Slide 12, let's review our results for the third quarter where we achieved record quarterly results in several categories. Total revenue improved 17% year-over-year to $3.3 billion as fuel surcharge and favorable price conditions more than offset a 2% decline in volume. Most notably, revenue per unit, excluding fuel, increased significantly and established a new record in both our merchandise sector and for Norfolk Southern overall. These results reflect a strong price environment and the deliberate efforts of our commercial teams to pursue these opportunities. Before I comment on our individual business groups, I would like to address the impact of our collaborative mitigation efforts in response to a potential labor disruption this quarter. Coming out of August, we were encouraged by the upward trajectory of our volumes. As we move through September and concerns of a labor disruption grew stronger, we acted to guard against the potentially negative impacts on our customers and the communities that we serve in keeping with our no-surprises approach to customer engagement. We spoke with our customers early on about our plans to limit the risk of stranded, hazardous materials and security-sensitive freight like Intermodal by restricting service for these products. We estimate that this approach accounted for roughly 40% to 50% of the volume decline in the quarter or $20 million to $25 million in lost revenue, mostly in our Intermodal markets. Our goal as a customer-centric organization is to gain credibility as a transparent and trusted service provider so that our customers integrate NS further into their supply chain needs. We can only achieve that goal with proactive communication and planning that minimizes disruption. Our customers told us that they appreciated our industry-leading communication, and we're confident that our approach will deliver long-term value for Norfolk Southern, for our shareholders and for our customers. We are pleased that a labor disruption was avoided, and we remain committed to providing quality service that our customers can rely on for their supply chain needs. Now continuing to our business group's performance in the third quarter. Merchandise volume was down 2% year-over-year, driven by declines in our steel and ethanol markets that were partially offset by higher demand for sand and aggregates. With respect to steel, service challenges related to equipment availability negatively impacted our ability to meet demand. Ethanol shipments were also down as consumption of gasoline declined in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. On the positive side, shipments of sand increased more than 43% year-over-year on higher demand related to the strong market for natural gas production. Aggregates were also up due to higher levels of construction activity. Merchandise revenue improved 13% year-over-year to a quarterly record of $1.9 billion on higher revenue from fuel surcharges and from price gains. Moving on to Intermodal, revenue improved 16% for the quarter despite a 5% decline in volume. Revenue per unit reached a record level this quarter, driven by higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price. Intermodal shipments continue to be pressured by supply chain congestion and equipment shortages. This temporary shift was felt most strongly in our domestic business, where volume was down 4% year-over-year. International Intermodal volume declines were driven primarily by car supply and private chassis shortages, both reducing customer demand for inland point Intermodal and limiting our ability to satisfy that demand. Lastly, coal market conditions were again favorable for us this quarter, enabling us to deliver 43% growth in revenue for the franchise from volume growth, price improvement and fuel surcharge revenue. Volume growth was led by shipments of utility coal that were up on higher demand spurred by high natural gas prices. Export coal volume was also up due to some carryover from the second quarter and generally improved coal supply. Coal volume growth was partially offset by year-over-year declines in coke shipments due to facility closures. Overall, our performance for the quarter reflects continued progress on our strategic plan to drive value for our customers and shareholders while simultaneously working to address pressures related to volume. Moving to our outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 13. Our service is trending in the right direction, and we expect that to be a tailwind to volumes in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we're optimistic that consumer spending and manufacturing activity will support volumes for the remainder of the year. Those expectations are somewhat muted in light of looming recession risks and tightening financial conditions that are pressuring economic activity, especially in interest rate-sensitive markets like housing. Volume in our merchandise segment will benefit from growing activity in automotive markets, with U.S. light vehicle production currently expected to increase in the fourth quarter of '22 compared to 2021. Also contributing to growth will be new opportunities to move corn and other grains. Much of the Southeast corn crop is down significantly versus last year. This is likely to increase demand for Midwest-originated corn by rail. Since emerging from the pandemic low, manufacturing activity has been increasing at a steady rate. But we're beginning to see that growth level off with forecasts calling for growth to moderate to 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. As the Fed tightens interest rates, mortgage rates have increased to levels that are cooling the housing market. This reduced demand affects several of our merchandise as well as Intermodal markets. Overall, we expect merchandise volumes to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter with some upside potential as service continues to recover. Within Intermodal, our expectation is for volume to be down slightly year-over-year with opportunities from easing terminal congestion and equipment supply being offset by expectations for weaker demand and a softening truck market. On the domestic side, national Intermodal volume trends are showing signs of slowing, suggesting weaker peak season demand. However, consumer spending, which has historically been a big driver of this market, is currently forecasted to hold steady through the end of the year, providing underlying support for our domestic Intermodal volumes. We continue to see volume opportunity for domestic Intermodal as our service recovers, and we expect customers to shift loads from the highway to rail as we intently focus on improving domestic Intermodal service. International Intermodal will continue to struggle with congestion and equipment supply, and we expect Intermodal storage charges to remain elevated so long as those issues continue. When supply chain congestion does ease, we expect to deliver additional international volume for customers as Inland Point Intermodal, or IPI, becomes more attractive. And finally, our expectations for coal are that volumes will continue to improve year-over-year in the fourth quarter driven by strength in the markets for both utility and export coal. EIA's latest forecast is for natural gas prices to remain elevated through the end of the year. This will increase demand for coal as a competitive alternative. Seaborne coal prices are expected to remain at relatively high levels through the end of the year, indicating continued demand for U.S. coals abroad. We also anticipate increased coal supply in the fourth quarter, primarily for export, which will create opportunities for coal volume growth. To summarize, we have a number of uncertain market signals in front of us right now, but our focus remains on impacting the things that we can control to deliver quality service to our customers and increase value for our shareholders. Overall, we have a fantastic portfolio of customers. And as always, I want to take this opportunity to thank them for their business and for their ongoing partnership. I will now turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results.\nMark George: Thank you, and good morning. Starting on Slide 15, Ed walked you through the drivers of our 17% growth in revenues. You'll see operating expense of $355 million or 21%, and that includes a $117 million true-up to our compensation accruals based on the terms of the tentative labor agreements. This resulted in the operating ratio increasing year-over-year to 62% for the quarter. Operating income grew $136 million or 12% despite that headwind. EPS was up 34% or $1.04, thanks to strong earnings growth coupled with share shrink, but also from an adjustment to income tax expense related to Pennsylvania's rate reduction that was enacted in the quarter. You will recall we did signal this in our second quarter earnings release. Let's take a moment on Slide 16 to drill specifically into the labor cost adjustments that we reported. As I mentioned, we increased our wage accruals by $117 million in Q3, with $88 million of that amount related to past periods and $29 million related specifically to Q3 2022. The columns represent the period in which the adjustments relate. These amounts, including the impact of the bonus payments, represents more than 2x what we had been assuming. We anticipate another $23 million of incremental expense in Q4, bringing the total amount for the year to $140 million, which represents as much as 110 basis points of headwind to the full year OR from what we had been expecting. It is also worth noting that there is an additional $50 million of incremental label cost that will be capitalized into property additions this year. Now let's take a moment on Slide 17 to reconcile the drivers of OR and EPS since there are some movers in the quarter. The impact of the $88 million out-of-period wage accruals in Q3 was meaningful, representing a 270 basis point headwind to the OR and $0.28 on EPS. We did have a favorable legal settlement in the quarter that provided a $0.05 of help to EPS and 40 basis points of help on the OR. The favorable state tax rate change caused a $136 million reduction to our deferred tax liability, which equates to $0.58 of EPS lift. That leaves a core improvement in EPS of $0.69 and improvement in the operating ratio of 50 basis points, which, I'll point out, includes the absorption of 90 basis points of headwind from the $29 million in-period incremental labor cost adjustments that I spoke to on the prior slide. Moving now to Slide 18 and the changes in operating expenses of $355 million, which represents a 21% increase year-over-year. Fuel was the primary driver, up $175 million or 84% due almost entirely to price. But as Cindy noted, we did enjoy benefits associated with a 3% fuel efficiency improvement. Compensation and benefits, it is up 21% due to the elevated labor costs associated with the tentative agreements. Moving on, you'll see purchase services and rents collectively up $52 million. Inflation and slower network speed continue to drive up these 2 cost categories. Materials, claims and other expenses were down 4% or $7 million year-over-year, helped in part from the $15 million favorable legal settlement in the other category. Turning now to Slide 19 for the P&L below operating income. Other income was an expense of $2 million in the quarter, $16 million unfavorable compared to last year driven by losses on the company-owned life insurance investments due to negative equity and fixed income market returns in the quarter. While pretax income was up 11% in the quarter, net income was up 27% due to the 12.4% effective tax rate in the quarter, thanks to the benefit recorded from the state tax rate change. EPS was up 34%, greater than net income growth supported by our capital allocation strategy that includes share repurchases. Shifting to Slide 20. Cash from operations through 9 months is up $111 million while property additions were higher by $257 million. As we discussed last quarter, I expect capital expenditures to be at the high end of the $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion guidance range, with materials inflation and now incremental wage inflation creating meaningful headwinds. Free cash flow conversion stands at 86%. Shareholder distributions have been strong this year with a 15% increase to our dividends plus continuing solid share repurchase activity. And with that, I'll hand back over to Alan.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you, Mark. Noting the considerable changes that occurred in the third quarter, I'd like to update you on our outlook for the balance of 2022. As you'll see on Slide 21, based on the strong Q3 revenue performance, we now see full year revenue growth of 13% plus year-over-year. Ongoing strength in RPU driven by fuel surcharges and strong price gains are helping us overcome lagging volumes which, as Ed laid out, we expect to be flattish overall in Q4. Turning to the operating ratio. We are tracking to our previous guidance, excluding the impact from the tentative labor agreements. Mark laid out $140 million of incremental impact for the year, which is roughly 110 basis points of OR headwind. As such, we now expect the all-in OR for the full year to be roughly 62% based on our current assessment of the market. Since I became CEO in May, you have heard me speak to the strengths of our team and culture, our powerful network and the macroeconomic trends supporting highway-to-rail conversion. I have shared some thoughts on our customer-centric operations-driven approach and spoken to the bright future ahead for Norfolk Southern. I continue to be encouraged by my engagements with all of our team members and their commitment to serving our customers. As we approach our December 6 Investor Day, we are eager to share a more detailed view of our long-term strategy for value creation. We will now open the call to questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today will be coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: Just to start on the 2022 guidance. If I look at what you're guiding for revenue and your commentary on volumes, it implies that yields will be down at a decent amount sequentially in the fourth quarter. So I was wondering if you could provide more color on that, specifically around coal RPU. And then maybe secondly, there have been a lot of inefficiencies in the network this year. Is there a way you can put a number on what that cost has been in 2022 as we think about service recovering and that potential future tailwind?\nAlan Shaw: Yes, certainly, we see some potential headwinds in some of our markets moving into the fourth quarter, specifically energy, as you called out. And I'll let Ed talk about the projected impact on the top line.\nClaude Elkins: Sure. We've seen how seaborne coal prices have fallen, but they have done a new floor and they remain at relatively high levels. On the utility side, we expect there's still a lot of demand out there for that. You factor in what's going on in Europe, and we feel pretty good on the utility side on the steam coal side. The met coal side is a different story. There's a lot of cross currents and headwinds, particularly from China that we see. Steel production in China remains muted, and the housing situation there, which consumes a tremendous amount of steel in that market, remains off kilter, so to speak. So we are more guarded about the met coal side of the business. Does that answer your question?\nAlan Shaw: Well, and also, Ed, talk about your outlook for fuel surcharge revenue.\nClaude Elkins: Yes. Fuel surcharge, when we look at the forward curves and we know we have a 2-month lag, we are expecting that there is a headwind. That's when we come into play in the fourth quarter.\nJustin Long: Okay. So it sounds like it's more action of fuel and coal RPU versus any slowdown in core price.\nAlan Shaw: That's right.\nClaude Elkins: Yes, we -- you've heard us talk about this before. We price to the value of our service in the market, and we're very diligent about that. We are confident with our commercial teams that we're identifying places we're adding value. We had -- we'll see RPU less fuel records in merchandise and overall this quarter, and we've had almost 6 years of revenue improvement or RPU improvement in Intermodal and almost 7 years on our merchandise side. That's through a lot of up and down cycles, freight recessions and freight boom times, and we've consistently been able to deliver. So we're very focused on that side of the business.\nAlan Shaw: And as we price to the value of our product, the value of our product is improving.\nClaude Elkins: Yes.\nJustin Long: Got it. And maybe, Mark, on the network inefficiency cost question?\nMark George: Yes. Clearly, we're suffering incremental service costs related to where we are in our service product today. Honestly, it's at least $40 million a quarter, and those things are -- they show up in comp and ben, it shows up in purchase services. And as things improve going into 2023, we'll start to see relief in the P&L there.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger: So you've talked about volumes and hopefully seeing some improvement there, but I'm just sort of curious when do we see these service metrics more fully translate to volume capability based on demand? And why has there been such a lag?\nAlan Shaw: Jordan, as we noted, volume is a lag to service. We had seen a lot of improvement in our volume sequentially heading up to the potential work stoppage in mid-September. We're starting to see some improvements now. Ed?\nClaude Elkins: Yes. And I'll repeat what I said earlier, we felt like we had a lot of momentum going into that strike or the potential for a strike. And we've talked previously about the IPI issue at our railroad, and that continues to impact volumes in the third quarter as our international customer portfolio made decisions to do more port-to-port services, specifically on short-haul lanes that are typically sensitive to spot truck prices. If you look, our revenue per tonne models in Intermodal declined 1% on a 5% volume decline, and that really confirms to us that the headwinds are highest in these very short haul lanes. We see some factors that have driven these IPI decisions like ocean freight rates. They're really reverting to a more normal course. We have a very broad base of international customers. And when you look back pre-pandemic, the IPI business, the Inland Port International, played a significant role in our customer supply chain. And as inland congestion eases, those supply chains are going to return to normal, and we think our customers -- well, we know our customers are telling us that they expect to increase their use of IPI as that happens. We talk to our customers every day, and we are very encouraged by the feedback we're getting. We have customers coming to us that are recognizing the change in our service product for the better and are looking to put additional volume on the railroad. As one example, I would cite the ag markets where we've been able to really participate in some of the spot markets that previously we weren't able to because we have new capacity because of the improvements in our service product. That's just an example.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\nChristian Wetherbee: I guess we are seeing some warning signals in terms of economic factors, and I guess I just wanted to make sure I understood sort of how you guys are going to manage the network as you sort of potentially deal with those maybe in the first half of next year, maybe over the course of next year. You've got the service improvement underway. It looks like hiring is kind of where you need it to be. I guess how flexible can the network be through potential volume volatility as we kind of progress over the course of the next several quarters?\nAlan Shaw: Chris, we are intently focused on continuing our service recovery. It is the value of our product. And as Ed noted, we price to the value of the product. And as our product value improves, we continue to see more volume and revenue opportunities for us. We're encouraged by the number of conductor trainees in our pipeline. Right now, it's about 950, which is, I think, pretty close to our high in 2022. And we are continuing to hire for some specific locations. As we've talked about, we have about 95 different true hiring locations. We're going to reassess our legacy assumptions on staffing, and we're not going to make any unilateral commitments on what we're going to do going forward. I will commit that we will be data-driven in our approach, and we're going to make decisions based on the long-term value creation, balancing service, cost control and growth. Cindy, you're thinking about some specific opportunities to add more flexibility.\nCynthia Sanborn: Yes. So in the short term, we obviously -- we do have some training opportunities to replenish our locomotive engineer ranks that we set back to conductors and allow us to step them up when we need to because it takes longer to train an engineer than it does a conductor. We'll also be enhancing our Go Team membership, the folks we're going to have in our Go Team group. It won't be a huge number of people, but that will also be a resiliency tactic that we'll take. And in the effort to improve our conductor availability through the downturns that we've had -- or through the challenges that we've had, we've qualified in a single segment because that's where they would stand to work. And now we need to qualify them on other segments, radiating out of that same supply point. So there's a number of actions that we'll take here to make sure we're fortified and ready to go into any upturn. Going through a downturn, we'll manage through these opportunities. And then as we come into an upturn, they'll be available to us.\nChristian Wetherbee: Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, I think there's been some concern for the industry broadly that if we were to see maybe a more sudden drop-off in volume that the industry would be less sort of able to react as quickly as possible, sort of resulting potentially in worse decremental margins than we've seen in previous downturns. I think that sort of has something to do with furloughing employees, maybe a bit more aggressively in previous times. Any thoughts on whether you think that is a valid concern as we go into next year? Or are there enough levers that you have to pull to be able to offset that?\nCynthia Sanborn: Well, I think we -- as you noted, I mean, the labor market is different than in the past, and our recruiting efforts are a little bit different than in the past. We know how long it takes to train and hire an employee, and we talk about having 95 different hiring groups that we have to manage that through. So I will say that we have to make sure we manage through downturns in such a way that we're in a good place to handle the upturns. That's how we're going to manage -- that's how we're going to grow long term. So we have levers such as attrition that can help us if we need it, but we also know that we have to be fortified in having a good hiring pipeline or a line of sight to that hiring pipeline so that we can manage the upturn. We don't just want to manage one side.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Mark, you talked about at least $40 million a quarter of sort of network inefficiencies. I'm wondering how much of storage revenue, though, are we seeing per quarter? And what's a more normal number? So as service gets better, that $40 million of cost goes away, but maybe how much of this storage revenue goes? I'm just trying to understand the puts and takes.\nMark George: Yes. Scott, clearly, there is some storage revenue that helps mitigate that, the accessorial revenues that we talked to. And certainly, as service recovers, we'll start to see those accessorial revenues come down. Ed, I don't know if you want to talk about the pacing in which you see that...\nClaude Elkins: Yes. No, earlier this year, we thought that the supply chains would unlock faster, and we would start to see that storage number come off as customers got more fluid into warehousing on the street. Frankly, that hadn't happened. If you look at many of our hinterland markets, particularly deeper into the Midwest, we continue to see the same issues that we saw earlier. So the storage number continues to remain elevated, and we expect right now that it's going to continue to be elevated in the fourth quarter. I think next year, we're hopeful that supply chains will unlock, and there'll be more opportunities move volume instead of storage.\nAlan Shaw: And it's also true that while storage revenue is elevated, the year-over-year comps are slowing down.\nClaude Elkins: Absolutely. We've lapped it, yes.\nScott Group: So when you think about the puts and takes for next year, I think it -- probably another good year of pricing, service improvement, some uncertainty with volume wage inflation. Do you think the pieces are there to start getting margins higher again next year?\nMark George: Well, we're actually putting together the budget for '23 now, and there's a lot of big assumptions that have to be made. So we'll be back to you with '23 guidance. Certainly, that's our goal at this point in time. We've got to get inflation under control. We've got to try to get some offsets on the top line from that. How much volume we can get is going to be a big lever as well. So we'll come back to you with the '23 numbers.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen.\nJason Seidl: I wanted to look a little bit about Intermodal's growth rate and sort of how much do you think it's been impacted by, A, your service levels and, B, some of the labor issues that we saw last quarter. So in other words, what's a good economic base to look at '23 off of '22?\nAlan Shaw: Intermodal is clearly a growth driver for us going forward. Ed, why don't you talk about how we're going to continue to leverage that unique franchise strength?\nClaude Elkins: Yes. We think we have the most powerful franchise in North America when it comes to Intermodal. We're located square in the heart of the U.S. consumer markets as well as manufacturing with access -- great access to all the East Coast ports and all the Western railroads. We talk to our customers every day. They are investing for growth. Our channel partners are priming themselves to grow with Norfolk Southern as our service improves. And as our service improves, we're creating additional opportunities for them to satisfy supply chain issues that are still manifesting themselves out there. We know that there's a lot of cross current and a lot of, what I would call, mixed signals out there in the macroeconomic environment. We're encouraged by what's going on in manufacturing, which had a great report in September. Future orders appear to be somewhat of a drag. It's undeniable that with interest rates going up and inflation staying stubbornly high, there is some demand destruction out there. But we're confident that for our customers and for our channel partners, Intermodal is still going to be a great way for them to save money going forward in a very inflationary environment as they take freight off the highway and put it on the railroad.\nAlan Shaw: Jason, we're looking forward to sharing more of our long-term vision for value creation at our Investor Day in 6 weeks. And clearly, Intermodal is a key component of that.\nJason Seidl: I look forward to hearing that down there. I was just trying to get sort of -- if you guys can even put a ballpark figure on sort of how many growth points, service, labor issues and lack of equipment might have cost you this year on a 3-quarter basis so far?\nAlan Shaw: Well, I think you nailed them all. And then I think you should also add in this IPI issue where the short-haul business from the ports is being trucked. Despite that and despite the fact that our Intermodal volumes were down by 1% in the quarter, as Ed noted, our revenue ton miles in Intermodal were up 5%.\nJason Seidl: Got you. So you think that if we didn't have all these issues, you guys have positive volumes at least this year.\nAlan Shaw: There's absolutely no doubt.\nJason Seidl: Okay. Really quick, if I can get one more in. The [indiscernible] tax benefit in the quarter, is there going to be an ongoing benefit that will impact your future tax rate?\nMark George: Pretty modest at the total level in any given quarter. It's kind of within that range that we guide. I don't think it's going to adjust the range, the effective tax rate that we guide.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nThomas Wadewitz: Yes. So I'll give you the two questions upfront. So the first one would just be on pricing. Mark, you talked about the big assumptions in the budget for 2023 that you need top line to offset some of the inflation. I wonder maybe for Ed, if you can just give some commentary on how sensitive you think prices in your book to a weaker truckload market and falling truckload contract rates. Can you accelerate pricing against that backdrop? Or is weaker truck something we should really be mindful of? And then the second one is just on volume. I think we've had this assessment that improving service that you're delivering more capacity would translate to stronger volume. It sounds like that's maybe not the case just because the markets are getting a bit weaker. So I don't know if that's right or if you still think there are segments that are going to see stronger volumes as you continue to improve the service.\nClaude Elkins: Sure. On the revenue side, on the price side, like I said, we've been talking to our customers every single day about where price is going. We've got a great track record of being able to deliver price as we increase the value that we're delivering to our customers, and they can transfer that on. Our service is improving in -- and I will tell you that our customers are confident that as our service improves, they can put additional volume against the railroad. And look, that helps save money for our customers in the long term. We price to the value of the market. We know that there's a lot of noise around the spot market, which goes up and goes down. We stay focused on the long-term trajectory of contract rates, and our customers understand that. Can you repeat your volume question again?\nThomas Wadewitz: What -- okay. I guess just to finish that thought, but do you think we ought to be careful about the truck market getting weaker or you say, no, that's not a big impact on our pricing in '23?\nAlan Shaw: Our RTMs went up 5%.\nClaude Elkins: Yes. I think the macro economy is going to tell us where we're all going in terms of economic trajectory. We have been able to price and continue to be successful in pricing because of the value that we're delivering to those customers. I think a recession, if there is one coming, or a downturn, that's going to dictate how much volume we can put against the railroad and how much is available to put against the railroad. But we're confident that we're going to be able to do that. On the volume side, I will tell you that we have a strong portfolio of customers that are, like I said, they're -- we stick to the script here, they're investing to grow. We see that happening, and I think as the IPI situation reverts to normal in terms of conditions that allow that, our customers are going to find value in that market as well.\nThomas Wadewitz: Okay, yes. And what about Industrial? Like if service improves, do you expect metals and forest products and chemicals volumes to improve in response to that?\nClaude Elkins: Yes. And in fact, we're seeing, on the bulk side of our network, additional throughput capacity that we're putting up against customers right now in the spot markets. That's indicative of the opportunities that are out there. I think I noted in the third quarter, we had cycle times on equipment that still inhibited our ability to serve everyone that wanted to be served. And so as our fluid improves, we're going to be able to put additional capacity against them, too. Our customers are telling us that there's additional volume out there that they want to put on the railroad. If you look at most of the manufacturing sectors, there's still a lot of unfilled orders out there that they're working through. Even in a -- what I would call a declining demand environment, there's still a lot of back orders. So we're confident about our ability to continue to grow volumes and service improvement.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question will be coming from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Mark, I just wanted to deconstruct the -- so the guidance of 62% OR, I think includes the $88 million prior period labor adjustments and then $15 million of legal settlements. So I'm just trying to figure out, it looks like it's really like 61.5% if you kind of strip out to maybe extraordinary, if you could just talk about that. And then the implied fourth quarter is something like, I think, like 63% OR or something like that to get to that 61.5%. I mean, you have to go back to like the fourth quarter of '19 to get something that low or high. And yield is up over 20% since then. Revenue is up over 10% since then. So I'm just trying to reconcile, first, if my numbers are correct. And then two, why would there be such a deterioration despite even some of the headwinds based on kind of the improvement you've seen in the business from a yield and service perspective.\nMark George: Thanks, Amit. So yes, the guidance that we gave of the 62% for the full year includes the retroactive wage adjustment as well as the ongoing wage adjustments. So basically, the $140 million, it is the all-in including the items that we called out this quarter. So it's -- that's kind of where it comes to. I'm not getting to your 63% number implied for Q4. So if you do the all-in, I think it's largely in line with -- in Q4, it should be largely in line with the full year number.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. Maybe I'll take that offline. But I'm just trying to think like if you strip out the $88 million, you're really looking at -- obviously, that's not an ongoing -- that's prior period. So maybe...\nMark George: Correct. Correct.\nAmit Mehrotra: So maybe 61.5% is kind of the right way to think about the jumping off point as you move into '23. Is that a fair way to think about it?\nMark George: Yes. We were -- when you ignore the $88 million and you look at our restated Q3, and then you can look at Q4 inclusive of the $23 million that we told you about, it's obviously -- it's a much lower number than the 62%.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.\nBascome Majors: As we look out into next year with the visibility into the union labor wage increases, can you talk a little bit about either broader rail inflation or something in a cost per employee kind of context that we can think about modeling, just -- without getting all the way to preliminary guiding next year? Just what sort of cost inflation on the labor front or overall are you expecting versus history?\nMark George: Bascome, this is Mark. So the -- if you look at our comp per employee in the third quarter and you take out the retro wage adjustments, it's -- you'll get to about $34,250 for the quarter. And I would probably guide you all to think that same number would apply in Q4 because that is kind of the new number. It's baking in this 7% higher wage that took effect in July. So that would kind of go sideways there in Q4.  And then as you think about 2023, what we typically see in the first quarter is a resetting of the payroll taxes, and so that will knock it up a couple of points in conjunction with assumptions for higher bonus payout as well. So you'd probably see a point or 2 increase in that number going into the first half of next year. And then, of course, when you get to the back half of next year, you have another wage jump that comes from the contractual agreement numbers that you would have seen published. So that will probably go up another few points in the back half. So that's probably the way I would look at it. It probably wants to go up more than a few points, but we will have some service cost relief as service improves and some of those costs that we are incurring related to overtime drayage -- not drayage, sorry, overtime and training costs, et cetera, start to subside. So I would model it out that way. A point or 2 elevation here from that level in the first half and then another, call it, a few points in the second half.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel.\nBenjamin Nolan: So as I'm looking at the 4Q sort of service improvements that look like they're having an effect with train speed and dwell and so forth and then matching that up with the increase in headcount that you have, just curious if you can frame in how much of the service improvements, you can say, put at the feet of being more fully staffed or appropriately staffed or whatever versus just sort of the -- well, any other factors that might be helping there.\nCynthia Sanborn: Thanks for the question, Ben. I think hiring is a critical part of our service improvement efforts. We established a target that we shared with the STB of about, call it, 7,550 qualified T&Es by mid-2023. And we are ahead of that target as we head into November. And when we think of that number, just so we're really clear, and that top line number, we have to recognize there's 95 hiring locations underneath it. So while that number is important that we also have to have folks in the right critical locations.  I would say another lever that we pulled and we've talked about it in prior quarters is our TOP|SPG operating plan initiative that is in place. It's really helped us, I think, to have a more executable plan. And it's boiled down into a comprehensive review of connection standards, our distributed power playbook, and help us to recalibrate train meet. So as we get closer and closer on time, that fluidity continues to -- allow us to be more fluid, I guess, is the best way to put it. So I would say those 2 things are the biggest levers that we've had.\nAlan Shaw: Then recall that we implemented the first phase of TOP|SPG at the very end of the second quarter. And then in the third quarter, our train speeds increased by 20%. And as Cindy noted, it applies the principles of PSR, and it's really focused on balance, simplicity and executability.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI.\nJonathan Chappell: Cindy, sticking with some of the service questions and updates to issues from the recent past hasn't been much talk about chassis recently. Is that because the availability there has cleared up meaningfully? And how does that impact as you think about the excess equipment or the spare capacity on the network once you are appropriately resourced and the economic backdrop you're looking at for next year?\nAlan Shaw: Ed, some of the chassis issues in the past have been our own. Some have been our customers. Could you cover that, please?\nClaude Elkins: Sure. And we've been successful in getting a portion of our order online of our chassis, and we're seeing that help in terms of fluidity. I will tell you on the international side, there still remains a lot of shortages out there mostly because I believe those units are deployed on the street or at a warehouse. And it continues to be an issue on the international side of the business, particularly in these hinterland markets, as we talked about earlier. We deployed a number of countermeasures which includes some temporary storage facilities that we've been able to open to help accommodate our customers. But we will continue to look for additional fluidity going forward, particularly on the private chassis side.\nJonathan Chappell: So Ed, just to be clear. I mean is there any improvement or any line of sight towards improvement because it was in kind of major focus, let's call it, 9 months ago and maybe not so much anymore? But it sounds like it's still having a really big impact, especially on your international Intermodal.\nClaude Elkins: On the international Intermodal side, it is having an impact, and that's not a chassis or an asset that we control per se. For our chassis on our equipment, we've seen some relief both in terms of the fluidity side, but mostly because we've been able to add some chassis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Look, I don't mean to be near term or quarterly focused here, but can we come back to the implied 4Q sequential on the operating ratio? Because, Mark, if I back out the $88 million of prior year accruals and maybe even the legal settlement, it still looks like you're guiding OR up maybe 400 to 500 basis points sequentially, which I think would be one of the worst outcomes if we go back in time for your company. So what are we missing on the cost side? Or is this really a deceleration on the revenue front that we should be thinking?\nMark George: Yes. Look, I think the story here, it's mainly a top line story. We see the expenses largely in line with the third quarter when you exclude the labor adjustments that were historic -- I'm sorry, that were retroactively made as well as the favorable legal item that we called out. So really, what we're talking about is more of a top line story. So Ed talked a little bit about the RPU assumptions that we made on energy pricing. Hopefully, that's conservative and that comes back, but it's really less about cost and more about just a little bit of deceleration.\nAlan Shaw: Well, I want to clear up a point. There's nothing that we're looking at that suggests a 400 to 500 basis point decline or worsening of our OR in the fourth quarter. We don't see that math.\nClaude Elkins: And our core pricing story remains absolutely intact.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.\nWalter Spracklin: Just a quick housekeeping question on the tax rate. You mentioned that it's not changed. Are we in the 23.5%, 24% range. Is that right?\nMark George: Yes. That's -- for the time being, that's where the implied guidance is on the overall tax rate. That includes, obviously, the federal rate, which is at 21%, but it also includes a multitude of states, not just Pennsylvania where we operate. That brings it up a little bit higher. And yes, Pennsylvania's rate goes down a little bit, but we still got all the other state tax where we pay.\nWalter Spracklin: Got it. Perfect. Okay. And then my second question here is on carryover impacts, whether it's headwinds or tailwinds that would impact OR going into 2023. And one of your peers mentioned they started out with a target for the beginning of the year. Obviously, you weren't able to achieve it due to the headwinds, but indicated that it's off the table for next year due to some of the carryovers. I don't know if Cindy is the best one to ask this, but is there -- is there headwinds to what you would have expected your OR to be, say, the beginning of the year that won't allow you to kind of achieve some of the benefits akin to what other industry peers are seeing? Or is that kind of specific to them? Do you believe that you can see a material improvement in your OR because those headwinds don't exist going into 2023?\nAlan Shaw: As I noted before, we're going to be more than happy to share our vision for long-term value creation at our Investor Day in about 6 weeks.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKenneth Hoexter: So Alan, as you just highlight earlier, I thought that was a really important point on the furloughing and decrementals. I think that's probably one of the most talked about discussions on the future of the railroads, it's going to be what happens, can the rails be as variable as they had been. But I just want to visit on -- did I catch you right? Did you say that labor costs were 2x your target? It seems to be a very big step relative to the other rail gaps. And is there any reason for that? And then I guess on the -- my follow-up on the TOP|SPG, what's the issue now? As you ramp employees, is it equipment chassis? Is it getting the humps back to speed? What else needs to be done going forward here to finish improving the service?\nMark George: Yes. Ken, I'll start on the labor costs. I mean, the PEB recommendations were obviously higher than we expected. We laid out very transparently for you the details of how those increases were allocated, including those retro adjustments, and we advised throughout all that we were accruing in line with historical increases and -- which is what we had on the table with labor prior to the PEB. So the adjustment is really just the math. Go ahead.\nAlan Shaw: Let me talk about the service. We improved our train speed by 20% in the third quarter, and our service metrics are better than what we had projected to the Service Transportation Board earlier this year. Our service metrics and our service product is at a level, as Ed described, that's allowing us to participate in some lucrative spot opportunities that we didn't anticipate. We could participate in a couple of months ago. We made a lot of improvement. What we're allowed to do now because of the health of our network is narrow our focus a little bit more on some specific areas in which we need to continue to improve our service price. That's our focus. It's job priority #1 on Norfolk Southern.\nCynthia Sanborn: And I would add on the SPG piece, Ken, that it's a consideration, refinement, simplification, all of those types of things. Again, it's a very PSR-oriented to making sure we get asset turns as we need to and be able to create fluidity that not only helps us from a cost perspective, but it's exactly what our customers need. So there's continuing work going on there as well.\nKenneth Hoexter: Can I just ask a clarification? Mark, did you mention the headwind on the lost fuel surcharge for the fourth quarter was there? Or was it just we're going to have a headwind? I don't know if you'd put in on that.\nMark George: Actually, Ken, thanks for the opportunity to clear that up a little bit. That was another thing that's driving the fourth quarter operating ratio in the implied math, too, is fuel surcharge. The net fuel surcharge was actually a benefit here in the third quarter. And based on where fuel prices are going, it spins to become a headwind again just like it was in the first half.\nKenneth Hoexter: I appreciate that. Did you put a level or a number, or just that's going to be...\nMark George: I did not. I did not. It's going to be -- well, we have to see where the prices are going. We've just seen a dramatic spike just in the past 1.5 weeks, which initially we weren't expecting to see, and we thought that maybe we would not have the headwinds that we're facing. But right now, it's -- fuel has moved up. And because of the lag effect, we'll end up having an OR headwind here in the fourth quarter. It won't catch up until the first quarter.  So again, in periods of a rising fuel, because of the lag, we end up with OR headwinds. When fuel stabilizes and starts to go down, you tend to get fuel tailwinds. So in Q3, we ended up having a reprieve on that and we got some OR help from the fuel surcharge program, but it looks like it's going to spin again to a headwind here in the fourth quarter. Just like we had in the first half.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse.\nAriel Rosa: So I wanted to start with just a philosophical question. Just maybe you could address how you're thinking about balancing desires for volume growth versus OR improvement. I know for a long time, I think the argument for NS has been, well, we grow -- we're going to outgrow the industry, and therefore, maybe our ORs will lag peers a little bit. Maybe you could just update us how you're thinking about the tension between those two?  And here we are in an environment where you're obviously adding resources in terms of headcount and other things, but you're looking for volume growth to be essentially flat in the fourth quarter. So maybe you could talk about that and the opportunity to maybe get volume over time to kind of meet those higher resource levels.\nAlan Shaw: Yes. Ari, we firmly believe that service and margin improvement support each other. And frankly, you saw that in the third quarter. The service improved. Our margin improved versus the second quarter. With respect to fourth quarter volumes, just note that normal seasonality would suggest generally about a 5% decline in volume in the fourth quarter relative to the third. So as our service continues to improve, we believe we're going to outperform normal seasonality on our volumes. And longer term, our commitment is to industry competitive margins with above market growth.\nAriel Rosa: Okay. That's helpful. And then just really quickly, Alan, you mentioned that you're getting increased inquiries from customers based on kind of some of these service improvements. I was hoping you could just add some color around where those inquiries are coming in, what's the nature of those inquiries. Again, it's a little difficult to reconcile with the notion of volume growth maybe being a little bit flat or at least as implied by the guide. Just maybe give us some color around the nature of those conversations with customers.\nAlan Shaw: Ed, you're talking to our customers every day, as am I, but you're certainly much closer to this.\nClaude Elkins: Yes. Overall sentiment from our customers is that things have improved, and we're continuing to move in the right direction. We're hearing that every day from a range with customers.  One thing that we're certain about is as we increase train speed and reduce the amount of dwell, we're going to have more capacity to deliver value to our customers, and we're hearing that from them. I'll use the ag markets as an example on the bulk side where we are seeing customers come to us and come to us with spot opportunities that we probably wouldn't have been able to execute on in prior periods, but we're able to now. And so we're diligently looking at these opportunities, and it really means looking at opportunities where we can be successful and add value. There are several of those on the bulk side, and we'll continue to look for them.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities.\nCherilyn Radbourne: I was just looking for a bit of clarification on the $88 million retroactive labor accrual and the extent to which it reflects base wage increases versus the proposed bonuses. And to the extent that it's more weighted to bonuses versus the base wage increase, should we then assume that, that means the company was correctly anticipating base wage inflation and, therefore, should have been passing that on as contracts roll? Or how should we think about that accrual?\nMark George: Yes. We didn't provide the split of impact between the bonus and the base wage, Cherilyn, but we can -- let me look at providing that to you offline. But I do think that we are -- the overall impact that we've got from the $88 million that relates to 2020, 2021 and the first half of 2022 now becomes something that we have to absorb over time and mitigate with not just pricing, but with productivity and efficiency in the go forward. And that's our goal on how we offset that.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research.\nJeffrey Kauffman: Congratulations. A lot of my questions have been answered, so let me just go with one modeling detail question. Debt was relatively flat. Interest expense, up $7 million. Obviously, interest rates arising. Can you give us a sense of your interest rate sensitivity? And let's say, the Fed does an additional 150 basis points here and then slows down. What would be a good way to think about run rate interest expense as we enter 2023?\nMark George: Well, Jeff, I mean, it will -- look, the weighted average interest rate in our overall debt portfolio today is below current rates. So with every new debt issuance that we have, it will be at higher rates than the average. It will start -- so as old maturities roll off, new ones come on. It's going to -- interest will start to go up a little bit. We're not so worried, frankly, because we do have a portfolio of debt that exceeds $14 billion or so. So I don't think it's going to be a meaningful drag on us going forward. And we haven't really seen the interest rates at levels yet that caused me much concern.\nJeffrey Kauffman: Okay. So more a function of new issuance replacing old issuance as opposed to any interest rate sensitivity on future increases.\nMark George: Correct.\nAlan Shaw: We thank you for joining our call, and we look forward to continuing these discussions at our December 6 Investor Day.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Norfolk Southern's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. The Norfolk Southern team delivered strong financial results in the third quarter, achieving quarterly records for revenue, net income and earnings per share. We also demonstrated our focus on productivity and efficiency with significant OR improvement, as Mark will describe in a moment. Thank you to all the men and women of Norfolk Southern for their remarkable work this quarter and throughout the year, proudly serving our customers and improving the quality of our product. We are qualifying conductors at a robust pace, executing and refining our TOP|SPG operating plan and further strengthening our leadership team and operations. The impact is evident across our network. We see improved operating metrics, such as higher train speeds and shorter dwells. We see improved customer-facing service metrics. We hear improve feedback from customers who are talking to us about adding business. Volume is the lagging indicator, and we are confident our broad and continuing service improvement will drive growth opportunities in the months ahead. Today, the NS team is providing better service, creating network capacity for growth and demonstrating the customer-centric operations-driven approach. That is the foundation of our success. During the quarter, we reached tentative agreements with the unions that represent our craft colleagues. This was a critical first step. The tentative agreements recognize the significant contributions of our people and keep them among the highest paid craft workers in any industry. In my continuing field visits with frontline railroaders and local supervisors, I've been able to express my appreciation for the vital work they do for Norfolk Southern, our customers and the U.S. economy. Working on the railroad has always been a great opportunity to build a fulfilling career, and we want to keep it that way. In the final days of the cooling off period is the possibility of service disruption . We took a transparent no-surprises approach to communicating with our customers, which help them make informed decisions about how to keep their goods and materials moving. This is an excellent illustration of what it means to be customer-centric. Even though it created a modest headwind on volume, as Ed will describe, we received positive feedback from many of our customers. We'll take that same no surprises approach every time, because it's how we will deepen customer trust and enhance long-term value creation and growth. Now, I'll turn the discussion to Cindy for additional detail on our strong operating progress during the quarter. Cindy? Thank you, Mark. Noting the considerable changes that occurred in the third quarter, I'd like to update you on our outlook for the balance of 2022. As you'll see on Slide 21, based on the strong Q3 revenue performance, we now see full year revenue growth of 13% plus year-over-year. Ongoing strength in RPU driven by fuel surcharges and strong price gains are helping us overcome lagging volumes which, as Ed laid out, we expect to be flattish overall in Q4. Turning to the operating ratio. We are tracking to our previous guidance, excluding the impact from the tentative labor agreements. Mark laid out $140 million of incremental impact for the year, which is roughly 110 basis points of OR headwind. As such, we now expect the all-in OR for the full year to be roughly 62% based on our current assessment of the market. Since I became CEO in May, you have heard me speak to the strengths of our team and culture, our powerful network and the macroeconomic trends supporting highway-to-rail conversion. I have shared some thoughts on our customer-centric operations-driven approach and spoken to the bright future ahead for Norfolk Southern. I continue to be encouraged by my engagements with all of our team members and their commitment to serving our customers. As we approach our December 6 Investor Day, we are eager to share a more detailed view of our long-term strategy for value creation. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Yes, certainly, we see some potential headwinds in some of our markets moving into the fourth quarter, specifically energy, as you called out. And I'll let Ed talk about the projected impact on the top line. Well, and also, Ed, talk about your outlook for fuel surcharge revenue. That's right. And as we price to the value of our product, the value of our product is improving. Jordan, as we noted, volume is a lag to service. We had seen a lot of improvement in our volume sequentially heading up to the potential work stoppage in mid-September. We're starting to see some improvements now. Ed? Chris, we are intently focused on continuing our service recovery. It is the value of our product. And as Ed noted, we price to the value of the product. And as our product value improves, we continue to see more volume and revenue opportunities for us. We're encouraged by the number of conductor trainees in our pipeline. Right now, it's about 950, which is, I think, pretty close to our high in 2022. And we are continuing to hire for some specific locations. As we've talked about, we have about 95 different true hiring locations. We're going to reassess our legacy assumptions on staffing, and we're not going to make any unilateral commitments on what we're going to do going forward. I will commit that we will be data-driven in our approach, and we're going to make decisions based on the long-term value creation, balancing service, cost control and growth. Cindy, you're thinking about some specific opportunities to add more flexibility. And it's also true that while storage revenue is elevated, the year-over-year comps are slowing down. Intermodal is clearly a growth driver for us going forward. Ed, why don't you talk about how we're going to continue to leverage that unique franchise strength? Jason, we're looking forward to sharing more of our long-term vision for value creation at our Investor Day in 6 weeks. And clearly, Intermodal is a key component of that. Well, I think you nailed them all. And then I think you should also add in this IPI issue where the short-haul business from the ports is being trucked. Despite that and despite the fact that our Intermodal volumes were down by 1% in the quarter, as Ed noted, our revenue ton miles in Intermodal were up 5%. There's absolutely no doubt. Our RTMs went up 5%. Then recall that we implemented the first phase of TOP|SPG at the very end of the second quarter. And then in the third quarter, our train speeds increased by 20%. And as Cindy noted, it applies the principles of PSR, and it's really focused on balance, simplicity and executability. Ed, some of the chassis issues in the past have been our own. Some have been our customers. Could you cover that, please? Well, I want to clear up a point. There's nothing that we're looking at that suggests a 400 to 500 basis point decline or worsening of our OR in the fourth quarter. We don't see that math. As I noted before, we're going to be more than happy to share our vision for long-term value creation at our Investor Day in about 6 weeks. Let me talk about the service. We improved our train speed by 20% in the third quarter, and our service metrics are better than what we had projected to the Service Transportation Board earlier this year. Our service metrics and our service product is at a level, as Ed described, that's allowing us to participate in some lucrative spot opportunities that we didn't anticipate. We could participate in a couple of months ago. We made a lot of improvement. What we're allowed to do now because of the health of our network is narrow our focus a little bit more on some specific areas in which we need to continue to improve our service price. That's our focus. It's job priority #1 on Norfolk Southern. Yes. Ari, we firmly believe that service and margin improvement support each other. And frankly, you saw that in the third quarter. The service improved. Our margin improved versus the second quarter. With respect to fourth quarter volumes, just note that normal seasonality would suggest generally about a 5% decline in volume in the fourth quarter relative to the third. So as our service continues to improve, we believe we're going to outperform normal seasonality on our volumes. And longer term, our commitment is to industry competitive margins with above market growth. Ed, you're talking to our customers every day, as am I, but you're certainly much closer to this. We thank you for joining our call, and we look forward to continuing these discussions at our December 6 Investor Day."

            "name": "Cynthia Sanborn",
            "content": "Good morning. Turning to Slide 5, our resolve to improve service levels is paying off. During the quarter, we executed a smooth rollout of the latest evolution of our PSR-based operating plan, TOP|SPG, and ended the quarter with network velocity more than 20% improved from where it was entering the quarter. As a result, the service recovery glide path we charted earlier this year for the STB is trending well ahead of schedule. We have more improvements to make with progress being fueled by staffing initiatives, TOP|SPG and disciplined field execution. We are gaining momentum and will continue to drive to enhance our customer service and create capacity. Slide 6 highlights where we are with staffing levels of our transportation workforce. Our pipeline of trainees remains robust, and we have reached the waypoint target of approximately 7,300 qualified T&E staff a month ahead of schedule. This was accomplished through our innovative approach to recruiting and reinforces the advantage we have to recruit a high-quality craft workforce that takes pride in moving the economy forward. As you heard from Alan, we are pleased to have reached tentative agreements in the quarter to keep that workforce among the highest paid in the nation. Slide 7 continues the discussion on service improvements we are making. Last quarter, we shared with you the decision to adjust a couple of our existing major terminals from flat switching to humping. Those shifts went smoothly and are paying dividends today. We are leveraging a similar number of crew starts as we had entering this year inside our yards and terminals and are now moving cars more fluidly through those facilities. As a result, the railcar fleet is moving faster through our terminals. We're operating at high levels of productivity and creating capacity within our switching resources to drive further growth and productivity. As I said last quarter, we will remain flexible to most optimally manage assets, control costs, serve our customers and do so safely. Moving to Slide 8. GTMs were flat year-over-year, coupled with crew starts that were up 1%, produced flat train length and weight. We are very focused on the implementation of TOP|SPG in the quarter and are now poised for growth on our train network. Active Locomotives were up for the fourth consecutive quarter in support of service recovery. And I am pleased to say that as we regain fluidity over the last couple of months, Active Locomotives are trending down on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. The skill of our mechanical workforce, coupled with our DC to AC modernization strategy, allowed us to deploy search fleet capacities to support service recovery at historic levels of reliability. As I've discussed, we're continuing the modernization program in support of reliability and capacity in the future. Lastly, this marked our fourth consecutive quarter of fuel efficiency gains, again, due in part to our fleet investments along with shutdown compliance initiatives, augmented with enhanced communications technology and many more efforts. Slide 9 hits on a pillar of our digital strategy, Empower the Workforce, which crosses our entire operations group. Through Empower the Workforce, we provide mobile, self-service capabilities to our field forces and enable them to better manage their work with modern mobile applications. They are no longer tied to fixed base reporting and can input and retrieve information when they need it in modern, user-friendly mobile applications. We have a mobility group of technology specialists that are responsible for providing consistent, consumer-grade mobile applications to our transportation, engineering and mechanical forces. Whether it's an application for reporting railcar pickups and set-offs, obtaining track authority or recording bridge inspections, we are providing information where and when our employees need it in order to better manage their workday. To wrap up, Slide 10 is a snapshot of our progress on operating safely. We've been aggressively hiring and have a strong focus on equipping our workforce with the training and tools to perform safely and efficiently. I want to thank our entire workforce for their focus on the job at hand throughout the very dynamic third quarter. I am pleased with our progress, but we'll never be satisfied until we reach zero accidents and injuries. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Ed. Yes. So in the short term, we obviously -- we do have some training opportunities to replenish our locomotive engineer ranks that we set back to conductors and allow us to step them up when we need to because it takes longer to train an engineer than it does a conductor. We'll also be enhancing our Go Team membership, the folks we're going to have in our Go Team group. It won't be a huge number of people, but that will also be a resiliency tactic that we'll take. And in the effort to improve our conductor availability through the downturns that we've had -- or through the challenges that we've had, we've qualified in a single segment because that's where they would stand to work. And now we need to qualify them on other segments, radiating out of that same supply point. So there's a number of actions that we'll take here to make sure we're fortified and ready to go into any upturn. Going through a downturn, we'll manage through these opportunities. And then as we come into an upturn, they'll be available to us. Well, I think we -- as you noted, I mean, the labor market is different than in the past, and our recruiting efforts are a little bit different than in the past. We know how long it takes to train and hire an employee, and we talk about having 95 different hiring groups that we have to manage that through. So I will say that we have to make sure we manage through downturns in such a way that we're in a good place to handle the upturns. That's how we're going to manage -- that's how we're going to grow long term. So we have levers such as attrition that can help us if we need it, but we also know that we have to be fortified in having a good hiring pipeline or a line of sight to that hiring pipeline so that we can manage the upturn. We don't just want to manage one side. Thanks for the question, Ben. I think hiring is a critical part of our service improvement efforts. We established a target that we shared with the STB of about, call it, 7,550 qualified T&Es by mid-2023. And we are ahead of that target as we head into November. And when we think of that number, just so we're really clear, and that top line number, we have to recognize there's 95 hiring locations underneath it. So while that number is important that we also have to have folks in the right critical locations.  I would say another lever that we pulled and we've talked about it in prior quarters is our TOP|SPG operating plan initiative that is in place. It's really helped us, I think, to have a more executable plan. And it's boiled down into a comprehensive review of connection standards, our distributed power playbook, and help us to recalibrate train meet. So as we get closer and closer on time, that fluidity continues to -- allow us to be more fluid, I guess, is the best way to put it. So I would say those 2 things are the biggest levers that we've had. And I would add on the SPG piece, Ken, that it's a consideration, refinement, simplification, all of those types of things. Again, it's a very PSR-oriented to making sure we get asset turns as we need to and be able to create fluidity that not only helps us from a cost perspective, but it's exactly what our customers need. So there's continuing work going on there as well."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Mark George",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. Starting on Slide 15, Ed walked you through the drivers of our 17% growth in revenues. You'll see operating expense of $355 million or 21%, and that includes a $117 million true-up to our compensation accruals based on the terms of the tentative labor agreements. This resulted in the operating ratio increasing year-over-year to 62% for the quarter. Operating income grew $136 million or 12% despite that headwind. EPS was up 34% or $1.04, thanks to strong earnings growth coupled with share shrink, but also from an adjustment to income tax expense related to Pennsylvania's rate reduction that was enacted in the quarter. You will recall we did signal this in our second quarter earnings release. Let's take a moment on Slide 16 to drill specifically into the labor cost adjustments that we reported. As I mentioned, we increased our wage accruals by $117 million in Q3, with $88 million of that amount related to past periods and $29 million related specifically to Q3 2022. The columns represent the period in which the adjustments relate. These amounts, including the impact of the bonus payments, represents more than 2x what we had been assuming. We anticipate another $23 million of incremental expense in Q4, bringing the total amount for the year to $140 million, which represents as much as 110 basis points of headwind to the full year OR from what we had been expecting. It is also worth noting that there is an additional $50 million of incremental label cost that will be capitalized into property additions this year. Now let's take a moment on Slide 17 to reconcile the drivers of OR and EPS since there are some movers in the quarter. The impact of the $88 million out-of-period wage accruals in Q3 was meaningful, representing a 270 basis point headwind to the OR and $0.28 on EPS. We did have a favorable legal settlement in the quarter that provided a $0.05 of help to EPS and 40 basis points of help on the OR. The favorable state tax rate change caused a $136 million reduction to our deferred tax liability, which equates to $0.58 of EPS lift. That leaves a core improvement in EPS of $0.69 and improvement in the operating ratio of 50 basis points, which, I'll point out, includes the absorption of 90 basis points of headwind from the $29 million in-period incremental labor cost adjustments that I spoke to on the prior slide. Moving now to Slide 18 and the changes in operating expenses of $355 million, which represents a 21% increase year-over-year. Fuel was the primary driver, up $175 million or 84% due almost entirely to price. But as Cindy noted, we did enjoy benefits associated with a 3% fuel efficiency improvement. Compensation and benefits, it is up 21% due to the elevated labor costs associated with the tentative agreements. Moving on, you'll see purchase services and rents collectively up $52 million. Inflation and slower network speed continue to drive up these 2 cost categories. Materials, claims and other expenses were down 4% or $7 million year-over-year, helped in part from the $15 million favorable legal settlement in the other category. Turning now to Slide 19 for the P&L below operating income. Other income was an expense of $2 million in the quarter, $16 million unfavorable compared to last year driven by losses on the company-owned life insurance investments due to negative equity and fixed income market returns in the quarter. While pretax income was up 11% in the quarter, net income was up 27% due to the 12.4% effective tax rate in the quarter, thanks to the benefit recorded from the state tax rate change. EPS was up 34%, greater than net income growth supported by our capital allocation strategy that includes share repurchases. Shifting to Slide 20. Cash from operations through 9 months is up $111 million while property additions were higher by $257 million. As we discussed last quarter, I expect capital expenditures to be at the high end of the $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion guidance range, with materials inflation and now incremental wage inflation creating meaningful headwinds. Free cash flow conversion stands at 86%. Shareholder distributions have been strong this year with a 15% increase to our dividends plus continuing solid share repurchase activity. And with that, I'll hand back over to Alan. Yes. Clearly, we're suffering incremental service costs related to where we are in our service product today. Honestly, it's at least $40 million a quarter, and those things are -- they show up in comp and ben, it shows up in purchase services. And as things improve going into 2023, we'll start to see relief in the P&L there. Yes. Scott, clearly, there is some storage revenue that helps mitigate that, the accessorial revenues that we talked to. And certainly, as service recovers, we'll start to see those accessorial revenues come down. Ed, I don't know if you want to talk about the pacing in which you see that... Well, we're actually putting together the budget for '23 now, and there's a lot of big assumptions that have to be made. So we'll be back to you with '23 guidance. Certainly, that's our goal at this point in time. We've got to get inflation under control. We've got to try to get some offsets on the top line from that. How much volume we can get is going to be a big lever as well. So we'll come back to you with the '23 numbers. Pretty modest at the total level in any given quarter. It's kind of within that range that we guide. I don't think it's going to adjust the range, the effective tax rate that we guide. Thanks, Amit. So yes, the guidance that we gave of the 62% for the full year includes the retroactive wage adjustment as well as the ongoing wage adjustments. So basically, the $140 million, it is the all-in including the items that we called out this quarter. So it's -- that's kind of where it comes to. I'm not getting to your 63% number implied for Q4. So if you do the all-in, I think it's largely in line with -- in Q4, it should be largely in line with the full year number. Correct. Correct. Yes. We were -- when you ignore the $88 million and you look at our restated Q3, and then you can look at Q4 inclusive of the $23 million that we told you about, it's obviously -- it's a much lower number than the 62%. Bascome, this is Mark. So the -- if you look at our comp per employee in the third quarter and you take out the retro wage adjustments, it's -- you'll get to about $34,250 for the quarter. And I would probably guide you all to think that same number would apply in Q4 because that is kind of the new number. It's baking in this 7% higher wage that took effect in July. So that would kind of go sideways there in Q4.  And then as you think about 2023, what we typically see in the first quarter is a resetting of the payroll taxes, and so that will knock it up a couple of points in conjunction with assumptions for higher bonus payout as well. So you'd probably see a point or 2 increase in that number going into the first half of next year. And then, of course, when you get to the back half of next year, you have another wage jump that comes from the contractual agreement numbers that you would have seen published. So that will probably go up another few points in the back half. So that's probably the way I would look at it. It probably wants to go up more than a few points, but we will have some service cost relief as service improves and some of those costs that we are incurring related to overtime drayage -- not drayage, sorry, overtime and training costs, et cetera, start to subside. So I would model it out that way. A point or 2 elevation here from that level in the first half and then another, call it, a few points in the second half. Yes. Look, I think the story here, it's mainly a top line story. We see the expenses largely in line with the third quarter when you exclude the labor adjustments that were historic -- I'm sorry, that were retroactively made as well as the favorable legal item that we called out. So really, what we're talking about is more of a top line story. So Ed talked a little bit about the RPU assumptions that we made on energy pricing. Hopefully, that's conservative and that comes back, but it's really less about cost and more about just a little bit of deceleration. Yes. That's -- for the time being, that's where the implied guidance is on the overall tax rate. That includes, obviously, the federal rate, which is at 21%, but it also includes a multitude of states, not just Pennsylvania where we operate. That brings it up a little bit higher. And yes, Pennsylvania's rate goes down a little bit, but we still got all the other state tax where we pay. Yes. Ken, I'll start on the labor costs. I mean, the PEB recommendations were obviously higher than we expected. We laid out very transparently for you the details of how those increases were allocated, including those retro adjustments, and we advised throughout all that we were accruing in line with historical increases and -- which is what we had on the table with labor prior to the PEB. So the adjustment is really just the math. Go ahead. Actually, Ken, thanks for the opportunity to clear that up a little bit. That was another thing that's driving the fourth quarter operating ratio in the implied math, too, is fuel surcharge. The net fuel surcharge was actually a benefit here in the third quarter. And based on where fuel prices are going, it spins to become a headwind again just like it was in the first half. I did not. I did not. It's going to be -- well, we have to see where the prices are going. We've just seen a dramatic spike just in the past 1.5 weeks, which initially we weren't expecting to see, and we thought that maybe we would not have the headwinds that we're facing. But right now, it's -- fuel has moved up. And because of the lag effect, we'll end up having an OR headwind here in the fourth quarter. It won't catch up until the first quarter.  So again, in periods of a rising fuel, because of the lag, we end up with OR headwinds. When fuel stabilizes and starts to go down, you tend to get fuel tailwinds. So in Q3, we ended up having a reprieve on that and we got some OR help from the fuel surcharge program, but it looks like it's going to spin again to a headwind here in the fourth quarter. Just like we had in the first half. Yes. We didn't provide the split of impact between the bonus and the base wage, Cherilyn, but we can -- let me look at providing that to you offline. But I do think that we are -- the overall impact that we've got from the $88 million that relates to 2020, 2021 and the first half of 2022 now becomes something that we have to absorb over time and mitigate with not just pricing, but with productivity and efficiency in the go forward. And that's our goal on how we offset that. Well, Jeff, I mean, it will -- look, the weighted average interest rate in our overall debt portfolio today is below current rates. So with every new debt issuance that we have, it will be at higher rates than the average. It will start -- so as old maturities roll off, new ones come on. It's going to -- interest will start to go up a little bit. We're not so worried, frankly, because we do have a portfolio of debt that exceeds $14 billion or so. So I don't think it's going to be a meaningful drag on us going forward. And we haven't really seen the interest rates at levels yet that caused me much concern. Correct."

            "name": "Claude Elkins",
            "content": "Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. All right. Turning to Slide 12, let's review our results for the third quarter where we achieved record quarterly results in several categories. Total revenue improved 17% year-over-year to $3.3 billion as fuel surcharge and favorable price conditions more than offset a 2% decline in volume. Most notably, revenue per unit, excluding fuel, increased significantly and established a new record in both our merchandise sector and for Norfolk Southern overall. These results reflect a strong price environment and the deliberate efforts of our commercial teams to pursue these opportunities. Before I comment on our individual business groups, I would like to address the impact of our collaborative mitigation efforts in response to a potential labor disruption this quarter. Coming out of August, we were encouraged by the upward trajectory of our volumes. As we move through September and concerns of a labor disruption grew stronger, we acted to guard against the potentially negative impacts on our customers and the communities that we serve in keeping with our no-surprises approach to customer engagement. We spoke with our customers early on about our plans to limit the risk of stranded, hazardous materials and security-sensitive freight like Intermodal by restricting service for these products. We estimate that this approach accounted for roughly 40% to 50% of the volume decline in the quarter or $20 million to $25 million in lost revenue, mostly in our Intermodal markets. Our goal as a customer-centric organization is to gain credibility as a transparent and trusted service provider so that our customers integrate NS further into their supply chain needs. We can only achieve that goal with proactive communication and planning that minimizes disruption. Our customers told us that they appreciated our industry-leading communication, and we're confident that our approach will deliver long-term value for Norfolk Southern, for our shareholders and for our customers. We are pleased that a labor disruption was avoided, and we remain committed to providing quality service that our customers can rely on for their supply chain needs. Now continuing to our business group's performance in the third quarter. Merchandise volume was down 2% year-over-year, driven by declines in our steel and ethanol markets that were partially offset by higher demand for sand and aggregates. With respect to steel, service challenges related to equipment availability negatively impacted our ability to meet demand. Ethanol shipments were also down as consumption of gasoline declined in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. On the positive side, shipments of sand increased more than 43% year-over-year on higher demand related to the strong market for natural gas production. Aggregates were also up due to higher levels of construction activity. Merchandise revenue improved 13% year-over-year to a quarterly record of $1.9 billion on higher revenue from fuel surcharges and from price gains. Moving on to Intermodal, revenue improved 16% for the quarter despite a 5% decline in volume. Revenue per unit reached a record level this quarter, driven by higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price. Intermodal shipments continue to be pressured by supply chain congestion and equipment shortages. This temporary shift was felt most strongly in our domestic business, where volume was down 4% year-over-year. International Intermodal volume declines were driven primarily by car supply and private chassis shortages, both reducing customer demand for inland point Intermodal and limiting our ability to satisfy that demand. Lastly, coal market conditions were again favorable for us this quarter, enabling us to deliver 43% growth in revenue for the franchise from volume growth, price improvement and fuel surcharge revenue. Volume growth was led by shipments of utility coal that were up on higher demand spurred by high natural gas prices. Export coal volume was also up due to some carryover from the second quarter and generally improved coal supply. Coal volume growth was partially offset by year-over-year declines in coke shipments due to facility closures. Overall, our performance for the quarter reflects continued progress on our strategic plan to drive value for our customers and shareholders while simultaneously working to address pressures related to volume. Moving to our outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 13. Our service is trending in the right direction, and we expect that to be a tailwind to volumes in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we're optimistic that consumer spending and manufacturing activity will support volumes for the remainder of the year. Those expectations are somewhat muted in light of looming recession risks and tightening financial conditions that are pressuring economic activity, especially in interest rate-sensitive markets like housing. Volume in our merchandise segment will benefit from growing activity in automotive markets, with U.S. light vehicle production currently expected to increase in the fourth quarter of '22 compared to 2021. Also contributing to growth will be new opportunities to move corn and other grains. Much of the Southeast corn crop is down significantly versus last year. This is likely to increase demand for Midwest-originated corn by rail. Since emerging from the pandemic low, manufacturing activity has been increasing at a steady rate. But we're beginning to see that growth level off with forecasts calling for growth to moderate to 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. As the Fed tightens interest rates, mortgage rates have increased to levels that are cooling the housing market. This reduced demand affects several of our merchandise as well as Intermodal markets. Overall, we expect merchandise volumes to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter with some upside potential as service continues to recover. Within Intermodal, our expectation is for volume to be down slightly year-over-year with opportunities from easing terminal congestion and equipment supply being offset by expectations for weaker demand and a softening truck market. On the domestic side, national Intermodal volume trends are showing signs of slowing, suggesting weaker peak season demand. However, consumer spending, which has historically been a big driver of this market, is currently forecasted to hold steady through the end of the year, providing underlying support for our domestic Intermodal volumes. We continue to see volume opportunity for domestic Intermodal as our service recovers, and we expect customers to shift loads from the highway to rail as we intently focus on improving domestic Intermodal service. International Intermodal will continue to struggle with congestion and equipment supply, and we expect Intermodal storage charges to remain elevated so long as those issues continue. When supply chain congestion does ease, we expect to deliver additional international volume for customers as Inland Point Intermodal, or IPI, becomes more attractive. And finally, our expectations for coal are that volumes will continue to improve year-over-year in the fourth quarter driven by strength in the markets for both utility and export coal. EIA's latest forecast is for natural gas prices to remain elevated through the end of the year. This will increase demand for coal as a competitive alternative. Seaborne coal prices are expected to remain at relatively high levels through the end of the year, indicating continued demand for U.S. coals abroad. We also anticipate increased coal supply in the fourth quarter, primarily for export, which will create opportunities for coal volume growth. To summarize, we have a number of uncertain market signals in front of us right now, but our focus remains on impacting the things that we can control to deliver quality service to our customers and increase value for our shareholders. Overall, we have a fantastic portfolio of customers. And as always, I want to take this opportunity to thank them for their business and for their ongoing partnership. I will now turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results. Sure. We've seen how seaborne coal prices have fallen, but they have done a new floor and they remain at relatively high levels. On the utility side, we expect there's still a lot of demand out there for that. You factor in what's going on in Europe, and we feel pretty good on the utility side on the steam coal side. The met coal side is a different story. There's a lot of cross currents and headwinds, particularly from China that we see. Steel production in China remains muted, and the housing situation there, which consumes a tremendous amount of steel in that market, remains off kilter, so to speak. So we are more guarded about the met coal side of the business. Does that answer your question? Yes. Fuel surcharge, when we look at the forward curves and we know we have a 2-month lag, we are expecting that there is a headwind. That's when we come into play in the fourth quarter. Yes, we -- you've heard us talk about this before. We price to the value of our service in the market, and we're very diligent about that. We are confident with our commercial teams that we're identifying places we're adding value. We had -- we'll see RPU less fuel records in merchandise and overall this quarter, and we've had almost 6 years of revenue improvement or RPU improvement in Intermodal and almost 7 years on our merchandise side. That's through a lot of up and down cycles, freight recessions and freight boom times, and we've consistently been able to deliver. So we're very focused on that side of the business. Yes. Yes. And I'll repeat what I said earlier, we felt like we had a lot of momentum going into that strike or the potential for a strike. And we've talked previously about the IPI issue at our railroad, and that continues to impact volumes in the third quarter as our international customer portfolio made decisions to do more port-to-port services, specifically on short-haul lanes that are typically sensitive to spot truck prices. If you look, our revenue per tonne models in Intermodal declined 1% on a 5% volume decline, and that really confirms to us that the headwinds are highest in these very short haul lanes. We see some factors that have driven these IPI decisions like ocean freight rates. They're really reverting to a more normal course. We have a very broad base of international customers. And when you look back pre-pandemic, the IPI business, the Inland Port International, played a significant role in our customer supply chain. And as inland congestion eases, those supply chains are going to return to normal, and we think our customers -- well, we know our customers are telling us that they expect to increase their use of IPI as that happens. We talk to our customers every day, and we are very encouraged by the feedback we're getting. We have customers coming to us that are recognizing the change in our service product for the better and are looking to put additional volume on the railroad. As one example, I would cite the ag markets where we've been able to really participate in some of the spot markets that previously we weren't able to because we have new capacity because of the improvements in our service product. That's just an example. Yes. No, earlier this year, we thought that the supply chains would unlock faster, and we would start to see that storage number come off as customers got more fluid into warehousing on the street. Frankly, that hadn't happened. If you look at many of our hinterland markets, particularly deeper into the Midwest, we continue to see the same issues that we saw earlier. So the storage number continues to remain elevated, and we expect right now that it's going to continue to be elevated in the fourth quarter. I think next year, we're hopeful that supply chains will unlock, and there'll be more opportunities move volume instead of storage. Absolutely. We've lapped it, yes. Yes. We think we have the most powerful franchise in North America when it comes to Intermodal. We're located square in the heart of the U.S. consumer markets as well as manufacturing with access -- great access to all the East Coast ports and all the Western railroads. We talk to our customers every day. They are investing for growth. Our channel partners are priming themselves to grow with Norfolk Southern as our service improves. And as our service improves, we're creating additional opportunities for them to satisfy supply chain issues that are still manifesting themselves out there. We know that there's a lot of cross current and a lot of, what I would call, mixed signals out there in the macroeconomic environment. We're encouraged by what's going on in manufacturing, which had a great report in September. Future orders appear to be somewhat of a drag. It's undeniable that with interest rates going up and inflation staying stubbornly high, there is some demand destruction out there. But we're confident that for our customers and for our channel partners, Intermodal is still going to be a great way for them to save money going forward in a very inflationary environment as they take freight off the highway and put it on the railroad. Sure. On the revenue side, on the price side, like I said, we've been talking to our customers every single day about where price is going. We've got a great track record of being able to deliver price as we increase the value that we're delivering to our customers, and they can transfer that on. Our service is improving in -- and I will tell you that our customers are confident that as our service improves, they can put additional volume against the railroad. And look, that helps save money for our customers in the long term. We price to the value of the market. We know that there's a lot of noise around the spot market, which goes up and goes down. We stay focused on the long-term trajectory of contract rates, and our customers understand that. Can you repeat your volume question again? Yes. I think the macro economy is going to tell us where we're all going in terms of economic trajectory. We have been able to price and continue to be successful in pricing because of the value that we're delivering to those customers. I think a recession, if there is one coming, or a downturn, that's going to dictate how much volume we can put against the railroad and how much is available to put against the railroad. But we're confident that we're going to be able to do that. On the volume side, I will tell you that we have a strong portfolio of customers that are, like I said, they're -- we stick to the script here, they're investing to grow. We see that happening, and I think as the IPI situation reverts to normal in terms of conditions that allow that, our customers are going to find value in that market as well. Yes. And in fact, we're seeing, on the bulk side of our network, additional throughput capacity that we're putting up against customers right now in the spot markets. That's indicative of the opportunities that are out there. I think I noted in the third quarter, we had cycle times on equipment that still inhibited our ability to serve everyone that wanted to be served. And so as our fluid improves, we're going to be able to put additional capacity against them, too. Our customers are telling us that there's additional volume out there that they want to put on the railroad. If you look at most of the manufacturing sectors, there's still a lot of unfilled orders out there that they're working through. Even in a -- what I would call a declining demand environment, there's still a lot of back orders. So we're confident about our ability to continue to grow volumes and service improvement. Sure. And we've been successful in getting a portion of our order online of our chassis, and we're seeing that help in terms of fluidity. I will tell you on the international side, there still remains a lot of shortages out there mostly because I believe those units are deployed on the street or at a warehouse. And it continues to be an issue on the international side of the business, particularly in these hinterland markets, as we talked about earlier. We deployed a number of countermeasures which includes some temporary storage facilities that we've been able to open to help accommodate our customers. But we will continue to look for additional fluidity going forward, particularly on the private chassis side. On the international Intermodal side, it is having an impact, and that's not a chassis or an asset that we control per se. For our chassis on our equipment, we've seen some relief both in terms of the fluidity side, but mostly because we've been able to add some chassis. And our core pricing story remains absolutely intact. Yes. Overall sentiment from our customers is that things have improved, and we're continuing to move in the right direction. We're hearing that every day from a range with customers.  One thing that we're certain about is as we increase train speed and reduce the amount of dwell, we're going to have more capacity to deliver value to our customers, and we're hearing that from them. I'll use the ag markets as an example on the bulk side where we are seeing customers come to us and come to us with spot opportunities that we probably wouldn't have been able to execute on in prior periods, but we're able to now. And so we're diligently looking at these opportunities, and it really means looking at opportunities where we can be successful and add value. There are several of those on the bulk side, and we'll continue to look for them."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Nichols. You may now begin.\nLuke Nichols: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today\u2019s call, we will make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used today to comparable GAAP measures. A full transcript and download will be posted after the call. Turning to Slide 3. It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw.\nAlan Shaw: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Norfolk Southern\u2019s second quarter 2022 earnings call. I am joined today by Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. In the second quarter, we stabilized service levels, expanded our pipeline of conductor trainees and launched the next evolution of our operating plan, top SPG with our signature no surprises approach. Service is not yet where we want it to be, but I am encouraged by our progress and inspired by the commitment and shared vision of our talented team. I am privileged to spend a lot of time in the field with our hard-working craft employees and operations supervisors. I see firsthand and sincerely appreciate their daily dedication to serving our customers. We are eager to reach an agreement that keeps our people among the highest paid craft workers of any industry and recognizes their essential service to our customers, our company and the U.S. economy. Moving to Slide 4. Thanks to the combined efforts of our team. We delivered solid financial performance in the second quarter with record revenue and earnings per share. Revenue increased 16% as a 20% increase in revenue per unit more than offset a 3% volume decline. Expenses grew by 21% year-over-year due primarily to higher fuel prices. Operating ratio was up 260 basis points versus last year\u2019s quarterly record. Comparisons were adversely impacted by the absence of a large property sale we called out last year as well as fuel price headwinds. Despite these headwinds, EPS improved by 5%, $3.45 per share, a second quarter record. The steps we are taking today to restore service and implement our new top SPG operating plan are making Norfolk Southern a more customer-centric operations-driven organization that will deliver long-term value for our customers and shareholders. Our top SPG operating plan is part of the equation for improving service. We named this iteration, SPG because it creates a platform for consistent service, continuous productivity improvement and smart growth for our customers, Norfolk Southern and our shareholders. There is no doubt we have an enviable value proposition to compete in today\u2019s logistics marketplace and where markets are headed. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, I\u2019ll share a few insights on how we will unlock that value. I\u2019ll now turn the discussion to Cindy for an update on operations and a detailed look at how our company is aligned around restoring service and creating a safe efficient and reliable product that meets our customers\u2019 needs and supports their growth. Cindy?\nCindy Sanborn: Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. In the second quarter, our team continued to face a challenging operational environment as we work to stabilize service levels, drive productivity gains and increase our T&E workforce. Crew starts were down 3% in the quarter and volumes also down 3% and flat gross ton miles. Similar to what I discussed last quarter, we continue to make gains in crew productivity. However, we would have preferred to run additional crew starts that were limited by staffing challenges. As we promote more of the conductor trainees currently in our pipeline, we will see additional highly productive crew starts that will support more volume and further increases to the record train size we have produced this year. Despite the ongoing decision to keep a portion of our surge locomotive fleet active to promote service recovery, we produced another all-time record for fuel efficiency, driven by our multipronged strategy to reduce consumption. This strategy includes the DC to AC conversion program, data-driven solutions to idle reduction and small but powerful investments in friction modification technology, just to name a few components. We expect to drive even better results as we execute on that strategy and enhance the fluidity of our network. Moving on to Slide 7. Train speed and terminal dwell remained challenged in the quarter, but we are really encouraged by the improvements we\u2019re seeing here in July. We are pulling every lever to restore service levels and delivering for our customers as our top priority. We have a long way to go, and our workforce is dedicated to getting the job done. I\u2019m going to speak over the next few slides about the plan for accomplishing this. Turning to Slide 8, which is an update on our T&E staffing progress. We\u2019re maintaining a very strong pipeline of conductor trainees. And even more encouraging, as you can see that in July, we\u2019re really making progress on getting those employees qualified more than offsetting ongoing attrition. And the impact on our network is being felt. We are continuing to start classes weekly and expect this momentum to continue. I will note that the labor market is still very challenging, particularly in certain locations. We\u2019re taking advantage of every option to get folks where we need them, including go teams, transfers, sign-on and attendance bonuses, retirement deferral and referral incentives and more. We\u2019re also examining how we can adjust our operation to best align resources with demand. An example of this is that our two of our major terminals, Macon and Bellevue, recall that both of these former hump yards were converted to flat switching in 2020. Switching demand has increased in both locations since that time, and we have begun the process of resuming conventional hump operations at both facilities to provide the capacity we need to most expeditiously and efficiently serve our customers with negligible upstart our ongoing costs. Having the ability to return to humping operations as demand dictates is an example of resiliency we now have in our network and a lever we can pull to improve service. We are excited about the talented individuals joining us to help move the economy, and we are confident we will continue to make progress on our staffing priorities. On Slide 9, I am very happy with the progress we\u2019ve made on our safety initiatives and translating that to fewer injuries and train accidents. Especially with large numbers of new employees starting out in the field, this reinforces that all of our employees, tenured and new alike are laser-focused on running a safe operation, providing a critical foundation for the future. Now moving to Slide 10. I\u2019ll talk about the progress we\u2019ve made with rolling out the latest evolution of our operating plan, TOP|SPG. As a reminder, TOP is in an acronym building on the legacy of Thoroughbred Operating Plans. And as Alan noted earlier, SPG signifies the equal prominence of the three pillars: service, productivity and growth. Late in the second quarter, we launched the plan, which was focused on creating more balance and executability within our network. We looked at how our business, rate flows and train composition have changed over the last few years and then couple that with a deep dive on how each of our terminals and routes can best handle the business. We took a fresh approach to balancing the number of crews and locomotives flowing across our core routes. I\u2019ve spoken before about the benefits of distributed power locomotives on longer trains, and as we\u2019re creating longer trains, when we built the plan for when and where we apply distributed power. We looked at prior and prospective train consolidations and weighed what it would take to continue launching and landing longer trains both from a time and resource perspective and made holistic decisions about what is best for service, productivity and growth. As we go forward, we will increase the service frequency in several of our core intermodal markets while simplifying the role of each terminal, particularly where we have more than one terminal in each market. This will allow us to drive even more value from our intermodal franchise and will promote executability and growth. Our bulk strategy has a long-term focus. In recent years, we\u2019ve made solid progress on train consolidations and to a lesser degree, blending with other traffic types. Now we\u2019re putting added emphasis on identifying how we can take the remaining unit train network and add an incremental 10, 20 or 30 cars to each train. Moving to Slide 11, to discuss a couple of metrics that indicate the early progress we\u2019re seeing. First, our arrival train performance has seen substantial improvements here in July. With TOP|SPG, we adjusted 90% of our train schedules to meet the service and executability standards I described on the previous slide, and this improvement is very encouraging. As I showed on the network update, our velocity has been improving in July, and this train performance trend reinforces that velocity is translating into trains hitting their slots at an increasing rate. One of the several reasons for this is the strong increase in the number of distributed powertrains we run each day. Team built a solid plan and is now executing it, and this is a component that will directly impact each aspect of SPG as DP trains run smoother, creating service resiliency. They are also more fuel-efficient than shorter trains driving productivity, and they give us a capacity dividend driving growth. We have a long way to go to fully restoring service. These are just a few examples of where we are and further improvements will continue to be driven by three primary functions: staffing initiatives paying off; the success of top SPG; and a solid execution by our field workforce. Thank you. And I will now turn it over to Ed.\nEd Elkins: Thanks, Cindy, and good morning, everybody. Let\u2019s go to Slide 13. Our results for the quarter reflect strong revenue growth amidst still recovering volume from network challenges. We achieved record revenue for the quarter of $3.3 billion. That\u2019s up 16% year-over-year on higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price improvement. Revenue per unit was also a record and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, saw a double-digit increase from the same period last year. This revenue growth more than offset a 3% decline in overall volume, resulting from service disruptions. Within merchandise, overall volume was down slightly as declines in steel and construction-related shipments from strained network fluidity were partially offset by gains in sand, driven by increased drilling activity in response to rising demand for natural gas, also helping to offset those declines with notable growth in our grain shipments due to rising export demand. Merchandise revenue and revenue per unit were records for the quarter on higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price gains. Now turning to Intermodal. Revenue, revenue per unit and revenue per unit excluding fuel were all up double digits in the second quarter with higher fuel surcharge price gains and higher revenue from storage fees more than offsetting the impact of those volume declines. International intermodal shipments were markedly down year-over-year, driven largely by a shift in our customer base away from Inland Point Intermodal or IPI, in response to ongoing supply chain challenges. Declines in international intermodal were partially offset by modest improvement in domestic shipments year-over-year due to sustained consumer demand. Revenue growth was strongest in our coal business unit this quarter with total revenue, revenue per unit and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, all increasing well north of 30% year-over-year in the second quarter. This growth was propelled by price gains, particularly in our export coal markets. Coal volume in the second quarter was negatively impacted by limited supply and facility closures. Overall, our performance for the quarter reflects an improving revenue portfolio that will serve as a platform for long-term sustainable revenue growth into the future. Moving to our outlook on Slide 14. We\u2019re cautiously optimistic that the demand environment will remain strong through the end of 2022, providing opportunities for us to expand our volume and revenue base as fluidity is restored to the network. Despite recession risks amid record inflation and aggressive monetary policy, most economists are still forecasting GDP growth above 1% for both the third and the fourth quarters of 2022. In addition, we are beginning to see gas prices moderate nationally and unemployment remains very low, both of which bode well for consumption, which drives many of our markets. Specific to our merchandise segment, we expect volume strength in the second half to be led by our automotive markets where U.S. light vehicle production is currently forecasted to be up 18% over the production levels experienced in the last six months of 2021. Looking at commodity prices, we see mixed signals for many of our markets, but overall prices remain elevated from those pre-pandemic levels. Manufacturing activity has been a tailwind throughout 2022. However, the outlook is less certain for the remainder of the year. Lastly, we anticipate overall year-over-year improvements in most of our merchandise markets as our service levels recover. Within intermodal, we expect sequential volume improvement in both our domestic and international lines of business in the second half of 2022 as demand remains strong and service improvements will allow for greater throughput on our network. Backlog demand for container movements will provide opportunities for growth in our domestic franchise. In addition, new opportunities for domestic volume growth exists in the truck and logistics market, and we\u2019re laser-focused on driving highway to rail conversions to expand our market share. With respect to our international lines of business, increasing import activity is providing growth opportunities, although lower IPI is a limiting factor. We\u2019re also keeping a close eye on truck pricing as rates have fallen, albeit from historically very high levels. Finally, our outlook for coal is positive for the second half of the year with growth in our utility and export markets driven by energy demand. Recent declines in export met coal prices suggest we\u2019re not likely to realize the same upside potential in RPU that we achieved in the second quarter. Market conditions support year-over-year volume growth in these markets with upside potential driven by coal supply and network fluidity. While we recognize that uncertainty persists in the macroeconomic environment, we continue to see opportunities for volume growth in the markets that we serve. As part of our execution of our top SPG operating plan, we are committed to capturing these opportunities, expanding our business by delivering the quality service that our customers need to thrive. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results.\nMark George: Thank you, Ed. As Alan noted, our EPS grew $0.17 or 5% in the quarter, while the operating ratio contracted 260 basis points. On Slide 16, we reconcile some of the drivers for both of those changes. Recall the $55 million discrete property sale in Q2 of 2021 that impacted our OR by 200 basis points. Also in Q2 last year, there was a state tax law change that impacted EPS by $0.09 and had a 220 basis point favorable impact on last year\u2019s Q2 effective tax rate. This year, we have some outsized impacts and claims related to accrual adjustments, but also an accrual related to a legal case. All totaling $16 million, and that creates a 50 basis point headwind on our operating ratio and a nickel drag on EPS. That leaves a modest 10 basis point increase in core OR that was heavily impacted by 140 basis points of headwind from fuel. Shifting to the overall reported highlights on Slide 17. As Ed discussed, revenues grew 16% despite the 3% volume decline, thanks to strong RPU again this quarter. Operating expenses were up 21%, driven in large part by fuel, operating income was up 9%, but net income was flat due to tax rate compares and non-operating headwinds from company-owned life insurance investments. Despite the flat net income, EPS was up 5% from the lower share count. Drilling into the operating expense components on Slide 18, nearly two-thirds of the increase in operating expense is from higher fuel cost. Increase of material and other of $75 million is affected by the $55 million property gain we called out last year and the $16 million of items that I spoke about earlier. Purchased services and rents are impacted by both inflation and our current service situation. The slower network speed is a critical driver impacting the higher equipment rents, while purchased services captures higher rates for our third-party lift contractors as well as our IT contractors. Compensation and benefits is a tailwind with lower incentive accruals, offsetting the cost of trainees as well as general wage inflation. As you can imagine, the current labor negotiations are likely to play out here in the second half and may result in incremental headwinds to comp the benefits that we are unable to estimate at this time. Shifting to the P&L below operating income on Slide 19, other income is actually an expense in the quarter of $14 million, driven by losses on our company-owned life insurance investment. I know this line item is difficult to estimate and model, so let me provide some clarity to help you at least directionally. This account is a collection of non-operating income and expense items that typically nets to about $15 million of income per quarter. On top of this, we have returns on our company-owned life insurance investments. A portion of this asset, roughly $525 million is invested in a traditional blend of equities and fixed income and we mark-to-market each quarter. These are non-cash gains or losses. And it\u2019s important to note that neither the gains nor losses from these investments are subject to income tax. As such the effective tax rate in this quarter was a bit higher than usual at 24.7%. While net income was exactly flat earnings per share increased 5% due to the accumulation of our share repurchases in the past year. Going back to income tax for a moment, I would also like to highlight that Pennsylvania enacted legislation in July to reduce their state tax rate. And the accounting for that change will have a roughly $135 million one-time non-cash favorable adjustment the income tax expense in the third quarter. Now turning to free cash flow on Slide 20, we\u2019ve generated nearly $1.2 billion in free cash flow through six months with property additions trending higher than last year with strong progress being made on both our rail replacement program and our DC-to-AC locomotive conversion program. Whereas Cindy touched upon, we gain operational benefits as well as improved fuel efficiency. Incremental inflation is also having an impact on property additions so I would expect CapEx to be at the high-end of our $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion guidance range. Shareholder distributions are up and you\u2019ll observe here the 19% higher dividend payments through six months on top of continued strong share repurchase activity. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Alan.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you, Mark. I\u2019ll conclude with an update on our outlook for the year and brief thoughts on our strategy for long-term value creation. You\u2019ll see, on Slide 21, our confidence in the revenue outlook has improved the 12% plus year-over-year growth underpinning the improved revenue outlook, a strong first half performance, continued strength in fuel surcharge revenues and better sequential volumes associated with service improvement in the back half of 2022. Our first half operating ratio was the result of a delayed service recovery and elevated fuel prices. These headwinds will translate into a deterioration in full-year operating ratio. Although we expect the back half to improve from the first half as our service recovery ramps, allowing us to absorb more and reduce costs associated with our service challenges. As Mark mentioned, we do not know if there will be any incremental costs recorded in 2022 associated with a resolution in our labor negotiations. Turning to Slide 22, although our focus today is on restoring service in the short-term, our vision extends much further. As I complete my first 100 days as CEO, I\u2019d like to share some insights on our future. The work we are doing now to improve service is only the beginning. We\u2019re going to build long-term resiliency into our network, creating sustainable value for our customers. Norfolk Southern has a franchise that is built for growth. Being customer centric and operations driven, propels Norfolk Southern to a service organization that will compete and win on operational excellence, leveraging the strengths of our powerful network to achieve above market growth. Our value proposition starts with the investments we\u2019ve made over decades to build a robust network that faces the fastest growing segments of the U.S. economy. Our markets extend globally through our strong working relationships with ports, all along the east coast, the great lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. We have cultivated more than 250 short-line partnerships, the most of any Class I railroad. Extending the reach of our network even further and creating even more options for our customers. We have longstanding relationships with a desirable portfolio of valued customers, reflecting a diversity as broad as the U.S. economy. Our automotive, metals, agriculture and consumer products markets are enduring strengths. And our unparalleled intermodal franchise will be an increasing driver of long-term growth. Our best-in-class channel partners and industry leading industrial development team position us well to capitalize on the growth of e-Commerce and the acceleration of onshore as we move Norfolk Southern forward. Leveraging the sustainability advantage of our service product will give us another compelling selling point as more shippers prioritize Scope 3 emissions reduction in the years ahead. We\u2019ll keep driving forward with industry leading technologies, enhancing our productivity and efficiency, and creating a best-in-class consumer oriented experience that makes it easier for customers to do business with Norfolk Southern. Consistent, convenient, cost effective service will enable shippers to build their supply chains around the inherent advantages of our network. We will deliver the simplicity of truck with the efficiency of rail. This is how we will achieve our vision of a customer centric, operations driven organization, and compete successfully in the $800 billion plus truck and logistics market. When I talk to my colleagues throughout Norfolk Southern, from our headquarters to our rail yards, I am energized. Our people are passionate about serving our customers and proud of the essential role we play in moving the American economy. Our team is the reason we will be successful. We are building a winning culture with innovation as a core competency, where people confidently bring forward their best ideas, continuously develop their skills and feel valued for their contributions. We look forward to sharing more about our strategy for long-term shareholder value creation in the months ahead. We will now open the call to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will be coming from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. Hi morning. Sort of \u2013 in thinking about your look ahead to sort of the second half and the sequential improvement. Can you maybe discuss in your mind what the most critical factor is to getting that service up and in turn volumes, is it adding more heads? Is it the new TOP SPG plan, simply easier comps, maybe just give some color around the critical factors as you would rank them? Thanks.\nAlan Shaw: Hey, good morning, Jordan. The critical factors are already in play. We\u2019ve ramped up our headcount and we continue to have a very robust pipeline of conductor trainees. We\u2019ve got close to 900 as of this morning, and we\u2019ve implemented a new operating plan, which is already providing some benefit for us and our customers in terms of improved fluidity and service to our customers. And so as we continue to add headcount, implement our plan we are very confident about the ability to improve service, which will allow us to accept more volume and enhance our productivity, driving OR gains.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to follow up on the service, we\u2019ve seen the improvements in first final mile trip line compliance, but they\u2019re coming off of really low levels. Is that improvement, that rate changed, is that enough to really see substantial volume recovery? Or do you think you need to hit a certain level to start to bring volume back sustainably onto the network? And then just a quick clarification for Mark, can you talk about gain on sale on the quarter, looks like it was about $31 million, wanted to see if that was right and what your expectations are for the rest of the year?\nAlan Shaw: Cindy, would you talk about what you\u2019re seeing with service please?\nCindy Sanborn: Yeah, so great question Brian, and specifically to our measure around first mile/last mile, it\u2019s a very rigorous measure and we put that in place very specifically to make sure that we were understanding what the customer was feeling and we\u2019ve had it in place for a while now, probably two years. And we look back to see where service was at a \u2013 we had a really good level in 2019 and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re aiming towards. And while the number on the page is, percentage wise challenging it\u2019s a measure that we hold ourselves to real high accountability with. And I think Ed can talk a little bit about how the customer feels and how they see the measure.\nEd Elkins: Sure. And thank you, Cindy. The first thing I would say is, our customers helped us develop our metrics and our targets here. Our customers want to do more business with us and they\u2019re starting to see some early green shoots here in terms of service improvement and we fully expect that to continue throughout the year.\nAlan Shaw: Brian, can I just clarify for you the gains. We got about weak last year you may recall we had $67 million of gains. We kind of called out $55 million as a more anomalous figure. And this year right now in Q2, we had $28 million of gains.\nMark George: Brian I\u2019ll add, in addition to first mile/last mile, we\u2019re also delivering improvements in train speed and terminal dwell as well.\nBrian Ossenbeck: And Mark for the rest of the year, what should we pencil in for a normalized level of gain, if you have one?\nMark George: Yeah. I\u2019m not going to really give you much more than the normal usual quarterly cadence. It can be a little bit volatile and real estate gains obviously can move around, even if we expect them to happen this year, they can certainly slide. So if you look so far year-to-date, we\u2019re running at about in the low $30 million range, there might be similar amount in the back half, but probably less than that, because things are moving around a little bit on us.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Right, makes sense. Okay. Thank you for the details. Appreciate it.\nMark George: All right, Brian. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.\nChris Wetherbee: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to talk a little bit about the operating ratio outlook and understand if there\u2019s a volume assumption underlying that. Can you give us a sense of sort of what you need there in terms of operating leverage to be able to hit the numbers? And then I guess Mark, you\u2019ve given us some clarity in sort of OpEx going forward quarter-by-quarter, should we assume somewhere in the $1.9 billion is the right number sort of ex-fuel going forward still or any help around that for the back half in terms of the operating ratio and volumes would be great?\nAlan Shaw: Chris, with respect to our outlook for volume, we have said we\u2019ll be flat for the year. We\u2019re down 4% year-to-date. So that suggests some sequential improvement as we move into the second half of the year and that\u2019s going to be supported by our improving service product. Mark, you want to comment on OpEx?\nMark George: Yeah. Chris, you\u2019re exactly right in your thinking. If you look at our Q2 OpEx numbers and take-away fuel, because fuel\u2019s going to be \u2013 what fuel\u2019s going to be as that moves, but you look at OpEx ex-fuel in the second quarter and even maybe excluding the items that I called out the $16 million that was somewhat anomalous. We would project that amount would be representative of what to expect in the last two quarters on average. So there could be some moves within any particular account or line item in the P&L, but in aggregate that\u2019s kind of the area that we\u2019re expecting. And if we have unexpected events, we\u2019ll call them out to you, like we typically do in our quarterly calls.\nAlan Shaw: And then with respect to the cadence of OR improvement, Mark also highlighted his comments, the 140 basis point headwind that fuel had in the first half of the year. We do not expect that to be the case in the second half of the year.\nMark George: We expect it to moderate, yes as we go through the balance of the year.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, great. Thanks very much for the time. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thanks. Operator wanted to talk a little bit about the call RPU. I think you guys mentioned you\u2019re expecting it to step down here. I just wanted to get a little more meat on the bone. Is that just a sequential step down or do you think it could step down on a year-over-year basis as well?\nAlan Shaw: Ed, would you please address that?\nEd Elkins: Sure. We stay very close to our customers and of course we\u2019re looking at these commodity prices every day. And the export prices have changed quite a bit. The fact is we \u2013 they\u2019re still historically high and there\u2019s still a lot of energy in the market, so to speak. But the [indiscernible] have dropped off as a result of the rise in coal inventory ahead of sanctions on Russia, but they remain near three year highs. So when you think about production limitations, you think about constraint, supply chains, and really what looks like steady demand, it should continue to support higher prices as for both thermal and met coals. We expect to see contract and spot pricing outpace where we thought we were at the beginning of the year, but we don\u2019t expect to be in those same inflated atmosphere that we saw toward the end of Q1. So when I think about it, I do see sequential declines in the yield. That\u2019s about as far as I want to go.\nJason Seidl: Okay. So it sounds like notable sequential declines, but at least for now, probably still above prior year.\nAlan Shaw: Yes.\nJason Seidl: Okay. Thank you for the time as always.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess a couple of things, how much more headcount do you realistically expect to add in the second half, maybe Cindy, any thoughts on restarting some of these hump yards and if that\u2019s \u2013 if there\u2019s more of them to do, if that\u2019s permanent? And then Ed, I just want to follow your point about, was that coal RPU is going to be down sequentially or is that overall RPU that you think will be down sequentially from 2Q to 3Q? Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Yeah, Scott I\u2019ll tackle the headcount question and just say that, I expect that we\u2019ll be probably about a thousand heads higher at the end of the year, compared to the end of last year. And the preponderance of that is going to be in T&E, first with trainees, higher trainee counts, but then also qualified T&E employees as well. And you can see our targets that we gave to the STB. Our target is 7,330, I think by November. And that continues to ramp up on the qualified ranks as we get into next year. I think we\u2019ve got to target out there of over 7,500, by the time we get to May. Let me hand it off to Cindy, you want to talk about humps?\nCindy Sanborn: Sure. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Scott, because I want to make sure I put that in my prepared remarks so I could talk a little bit more about it. We reactivated these humps to give ourselves some additional capacity that we need in the two areas served by Macon and Bellevue. The way switching demand has evolved since 2020, there\u2019s enough critical mass to justify returning them to service as hump yards and because we idled them which was our plan always in 2020, and we didn\u2019t eliminate their capabilities. We do not expect any upfront or ongoing cost of any substantial nature. So we think that returning to hump yards is, humping cars even for either short or long term as an example of resiliency. And it\u2019s important that we have that. And I do think, when you think about it, the productivity gains that we generated when we idled them the first time, we\u2019re going to be able to hold onto most of those. That was a lot of the thinking that went into \u2013 that was part of the thinking that went into returning them to service. And I do think, we\u2019ll always evaluate and there\u2019ll be times where we may see that we\u2019ll idle them again. So it\u2019s meant to help us do our number one goal here, which is to return our service levels.\nEd Elkins: Yeah. Let me talk about coal for a second. Yeah, we\u2019re going to see sequential improve \u2013 sequential decline in the coal RPU, that\u2019s going to be an inevitable drag on the overall RPU for the rest of the year, but we continue to see strong price opportunities in our other markets, including merchandise intermodal auto.\nScott Group: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Nolan: Yeah, I appreciate it. So you guys mentioned storage fees on the intermodal side. I\u2019m curious if you could maybe put a little context around that and then how you see that playing out in the back half of the year?\nEd Elkins: Sure. I\u2019ll take that. We had anticipated that supply chains would be improving as the year has progress. And while we saw some improvement earlier in the year, we\u2019ve seen more of the constraints really become more acute lately. So we are anticipating that supply chains will improve throughout the rest of the year. And as they do and fluidity improves, then we\u2019ll see those storage charges decline.\nBen Nolan: Okay. Any context and as to how we should think about what that means in terms of order magnitude at all?\nEd Elkins: Now, I think we we\u2019ll see presuming and this is forecast in the future for things I don\u2019t control like supply chains, but if you see improvement, you\u2019ll see similar change in the rate of storage.\nBen Nolan: All right. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes to the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks. Maybe to start with one for Mark, just thinking about the full year OR guidance, it\u2019s a 100 to 200 basis points worse than what you anticipated coming into the year. How much of that is fuel versus everything else? And then Cindy, I was wondering if you could talk about what you\u2019re seeing with attrition rates right now versus normalized levels, especially attrition rates for new employees that you\u2019ve hired in the last year?\nMark George: Justin thanks. This is Mark. Certainly a portion of it is fuel for sure, but I think the real issue here is just the volume has not come the way we expected it to come. When we were talking about middle of the quarter there about still having a path to our prior guidance, it was really going to require that we saw an upward inflection on volumes take hold pretty quickly and lead to some sustainable ramp that obviously did not happen as we concluded Q2. And we\u2019re now projecting more of a gradual ramp in volumes, as we\u2019re seeing service start to improve here. And then yes, fuel that you heard its 140 basis points headwind. Now in the second quarter, it\u2019s bigger than we had expected. We do think it moderates as we go through the back half of the year. We\u2019re not \u2013 we can\u2019t control that, we\u2019re not sure. We do take into account the fuel curves, when we look at our projections for fuel but certainly fuel is an element of that change as well.\nCindy Sanborn: And Justin, as far as attrition rates, look globally we\u2019re seeing about the same as we\u2019ve seen all year, both from a tenured employee perspective and a new employee perspective or a conductor trainee perspective. There are clearly markets and locations where it\u2019s more challenging than others. And that\u2019s also consistent with where we\u2019ve been all year. I will say that we just recently announced that we are increasing our conductor training rates. And we think that\u2019ll have a very positive impact for us, both in retention as well as attraction. So we\u2019re feeling good.\nJustin Long: Okay. Thanks for the time.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Cindy, there\u2019s been this acute focus on labor, and it seems like you guys are doing a good job of ramping up pretty quickly, especially in July, and you\u2019re starting to see it in your service metrics. Norfolk specifically has had a little bit more issue with chassis over the last 12 months as well, and you guys kind of laid that out in the presentation. If we take the labor component out of it, what\u2019s the equipment situation like and what\u2019s your latent capacity that if you\u2019re appropriately resourced from a T&E perspective, you can actually meet this demand and we\u2019ll see more of an inflection in volumes.\nCindy Sanborn: So let me just add equipment wise. We do \u2013 we are \u2013 I\u2019ll talk about locomotives and I\u2019ll turn it over to Ed to talk a little bit about chassis. You didn\u2019t mention locomotives, but it is important to make sure you note that in my prepared remarks, I did indicate that we\u2019re keeping our surge fleet fully activated throughout this whole process here as we recover service, and we\u2019re bringing on our DC to AC conversions, which is also allowing us some capacity from an equipment basis on locomotives from a chassis perspective, let me turn it over to Ed for some detail.\nEd Elkins: Sure. Thank you, Cindy. We have a couple of hundred in hand with more arriving each week, and we expect a significant tranche of improvement to land during the fourth quarter this year. So I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape when it comes to our chassis. We see the normal, what I would call normal course of business sporadic disruptions associated with chassis for both other domestic partners as well as steamship lines. But again, I would consider that normal course of business. Outside the gate, we are seeing supply chains impacted by the congestions of first mile last mile on the street, elevated street wells as well as volume fluctuations associated with different ports, a lot of drayage capacity issues and, of course, available warehouse space. And if you read the papers the way I do, you see a lot of ships waiting offshore at a number of ports, which has really not shrunk very much.\nJon Chappell: Yes. Got it. Okay. Thank you, Ed. Thanks, Cindy.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good morning. Maybe, Cindy, I just want to dig into the hump returning a little bit here. Just why bring them back, isn\u2019t it more efficient to be flat, I guess, just from us being on the other side of the table years and years, it seems like all we heard was the first thing under precision scheduled railroading to do was to eliminate the humps to save on touching and time. And then, I guess, Alan, with that, would you consider bringing on any PSR expertise just as CN just did with Ed Harris on a consulting basis. Obviously, there\u2019s a couple of x, I guess, PSR experts out there that are available. Is that something you would consider?\nCindy Sanborn: So Ken, let me start with the hump. So we really did take a really deep dive into this. And when you think about not only sort of traffic changes that have occurred since 2020, that had a big impact on it. But the other piece is, the idea of switching cars beyond the hump yards and bypassing them reflect which to reduce demand so that you can flap switching them. Challenge has really been having the people to do that switching where we are moving them to serving our customers. So the value is really in being able to have a location that you can get to switching done it may be short term and maybe longer term, we\u2019ll just see how it evolves, but that\u2019s the thinking behind it. And again, I do want to emphasize that we really consider the cost associated with it to make sure that we had a really good trade-off here. And we\u2019re really going to be able to hold on a number of the games that we have.\nAlan Shaw: We\u2019re confident it\u2019s not going to add cost, more of the case to the humps is making sure that you\u2019re not running cars out of route just to have them hump. And so we saw that discipline when we closed these two hump yards during the pandemic and the volume outlook has changed. We\u2019ve maintained our focus on a very efficient, balanced operating plan. We just installed a new operating plan and opening the humps just makes those switching operations more efficient. And we\u2019ve got a great team. As you take a \u2013 just look around the table of the folks on this call, we\u2019re fortunate to have two folks who join us from outside of Norfolk Southern who contributed greatly to our success.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks, Alan. Thanks, Cindy.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: Great. Yes. Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit more on TOP|SPG and the schedule changes. I think, Cindy, you said something like 90% of the trains you reviewed and \u2013 how should we think about the schedule changes that were made? And then also maybe if you consider that relative to the changes made a couple of years ago when you originally implemented TOP? I think of those changes as being fewer train starts, longer trains. How should we think about the train schedule changes made with TOP|SPG? Is it also fewer train starts or it sounds like in intermodal might even be more train starts and some different approach. I just wondered if you could offer more perspective on what you\u2019re doing with that in terms of train starts and other changes. Thank you.\nCindy Sanborn: Sure. Thanks for the question. So just to go to a high level here, our main three objectives on TOP|SPG were to balance the network, improve executability and increased train size. And part of the changes in the schedules were really to help us balance the network, balance the flows across the network, both cars and locomotives and make sure that we have realistic schedules that allowed trains to arrive and depart terminals. So we didn\u2019t have them bunched in or bunched out of a particular terminal. We also, as I noted in my prepared remarks, have increased our distributed power utilization and accounting for that as trains were departing and/or working in individual terminals is a lot of the work that we\u2019ve done. And the 90% of the schedules doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019ve changed them dramatically, but we\u2019ve adjusted them so that we can make sure that when we operate our plan, that we don\u2019t have conflicts that prevent us from being able to execute consistently. So that\u2019s really what we were trying to achieve there.\nAlan Shaw: It has substantially reduced the number of train meets on our network, which makes our operations more fluid and more executable by our team. And consistent with our no surprises approach, we involved our customers. Ed, do you want to give some perspective on the customer involvement?\nEd Elkins: Sure. Absolutely. The first thing our customers want. And by the way, let me just say, we are so lucky to have a great coalition of partners that we do business with every day, and they really want us to have an executable train schedule. They want to have a predictable service product. And so they have been highly collaborative with us as we\u2019ve gone through the TOP|SPG process. To look at the changes that were necessary to improve the executability of our product. And I can\u2019t say enough about the collaboration that we\u2019ve had with them. And I think we\u2019re starting to see some early results. And I think that they would say the same thing. So we\u2019re encouraged by those results, but I am most particularly encouraged by the level of the collaboration that we\u2019ve enjoyed with our partners.\nTom Wadewitz: So just, I guess, to be clear, should we think of this as a reduction in train starts or an increase or kind of net, not a big impact, but just more rebalancing?\nCindy Sanborn: I think as we continue to roll it out, I mean we \u2013 I noted that we started in the second half or actually it was in late second quarter. We still have some work to do to roll it out in the intermodal space. And what you\u2019ll \u2013 what I would say relative to crew starts is we\u2019re going to improve service frequency in some of our core markets, and we\u2019re not going to be adding new starts. And we may have a small reduction in that lane or in those lanes. But it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re still in the process of putting it on the railroad.\nAlan Shaw: Tom, what it does is it really improves the executability of our operating plan, which means we\u2019re going to be more consistent, more reliable, more on schedule. Those are the principles of PSR. That will reduce the friction costs associated with slowness in our network.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. Great. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Hi, everyone. Appreciate the time. Hey, Mark. I just wanted to understand the cadence of the OR in the back half because volume out of the gate here in the third quarter is pretty weak? I think it\u2019s down like 3% or something like that. Typically, we do see maybe flattish to slightly worse OR 3Q versus 2Q. I don\u2019t know if \u2013 I mean is the full year guide, the revised full year guide really contemplating kind of a big inflection in the fourth quarter or does the third quarter look a lot like the fourth quarter? If you can talk about that. And then just for the industry, maybe this one is for Cindy and Alan. The industry has been talking about better service and more labor for a long time over the last several months. And we\u2019ve been kind of disappointed not just with Norfolk, but I think the industry as a whole, I think it would just be helpful to understand when do you guys actually think timing-wise, we see a more pronounced inflection. We\u2019ve seen some green shoots, as you mentioned, or maybe a stabilization. I Mean, are we talking about September, October? When do you think you\u2019re at the point equipment and labor wise where we actually see some tangible inflection in the service metrics?\nAlan Shaw: Yes. I\u2019ll cover the service metrics first. We outlined our plan for the Service Transportation Board. It will be beginning of next year before we\u2019re at our targeted headcount that\u2019s going to create a big lift. We\u2019ve already seen improvements in our service product with the implementation of TOP|SPG and with the onboarding of new conductors. And I think that will continue to improve as the year progresses. It won\u2019t be linear, but we should see some lift as we move out of vacation season as well in terms of the availability of our crews.\nMark George: And Amit, so that leads to pretty much the volume profile as well. We\u2019ll probably see more of a ramp into fourth quarter with more volume that should help the operating ratio. But of course, there are seasonal headwinds that typically take effect in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter that might neutralize some of that when we look at the OR progression. So we\u2019re not going to give the quarterly guidance, but it does seem to be probably a little bit more of an upward \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, a little bit more of a gradual improvement in the OR as we go through the balance of the year as volumes come on mainly in the fourth quarter. The volume growth, I should say, comes on mainly in the fourth quarter.\nAmit Mehrotra: So does that mean we take a step back before we accelerate into the fourth quarter? I\u2019m just trying to understand, is it a slope upwards in the back half versus where you are in the second quarter or is it a step back is it a little bit of a J curve?\nMark George: Well, I think we\u2019re going to \u2013 I would fully expect that we\u2019ll see sequential improvement from the second to the third quarter. I\u2019m just \u2013 I\u2019m not going to tell you yet whether we\u2019ll also see sequential improvement from the third quarter or to the fourth quarter or if there\u2019ll be somewhat on par with one another.\nAmit Mehrotra: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s very clear. Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it.\nMark George: Thank you, Amit.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nAri Rosa: Yes. Hi, good morning. So I wanted to ask just kind of a broader philosophical question. I think we\u2019ve been dancing around it with a couple of questions that have been asked. But you\u2019re talking about obviously adding headcount, bringing equipment back onto the network, reintroducing some of these hump yards. Is there a point where service improvement maybe is at odds with OR improvement? And at what point do you think we can kind of see a resumption in OR improvement? And as we think about 2023 what kind of incremental margins might we be looking at as that service gets back to where you want it to be?\nAlan Shaw: Ari, we fully believe that service and margin improvement are complementary. They support each other and our trajectory for service improvements and the attendant improvement in OR belies that fact. We\u2019re going to take a balanced approach. We\u2019ve got balanced objectives of service, productivity and growth and our new operating plan, that provides some sort of insight as to how we\u2019re thinking about this thing. Our priority is to improve service as service and fluidity improve, you\u2019re going to see significant volume uptick and productivity gains, which will collectively drive margin improvement.\nMark George: And Ari, I also remind you, in a difficult service environment like we\u2019re dealing with, there\u2019s a fair amount of incremental costs that we\u2019re absorbing to have to cope with it, whether it\u2019s incremental overtime, whether it\u2019s recrews, whether it\u2019s train costs, you name it, training, travel, taxi, there\u2019s a fair amount of cost right now that we\u2019re absorbing in our P&L to deal with the current service challenges. So that starts to lessen as service improves, and I think you need to keep that in mind.\nCindy Sanborn: Yes. And even in my prepared remarks, I talked about the fact that both train length and train weight are up even in difficult circumstances here. So think we\u2019ll hold on to that. And I\u2019m very positive on being able to run a very efficient network that serves our customers extremely well.\nAri Rosa: Got it. Okay. Thank you for that color.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, everyone. And thanks for taking my question. Cindy this might kind of little naive, but I know we always focus on conductor trainees. My understanding, though, is that for engineering or to be an engineer that trains a little bit more intensive or maybe longer duration. So can you talk about your qualified engineer ranks? And is that potentially a next bottleneck or again, is that just a naive question?\nCindy Sanborn: It\u2019s a great question. We are \u2013 as you noted, conductors take promotion to engineers. That is our pipeline for locomotive engineers. Over the years, our investments part of the resiliency investments we\u2019ve made is to qualify more people to be locomotive engineers as conductors step them up to qualify and then step them back down to acting and active working conductors. So we keep a buffer that is \u2013 that we\u2019ve used through this time where we can step up engineers and then backfill with conductor trainees. And I would say that we\u2019re already starting the process, training some locomotive engineers will be next month. We will keep an eye on that and maintain that buffer that\u2019s going to be part of \u2013 as we stabilize service levels and get our conductor ranks where they need to be, that will be one of the big areas that we focus on in 2023.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Cindy or Alan, can you help us understand how your customers right now are thinking about truck to rail conversion. Obviously, your service is improving, you\u2019re pretty in place TOP|SPG and that helps at the same time the truck market is loosening. And I think for now at least, shippers want like super tight fast supply chains with high turnover. So what\u2019s driving that incremental conversion and is TOP|SPG enough to do that?\nAlan Shaw: Mark, why don\u2019t you talk about what you\u2019re hearing from our customers with respect to opportunities?\nMark George: Absolutely. We\u2019re talking to our partners every day. And frankly, the truck prices are loosening, but our customers remind us every single day that those are from historically very high levels. And the contract rates have stabilized. There are a number of things that our customers want, but one of them is they want to do more business with us. Our customers have freight that they would like to put on the railroad and as our network throughput capacity improves through network velocity, they\u2019re going to do that. They have \u2013 we have line of sight on freight that want to move on the railroad right now, whether it\u2019s in our industrial markets, our consumer markets or energy markets. And we\u2019re confident that as the network velocity improves, our customers are going to find additional value in the product that we\u2019re able to deliver to them, and that will manifest itself in additional volumes later this year.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. So given the incremental value provision of rails, you guys are confident that you can push yields higher even if the truck market \u2013 truck pricing comes down?\nEd Elkins: Yes. We stay very, very close to that. We\u2019re always looking at what truck prices are doing. Again, contract prices have stabilized at very high levels. We\u2019re always looking at the gap between what we believe the value that we\u2019re offering versus what a truck offers. And we looked at a number of lanes specifically where we offer intermodal service as an example, and we\u2019re comfortable that our door-to-door pricing is very competitive against over-the-road trucking. And let me remind everyone, including myself, there are multiple advantages to using rail versus the highway, including sustainability. We\u2019ve seen a lot of our customers make commitments publicly about what it\u2019s going to take for them to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. And when we think about the consumer packaged goods business, approximately 80% of the greenhouse gas comes from transportation. The efficiency advantage that we deliver for our customers over a long period of time is going to help them achieve those goals.\nRavi Shanker: Very good. Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: I\u2019ll add. We had \u2013 in our intermodal franchise has delivered 22 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in RPU ex fuel. That\u2019s during a freight recession and during the pandemic. And so there\u2019s great value with the product that we deliver. Our focus now is on enhancing the value of that product.\nRavi Shanker: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nBascome Majors: Mark and Alan, as you both alluded to in your prepared remarks, there\u2019s some uncertainty as to what the actual union wage increases from 2024 are ultimately going to be? Can you talk about how you have managed that uncertainty with your accruals so far? And if the actual wage is come in different than those expectations, when do you true that up retroactively and communicate it to us on a go-forward basis?\nMark George: Hey Bascome, thanks a lot for the question. This is Mark. Look, we\u2019ve agreed with PEB that we weren\u2019t going to discuss publicly what our relative positions are. But I will tell you, we have accrued a level of back wages that reflects our efforts to keep our craft workers amongst the highest paid in any industry. And obviously, if there\u2019s a settlement that is at a different level, whether that happens through the PEB or subsequent to the PEB, we will have to make an adjustment, and we will make that very, very clear in terms of disclosure to you all what the impact will be. So again, whatever that increment is, we\u2019ll let you know. But right now, we are accruing something based upon what our expectations were.\nBascome Majors: Thank you for that. And just to clarify, you mentioned the PEB a couple of times in your timing. Is it the PEB report that would be that triggering your mind or something subsequent like a tentative agreement with the coalition or something in that vein?\nMark George: Yes. We have to work with the accountants to understand what the trigger event will be. So I\u2019m not really at liberty to pinpoint that right now on this call.\nBascome Majors: Thank you for the time.\nMark George: Thank you, Bascome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much, and thank you for taking my question. Just a question about the hiring process. I know there\u2019s been a bunch of this quarter. One of the complaints we had heard from some other rails is that they were seeing a problem retaining employees post training. Now you had mentioned the wage increase and some of the carrots that you had put out there. But I guess two questions. Why has this become so problematic? Is it just that it\u2019s kind of a Gen Z employee wants different things, and we\u2019ve got to change the job kind of item? Is it more of a pay item? And then secondly, let\u2019s say the economy slows a lot faster than we all think, just theoretically, and I know your volume forecast doesn\u2019t imply that. Do we still stay to the 1,000 employees by the end of the year?\nCindy Sanborn: Great. Well, let me start with the training retention piece. One of the challenges for our trainees when they do mark up as a seniority-based system they will tend to get the work that others do not necessarily \u2013 they do not want. Those will be the jobs that they can hold. So as they step into that role, some find that, that\u2019s not really what they\u2019re looking for. We \u2013 our training process allows us to convey that information, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t become real until you come up and you mark up. I will say in terms of what could be a solution at the national table is conductor redeployment that will allow us to have a more structured work environment for more conductors than we do today. So that is part of what we feel like is a good solution, and we feel like it will fit the needs and demands of our workforce in the future, which is why we\u2019ve got it on the table for negotiation.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you, Cindy.\nMark George: It\u2019s really more of a lifestyle \u2013 Jeff, it\u2019s really more of a lifestyle challenge in a very unique market where everybody is looking for talent. So you have to compete against everybody simultaneously. So labor has their choice of what they want to do. And in many cases, despite the very rich and attractive pay structure that the railroads offer, sometimes, they\u2019d rather work in a more predictable schedule in warehousing or in home construction, where they can be nearby where they live and not stay in hotels and also just not be on call or work their shift. So we\u2019re just in a very unique environment right now where the entire labor market have their options to choose from.\nAlan Shaw: As Cindy noted, some of those work rules changes that we\u2019re proposing would directly address some of those issues that Mark articulated.\nJeff Kauffman: Okay. And second half of the question, I know the trainees are already in process. So were we pretty committed to that 1,000-plus employees by year-end with the STB plan or what if the world changes?\nAlan Shaw: We are committed to high levels of service throughout all economic cycles because we believe that services resiliency enhances the ability to be opportunistic during the near-term recovery and generates confidence by our customers and building supply chains around us for the long-term. As Ed noted, there are a lot of inherent advantages to our network. There\u2019s a lot of reasons that customers want to do business with us over the long-term.\nJeff Kauffman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in here at the end. I\u2019ve got two longer-term questions for you on TOP|SPG. If we\u2019re adding 1,000 heads to workforce, can you talk about maybe, Cindy, what level of volume growth you could absorb with that headcount once it gets productive. I\u2019m trying to understand whether the embedded labor productivity level in this new version of the operating plan is higher or lower than maybe what we\u2019ve seen in the early days of PSR? And then, Alan, maybe longer-term on the service side, does this get us to that low to mid-80s in first and last mile sort of service levels as you outlined for the STB? Or is there upside to that? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for kind of how you think about is low to mid-80s enough to drive modal conversion longer-term?\nCindy Sanborn: David, I\u2019ll start. I mean so from TOP|SPG, I mean, I would think it\u2019s going to be a very productive operating plan. And obviously, it\u2019s not going to be static. We\u2019re going to adjust as volume adjusts and as business adjusts across \u2013 going across our network. It\u2019s about balanced executability and train size, as I described. One of the areas that I mentioned in my prepared remarks in the bulk network, we have seen a lot of improvement in train size from the standpoint of combinations of trains, but we will be able to add additional cars to trains as well in our standard sets in our grain network. So I see this as an enabler from a productivity standpoint and allow us to bring on volume with a consistent operation that we will offer.\nAlan Shaw: Ed, go ahead.\nEd Elkins: Let me just add to the fact that the number of people we\u2019re adding, it requires a lot more energy and people to get the network sped up to where it needs to be. And then also that the number of people we\u2019re adding. And once we\u2019re up to speed, gives us the capacity, additional head count capacity to handle even greater volume. So I think that\u2019s the other point is the capacity dividend that a faster network provides will allow us to take on more volume.\nMark George: And a stable, reliable, predictable service product over a long period of time is exactly what our customers need to build their businesses around ours, and we can offer tremendous value and unlock value for them and for their customers by delivering that kind of service. That\u2019s what we\u2019re committed to over the long-term, delivering a high level of service that our customers need that allows them to deliver growth and value for their customers.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Alan Shaw for closing comments.\nAlan Shaw: We thank you for joining us today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Alan Shaw",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Norfolk Southern's second quarter 2022 earnings call. I am joined today by Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. In the second quarter, we stabilized service levels, expanded our pipeline of conductor trainees and launched the next evolution of our operating plan, top SPG with our signature no surprises approach. Service is not yet where we want it to be, but I am encouraged by our progress and inspired by the commitment and shared vision of our talented team. I am privileged to spend a lot of time in the field with our hard-working craft employees and operations supervisors. I see firsthand and sincerely appreciate their daily dedication to serving our customers. We are eager to reach an agreement that keeps our people among the highest paid craft workers of any industry and recognizes their essential service to our customers, our company and the U.S. economy. Moving to Slide 4. Thanks to the combined efforts of our team. We delivered solid financial performance in the second quarter with record revenue and earnings per share. Revenue increased 16% as a 20% increase in revenue per unit more than offset a 3% volume decline. Expenses grew by 21% year-over-year due primarily to higher fuel prices. Operating ratio was up 260 basis points versus last year's quarterly record. Comparisons were adversely impacted by the absence of a large property sale we called out last year as well as fuel price headwinds. Despite these headwinds, EPS improved by 5%, $3.45 per share, a second quarter record. The steps we are taking today to restore service and implement our new top SPG operating plan are making Norfolk Southern a more customer-centric operations-driven organization that will deliver long-term value for our customers and shareholders. Our top SPG operating plan is part of the equation for improving service. We named this iteration, SPG because it creates a platform for consistent service, continuous productivity improvement and smart growth for our customers, Norfolk Southern and our shareholders. There is no doubt we have an enviable value proposition to compete in today's logistics marketplace and where markets are headed. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, I'll share a few insights on how we will unlock that value. I'll now turn the discussion to Cindy for an update on operations and a detailed look at how our company is aligned around restoring service and creating a safe efficient and reliable product that meets our customers' needs and supports their growth. Cindy? Thank you, Mark. I'll conclude with an update on our outlook for the year and brief thoughts on our strategy for long-term value creation. You'll see, on Slide 21, our confidence in the revenue outlook has improved the 12% plus year-over-year growth underpinning the improved revenue outlook, a strong first half performance, continued strength in fuel surcharge revenues and better sequential volumes associated with service improvement in the back half of 2022. Our first half operating ratio was the result of a delayed service recovery and elevated fuel prices. These headwinds will translate into a deterioration in full-year operating ratio. Although we expect the back half to improve from the first half as our service recovery ramps, allowing us to absorb more and reduce costs associated with our service challenges. As Mark mentioned, we do not know if there will be any incremental costs recorded in 2022 associated with a resolution in our labor negotiations. Turning to Slide 22, although our focus today is on restoring service in the short-term, our vision extends much further. As I complete my first 100 days as CEO, I'd like to share some insights on our future. The work we are doing now to improve service is only the beginning. We're going to build long-term resiliency into our network, creating sustainable value for our customers. Norfolk Southern has a franchise that is built for growth. Being customer centric and operations driven, propels Norfolk Southern to a service organization that will compete and win on operational excellence, leveraging the strengths of our powerful network to achieve above market growth. Our value proposition starts with the investments we've made over decades to build a robust network that faces the fastest growing segments of the U.S. economy. Our markets extend globally through our strong working relationships with ports, all along the east coast, the great lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. We have cultivated more than 250 short-line partnerships, the most of any Class I railroad. Extending the reach of our network even further and creating even more options for our customers. We have longstanding relationships with a desirable portfolio of valued customers, reflecting a diversity as broad as the U.S. economy. Our automotive, metals, agriculture and consumer products markets are enduring strengths. And our unparalleled intermodal franchise will be an increasing driver of long-term growth. Our best-in-class channel partners and industry leading industrial development team position us well to capitalize on the growth of e-Commerce and the acceleration of onshore as we move Norfolk Southern forward. Leveraging the sustainability advantage of our service product will give us another compelling selling point as more shippers prioritize Scope 3 emissions reduction in the years ahead. We'll keep driving forward with industry leading technologies, enhancing our productivity and efficiency, and creating a best-in-class consumer oriented experience that makes it easier for customers to do business with Norfolk Southern. Consistent, convenient, cost effective service will enable shippers to build their supply chains around the inherent advantages of our network. We will deliver the simplicity of truck with the efficiency of rail. This is how we will achieve our vision of a customer centric, operations driven organization, and compete successfully in the $800 billion plus truck and logistics market. When I talk to my colleagues throughout Norfolk Southern, from our headquarters to our rail yards, I am energized. Our people are passionate about serving our customers and proud of the essential role we play in moving the American economy. Our team is the reason we will be successful. We are building a winning culture with innovation as a core competency, where people confidently bring forward their best ideas, continuously develop their skills and feel valued for their contributions. We look forward to sharing more about our strategy for long-term shareholder value creation in the months ahead. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Hey, good morning, Jordan. The critical factors are already in play. We've ramped up our headcount and we continue to have a very robust pipeline of conductor trainees. We've got close to 900 as of this morning, and we've implemented a new operating plan, which is already providing some benefit for us and our customers in terms of improved fluidity and service to our customers. And so as we continue to add headcount, implement our plan we are very confident about the ability to improve service, which will allow us to accept more volume and enhance our productivity, driving OR gains. Cindy, would you talk about what you're seeing with service please? Brian, can I just clarify for you the gains. We got about weak last year you may recall we had $67 million of gains. We kind of called out $55 million as a more anomalous figure. And this year right now in Q2, we had $28 million of gains. Chris, with respect to our outlook for volume, we have said we'll be flat for the year. We're down 4% year-to-date. So that suggests some sequential improvement as we move into the second half of the year and that's going to be supported by our improving service product. Mark, you want to comment on OpEx? And then with respect to the cadence of OR improvement, Mark also highlighted his comments, the 140 basis point headwind that fuel had in the first half of the year. We do not expect that to be the case in the second half of the year. Ed, would you please address that? Yes. Yeah, Scott I'll tackle the headcount question and just say that, I expect that we'll be probably about a thousand heads higher at the end of the year, compared to the end of last year. And the preponderance of that is going to be in T&E, first with trainees, higher trainee counts, but then also qualified T&E employees as well. And you can see our targets that we gave to the STB. Our target is 7,330, I think by November. And that continues to ramp up on the qualified ranks as we get into next year. I think we've got to target out there of over 7,500, by the time we get to May. Let me hand it off to Cindy, you want to talk about humps? Thank you. We're confident it's not going to add cost, more of the case to the humps is making sure that you're not running cars out of route just to have them hump. And so we saw that discipline when we closed these two hump yards during the pandemic and the volume outlook has changed. We've maintained our focus on a very efficient, balanced operating plan. We just installed a new operating plan and opening the humps just makes those switching operations more efficient. And we've got a great team. As you take a \u2013 just look around the table of the folks on this call, we're fortunate to have two folks who join us from outside of Norfolk Southern who contributed greatly to our success. It has substantially reduced the number of train meets on our network, which makes our operations more fluid and more executable by our team. And consistent with our no surprises approach, we involved our customers. Ed, do you want to give some perspective on the customer involvement? Tom, what it does is it really improves the executability of our operating plan, which means we're going to be more consistent, more reliable, more on schedule. Those are the principles of PSR. That will reduce the friction costs associated with slowness in our network. Yes. I'll cover the service metrics first. We outlined our plan for the Service Transportation Board. It will be beginning of next year before we're at our targeted headcount that's going to create a big lift. We've already seen improvements in our service product with the implementation of TOP|SPG and with the onboarding of new conductors. And I think that will continue to improve as the year progresses. It won't be linear, but we should see some lift as we move out of vacation season as well in terms of the availability of our crews. Ari, we fully believe that service and margin improvement are complementary. They support each other and our trajectory for service improvements and the attendant improvement in OR belies that fact. We're going to take a balanced approach. We've got balanced objectives of service, productivity and growth and our new operating plan, that provides some sort of insight as to how we're thinking about this thing. Our priority is to improve service as service and fluidity improve, you're going to see significant volume uptick and productivity gains, which will collectively drive margin improvement. Mark, why don't you talk about what you're hearing from our customers with respect to opportunities? I'll add. We had \u2013 in our intermodal franchise has delivered 22 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in RPU ex fuel. That's during a freight recession and during the pandemic. And so there's great value with the product that we deliver. Our focus now is on enhancing the value of that product. As Cindy noted, some of those work rules changes that we're proposing would directly address some of those issues that Mark articulated. We are committed to high levels of service throughout all economic cycles because we believe that services resiliency enhances the ability to be opportunistic during the near-term recovery and generates confidence by our customers and building supply chains around us for the long-term. As Ed noted, there are a lot of inherent advantages to our network. There's a lot of reasons that customers want to do business with us over the long-term. Ed, go ahead. We thank you for joining us today."

            "name": "Cindy Sanborn",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. In the second quarter, our team continued to face a challenging operational environment as we work to stabilize service levels, drive productivity gains and increase our T&E workforce. Crew starts were down 3% in the quarter and volumes also down 3% and flat gross ton miles. Similar to what I discussed last quarter, we continue to make gains in crew productivity. However, we would have preferred to run additional crew starts that were limited by staffing challenges. As we promote more of the conductor trainees currently in our pipeline, we will see additional highly productive crew starts that will support more volume and further increases to the record train size we have produced this year. Despite the ongoing decision to keep a portion of our surge locomotive fleet active to promote service recovery, we produced another all-time record for fuel efficiency, driven by our multipronged strategy to reduce consumption. This strategy includes the DC to AC conversion program, data-driven solutions to idle reduction and small but powerful investments in friction modification technology, just to name a few components. We expect to drive even better results as we execute on that strategy and enhance the fluidity of our network. Moving on to Slide 7. Train speed and terminal dwell remained challenged in the quarter, but we are really encouraged by the improvements we're seeing here in July. We are pulling every lever to restore service levels and delivering for our customers as our top priority. We have a long way to go, and our workforce is dedicated to getting the job done. I'm going to speak over the next few slides about the plan for accomplishing this. Turning to Slide 8, which is an update on our T&E staffing progress. We're maintaining a very strong pipeline of conductor trainees. And even more encouraging, as you can see that in July, we're really making progress on getting those employees qualified more than offsetting ongoing attrition. And the impact on our network is being felt. We are continuing to start classes weekly and expect this momentum to continue. I will note that the labor market is still very challenging, particularly in certain locations. We're taking advantage of every option to get folks where we need them, including go teams, transfers, sign-on and attendance bonuses, retirement deferral and referral incentives and more. We're also examining how we can adjust our operation to best align resources with demand. An example of this is that our two of our major terminals, Macon and Bellevue, recall that both of these former hump yards were converted to flat switching in 2020. Switching demand has increased in both locations since that time, and we have begun the process of resuming conventional hump operations at both facilities to provide the capacity we need to most expeditiously and efficiently serve our customers with negligible upstart our ongoing costs. Having the ability to return to humping operations as demand dictates is an example of resiliency we now have in our network and a lever we can pull to improve service. We are excited about the talented individuals joining us to help move the economy, and we are confident we will continue to make progress on our staffing priorities. On Slide 9, I am very happy with the progress we've made on our safety initiatives and translating that to fewer injuries and train accidents. Especially with large numbers of new employees starting out in the field, this reinforces that all of our employees, tenured and new alike are laser-focused on running a safe operation, providing a critical foundation for the future. Now moving to Slide 10. I'll talk about the progress we've made with rolling out the latest evolution of our operating plan, TOP|SPG. As a reminder, TOP is in an acronym building on the legacy of Thoroughbred Operating Plans. And as Alan noted earlier, SPG signifies the equal prominence of the three pillars: service, productivity and growth. Late in the second quarter, we launched the plan, which was focused on creating more balance and executability within our network. We looked at how our business, rate flows and train composition have changed over the last few years and then couple that with a deep dive on how each of our terminals and routes can best handle the business. We took a fresh approach to balancing the number of crews and locomotives flowing across our core routes. I've spoken before about the benefits of distributed power locomotives on longer trains, and as we're creating longer trains, when we built the plan for when and where we apply distributed power. We looked at prior and prospective train consolidations and weighed what it would take to continue launching and landing longer trains both from a time and resource perspective and made holistic decisions about what is best for service, productivity and growth. As we go forward, we will increase the service frequency in several of our core intermodal markets while simplifying the role of each terminal, particularly where we have more than one terminal in each market. This will allow us to drive even more value from our intermodal franchise and will promote executability and growth. Our bulk strategy has a long-term focus. In recent years, we've made solid progress on train consolidations and to a lesser degree, blending with other traffic types. Now we're putting added emphasis on identifying how we can take the remaining unit train network and add an incremental 10, 20 or 30 cars to each train. Moving to Slide 11, to discuss a couple of metrics that indicate the early progress we're seeing. First, our arrival train performance has seen substantial improvements here in July. With TOP|SPG, we adjusted 90% of our train schedules to meet the service and executability standards I described on the previous slide, and this improvement is very encouraging. As I showed on the network update, our velocity has been improving in July, and this train performance trend reinforces that velocity is translating into trains hitting their slots at an increasing rate. One of the several reasons for this is the strong increase in the number of distributed powertrains we run each day. Team built a solid plan and is now executing it, and this is a component that will directly impact each aspect of SPG as DP trains run smoother, creating service resiliency. They are also more fuel-efficient than shorter trains driving productivity, and they give us a capacity dividend driving growth. We have a long way to go to fully restoring service. These are just a few examples of where we are and further improvements will continue to be driven by three primary functions: staffing initiatives paying off; the success of top SPG; and a solid execution by our field workforce. Thank you. And I will now turn it over to Ed. Yeah, so great question Brian, and specifically to our measure around first mile/last mile, it's a very rigorous measure and we put that in place very specifically to make sure that we were understanding what the customer was feeling and we've had it in place for a while now, probably two years. And we look back to see where service was at a \u2013 we had a really good level in 2019 and so that's what we're aiming towards. And while the number on the page is, percentage wise challenging it's a measure that we hold ourselves to real high accountability with. And I think Ed can talk a little bit about how the customer feels and how they see the measure. Sure. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Scott, because I want to make sure I put that in my prepared remarks so I could talk a little bit more about it. We reactivated these humps to give ourselves some additional capacity that we need in the two areas served by Macon and Bellevue. The way switching demand has evolved since 2020, there's enough critical mass to justify returning them to service as hump yards and because we idled them which was our plan always in 2020, and we didn't eliminate their capabilities. We do not expect any upfront or ongoing cost of any substantial nature. So we think that returning to hump yards is, humping cars even for either short or long term as an example of resiliency. And it's important that we have that. And I do think, when you think about it, the productivity gains that we generated when we idled them the first time, we're going to be able to hold onto most of those. That was a lot of the thinking that went into \u2013 that was part of the thinking that went into returning them to service. And I do think, we'll always evaluate and there'll be times where we may see that we'll idle them again. So it's meant to help us do our number one goal here, which is to return our service levels. And Justin, as far as attrition rates, look globally we're seeing about the same as we've seen all year, both from a tenured employee perspective and a new employee perspective or a conductor trainee perspective. There are clearly markets and locations where it's more challenging than others. And that's also consistent with where we've been all year. I will say that we just recently announced that we are increasing our conductor training rates. And we think that'll have a very positive impact for us, both in retention as well as attraction. So we're feeling good. So let me just add equipment wise. We do \u2013 we are \u2013 I'll talk about locomotives and I'll turn it over to Ed to talk a little bit about chassis. You didn't mention locomotives, but it is important to make sure you note that in my prepared remarks, I did indicate that we're keeping our surge fleet fully activated throughout this whole process here as we recover service, and we're bringing on our DC to AC conversions, which is also allowing us some capacity from an equipment basis on locomotives from a chassis perspective, let me turn it over to Ed for some detail. So Ken, let me start with the hump. So we really did take a really deep dive into this. And when you think about not only sort of traffic changes that have occurred since 2020, that had a big impact on it. But the other piece is, the idea of switching cars beyond the hump yards and bypassing them reflect which to reduce demand so that you can flap switching them. Challenge has really been having the people to do that switching where we are moving them to serving our customers. So the value is really in being able to have a location that you can get to switching done it may be short term and maybe longer term, we'll just see how it evolves, but that's the thinking behind it. And again, I do want to emphasize that we really consider the cost associated with it to make sure that we had a really good trade-off here. And we're really going to be able to hold on a number of the games that we have. Sure. Thanks for the question. So just to go to a high level here, our main three objectives on TOP|SPG were to balance the network, improve executability and increased train size. And part of the changes in the schedules were really to help us balance the network, balance the flows across the network, both cars and locomotives and make sure that we have realistic schedules that allowed trains to arrive and depart terminals. So we didn't have them bunched in or bunched out of a particular terminal. We also, as I noted in my prepared remarks, have increased our distributed power utilization and accounting for that as trains were departing and/or working in individual terminals is a lot of the work that we've done. And the 90% of the schedules doesn't mean that we've changed them dramatically, but we've adjusted them so that we can make sure that when we operate our plan, that we don't have conflicts that prevent us from being able to execute consistently. So that's really what we were trying to achieve there. I think as we continue to roll it out, I mean we \u2013 I noted that we started in the second half or actually it was in late second quarter. We still have some work to do to roll it out in the intermodal space. And what you'll \u2013 what I would say relative to crew starts is we're going to improve service frequency in some of our core markets, and we're not going to be adding new starts. And we may have a small reduction in that lane or in those lanes. But it's \u2013 we're still in the process of putting it on the railroad. Yes. And even in my prepared remarks, I talked about the fact that both train length and train weight are up even in difficult circumstances here. So think we'll hold on to that. And I'm very positive on being able to run a very efficient network that serves our customers extremely well. It's a great question. We are \u2013 as you noted, conductors take promotion to engineers. That is our pipeline for locomotive engineers. Over the years, our investments part of the resiliency investments we've made is to qualify more people to be locomotive engineers as conductors step them up to qualify and then step them back down to acting and active working conductors. So we keep a buffer that is \u2013 that we've used through this time where we can step up engineers and then backfill with conductor trainees. And I would say that we're already starting the process, training some locomotive engineers will be next month. We will keep an eye on that and maintain that buffer that's going to be part of \u2013 as we stabilize service levels and get our conductor ranks where they need to be, that will be one of the big areas that we focus on in 2023. Great. Well, let me start with the training retention piece. One of the challenges for our trainees when they do mark up as a seniority-based system they will tend to get the work that others do not necessarily \u2013 they do not want. Those will be the jobs that they can hold. So as they step into that role, some find that, that's not really what they're looking for. We \u2013 our training process allows us to convey that information, but sometimes it doesn't become real until you come up and you mark up. I will say in terms of what could be a solution at the national table is conductor redeployment that will allow us to have a more structured work environment for more conductors than we do today. So that is part of what we feel like is a good solution, and we feel like it will fit the needs and demands of our workforce in the future, which is why we've got it on the table for negotiation. David, I'll start. I mean so from TOP|SPG, I mean, I would think it's going to be a very productive operating plan. And obviously, it's not going to be static. We're going to adjust as volume adjusts and as business adjusts across \u2013 going across our network. It's about balanced executability and train size, as I described. One of the areas that I mentioned in my prepared remarks in the bulk network, we have seen a lot of improvement in train size from the standpoint of combinations of trains, but we will be able to add additional cars to trains as well in our standard sets in our grain network. So I see this as an enabler from a productivity standpoint and allow us to bring on volume with a consistent operation that we will offer."

            "content": "Thanks, Cindy, and good morning, everybody. Let's go to Slide 13. Our results for the quarter reflect strong revenue growth amidst still recovering volume from network challenges. We achieved record revenue for the quarter of $3.3 billion. That's up 16% year-over-year on higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price improvement. Revenue per unit was also a record and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, saw a double-digit increase from the same period last year. This revenue growth more than offset a 3% decline in overall volume, resulting from service disruptions. Within merchandise, overall volume was down slightly as declines in steel and construction-related shipments from strained network fluidity were partially offset by gains in sand, driven by increased drilling activity in response to rising demand for natural gas, also helping to offset those declines with notable growth in our grain shipments due to rising export demand. Merchandise revenue and revenue per unit were records for the quarter on higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price gains. Now turning to Intermodal. Revenue, revenue per unit and revenue per unit excluding fuel were all up double digits in the second quarter with higher fuel surcharge price gains and higher revenue from storage fees more than offsetting the impact of those volume declines. International intermodal shipments were markedly down year-over-year, driven largely by a shift in our customer base away from Inland Point Intermodal or IPI, in response to ongoing supply chain challenges. Declines in international intermodal were partially offset by modest improvement in domestic shipments year-over-year due to sustained consumer demand. Revenue growth was strongest in our coal business unit this quarter with total revenue, revenue per unit and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, all increasing well north of 30% year-over-year in the second quarter. This growth was propelled by price gains, particularly in our export coal markets. Coal volume in the second quarter was negatively impacted by limited supply and facility closures. Overall, our performance for the quarter reflects an improving revenue portfolio that will serve as a platform for long-term sustainable revenue growth into the future. Moving to our outlook on Slide 14. We're cautiously optimistic that the demand environment will remain strong through the end of 2022, providing opportunities for us to expand our volume and revenue base as fluidity is restored to the network. Despite recession risks amid record inflation and aggressive monetary policy, most economists are still forecasting GDP growth above 1% for both the third and the fourth quarters of 2022. In addition, we are beginning to see gas prices moderate nationally and unemployment remains very low, both of which bode well for consumption, which drives many of our markets. Specific to our merchandise segment, we expect volume strength in the second half to be led by our automotive markets where U.S. light vehicle production is currently forecasted to be up 18% over the production levels experienced in the last six months of 2021. Looking at commodity prices, we see mixed signals for many of our markets, but overall prices remain elevated from those pre-pandemic levels. Manufacturing activity has been a tailwind throughout 2022. However, the outlook is less certain for the remainder of the year. Lastly, we anticipate overall year-over-year improvements in most of our merchandise markets as our service levels recover. Within intermodal, we expect sequential volume improvement in both our domestic and international lines of business in the second half of 2022 as demand remains strong and service improvements will allow for greater throughput on our network. Backlog demand for container movements will provide opportunities for growth in our domestic franchise. In addition, new opportunities for domestic volume growth exists in the truck and logistics market, and we're laser-focused on driving highway to rail conversions to expand our market share. With respect to our international lines of business, increasing import activity is providing growth opportunities, although lower IPI is a limiting factor. We're also keeping a close eye on truck pricing as rates have fallen, albeit from historically very high levels. Finally, our outlook for coal is positive for the second half of the year with growth in our utility and export markets driven by energy demand. Recent declines in export met coal prices suggest we're not likely to realize the same upside potential in RPU that we achieved in the second quarter. Market conditions support year-over-year volume growth in these markets with upside potential driven by coal supply and network fluidity. While we recognize that uncertainty persists in the macroeconomic environment, we continue to see opportunities for volume growth in the markets that we serve. As part of our execution of our top SPG operating plan, we are committed to capturing these opportunities, expanding our business by delivering the quality service that our customers need to thrive. I'll now turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results. Sure. And thank you, Cindy. The first thing I would say is, our customers helped us develop our metrics and our targets here. Our customers want to do more business with us and they're starting to see some early green shoots here in terms of service improvement and we fully expect that to continue throughout the year. Sure. We stay very close to our customers and of course we're looking at these commodity prices every day. And the export prices have changed quite a bit. The fact is we \u2013 they're still historically high and there's still a lot of energy in the market, so to speak. But the [indiscernible] have dropped off as a result of the rise in coal inventory ahead of sanctions on Russia, but they remain near three year highs. So when you think about production limitations, you think about constraint, supply chains, and really what looks like steady demand, it should continue to support higher prices as for both thermal and met coals. We expect to see contract and spot pricing outpace where we thought we were at the beginning of the year, but we don't expect to be in those same inflated atmosphere that we saw toward the end of Q1. So when I think about it, I do see sequential declines in the yield. That's about as far as I want to go. Yeah. Let me talk about coal for a second. Yeah, we're going to see sequential improve \u2013 sequential decline in the coal RPU, that's going to be an inevitable drag on the overall RPU for the rest of the year, but we continue to see strong price opportunities in our other markets, including merchandise intermodal auto. Sure. I'll take that. We had anticipated that supply chains would be improving as the year has progress. And while we saw some improvement earlier in the year, we've seen more of the constraints really become more acute lately. So we are anticipating that supply chains will improve throughout the rest of the year. And as they do and fluidity improves, then we'll see those storage charges decline. Now, I think we we'll see presuming and this is forecast in the future for things I don't control like supply chains, but if you see improvement, you'll see similar change in the rate of storage. Sure. Thank you, Cindy. We have a couple of hundred in hand with more arriving each week, and we expect a significant tranche of improvement to land during the fourth quarter this year. So I think we're in pretty good shape when it comes to our chassis. We see the normal, what I would call normal course of business sporadic disruptions associated with chassis for both other domestic partners as well as steamship lines. But again, I would consider that normal course of business. Outside the gate, we are seeing supply chains impacted by the congestions of first mile last mile on the street, elevated street wells as well as volume fluctuations associated with different ports, a lot of drayage capacity issues and, of course, available warehouse space. And if you read the papers the way I do, you see a lot of ships waiting offshore at a number of ports, which has really not shrunk very much. Sure. Absolutely. The first thing our customers want. And by the way, let me just say, we are so lucky to have a great coalition of partners that we do business with every day, and they really want us to have an executable train schedule. They want to have a predictable service product. And so they have been highly collaborative with us as we've gone through the TOP|SPG process. To look at the changes that were necessary to improve the executability of our product. And I can't say enough about the collaboration that we've had with them. And I think we're starting to see some early results. And I think that they would say the same thing. So we're encouraged by those results, but I am most particularly encouraged by the level of the collaboration that we've enjoyed with our partners. Yes. We stay very, very close to that. We're always looking at what truck prices are doing. Again, contract prices have stabilized at very high levels. We're always looking at the gap between what we believe the value that we're offering versus what a truck offers. And we looked at a number of lanes specifically where we offer intermodal service as an example, and we're comfortable that our door-to-door pricing is very competitive against over-the-road trucking. And let me remind everyone, including myself, there are multiple advantages to using rail versus the highway, including sustainability. We've seen a lot of our customers make commitments publicly about what it's going to take for them to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. And when we think about the consumer packaged goods business, approximately 80% of the greenhouse gas comes from transportation. The efficiency advantage that we deliver for our customers over a long period of time is going to help them achieve those goals. Let me just add to the fact that the number of people we're adding, it requires a lot more energy and people to get the network sped up to where it needs to be. And then also that the number of people we're adding. And once we're up to speed, gives us the capacity, additional head count capacity to handle even greater volume. So I think that's the other point is the capacity dividend that a faster network provides will allow us to take on more volume."

            "name": "Mark George",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed. As Alan noted, our EPS grew $0.17 or 5% in the quarter, while the operating ratio contracted 260 basis points. On Slide 16, we reconcile some of the drivers for both of those changes. Recall the $55 million discrete property sale in Q2 of 2021 that impacted our OR by 200 basis points. Also in Q2 last year, there was a state tax law change that impacted EPS by $0.09 and had a 220 basis point favorable impact on last year's Q2 effective tax rate. This year, we have some outsized impacts and claims related to accrual adjustments, but also an accrual related to a legal case. All totaling $16 million, and that creates a 50 basis point headwind on our operating ratio and a nickel drag on EPS. That leaves a modest 10 basis point increase in core OR that was heavily impacted by 140 basis points of headwind from fuel. Shifting to the overall reported highlights on Slide 17. As Ed discussed, revenues grew 16% despite the 3% volume decline, thanks to strong RPU again this quarter. Operating expenses were up 21%, driven in large part by fuel, operating income was up 9%, but net income was flat due to tax rate compares and non-operating headwinds from company-owned life insurance investments. Despite the flat net income, EPS was up 5% from the lower share count. Drilling into the operating expense components on Slide 18, nearly two-thirds of the increase in operating expense is from higher fuel cost. Increase of material and other of $75 million is affected by the $55 million property gain we called out last year and the $16 million of items that I spoke about earlier. Purchased services and rents are impacted by both inflation and our current service situation. The slower network speed is a critical driver impacting the higher equipment rents, while purchased services captures higher rates for our third-party lift contractors as well as our IT contractors. Compensation and benefits is a tailwind with lower incentive accruals, offsetting the cost of trainees as well as general wage inflation. As you can imagine, the current labor negotiations are likely to play out here in the second half and may result in incremental headwinds to comp the benefits that we are unable to estimate at this time. Shifting to the P&L below operating income on Slide 19, other income is actually an expense in the quarter of $14 million, driven by losses on our company-owned life insurance investment. I know this line item is difficult to estimate and model, so let me provide some clarity to help you at least directionally. This account is a collection of non-operating income and expense items that typically nets to about $15 million of income per quarter. On top of this, we have returns on our company-owned life insurance investments. A portion of this asset, roughly $525 million is invested in a traditional blend of equities and fixed income and we mark-to-market each quarter. These are non-cash gains or losses. And it's important to note that neither the gains nor losses from these investments are subject to income tax. As such the effective tax rate in this quarter was a bit higher than usual at 24.7%. While net income was exactly flat earnings per share increased 5% due to the accumulation of our share repurchases in the past year. Going back to income tax for a moment, I would also like to highlight that Pennsylvania enacted legislation in July to reduce their state tax rate. And the accounting for that change will have a roughly $135 million one-time non-cash favorable adjustment the income tax expense in the third quarter. Now turning to free cash flow on Slide 20, we've generated nearly $1.2 billion in free cash flow through six months with property additions trending higher than last year with strong progress being made on both our rail replacement program and our DC-to-AC locomotive conversion program. Whereas Cindy touched upon, we gain operational benefits as well as improved fuel efficiency. Incremental inflation is also having an impact on property additions so I would expect CapEx to be at the high-end of our $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion guidance range. Shareholder distributions are up and you'll observe here the 19% higher dividend payments through six months on top of continued strong share repurchase activity. And with that, I'll hand it back to Alan. Brian I'll add, in addition to first mile/last mile, we're also delivering improvements in train speed and terminal dwell as well. Yeah. I'm not going to really give you much more than the normal usual quarterly cadence. It can be a little bit volatile and real estate gains obviously can move around, even if we expect them to happen this year, they can certainly slide. So if you look so far year-to-date, we're running at about in the low $30 million range, there might be similar amount in the back half, but probably less than that, because things are moving around a little bit on us. All right, Brian. Thanks. Yeah. Chris, you're exactly right in your thinking. If you look at our Q2 OpEx numbers and take-away fuel, because fuel's going to be \u2013 what fuel's going to be as that moves, but you look at OpEx ex-fuel in the second quarter and even maybe excluding the items that I called out the $16 million that was somewhat anomalous. We would project that amount would be representative of what to expect in the last two quarters on average. So there could be some moves within any particular account or line item in the P&L, but in aggregate that's kind of the area that we're expecting. And if we have unexpected events, we'll call them out to you, like we typically do in our quarterly calls. We expect it to moderate, yes as we go through the balance of the year. Justin thanks. This is Mark. Certainly a portion of it is fuel for sure, but I think the real issue here is just the volume has not come the way we expected it to come. When we were talking about middle of the quarter there about still having a path to our prior guidance, it was really going to require that we saw an upward inflection on volumes take hold pretty quickly and lead to some sustainable ramp that obviously did not happen as we concluded Q2. And we're now projecting more of a gradual ramp in volumes, as we're seeing service start to improve here. And then yes, fuel that you heard its 140 basis points headwind. Now in the second quarter, it's bigger than we had expected. We do think it moderates as we go through the back half of the year. We're not \u2013 we can't control that, we're not sure. We do take into account the fuel curves, when we look at our projections for fuel but certainly fuel is an element of that change as well. And Amit, so that leads to pretty much the volume profile as well. We'll probably see more of a ramp into fourth quarter with more volume that should help the operating ratio. But of course, there are seasonal headwinds that typically take effect in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter that might neutralize some of that when we look at the OR progression. So we're not going to give the quarterly guidance, but it does seem to be probably a little bit more of an upward \u2013 I'm sorry, a little bit more of a gradual improvement in the OR as we go through the balance of the year as volumes come on mainly in the fourth quarter. The volume growth, I should say, comes on mainly in the fourth quarter. Well, I think we're going to \u2013 I would fully expect that we'll see sequential improvement from the second to the third quarter. I'm just \u2013 I'm not going to tell you yet whether we'll also see sequential improvement from the third quarter or to the fourth quarter or if there'll be somewhat on par with one another. Thank you, Amit. And Ari, I also remind you, in a difficult service environment like we're dealing with, there's a fair amount of incremental costs that we're absorbing to have to cope with it, whether it's incremental overtime, whether it's recrews, whether it's train costs, you name it, training, travel, taxi, there's a fair amount of cost right now that we're absorbing in our P&L to deal with the current service challenges. So that starts to lessen as service improves, and I think you need to keep that in mind. Absolutely. We're talking to our partners every day. And frankly, the truck prices are loosening, but our customers remind us every single day that those are from historically very high levels. And the contract rates have stabilized. There are a number of things that our customers want, but one of them is they want to do more business with us. Our customers have freight that they would like to put on the railroad and as our network throughput capacity improves through network velocity, they're going to do that. They have \u2013 we have line of sight on freight that want to move on the railroad right now, whether it's in our industrial markets, our consumer markets or energy markets. And we're confident that as the network velocity improves, our customers are going to find additional value in the product that we're able to deliver to them, and that will manifest itself in additional volumes later this year. Hey Bascome, thanks a lot for the question. This is Mark. Look, we've agreed with PEB that we weren't going to discuss publicly what our relative positions are. But I will tell you, we have accrued a level of back wages that reflects our efforts to keep our craft workers amongst the highest paid in any industry. And obviously, if there's a settlement that is at a different level, whether that happens through the PEB or subsequent to the PEB, we will have to make an adjustment, and we will make that very, very clear in terms of disclosure to you all what the impact will be. So again, whatever that increment is, we'll let you know. But right now, we are accruing something based upon what our expectations were. Yes. We have to work with the accountants to understand what the trigger event will be. So I'm not really at liberty to pinpoint that right now on this call. Thank you, Bascome. It's really more of a lifestyle \u2013 Jeff, it's really more of a lifestyle challenge in a very unique market where everybody is looking for talent. So you have to compete against everybody simultaneously. So labor has their choice of what they want to do. And in many cases, despite the very rich and attractive pay structure that the railroads offer, sometimes, they'd rather work in a more predictable schedule in warehousing or in home construction, where they can be nearby where they live and not stay in hotels and also just not be on call or work their shift. So we're just in a very unique environment right now where the entire labor market have their options to choose from. And a stable, reliable, predictable service product over a long period of time is exactly what our customers need to build their businesses around ours, and we can offer tremendous value and unlock value for them and for their customers by delivering that kind of service. That's what we're committed to over the long-term, delivering a high level of service that our customers need that allows them to deliver growth and value for their customers."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Meghan Achimasi, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nMeghan Achimasi: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today\u2019s call we will make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section along with our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. Our full transcripts and download will be posted after the call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern\u2019s President, Alan Shaw.\nAlan Shaw: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's first quarter 2022 earnings call. I am joined today by Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. I would like to start by recognizing the contributions of Norfolk Southern's employees who have worked safely and tirelessly to serve our customers and a challenging supply chain environment. I sincerely appreciate the commitment of our employees to Norfolk Southern and our customers. Norfolk Southern delivered solid financial performance in the first quarter with record first quarter revenue, earnings per share and net income. While our operating and marketing teams worked around the clock with our customers to address current network challenges and a dynamic supply chain. We know we need to improve service and are committed to increasing network fluidity and restoring service to levels our customers deserve. Cindy will share updates on our accelerated hiring and progress of our new operating plan, TOP SPG. Viewing the results for the quarter, you'll note that revenue increased 10% as a 16% increase in revenue per unit more than offset a 5% volume decline. Expenses grew over $200 million or 13% year-over-year, due primarily to a sharp increase in fuel price. Higher fuel costs, along with slower network velocity and reduced volume contributed to an increase in our operating ratio, which was up 130 basis points versus last year's first quarter record. We remain confident in our ability to improve service while simultaneously delivering productivity and growth. Our outlook is bright. I'll now turn the discussion to Cindy for an update on operations. Cindy?\nCindy Sanborn: Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk to you all today about the outlook for our operations. During the past quarter, resource levels have challenged the fluidity of our operation, yet we have continued our momentum on increasing train size. We are in the very early days of seeing the fruits of our hiring initiatives and are working every avenue to improve service levels as quickly as possible. I'll provide an update on our Thoroughbred operating plan initiative as well as what we're doing with technology to make the railroad safer and more productive. First, turning to slide 6 as a recap of our operational activity metrics in the quarter, GTMs were down slightly, outperforming the unit volume decline as mix shifted modestly towards our heavier merchandise and coal segments. Our crew starts were down 5% in the quarter, which is a good news, bad news story. Resource levels prohibited us from operating some starts that we would have preferred to operate and our recovery mechanism was challenged as a result. However, on the positive side of the ledger, we continue to drive very beneficial road train consolidations across our segments, most pronounced in our boat franchise as we move similar coal tonnage with 6% fewer train starts and saw train weight up across the board for intermodal, merchandise and bulk. In an effort to improve resiliency, we kept a portion of the surge locomotive fleet active, yet we still achieved another quarter of fuel efficiency improvement. Turning to network performance on slide 7, train speed and terminal dwell closely resembled the levels they were at in the fourth quarter. Qualified T&E levels continued to decline throughout the quarter, culminating in what we expect to be the trough in March. As we start to see relief in certain areas, we are prioritizing crew starts that can have the most impact on customer service levels, and we are redeploying our go teams when possible. I want to reiterate that improving service levels is our top priority. And turning to slide 8, I will provide more detail on where we are with our hiring efforts. As we progress through 2021, we quickly identified the need to increase hiring within our transportation workforce. We were met with a very challenging labor market that made our ramp-up time longer than expected but we responded with a robust plan to streamline our pre-employment process, deploy a variety of financial incentives and mobilize additional onboarding resources. These efforts have paid off in a big way in 2022, and we now have over 800 conductor trainees on the property. As a result, we now expect our qualified T&E headcount to begin growing sequentially throughout the remainder of the year. We are laser focused on utilizing these additional employees to improve service levels and provide a solid platform from which to launch top SPG, which I will discuss on slide 9. As we did last quarter, I want to reiterate the approach of focusing on service, productivity and growth as equal pillars in our latest evolution of the top plan, which we envision launching in late second quarter. Let's talk about service quality and resiliency first. Several key elements of PSR are having a simple and executable operation as well as having a balance. You heard us talk about some of these PSR fundamentals when TOP21 was rolled out, and we now need to revisit a few of them with a renewed focus while ensuring they are embedded in all of our segments, including intermodal. One of the greatest strengths of our network is the quality and positioning of our intermodal franchise. And as we've performed the zero-based review of how we link together our major markets, we found opportunities to simplify how we connect those terminals while providing more capacity than what we have today. This will include ensuring we have assets flowing across our network in a balanced fashion so that less intervention is required for resources to be in the right place at the right time. Let me be clear, TOP SPG is another lever we're pulling to improve our service and represents an evolution of our current operating plan. This pathway towards enhanced service will allow us to better plan forward and execute longer trains. Additionally, going back to the idea of encompassing all business segments, while we've made great progress on enhancing book train sizes within coal, there is more runway ahead. Other facets of the bulk network such as grain, will see benefits as we develop the capability to run longer trains through those parts of the network, such as the mid west. This productivity dividend is very complementary to the service pillar as it will give us more flexibility to handle commodity volatility. These improvements in train productivity have obvious benefits of reducing labor intensity but will also propel further fuel efficiency improvements. Finally, these efforts will ensure that we grow capacity within our terminals and along our main lines, including the initiatives I've discussed with you before, to bolster our infrastructure with targeted siding extensions that are actively coming online. We are going to provide the capacity our customers want to grow with us organically while still creating the flexibility to respond quickly and effectively to new opportunities. Moving to our safety update on slide 10. We have seen improvement in both FRA train accidents per ton miles moved as well as the FRA injury index year-over-year. However, we will not be satisfied as long as there is a single injury or accident, which is why we continue our efforts to get better in this area every day. First, on the engagement front. In 2021, we conducted our first annual safety survey, which was across the entire workforce. This has provided us with insight on what and where we need to focus our engagement efforts. We've expanded our field training program to leverage outlets such as online training, classroom training and our signature safety train events so that we empower our workforce to actively engage in our goal of continuous improvement when it comes to safety. Lastly, we're making great progress building momentum with technology investments that are focused on safe and efficient operations, and I'll give a great example on slide 11 with an update where we are with one of our key technology pillars; automation. More specifically, we are using machine vision technology to detect component failures before they occur. We're in the process of deploying fully automated inspection corridors, which will cover more than 90% of the cars moving across our network using a variety of systems to detect signs and symptoms of pending failures before they occur. Equally as important as deploying the hardware is developing the next-generation AI algorithms that detect these failures with edge computing and procedures for intervening quickly. This is where we've made really exciting progress and we are already actively preventing incidents. We are finding that the technology is enabling us to achieve better outcomes than the human eyes alone can achieve. One reason for this is the power of seeing how these components are behaving on a train in motion versus well stationary during a manual inspection. We're generating high success rates with very few false positives and detecting components that need to be replaced, but had no outward indication to the human eye. The close and effective working relationship between our data scientists and field team is creating a feedback loop that is accelerating our progress. This is one of the most revolutionary technologies we are working on, and I'm extremely excited for what we are achieving with our relentless pursuit of safety first and productivity. I will now turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Elkins: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. If you would, let's turn to slide 13. Our results for the first quarter lagged challenges that we experienced on the volume side with supply chain constraints and network fluidity. These were offset by record success in revenue per unit. Overall, our volume decreased 5% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by declines in our intermodal, automotive and steel franchises. But despite these volume declines, total revenue improved 10% year-over-year to $2.9 billion due to higher revenue from fuel surcharges and strong price gains. Within merchandise, volume declines were led by automotive and steel for chip supply and equipment cycle time challenges significantly inhibited our ability to drive growth. Partially offsetting these decreases were gains in agri fuels, feed and aggregates due to increased gasoline consumption, higher demand for agriculture products and rising levels of construction spending. Higher fuel revenue and price improvement more than offset the headwinds from volume and mix that generate 4% revenue growth year-over-year, along with record level revenue per unit. Revenue per unit less fuel was also a record for the quarter. Total intermodal shipments declined 6% in the first quarter, driven almost entirely by the international market where tight drayage capacity, high street dwell for chassis and warehouse throughput drove customers to seek alternatives to Inland Point Intermodal, or IPI. Domestic shipments grew modestly year-over-year on sustained consumer demand that outpaced supply. However, as network velocity improves, and as top SPG is implemented, we're confident that we will provide the capacity our customers need to grow. Higher revenue from fuel surcharges was the leading driver of intermodal revenue growth this quarter, followed by storage revenue, price improvement and positive mix, all leading the record quarterly revenue metrics for the franchise. Intermodal revenue per unit less fuel grew for the 21st consecutive quarter. Now moving to coal. Total volume was down slightly year-over-year in the first quarter as gains in utility shipments were offset by declines in export coal. Utility growth was driven by higher levels of demand for electric power and the need to replenish depleted inventories. Our export franchise experienced a number of acute service disruptions that limited shipments for a period of time, resulting in a year-over-year decline. But despite these volume headwinds, coal revenue grew 25%, primarily due to price gains, underscoring the near-term market demand opportunities we effectively secured. Revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel reached record levels this quarter. Now let's turn to slide 14 for our market outlook for the remainder of 2022. In general, we anticipate continued, consumer driven strength in demand and improvements in our service product. Both of these will enable us to deliver year-over-year volume and revenue growth in 2022. However, we are closely monitoring a base of uncertainty in the macro economy, including inflation at levels we haven't seen in over 40 years, rising interest rates and evolving post-pandemic labor market and ongoing global geopolitical conflict. Merchandise volume growth will be led by agriculture, forest and consumer products where we're seeing elevated demand for products such as soybeans and corn as global food supply chains face ongoing uncertainty. The USDA recently increased their expectations for export soybeans from the US amid declining foreign availability and highlighted rising demand for corn, both of which create opportunities for rail transportation. Also contributing to volume gains will be automotive for US light vehicle production is expected to improve 19% year-over-year in the month of April through December on improving chip supply. Total construction spending in the US has been steadily increasing since mid-2020 and currently sits at the highest level on record, signaling opportunities for our construction related markets. Within intermodal, our expectation is for a healthy and resilient consumer in 2022 based on a strong balance sheet, suggest an increased spending power from excess savings despite record high inflationary pressures. Growth in the consumer led economy will drive demand for our domestic intermodal service, which we expect will benefit from service improvements in the second half of the year and drive growth to offset the volume declines that we experienced at the start of the year. Sustained tightness in the truck market and rising diesel fuel prices are both contributing to an economic environment that encourages highway to rail conversion and provides a superior value proposition for our customers because of our fuel efficiency advantage, especially when compared to the highway. For our international franchise, we're working diligently to create the capacity our channel partners need to take advantage of the opportunities on Norfolk Southern. Our efforts are expected to boost volume recovery and drive year-over-year growth in intermodal this year. And lastly, turning to coal. Record high seaborne prices continue in an already strong market that is amplified by geopolitical tensions. This will provide opportunities in the near-term. Pricing is expected to remain a tailwind in the export markets. Utility shrink continues with higher natural gas prices though it will continue to be counteracted by higher coal prices. Inventories are still lower than target heading into the summer season. In our domestic met market, consumer demand remains high for domestic receivers. Coal supply availability and production remain tight in every market, which will be the determining factor and upside potential. Overall, we're confident in the growth potential for Norfolk Southern for the remainder of the year. And we expect to deliver revenue and volume growth over last year. I would like to thank our customers for their partnership and reiterate that we remain intently focused on improving service and driving value for our customers and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results. Thank you.\nMark George: Thank you, Ed. I'm on slide 16. We delivered double-digit revenue and EPS growth in the first quarter. Both were record levels for NS. Starting with revenues, the 10% growth was despite the 5% volume decline, thanks to the strong RPU growth that Ed just detailed. Operating expenses were up 13%, driven in large part by a sharp increase in fuel prices, but also higher costs related to our network challenges. Despite revenue dollar growth exceeding OpEx dollar growth, we experienced a 130 basis point increase in our operating ratio. Recall that at the first quarter conferences, we previewed pressure on our OR, compared to our original expectation of flattish sequentially due to lighter volumes that we were experiencing to start the year and also the rapid rise in fuel expense. The way it landed, fuel prices alone represented 100 basis points of OR headwind relative to our expectations as well as year-over-year. We also booked an accrual adjustment within claims expense that created another 40 basis points of headwind. The volume shortfall also adversely impacted OR as we previewed, along with incremental service related costs. These were only partially offset by the strong RPU improvements. OR side, the operating income and earnings per share were both Q1 records growing 7% and 10%, respectively. Drilling into the breakdown of operating expenses in the quarter on slide 17, you'll see that 60% of the $206 million increase in the quarter was from higher fuel prices on a year-over-year basis. Purchased services was up $31 million or 10%, driven in large part from inflation and service related costs that more than offset benefits that would typically come from lower volumes. Equipment rents increased $13 million or 17%, driven by slower network velocity and less equity earnings from TTX. The $20 million increase in materials and others is driven by a $13 million accrual adjustment in claims related to the 2017 through 2020 years based on an actuarial study. Comp and benefits were up 1%, with compensation inflation offsetting savings from lower employee levels in several categories. Qualified T&E employees were down mostly offset by conductor trainees. The unwanted attrition of qualified T&E employees drove higher overtime cost to move the freight. Shifting to slide 18. In a discussion of the P&L below operating income, other income was a $5 million expense in the quarter, driven largely by losses on the company owned life insurance investments. Pre-tax income was up 5%, while net income was up 4%. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 23%, in line with the 23% to 24% range that we guide. EPS was up 10% on the 4% net income growth, thanks to nearly 2.2 million shares repurchased in the quarter. We're moving nearly 1% of the outstanding shares. Closing with cash flow and shareholder distributions on slide 19, free cash flow was $605 million, down 19% from last year due to property additions in Q1 this year that are $124 million higher. Recall Q1 2021 property additions were quite low to start the year, due in part to weather. Free cash flow conversion in the first quarter was a healthy 86%. Despite a lower free cash flow year-over-year, shareholder distributions were nearly 7% higher with a 19% higher dividend payment and modestly higher share repurchases. We'll now turn it back to Alan for a wrap up.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you, Mark. Turning to slide 20. We show multiple approaches on how we're building upon our record of sustainability leadership. With the launch of our next-generation carbon calculator in mid-March, we've made it easier for customers to do business with us, incorporating carbon into their freight decision framework with quantifiable benefits of utilizing the most efficient and least carbon intensive mode of ground transportation. Also in March, we announced the continuation of our locomotive modernization program in partnership with Witek, which will improve our operational performance and reliability and help us achieve our science based target emission reductions, up 42% by 2034. The pace of our sustainability initiatives has increased and is recognized in the industry as evidenced by several prestigious awards received in the quarter, including named as supplier engagement leader by Carbon Disclosure Project for 2021 recognized with the 2022 Green Bond of the Year award from Environmental Finance and earning the Responsible Care Energy Efficiency Award for locomotive fuel efficiency, from the American Chemistry Council. We are incredibly proud of our progress in this area, and we will continue to build upon our sustainability initiatives, which are good for business and the right thing to do for all of our stakeholders. Let me close by confirming our commitment to deliver our targets this year. Our confidence at this stage is based on our assessment of economic indicators, which at this time remain supportive of manufacturing and consumer activity as well as our service recovery efforts associated with accelerated hiring and the successful implementation of TOP SPG. These factors will support healthy volume growth in the back half of the year. In fact, potential upside exists to our revenue outlook and energy prices remain elevated throughout the year. As you've heard from our entire team, we are disappointed with our current service levels. We are laser focused on restoring the quality of our product to a level that allows our customers to succeed and grow. We are confident that our decisive actions to restore service, including hiring and the launch of TOP SPG will create long-term sustained value for our customers and shareholders, leveraging our unique franchise strengths. Before we open the call to questions, I want to take the opportunity to thank our retiring CEO, Jim Squires for his tremendous leadership to our company over the past 30 years. During Jim's tenure as CEO, NS improved our operating ratio by more than 1,200 basis points, more than doubled our market cap and returned over $17 billion to our shareholders. He led our company through the challenges of our freight recession and global pandemic. Jim launched an industry leading digital transformation strategy, elevated sustainability to a strategic business priority and personally championed diversity and inclusion. And Jim united our team and the new headquarters in Midtown Atlanta last year. On behalf of all NS employees, retirees and stakeholders. Thank you, Jim, and we wish you and your family all the best in your well-earned retirement. We will now open the call to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, great. Thanks and good morning everybody. Maybe I just wanted to start on the outlook for the rest of the year, particularly on the operating ratio side. So I know fuel, I think, Mark, you said it was 100 basis points in the first quarter and presumably, it could be elevated and be a bit of a headwind to operating ratio in the subsequent few quarters. So I wanted to get a sense of whether the 50 to 100 basis points of OR improvement is excluding fuel or inclusive of fuel. And if it is inclusive, kind of, curious what, sort of, the incremental productivity opportunities you see that we'll be able to sustain that 50 to 100 basis points?\nAlan Shaw: Hey, Chris, this is Alan. Thanks for the question. We've got multiple paths to achieve that OR target that we put out there. And certainly, improving service is, first and foremost among those. It allows us to take on more volume, absorb costs. And as we bring more business on to the network, it comes with higher incremental margins. We did see some modest improvement in our network capacity in March. And as a result, we saw sequential volume improvements in March as well, which really helped out the trajectory of our OR within the quarter. If you look at the markets in which we're serving, we've got a stronger coal outlook. Commodity pricing certainly helps, and we should see OR improvement sequentially throughout the year. And to be clear, we're talking about OR, including fuel. The headwind that we saw in the first quarter associated with sharply rising fuel prices is something that the OR headwind, pardon me. It's something we don't anticipate as we move forward throughout the year.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Alan, I guess, can you just talk more about TOP SPG or maybe this one is for Cindy, too. Is this the new operating plan, or is that like the strategy guiding the new operating plan that you guys intend to launch later this quarter? And can you just give us some details on what's going to be implemented change-wise that can get you to better service outcomes? Thank you.\nCindy Sanborn: Hi, Brandon, this is Cindy. I'll take the question. Thanks for the question. So think of TOP SPG as a continuation of TOP21 with a pause for a pandemic in the middle. We worked on our manifest network in 2019, so two very, very great results from a service perspective. So we are now moving from the manifest to looking at intermodal specifically. The three main things that we're pulling from our analysis of where we are is -- where we want to be is balancing the network, executability of the plan and embedded in that is train size. And so those are the main initiatives around TOP21 generally and as it applies to intermodal specifically. We also have some secondary thoughts around what we expect the intermodal product to look like that include outlet frequency as well as blocking density. So got a lot that we're working on looking at that product and basically taking a very unconstrained view and then building up into what we think that's going to look like. And as we noted, it would be -- we'd probably implement that towards the second half of -- back half of this quarter. And, obviously, with great communication with our employees as well as our customers. So we're largely in that phase of it. And then as we continue from there, we're going to look at our bulk network. We have -- we've seen some great efficiencies in the numbers. And in my prepared remarks, I talked about both train size and efficiencies there. And we've seen that really in our Lamberts Point coal market coming out of West Virginia going down to the port with export coal. But we think with opportunities both from a standpoint of doubling up trains other than those types of trains, it could be trains coming over Chicago to interchange as well as our own grain trains. And then secondly, behind that, on our local service for our bulk network, that's origin destination payer on an as, we think there's opportunity just to grow train size generally. We've seen some improvement with one of our metals customers in that regard, and we've got more work to do there. So I think what you'll see is as we implement it in the back half of the quarter, it will start with intermodal, and then we'll layer in and add into that over the course of the year, the bulk opportunities.\nBrandon Oglenski: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Ed, when you break down the revenue variance of the different groups, for intermodal and coal, especially, this rate mix and other component is pretty tremendous. Is there any way to kind of further parse out what is pure rate and potentially stickier going forward as we think about RPU as volumes start to inflect positively? And how much of it is maybe more temporary along the lines of storage, et cetera?\nEd Elkins: Sure. And thank you for the question. We have a strong environment out there for demand, for our services, and that includes, of course, price associated with that. Price is a little bit north of one-third in terms of the total composition. I will tell you that storage is another component there later on top of that pure price number. And we expect, as service improves, this year. And as supply chains improved throughout the year, we're going to see that storage number decline as the steamship lines in particular, require less storage and are able to deliver more throughput capacity.\nJon Chappell: Okay. So just to be clear, that one-third of price, is that intermodal and coal, or was that just intermodal and coal maybe is a bigger\u2026\nEd Elkins: That's the whole shooting match. That's our portfolio.\nJon Chappell: Got it. All right. Thank you Ed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: Hey thanks, good morning. And best of luck to you, Jim. Mark, I wanted to just ask the -- any thoughts on the operating ratio for second quarter just to help give us some comfort on the bridge to the full year guidance? And then Ed, just on the RPU less fuel for merchandise, it was only up 3%, which just feels a little light given the pricing environment and the inflationary environment. Does that get incrementally better from here, do you think?\nMark George: You want to start first?\nAlan Shaw: I'll start first with the last question on price. We -- I think you're right familiar with the composition of our portfolio in general, which mean every year, about half of our business comes up for pricing. We've still got probably a majority of that to go for the year on merchandise. And we are expecting to continue to deliver value in the form of yield based off the demand that we see out there, and as our ability to deliver capacity for that demand continues to improve this year. We have a contract portfolio that's stacked with not only long-term contracts that you're all familiar with, but also the short-term. We're testing the short-term right now. And we're delivering what we call very encouraging results. I would also say this, our customers are also delivering some encouraging results on their own that they're reporting to us in terms of their ability to attract new business and price.\nMark George: And Scott, with regard to the operating ratio, obviously, we've stuck to our guidance for the full year. And we're going to see progressive improvement sequentially as we go through the year with more of the improvement really in the back half as we enjoy the recovery in service and in particular, in the fourth quarter. But I don't want to get any more granular with that given the dynamics in the marketplace.\nScott Group: Would you still expect it to be worse year-over-year in 2Q?\nMark George: Well, remember in 2Q, we had a fairly large property gain that was -- really had a good lowering effect on our operating ratio. So all in year-over-year, it would be really hard to get close to that number, but it will be certainly better than where we are right now. We saw within the first quarter, the operating ratio -- the rate of operating ratio improvement from January and February when volumes were very muted to what we saw in February -- in the month of March was a pretty nice improvement. And I expect that in the second quarter with volumes at least holding at these levels and perhaps starting to ramp up a little bit, we'll see a nice jump. But Q2 is a very tough compare because of that that land sale that we had called out.\nScott Group: Yeah. Okay. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, Operator. You guys mentioned that there could be some upside to the numbers if fuel remains high. I'm assuming that could come in the form of intermodal and coal as well on the export or maybe even domestic side. Could you talk a little bit about how you're equipped to handle that business in terms of the fluidity of the network? And then are there any investments needed in the coal franchise,, which we all know has not been getting ramped up over the last four, five years?\nMark George: Yeah, sure. Let's talk about coal specifically. That's been a market that's been supported by price driven by capacity tightness. And with the current geopolitical disruptions that are out there, the market's got even hotter. And so we are very well equipped, I believe, with our franchise going to the labors point to deliver value for our customers and for the marketplace on the export side. And that includes -- we are ensuring that we have the fleet necessary to deliver that value. We know that there's some incremental capacity coming on later this year. And so we are working right now to repair those portions of the fleet that are needed so that we have a good order fleet of coal cars that can deliver value over Lamberts Point as well as to the rest of our customers that rely on that fleet.\nCindy Sanborn: And as far as the network is concerned, you mentioned intermodal as well. I mean, obviously, the hiring that we're doing and you see the numbers and number of qualified employees starting to tick up. We expect that to continue through the quarter. I'm very, very optimistic about that. And I think that as that starts to be felt, I think, in addition, the intermodal impact -- intermodal TOP SPG focus is also going to help us in the intermodal side. It really does do -- it's completely streamlined between terminal operations and road operations to drive some of the efficiencies that I described before. So I think that will give us a great platform for being able to meet much more of the demand that we're meeting right now.\nMark George: And to reiterate, our customers wants to grow. And on the intermodal side, in particular, we're blessed with a great portfolio of customers who are investing for growth in 2022, and we're making sure that we're going to be able to deliver for them. With the way fuel prices are currently, we have a compelling product in the marketplace, which will only become more compelling as we're able to deliver more capacity.\nCindy Sanborn: And I guess I would add one more on coal\u2026\nAlan Shaw: Go ahead. I'm sorry, Cindy.\nCindy Sanborn: Yeah, Jason, on coal, I should have also mentioned, we really have had a solid service product to the port throughout the year. And part of what you've heard me talk about, and I referenced it in my prepared remarks around train size has been the demand that we've seen, being able to double those trains up and operate the tons with less labor intensity has been consistent throughout the year, and we expect it to continue.\nJason Seidl: Great. Let me just send my best wishes to Jim before I sign off. Everyone, thanks for the time as always.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So Cindy, sticking with you, obviously, the STB is having the hearing on urgent service issues. It seems like they want some improvement here in the next 30 to 60 days. So I wanted to see if there's anything in particular that you had in the pipeline. If you could maybe accomplish that, that you haven't really talked about yet here? And then also, when you think about retention, obviously, a lot of the service improvement contests contingent rather upon that inflection. But are you all concerned about retention of the trainee size staying at the rate it is retention of the more experienced people on the line of road? How are you feeling about that? What's your level of confidence in there, are there any other actions you can take to increase that retention level? Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Hi, good morning Brian. Thanks for the question. I'm going to start with that and then turn it over to Cindy. And just to be crystal clear, restoring service is the top priority of this entire leadership and every employee at Norfolk Southern. Personally, I've been out in the field and I've been in our dispatch center, and I really see the pride that our employees have in serving our customers and serving our -- serving the US economy. I'm really encouraged by the employee engagement, and I'm very encouraged about the steps that we're taking right now to restore our service product to where it needs to be.\nCindy Sanborn: And Brian, yeah, I saw you yesterday at the STB hearings. The focus of the committee around of the Board around trying to restore service as quickly as possible. We are lockstep in line with that mindset. And other -- I think we have brought to bear everything we can to do just that. I can't think of anything that I heard yesterday that helps move it forward any faster. So we're going to -- as Alan has noted, we are laser focused on this. So I think a TOP SPG will help us. I mean there's just a number of initiatives that we have already. And I think those are the ones that we're going to -- we'll stick with, and I think they will bear fruit for us. In terms of the retention of trainees, that is something that we look at and make our hiring decisions based on that and they differ between some of the hiring groups that we have. We have put in signing bonuses at various levels based on attracting trainees and clearly outline what the job is to trainees and makes -- work very hard to make sure that we do keep the ones that we get in. That said, one of the things that we also do once they are on and training is provide the work life in terms of being on call and working different shifts and working weekends in the training program to make sure they really do understand what it is we're expecting as a railroad employee. And to some extent, that may accelerate attrition, but that attrition comes early rather than later because it would ultimately come. So we feel like that's the best way to make sure that we manage the -- a promoted trainee very effectively or the promoted conductor very effectively by trying to manage it on the front end. But we do see high attrition in the training ranks, but we plan for that.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay. So just to summarize, it does feel like you're communicating is you are at an inflection point in terms of getting the T&E, the right number of people in the right place?\nCindy Sanborn: Well, you're seeing it on the slide that we showed with qualified teen, it's starting to tick up and looking at our hiring locations and the number of trainees that we have in place, we are in flight right now. We feel really good about being -- seeing good -- as we started the second quarter and ended in the second quarter, we will see improvement across that timeline and acceleration from that. So I'm really enthusiastic about where we stand.\nAlan Shaw: And you couple that with the implementation of TOP SPG late this quarter and a number of other specific tactical initiatives that Cindy has every day to improve the quality of our service and our labor utilization. We've got a good runway ahead of us.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay. Thank you for the time. Appreciated.\nAlan Shaw: Thanks Brian.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah, hi. Just a follow-up on TOP SPG. I'm wondering, I know the deployment is forthcoming. How long would you see -- how long do you think it will take to actually fully deploy and start to see the benefits? Is this something that you start to see the impact relatively quickly? And then just as a follow-up, I'm assuming I can't remember completely that intermodal planning was part of the original PSR efforts three or so years ago. So is this just a function of three years in, hey, these are adjustments we need to make because something is not working completely right? Thank you.\nCindy Sanborn: Yeah, Jordan. I would say that it's really just, as I described, unconstrained approach. I mean, things have changed over time post-pandemic included. And the original TOP21 was -- the plan was to continue on with intermodal. And there are certain trains that could actually carry both. And that does exist today, and we probably have an opportunity or two to have it in the new version here. But this is -- it's really about, again, take an unconstrained approach and figuring out how to balance our network, make sure we have a good executable plan and improve train size. So those are the main tenants of what the output should be. Now in terms of benefits, I mean, intermodal is about 20% of our crew starts. So we will see it affecting that part of our business and we'll implement schedule changes and those types of things as we roll it out fairly quickly. So I feel like that one will see some benefits as we get into the third quarter. But then we'll move on to the bulk side. So I think it will be TOP SPG generally will be something that allow -- it will be something that will take longer than just the intermodal portion that will continue on through the year and beyond in some cases where we have bulk opportunities in places where there's some physical infrastructure constraints.\nAlan Shaw: Cindy, I think we think of it as a process of continual improvement.\nCindy Sanborn: Yeah, absolutely.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Good morning, and Jim, again, best of luck and Alan and Cindy, I know everybody has been harping on this, but maybe if I can maybe come at it a different way, on PSR was all about resilience and something goes wrong, it kind of fixed itself. We're now in the second phase of it with TOP SPG. So maybe you could just dumb it down for me. Is it just employees that you need that -- as the STB said you kind of overdid it, now you've got to get them to get the service back? Is it that the plan wasn't the rightfully built plan and now you kind of need to fix it and you talked about keeping a surge locomotive fleet. So what is it that needs to get the fluidity up? And then on the tail end of that, you've talked a lot about intermodal and the shift of freight east, yet international volumes down 20%. I guess, is that part of this equation of not enough employees at the congestion still on the network, maybe walk through what has to happen to clean that up as well? Thanks a lot.\nAlan Shaw: Thanks, Ken. With respect to how we're approaching this thing, I mean, to be clear, our first priority is restoring our service. And our entire organization laser focused on delivering that objective. Once we've gotten that near-term goal, we are going to perform a retrospective analysis on how we got into this position. And we're going to understand what signals we missed, how we can improve the process and what mitigates we can put in place going forward. For us, we firmly believe that right now, it's a combination of our employee level and our service plan, which is why we very quickly implemented decisively initiatives to increase our hiring and to redesign our operating plan. That redesign of the operating plan is going to improve our balance, it's going to improve the simplicity of our product, and it's going to improve the executability of our product, which is going to help the service product in all three of our franchises. Ed, do you want to talk specifically about international intermodal?\nEd Elkins: Sure, absolutely. And thanks for the question. In terms of the Intercontinental supply chain, which delivers products to the US consumer from -- primarily from Asia, but from other places, well, there's been tremendous volatility as everybody on this call already knows. Not only our supply chain stress in the US, and that includes really all the components of that supply chain, which are the ports, warehouses, railroads, truckers, retailers and other outlet venues. But it also includes the lines themselves on the water and in -- at the port of origin. So there's been a lot of volatility there. We have seen steamship lines make decisions that really allow themselves to have more flexibility. And then part of that is because of the congestion, which we've experienced, which is supply chain experience. But we're seeing some very encouraging signs in terms of where that goes going forward. We believe that intermodal still offers substantial value not only for the state line, but for their customers, especially in a high fuel environment or a high fuel price environment. We think there's a compelling story there that we can deliver value for over the long-term. And as we see those supply chains start to loosen up this year as the lockdowns in Asia continue to ease, we hope, we're going to see, we believe, customers look to IPI again for a way to add value on the inland supply chains. But there's a few forward-looking indicators or leading indicators that we want to look at, that's warehouse availability, drayage capacity? It's a dynamic situation.\nKen Hoexter: Wonderful, Alan. I appreciate the time. Thanks guys.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Morning everyone. Jim, best of luck from us as well. I had a couple of questions on train length. Just to understand that a little bit better, there's increasing train length at a time when, obviously, network fluidity is not great and service is challenging. Does that help or hurt at the current moment? Obviously, I get the long-term benefits of increasing train length. But at this time, I just wanted to check if it helps or hurts. And as a follow-up to that, I know the STB is very focused on service levels as a whole, but there's also been some scrutiny on train length specifically especially at a congressional level and some reasonable shippers as well. So I'm just wondering if there's a natural limit to that or if there's demising returns over time? Thanks.\nCindy Sanborn: Ravi, thanks. I think train length really helps us right now. It improves our lessons or labor intensity. Now there's a point to, which if you're unable to meet trains at multiple locations on a particular district, it could work against you to your point. But I think where we are finding opportunities to move more traffic with one crew that is really to our advantage. So I don't see it working against us both near-term, nor do I see it working against us long term. We want to be able to match our train size to our locomotive pulling capability. And as we invest in locomotives and you've heard me talk about that in our prepared remarks, with DC/AC conversions, it's very helpful to us to improve train length. From the standpoint of what the STB might do, I don't know. I know that it is a topic that even FRA brings up from time-to-time. But I truly believe that the technology that's brought to us with distributed power capability makes it a very safe and effective operation. I don't see a reason that we should expect or want or think necessary, any restrictions on train length as long as we're continuing to move fluidly and not getting longer than the district that we need to run on.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Hi, everyone. Mark, you\u2019ve been helpful in the past talking about the cadence of absolute cost. I mean, I think we're in a somewhat uncertain volume environment as we look out six to nine months. I think it would be helpful to get your perspective on what you have visibility on, which is the absolute cost structure. So can you talk about at $1.8 billion in the first quarter, where you expect the cost structure to -- how do you expect it to move over the next few quarters? And then I just had one clarifying question. When you talked about the year-on-year change on the second quarter OR, I fully understand the land gain, bringing that down. But it was -- I think it's 60.3% excluding that. Do you expect to be better than that or worse than that year-over-year, or is it sequentially kind of the right way we should think about it for the second quarter?\nMark George: Thanks, Amit. Look, yeah, we ended this first quarter with absolute costs in that 18, 30 [ph] range. And -- when I look out from here, there'll be a step-up even excluding fuel, I think as volumes start to rise, we'll see probably a step up in absolute cost for sure. But I would still think inclusive of fuel, we're going to stay under that $1.9 billion level throughout each of the quarters going forward. Now with regard to the year-over-year change in OR in the second quarter, again, I really don\u2019t want to get into any more specifics than to say we could -- we have a good chance to be in that range, ex fuel, but I don't want to put more of a finer point on it than that -- I'm sorry, not ex fuel, ex the land gain from due two of last year. I'm hopeful we can be in that range. But there's too many variables. I don't really want to put a fine point on it.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. I appreciate you talking about the cost structure. It\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.\nMark George: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. I know that 2022 guidance for high single-digit revenue growth didn't change, but is it possible to share what you're assuming for full year volume growth within that outlook. And looking at the second quarter specifically, do you think there's the opportunity for volumes to inflect positively year-over-year?\nAlan Shaw: Yeah. Thank you for the question. We believe that not only is the US economy poised to continue to deliver growth for transportation providers who can add value, but we think that the consumer demand is going to continue here at least for the foreseeable future. And you layer in some high commodity prices and some geopolitical conflict. And we believe that the US is very well-positioned in the current environment, despite some of those headwinds that we all know about in terms of rate increases and higher fuel prices. That being said, we know that as we improve our service, as we deliver more capacity that our customers want to grow, they're poised to grow and we're going to be able to deliver that growth. So yes, I would say we're sticking with our view that we're going to be able to deliver growth for the full year in terms of volume.\nMark George: Yeah. Second quarter, in particular, was not necessarily going to be as ramp back half, so we're going to ramp toward the back half as service improves.\nJustin Long: Okay, got it. And maybe a quick follow-up on TOP SPG. I was curious if you could share how much additional capacity you think that will create in the domestic intermodal network specifically. And if we get into an environment where domestic intermodal volumes are increasing double digits, I just want to get some color on your ability to handle that over the remainder of the year?\nCindy Sanborn: Yeah, Justin, I'll mention the secondary -- kind of, the secondary order of business on TOP SPG, particularly intermodal, is to look at outlet frequency as well as blocking density that will help us be able to be as efficient as possible in our terminals and obviously then operate trains that support that. So that is a big component of the plan and how we're thinking about it, because we want to make sure that we build it with a platform to grow.\nJustin Long: Okay. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Spracklin: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to come back to the regulatory question and really some of the concerns that are raised generally about rail service. And we're hearing it now from a number of different sources, not just the STB, but from other organizations, Federal Maritime Commission, Secretary of Transportation and so forth. And I know in Canada, the regulator did make efforts to regulate service, and it was complicated and it created a fairly high level of uncertainty as the regulator tried to step in and regulate on service. Do you see any concern that -- and I know there was some calling for that that the regulator here in the US would look to follow suit and what form might that take? And do you have any concern whether that will affect your ultimate profitability if the regular starts to move in on regulating service levels?\nAlan Shaw: Yeah, Walter, that's part of that is a hypothetical as to what form could potentially take. I can tell you that we are completely aligned with our customers and our shareholders and our regulators on the intent and the focus on delivering value to our customers. And we have every economic incentive and are self-motivated to fix this problem. And as a result, we are staying actively engaged with the STB. You saw Ed and Cindy and Annie represent Norfolk Southern in the industry yesterday in that venue. And I think what you heard from them is that we are entirely focused on restoring our service levels. That's our commitment.\nWalter Spracklin: Thanks so much for the answer. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for the chance to ask the question here. The -- I guess, I mean, you've talked a lot about crew and SPG adding capacity or crew additions. What -- do you need to do one before you do the other, or I guess -- and how would you think, like, would you expect to see velocity improve before you make some of the schedule changes? I guess, I'm just thinking about related to execution risk when you make the schedule changes or perhaps they're incremental in the way you roll them out, and there's not a whole lot of execution. But I wanted to ask about those two initiatives and just how you would link them together and how you need to do them?\nCindy Sanborn: Yeah, Tom. Well, I would tell you, if I pivot back to TOP21 when we've come out of 2018 with a lot of real service challenges and implemented TOP21, really, really effectively, and it went extremely well. So we're kind of using that as an experience that we've had to implement changes in operating plans. But at the same time, we have not completely finished the plan yet, and we will engage our employees and obviously, our customers to make sure that how we implement it is the most effective way that we can implement it. And it is meant to be positive towards our service product. And if we need to do it more in a more sequential manner for that to support that, that's how we'll do it.\nTom Wadewitz: So do you -- I mean, do you think velocity needs to be 20 miles an hour before you implement something, or would you say they're not necessarily connected in terms of how well you're running before you make the schedule changes?\nCindy Sanborn: Yeah. I think that the result of the implementation should help to lift velocity. And I don't think there's a gate of how fast we should be operating before we start something. And these will obviously be very localized changes. So we'll give those line segments a really good look before we actually implement. But I don't think there's a gate, at which we have to be at a certain speed or a certain dwell in order to implement. But we'll be very thoughtful as we implement to make sure it's supportive of improvement in service and not creating problems associated with that.\nAlan Shaw: Tom, there's a dual path here, right? At the same time, we're implementing TOP SPG. We're going to start getting healthier with our crew base. And I'm very confident in the ability of our team out in the field to execute this.\nMark George: I might just add, TOP21 that we did in 2019 was really in hindsight, a revolutionary operating plan change that unlocked a tremendous amount of productivity that we harvested. I think TOP SPG is more of an evolution from that now, where we're looking to get back into an operating plan that we can execute on a more reliable manner and also resource more reliably because that's where we're dealing with the challenges on the crew resource. So what happened in the middle was the pandemic that really altered a lot of our traffic flows and our traffic mixes or commodity mixes, I should say. And that's really what necessitates us to evolve the plan a little bit and try to get back into balance. So that's one way to think of TOP SPG. So now as we go when we release the new plan, which is being -- we're going through iterations right now, internally and then ultimately with our customers, hopefully, we'll end up with more crews on the ground and we'll be able to execute in a much more predictable fashion. So they're kind of happening simultaneously.\nTom Wadewitz: And we see the result more in 3Q or in 2Q on velocity, let's say?\nMark George: Yeah, I would imagine we'll start to see it more pronounced than 3Q. That's not to say that we're not looking for opportunities here in 2Q to inflect upward.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. Thanks for all the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thanks very much and good morning. I just had another one on TOP SPG and the emphasis on the train size to drive productivity. So Cindy, I wonder if you could give us some perspective on where train size sits today and what you think the upside is as you leverage distributed power and make siding extensions and how you'd rank the remaining opportunity for train size improvement in bulk merchandise and intermodal? Thanks.\nCindy Sanborn: Cherilyn, thanks for the question. I think that you've seen train size incrementally improve over many quarters. Some of that is bringing volume on to existing trains. And that's just absorbing volume coming to us. So as we came out of the pandemic, and we had more volume coming to us, we just added to existing trains. And then there's a piece of it that's a little bit more structural. And that structural piece can be in the bulk network where we can double trains up or where we can actually increase train size by 20 cars, let's say, in our green network or so forth because that matches the pulling power of our locomotives. So as you see mix changes happen with the intermodal or bulk or manifest, that will impact what the high end of our opportunity set is, but what we're really doing is matching the train to the locomotive pulling power and capability. And as -- and I don't -- we really don't think of it as this is the output we're trying to get to. We more think about it incrementally and structurally how we can change it to improve it. But the distributed power is what's unlocking that opportunity. The technology associated with distributed power is what's unlocking that opportunity. And you're seeing us invest in our locomotives, the rebuild locomotives all come equipped with distributed power is helping us continue to do that. The locomotive fleet over the years from 2016, we started this process of DC to AC conversions has incrementally added to our ability to take on train size. So that's how we think about it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Nolan: Yeah, hi. Actually, Cindy, I wanted to follow-up on that a little bit. You talked about, I think, specifically in the intermodal part of the business that were some positive mix in there in the first quarter. And I assume that, obviously, that's the effort going forward. But how do you balance out trying to just add volume on an absolute basis versus also trying to add the premium volume that generates better margins. It's got to be a little challenging to do both at the same time, right?\nCindy Sanborn: Yeah. So we think about it in terms of balance. We think about in terms of executability. And I talked a little bit about outlet frequency. In some cases, we're running certain, several trains between two different cities but they're going to two different ramps. So how do we think about taking those two trains and getting outlets for our customers more frequently to be able to get to the destination cities and not think so hard about specifically what ramp we're going to. So that's some of what is embedded in our thinking. And then how simplify -- how can we simplify the building of the train with blocking density and being able to make blocks that are bigger. So there's a lot that goes into the inputs of how we balance train size and the internal components of how we operate the trains and the terminals between, which we operate them.\nAlan Shaw: Cindy, I would add that as we strike balance, we strike simplicity and we add crews, our train performance is going to improve. Train speed is going to improve. The quality of our product is going to improve and that's going to add more business to existing trades. And so just from that standpoint, even without a design change, we're going to add train length and train weight.\nMark George: That's exactly right. Now I would say -- just to add one other thing. The structure of our network is such that we are blessed with a lot of optionality here, both in terms of the cities that we serve, the major metropolitan areas, but also multiple robust facilities within those metro areas, which we're going to leverage to deliver a simplified and effective train plan for our customers.\nBen Nolan: All right. Appreciate. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon: Hi, good morning. I had a question for you on somewhat related to service issues, but if you think about the volume inflecting in the back half of the year, adding some congestion to the network, do you worry at all that, that might delay the recovery at least in the metrics themselves? And do you have any time frame for when we should be expecting service to kind of normalize or return to a better level? I know we're talking about inflection here in the second, third quarter, but when you think about getting fully restored, do you have a time frame for what that might look like?\nCindy Sanborn: Yeah. So I think what we've talked about is we're really confident in the pace of improvement this quarter and into the future quarters. Very dynamic environment we're dealing with. So it's hard to say when will \u2013 quote, unquote \u2013 \u201cbe back.\u201d But it's a very positive trajectory that we expect. And from a congestion standpoint, as we speed up, by definition, congestion will ease. So as we bring, it will be much easier to bring on volume because we are less congested. So we really -- the idea is to start with crew resources and plan changes to a lesser extent, but still supportive to the idea of being able to operate the railroad in a much less congested manner than we see, which will be reflected in our train speak going out.\nDavid Vernon: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just as a quick follow-up, terminal capacity, your third-party contractors that are running some of the intermodal terminals. And we've certainly heard a lot about service issues there as well. As you think about the resourcing that you're doing, can you comment at all around the resourcing that's happening at some of the terminal operations and when some of those sort of engage out problems might also start to get better?\nAlan Shaw: Sure. I'll comment on that. We've taken a very hard look at our effectiveness in terms of throughput efficiency and our ability to deliver capacity for the market through our terminals. And in many cases, there's a lot of inflation working its way through the entire US economy that manifests itself, of course, at the terminal level as well. But what we are focused on is ensuring, number one, that we have the capability at the terminal level to handle the volumes that TOP SPG is going to deliver for us going forward. We are reconfiguring some of those contracts as we speak to both make sure that we have that capacity for the future as well as ensure that the type of operation that we have is the one that we need. So we're working on that as we speak, and we're confident that as TOP SPG rolls out here, we're going to see it manifest itself as additional capacity for our customers and improved executability for the service we deliver. And the physical capacity of our intermodal footprint has allowed us to handle much higher intermodal volumes just as recently as 2018.\nMark George: Absolutely. So the physical capacity is there. We're working on our engagement with our lift contractors with shared service metrics, and we're working on how we can improve our own performance with the trains. And I think that's a recipe for success for our customers.\nDavid Vernon: Thank you. That\u2019s helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nBascome Majors: Yeah. Apologies, I was on mute there. So your largest domestic intermodal chatter partner recently renewed this valves with their Western real partner, committed to a really big capital investment going to drive midterm growth and share gain from highway. Can you talk a little bit about what your appetite for that type of commitment and customer visibility it might provide is? Is it Norfolk? And whether a firmed up or expanded channel partner deal would be more and less likely after you get through some of the operating plan changes that you're currently undergoing for intermodal? Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Well, there's probably very little I can talk about any of those things. But let me say this, we are blessed with a fantastic portfolio of customers. The customer you're talking about is a very valued partner of ours, including some others. And they are positioning themselves for growth. Our customers want to grow, they are poised to grow. They're investing for growth, and we are, too. And so you put the combination of very powerful intermodal franchise. We would argue the best certainly in the Eastern United States, put that together with a robust portfolio of partners who are delivering value for their customers in the marketplace. And I think it's already a great combination. It can only get stronger.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Shaw for any final comments.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you for your time and your questions, and I appreciate you joining our call this morning.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alan Shaw",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's first quarter 2022 earnings call. I am joined today by Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. I would like to start by recognizing the contributions of Norfolk Southern's employees who have worked safely and tirelessly to serve our customers and a challenging supply chain environment. I sincerely appreciate the commitment of our employees to Norfolk Southern and our customers. Norfolk Southern delivered solid financial performance in the first quarter with record first quarter revenue, earnings per share and net income. While our operating and marketing teams worked around the clock with our customers to address current network challenges and a dynamic supply chain. We know we need to improve service and are committed to increasing network fluidity and restoring service to levels our customers deserve. Cindy will share updates on our accelerated hiring and progress of our new operating plan, TOP SPG. Viewing the results for the quarter, you'll note that revenue increased 10% as a 16% increase in revenue per unit more than offset a 5% volume decline. Expenses grew over $200 million or 13% year-over-year, due primarily to a sharp increase in fuel price. Higher fuel costs, along with slower network velocity and reduced volume contributed to an increase in our operating ratio, which was up 130 basis points versus last year's first quarter record. We remain confident in our ability to improve service while simultaneously delivering productivity and growth. Our outlook is bright. I'll now turn the discussion to Cindy for an update on operations. Cindy? Thank you, Mark. Turning to slide 20. We show multiple approaches on how we're building upon our record of sustainability leadership. With the launch of our next-generation carbon calculator in mid-March, we've made it easier for customers to do business with us, incorporating carbon into their freight decision framework with quantifiable benefits of utilizing the most efficient and least carbon intensive mode of ground transportation. Also in March, we announced the continuation of our locomotive modernization program in partnership with Witek, which will improve our operational performance and reliability and help us achieve our science based target emission reductions, up 42% by 2034. The pace of our sustainability initiatives has increased and is recognized in the industry as evidenced by several prestigious awards received in the quarter, including named as supplier engagement leader by Carbon Disclosure Project for 2021 recognized with the 2022 Green Bond of the Year award from Environmental Finance and earning the Responsible Care Energy Efficiency Award for locomotive fuel efficiency, from the American Chemistry Council. We are incredibly proud of our progress in this area, and we will continue to build upon our sustainability initiatives, which are good for business and the right thing to do for all of our stakeholders. Let me close by confirming our commitment to deliver our targets this year. Our confidence at this stage is based on our assessment of economic indicators, which at this time remain supportive of manufacturing and consumer activity as well as our service recovery efforts associated with accelerated hiring and the successful implementation of TOP SPG. These factors will support healthy volume growth in the back half of the year. In fact, potential upside exists to our revenue outlook and energy prices remain elevated throughout the year. As you've heard from our entire team, we are disappointed with our current service levels. We are laser focused on restoring the quality of our product to a level that allows our customers to succeed and grow. We are confident that our decisive actions to restore service, including hiring and the launch of TOP SPG will create long-term sustained value for our customers and shareholders, leveraging our unique franchise strengths. Before we open the call to questions, I want to take the opportunity to thank our retiring CEO, Jim Squires for his tremendous leadership to our company over the past 30 years. During Jim's tenure as CEO, NS improved our operating ratio by more than 1,200 basis points, more than doubled our market cap and returned over $17 billion to our shareholders. He led our company through the challenges of our freight recession and global pandemic. Jim launched an industry leading digital transformation strategy, elevated sustainability to a strategic business priority and personally championed diversity and inclusion. And Jim united our team and the new headquarters in Midtown Atlanta last year. On behalf of all NS employees, retirees and stakeholders. Thank you, Jim, and we wish you and your family all the best in your well-earned retirement. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Hey, Chris, this is Alan. Thanks for the question. We've got multiple paths to achieve that OR target that we put out there. And certainly, improving service is, first and foremost among those. It allows us to take on more volume, absorb costs. And as we bring more business on to the network, it comes with higher incremental margins. We did see some modest improvement in our network capacity in March. And as a result, we saw sequential volume improvements in March as well, which really helped out the trajectory of our OR within the quarter. If you look at the markets in which we're serving, we've got a stronger coal outlook. Commodity pricing certainly helps, and we should see OR improvement sequentially throughout the year. And to be clear, we're talking about OR, including fuel. The headwind that we saw in the first quarter associated with sharply rising fuel prices is something that the OR headwind, pardon me. It's something we don't anticipate as we move forward throughout the year. I'll start first with the last question on price. We -- I think you're right familiar with the composition of our portfolio in general, which mean every year, about half of our business comes up for pricing. We've still got probably a majority of that to go for the year on merchandise. And we are expecting to continue to deliver value in the form of yield based off the demand that we see out there, and as our ability to deliver capacity for that demand continues to improve this year. We have a contract portfolio that's stacked with not only long-term contracts that you're all familiar with, but also the short-term. We're testing the short-term right now. And we're delivering what we call very encouraging results. I would also say this, our customers are also delivering some encouraging results on their own that they're reporting to us in terms of their ability to attract new business and price. Go ahead. I'm sorry, Cindy. Thank you. Hi, good morning Brian. Thanks for the question. I'm going to start with that and then turn it over to Cindy. And just to be crystal clear, restoring service is the top priority of this entire leadership and every employee at Norfolk Southern. Personally, I've been out in the field and I've been in our dispatch center, and I really see the pride that our employees have in serving our customers and serving our -- serving the US economy. I'm really encouraged by the employee engagement, and I'm very encouraged about the steps that we're taking right now to restore our service product to where it needs to be. And you couple that with the implementation of TOP SPG late this quarter and a number of other specific tactical initiatives that Cindy has every day to improve the quality of our service and our labor utilization. We've got a good runway ahead of us. Thanks Brian. Cindy, I think we think of it as a process of continual improvement. Thanks, Ken. With respect to how we're approaching this thing, I mean, to be clear, our first priority is restoring our service. And our entire organization laser focused on delivering that objective. Once we've gotten that near-term goal, we are going to perform a retrospective analysis on how we got into this position. And we're going to understand what signals we missed, how we can improve the process and what mitigates we can put in place going forward. For us, we firmly believe that right now, it's a combination of our employee level and our service plan, which is why we very quickly implemented decisively initiatives to increase our hiring and to redesign our operating plan. That redesign of the operating plan is going to improve our balance, it's going to improve the simplicity of our product, and it's going to improve the executability of our product, which is going to help the service product in all three of our franchises. Ed, do you want to talk specifically about international intermodal? Thank you Ken. Yeah. Thank you for the question. We believe that not only is the US economy poised to continue to deliver growth for transportation providers who can add value, but we think that the consumer demand is going to continue here at least for the foreseeable future. And you layer in some high commodity prices and some geopolitical conflict. And we believe that the US is very well-positioned in the current environment, despite some of those headwinds that we all know about in terms of rate increases and higher fuel prices. That being said, we know that as we improve our service, as we deliver more capacity that our customers want to grow, they're poised to grow and we're going to be able to deliver that growth. So yes, I would say we're sticking with our view that we're going to be able to deliver growth for the full year in terms of volume. Yeah, Walter, that's part of that is a hypothetical as to what form could potentially take. I can tell you that we are completely aligned with our customers and our shareholders and our regulators on the intent and the focus on delivering value to our customers. And we have every economic incentive and are self-motivated to fix this problem. And as a result, we are staying actively engaged with the STB. You saw Ed and Cindy and Annie represent Norfolk Southern in the industry yesterday in that venue. And I think what you heard from them is that we are entirely focused on restoring our service levels. That's our commitment. Tom, there's a dual path here, right? At the same time, we're implementing TOP SPG. We're going to start getting healthier with our crew base. And I'm very confident in the ability of our team out in the field to execute this. Cindy, I would add that as we strike balance, we strike simplicity and we add crews, our train performance is going to improve. Train speed is going to improve. The quality of our product is going to improve and that's going to add more business to existing trades. And so just from that standpoint, even without a design change, we're going to add train length and train weight. Sure. I'll comment on that. We've taken a very hard look at our effectiveness in terms of throughput efficiency and our ability to deliver capacity for the market through our terminals. And in many cases, there's a lot of inflation working its way through the entire US economy that manifests itself, of course, at the terminal level as well. But what we are focused on is ensuring, number one, that we have the capability at the terminal level to handle the volumes that TOP SPG is going to deliver for us going forward. We are reconfiguring some of those contracts as we speak to both make sure that we have that capacity for the future as well as ensure that the type of operation that we have is the one that we need. So we're working on that as we speak, and we're confident that as TOP SPG rolls out here, we're going to see it manifest itself as additional capacity for our customers and improved executability for the service we deliver. And the physical capacity of our intermodal footprint has allowed us to handle much higher intermodal volumes just as recently as 2018. Well, there's probably very little I can talk about any of those things. But let me say this, we are blessed with a fantastic portfolio of customers. The customer you're talking about is a very valued partner of ours, including some others. And they are positioning themselves for growth. Our customers want to grow, they are poised to grow. They're investing for growth, and we are, too. And so you put the combination of very powerful intermodal franchise. We would argue the best certainly in the Eastern United States, put that together with a robust portfolio of partners who are delivering value for their customers in the marketplace. And I think it's already a great combination. It can only get stronger. Thank you for your time and your questions, and I appreciate you joining our call this morning."

            "name": "Cindy Sanborn",
            "content": "Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk to you all today about the outlook for our operations. During the past quarter, resource levels have challenged the fluidity of our operation, yet we have continued our momentum on increasing train size. We are in the very early days of seeing the fruits of our hiring initiatives and are working every avenue to improve service levels as quickly as possible. I'll provide an update on our Thoroughbred operating plan initiative as well as what we're doing with technology to make the railroad safer and more productive. First, turning to slide 6 as a recap of our operational activity metrics in the quarter, GTMs were down slightly, outperforming the unit volume decline as mix shifted modestly towards our heavier merchandise and coal segments. Our crew starts were down 5% in the quarter, which is a good news, bad news story. Resource levels prohibited us from operating some starts that we would have preferred to operate and our recovery mechanism was challenged as a result. However, on the positive side of the ledger, we continue to drive very beneficial road train consolidations across our segments, most pronounced in our boat franchise as we move similar coal tonnage with 6% fewer train starts and saw train weight up across the board for intermodal, merchandise and bulk. In an effort to improve resiliency, we kept a portion of the surge locomotive fleet active, yet we still achieved another quarter of fuel efficiency improvement. Turning to network performance on slide 7, train speed and terminal dwell closely resembled the levels they were at in the fourth quarter. Qualified T&E levels continued to decline throughout the quarter, culminating in what we expect to be the trough in March. As we start to see relief in certain areas, we are prioritizing crew starts that can have the most impact on customer service levels, and we are redeploying our go teams when possible. I want to reiterate that improving service levels is our top priority. And turning to slide 8, I will provide more detail on where we are with our hiring efforts. As we progress through 2021, we quickly identified the need to increase hiring within our transportation workforce. We were met with a very challenging labor market that made our ramp-up time longer than expected but we responded with a robust plan to streamline our pre-employment process, deploy a variety of financial incentives and mobilize additional onboarding resources. These efforts have paid off in a big way in 2022, and we now have over 800 conductor trainees on the property. As a result, we now expect our qualified T&E headcount to begin growing sequentially throughout the remainder of the year. We are laser focused on utilizing these additional employees to improve service levels and provide a solid platform from which to launch top SPG, which I will discuss on slide 9. As we did last quarter, I want to reiterate the approach of focusing on service, productivity and growth as equal pillars in our latest evolution of the top plan, which we envision launching in late second quarter. Let's talk about service quality and resiliency first. Several key elements of PSR are having a simple and executable operation as well as having a balance. You heard us talk about some of these PSR fundamentals when TOP21 was rolled out, and we now need to revisit a few of them with a renewed focus while ensuring they are embedded in all of our segments, including intermodal. One of the greatest strengths of our network is the quality and positioning of our intermodal franchise. And as we've performed the zero-based review of how we link together our major markets, we found opportunities to simplify how we connect those terminals while providing more capacity than what we have today. This will include ensuring we have assets flowing across our network in a balanced fashion so that less intervention is required for resources to be in the right place at the right time. Let me be clear, TOP SPG is another lever we're pulling to improve our service and represents an evolution of our current operating plan. This pathway towards enhanced service will allow us to better plan forward and execute longer trains. Additionally, going back to the idea of encompassing all business segments, while we've made great progress on enhancing book train sizes within coal, there is more runway ahead. Other facets of the bulk network such as grain, will see benefits as we develop the capability to run longer trains through those parts of the network, such as the mid west. This productivity dividend is very complementary to the service pillar as it will give us more flexibility to handle commodity volatility. These improvements in train productivity have obvious benefits of reducing labor intensity but will also propel further fuel efficiency improvements. Finally, these efforts will ensure that we grow capacity within our terminals and along our main lines, including the initiatives I've discussed with you before, to bolster our infrastructure with targeted siding extensions that are actively coming online. We are going to provide the capacity our customers want to grow with us organically while still creating the flexibility to respond quickly and effectively to new opportunities. Moving to our safety update on slide 10. We have seen improvement in both FRA train accidents per ton miles moved as well as the FRA injury index year-over-year. However, we will not be satisfied as long as there is a single injury or accident, which is why we continue our efforts to get better in this area every day. First, on the engagement front. In 2021, we conducted our first annual safety survey, which was across the entire workforce. This has provided us with insight on what and where we need to focus our engagement efforts. We've expanded our field training program to leverage outlets such as online training, classroom training and our signature safety train events so that we empower our workforce to actively engage in our goal of continuous improvement when it comes to safety. Lastly, we're making great progress building momentum with technology investments that are focused on safe and efficient operations, and I'll give a great example on slide 11 with an update where we are with one of our key technology pillars; automation. More specifically, we are using machine vision technology to detect component failures before they occur. We're in the process of deploying fully automated inspection corridors, which will cover more than 90% of the cars moving across our network using a variety of systems to detect signs and symptoms of pending failures before they occur. Equally as important as deploying the hardware is developing the next-generation AI algorithms that detect these failures with edge computing and procedures for intervening quickly. This is where we've made really exciting progress and we are already actively preventing incidents. We are finding that the technology is enabling us to achieve better outcomes than the human eyes alone can achieve. One reason for this is the power of seeing how these components are behaving on a train in motion versus well stationary during a manual inspection. We're generating high success rates with very few false positives and detecting components that need to be replaced, but had no outward indication to the human eye. The close and effective working relationship between our data scientists and field team is creating a feedback loop that is accelerating our progress. This is one of the most revolutionary technologies we are working on, and I'm extremely excited for what we are achieving with our relentless pursuit of safety first and productivity. I will now turn the call over to Ed. Hi, Brandon, this is Cindy. I'll take the question. Thanks for the question. So think of TOP SPG as a continuation of TOP21 with a pause for a pandemic in the middle. We worked on our manifest network in 2019, so two very, very great results from a service perspective. So we are now moving from the manifest to looking at intermodal specifically. The three main things that we're pulling from our analysis of where we are is -- where we want to be is balancing the network, executability of the plan and embedded in that is train size. And so those are the main initiatives around TOP21 generally and as it applies to intermodal specifically. We also have some secondary thoughts around what we expect the intermodal product to look like that include outlet frequency as well as blocking density. So got a lot that we're working on looking at that product and basically taking a very unconstrained view and then building up into what we think that's going to look like. And as we noted, it would be -- we'd probably implement that towards the second half of -- back half of this quarter. And, obviously, with great communication with our employees as well as our customers. So we're largely in that phase of it. And then as we continue from there, we're going to look at our bulk network. We have -- we've seen some great efficiencies in the numbers. And in my prepared remarks, I talked about both train size and efficiencies there. And we've seen that really in our Lamberts Point coal market coming out of West Virginia going down to the port with export coal. But we think with opportunities both from a standpoint of doubling up trains other than those types of trains, it could be trains coming over Chicago to interchange as well as our own grain trains. And then secondly, behind that, on our local service for our bulk network, that's origin destination payer on an as, we think there's opportunity just to grow train size generally. We've seen some improvement with one of our metals customers in that regard, and we've got more work to do there. So I think what you'll see is as we implement it in the back half of the quarter, it will start with intermodal, and then we'll layer in and add into that over the course of the year, the bulk opportunities. And as far as the network is concerned, you mentioned intermodal as well. I mean, obviously, the hiring that we're doing and you see the numbers and number of qualified employees starting to tick up. We expect that to continue through the quarter. I'm very, very optimistic about that. And I think that as that starts to be felt, I think, in addition, the intermodal impact -- intermodal TOP SPG focus is also going to help us in the intermodal side. It really does do -- it's completely streamlined between terminal operations and road operations to drive some of the efficiencies that I described before. So I think that will give us a great platform for being able to meet much more of the demand that we're meeting right now. And I guess I would add one more on coal... Yeah, Jason, on coal, I should have also mentioned, we really have had a solid service product to the port throughout the year. And part of what you've heard me talk about, and I referenced it in my prepared remarks around train size has been the demand that we've seen, being able to double those trains up and operate the tons with less labor intensity has been consistent throughout the year, and we expect it to continue. And Brian, yeah, I saw you yesterday at the STB hearings. The focus of the committee around of the Board around trying to restore service as quickly as possible. We are lockstep in line with that mindset. And other -- I think we have brought to bear everything we can to do just that. I can't think of anything that I heard yesterday that helps move it forward any faster. So we're going to -- as Alan has noted, we are laser focused on this. So I think a TOP SPG will help us. I mean there's just a number of initiatives that we have already. And I think those are the ones that we're going to -- we'll stick with, and I think they will bear fruit for us. In terms of the retention of trainees, that is something that we look at and make our hiring decisions based on that and they differ between some of the hiring groups that we have. We have put in signing bonuses at various levels based on attracting trainees and clearly outline what the job is to trainees and makes -- work very hard to make sure that we do keep the ones that we get in. That said, one of the things that we also do once they are on and training is provide the work life in terms of being on call and working different shifts and working weekends in the training program to make sure they really do understand what it is we're expecting as a railroad employee. And to some extent, that may accelerate attrition, but that attrition comes early rather than later because it would ultimately come. So we feel like that's the best way to make sure that we manage the -- a promoted trainee very effectively or the promoted conductor very effectively by trying to manage it on the front end. But we do see high attrition in the training ranks, but we plan for that. Well, you're seeing it on the slide that we showed with qualified teen, it's starting to tick up and looking at our hiring locations and the number of trainees that we have in place, we are in flight right now. We feel really good about being -- seeing good -- as we started the second quarter and ended in the second quarter, we will see improvement across that timeline and acceleration from that. So I'm really enthusiastic about where we stand. Yeah, Jordan. I would say that it's really just, as I described, unconstrained approach. I mean, things have changed over time post-pandemic included. And the original TOP21 was -- the plan was to continue on with intermodal. And there are certain trains that could actually carry both. And that does exist today, and we probably have an opportunity or two to have it in the new version here. But this is -- it's really about, again, take an unconstrained approach and figuring out how to balance our network, make sure we have a good executable plan and improve train size. So those are the main tenants of what the output should be. Now in terms of benefits, I mean, intermodal is about 20% of our crew starts. So we will see it affecting that part of our business and we'll implement schedule changes and those types of things as we roll it out fairly quickly. So I feel like that one will see some benefits as we get into the third quarter. But then we'll move on to the bulk side. So I think it will be TOP SPG generally will be something that allow -- it will be something that will take longer than just the intermodal portion that will continue on through the year and beyond in some cases where we have bulk opportunities in places where there's some physical infrastructure constraints. Yeah, absolutely. Ravi, thanks. I think train length really helps us right now. It improves our lessons or labor intensity. Now there's a point to, which if you're unable to meet trains at multiple locations on a particular district, it could work against you to your point. But I think where we are finding opportunities to move more traffic with one crew that is really to our advantage. So I don't see it working against us both near-term, nor do I see it working against us long term. We want to be able to match our train size to our locomotive pulling capability. And as we invest in locomotives and you've heard me talk about that in our prepared remarks, with DC/AC conversions, it's very helpful to us to improve train length. From the standpoint of what the STB might do, I don't know. I know that it is a topic that even FRA brings up from time-to-time. But I truly believe that the technology that's brought to us with distributed power capability makes it a very safe and effective operation. I don't see a reason that we should expect or want or think necessary, any restrictions on train length as long as we're continuing to move fluidly and not getting longer than the district that we need to run on. Yeah, Justin, I'll mention the secondary -- kind of, the secondary order of business on TOP SPG, particularly intermodal, is to look at outlet frequency as well as blocking density that will help us be able to be as efficient as possible in our terminals and obviously then operate trains that support that. So that is a big component of the plan and how we're thinking about it, because we want to make sure that we build it with a platform to grow. Yeah, Tom. Well, I would tell you, if I pivot back to TOP21 when we've come out of 2018 with a lot of real service challenges and implemented TOP21, really, really effectively, and it went extremely well. So we're kind of using that as an experience that we've had to implement changes in operating plans. But at the same time, we have not completely finished the plan yet, and we will engage our employees and obviously, our customers to make sure that how we implement it is the most effective way that we can implement it. And it is meant to be positive towards our service product. And if we need to do it more in a more sequential manner for that to support that, that's how we'll do it. Yeah. I think that the result of the implementation should help to lift velocity. And I don't think there's a gate of how fast we should be operating before we start something. And these will obviously be very localized changes. So we'll give those line segments a really good look before we actually implement. But I don't think there's a gate, at which we have to be at a certain speed or a certain dwell in order to implement. But we'll be very thoughtful as we implement to make sure it's supportive of improvement in service and not creating problems associated with that. Cherilyn, thanks for the question. I think that you've seen train size incrementally improve over many quarters. Some of that is bringing volume on to existing trains. And that's just absorbing volume coming to us. So as we came out of the pandemic, and we had more volume coming to us, we just added to existing trains. And then there's a piece of it that's a little bit more structural. And that structural piece can be in the bulk network where we can double trains up or where we can actually increase train size by 20 cars, let's say, in our green network or so forth because that matches the pulling power of our locomotives. So as you see mix changes happen with the intermodal or bulk or manifest, that will impact what the high end of our opportunity set is, but what we're really doing is matching the train to the locomotive pulling power and capability. And as -- and I don't -- we really don't think of it as this is the output we're trying to get to. We more think about it incrementally and structurally how we can change it to improve it. But the distributed power is what's unlocking that opportunity. The technology associated with distributed power is what's unlocking that opportunity. And you're seeing us invest in our locomotives, the rebuild locomotives all come equipped with distributed power is helping us continue to do that. The locomotive fleet over the years from 2016, we started this process of DC to AC conversions has incrementally added to our ability to take on train size. So that's how we think about it. Yeah. So we think about it in terms of balance. We think about in terms of executability. And I talked a little bit about outlet frequency. In some cases, we're running certain, several trains between two different cities but they're going to two different ramps. So how do we think about taking those two trains and getting outlets for our customers more frequently to be able to get to the destination cities and not think so hard about specifically what ramp we're going to. So that's some of what is embedded in our thinking. And then how simplify -- how can we simplify the building of the train with blocking density and being able to make blocks that are bigger. So there's a lot that goes into the inputs of how we balance train size and the internal components of how we operate the trains and the terminals between, which we operate them. Yeah. So I think what we've talked about is we're really confident in the pace of improvement this quarter and into the future quarters. Very dynamic environment we're dealing with. So it's hard to say when will \u2013 quote, unquote \u2013 \u201cbe back.\u201d But it's a very positive trajectory that we expect. And from a congestion standpoint, as we speed up, by definition, congestion will ease. So as we bring, it will be much easier to bring on volume because we are less congested. So we really -- the idea is to start with crew resources and plan changes to a lesser extent, but still supportive to the idea of being able to operate the railroad in a much less congested manner than we see, which will be reflected in our train speak going out."

            "name": "Ed Elkins",
            "content": "Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. If you would, let's turn to slide 13. Our results for the first quarter lagged challenges that we experienced on the volume side with supply chain constraints and network fluidity. These were offset by record success in revenue per unit. Overall, our volume decreased 5% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by declines in our intermodal, automotive and steel franchises. But despite these volume declines, total revenue improved 10% year-over-year to $2.9 billion due to higher revenue from fuel surcharges and strong price gains. Within merchandise, volume declines were led by automotive and steel for chip supply and equipment cycle time challenges significantly inhibited our ability to drive growth. Partially offsetting these decreases were gains in agri fuels, feed and aggregates due to increased gasoline consumption, higher demand for agriculture products and rising levels of construction spending. Higher fuel revenue and price improvement more than offset the headwinds from volume and mix that generate 4% revenue growth year-over-year, along with record level revenue per unit. Revenue per unit less fuel was also a record for the quarter. Total intermodal shipments declined 6% in the first quarter, driven almost entirely by the international market where tight drayage capacity, high street dwell for chassis and warehouse throughput drove customers to seek alternatives to Inland Point Intermodal, or IPI. Domestic shipments grew modestly year-over-year on sustained consumer demand that outpaced supply. However, as network velocity improves, and as top SPG is implemented, we're confident that we will provide the capacity our customers need to grow. Higher revenue from fuel surcharges was the leading driver of intermodal revenue growth this quarter, followed by storage revenue, price improvement and positive mix, all leading the record quarterly revenue metrics for the franchise. Intermodal revenue per unit less fuel grew for the 21st consecutive quarter. Now moving to coal. Total volume was down slightly year-over-year in the first quarter as gains in utility shipments were offset by declines in export coal. Utility growth was driven by higher levels of demand for electric power and the need to replenish depleted inventories. Our export franchise experienced a number of acute service disruptions that limited shipments for a period of time, resulting in a year-over-year decline. But despite these volume headwinds, coal revenue grew 25%, primarily due to price gains, underscoring the near-term market demand opportunities we effectively secured. Revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel reached record levels this quarter. Now let's turn to slide 14 for our market outlook for the remainder of 2022. In general, we anticipate continued, consumer driven strength in demand and improvements in our service product. Both of these will enable us to deliver year-over-year volume and revenue growth in 2022. However, we are closely monitoring a base of uncertainty in the macro economy, including inflation at levels we haven't seen in over 40 years, rising interest rates and evolving post-pandemic labor market and ongoing global geopolitical conflict. Merchandise volume growth will be led by agriculture, forest and consumer products where we're seeing elevated demand for products such as soybeans and corn as global food supply chains face ongoing uncertainty. The USDA recently increased their expectations for export soybeans from the US amid declining foreign availability and highlighted rising demand for corn, both of which create opportunities for rail transportation. Also contributing to volume gains will be automotive for US light vehicle production is expected to improve 19% year-over-year in the month of April through December on improving chip supply. Total construction spending in the US has been steadily increasing since mid-2020 and currently sits at the highest level on record, signaling opportunities for our construction related markets. Within intermodal, our expectation is for a healthy and resilient consumer in 2022 based on a strong balance sheet, suggest an increased spending power from excess savings despite record high inflationary pressures. Growth in the consumer led economy will drive demand for our domestic intermodal service, which we expect will benefit from service improvements in the second half of the year and drive growth to offset the volume declines that we experienced at the start of the year. Sustained tightness in the truck market and rising diesel fuel prices are both contributing to an economic environment that encourages highway to rail conversion and provides a superior value proposition for our customers because of our fuel efficiency advantage, especially when compared to the highway. For our international franchise, we're working diligently to create the capacity our channel partners need to take advantage of the opportunities on Norfolk Southern. Our efforts are expected to boost volume recovery and drive year-over-year growth in intermodal this year. And lastly, turning to coal. Record high seaborne prices continue in an already strong market that is amplified by geopolitical tensions. This will provide opportunities in the near-term. Pricing is expected to remain a tailwind in the export markets. Utility shrink continues with higher natural gas prices though it will continue to be counteracted by higher coal prices. Inventories are still lower than target heading into the summer season. In our domestic met market, consumer demand remains high for domestic receivers. Coal supply availability and production remain tight in every market, which will be the determining factor and upside potential. Overall, we're confident in the growth potential for Norfolk Southern for the remainder of the year. And we expect to deliver revenue and volume growth over last year. I would like to thank our customers for their partnership and reiterate that we remain intently focused on improving service and driving value for our customers and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results. Thank you. Sure. And thank you for the question. We have a strong environment out there for demand, for our services, and that includes, of course, price associated with that. Price is a little bit north of one-third in terms of the total composition. I will tell you that storage is another component there later on top of that pure price number. And we expect, as service improves, this year. And as supply chains improved throughout the year, we're going to see that storage number decline as the steamship lines in particular, require less storage and are able to deliver more throughput capacity. That's the whole shooting match. That's our portfolio. Sure, absolutely. And thanks for the question. In terms of the Intercontinental supply chain, which delivers products to the US consumer from -- primarily from Asia, but from other places, well, there's been tremendous volatility as everybody on this call already knows. Not only our supply chain stress in the US, and that includes really all the components of that supply chain, which are the ports, warehouses, railroads, truckers, retailers and other outlet venues. But it also includes the lines themselves on the water and in -- at the port of origin. So there's been a lot of volatility there. We have seen steamship lines make decisions that really allow themselves to have more flexibility. And then part of that is because of the congestion, which we've experienced, which is supply chain experience. But we're seeing some very encouraging signs in terms of where that goes going forward. We believe that intermodal still offers substantial value not only for the state line, but for their customers, especially in a high fuel environment or a high fuel price environment. We think there's a compelling story there that we can deliver value for over the long-term. And as we see those supply chains start to loosen up this year as the lockdowns in Asia continue to ease, we hope, we're going to see, we believe, customers look to IPI again for a way to add value on the inland supply chains. But there's a few forward-looking indicators or leading indicators that we want to look at, that's warehouse availability, drayage capacity? It's a dynamic situation."

            "name": "Mark George",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed. I'm on slide 16. We delivered double-digit revenue and EPS growth in the first quarter. Both were record levels for NS. Starting with revenues, the 10% growth was despite the 5% volume decline, thanks to the strong RPU growth that Ed just detailed. Operating expenses were up 13%, driven in large part by a sharp increase in fuel prices, but also higher costs related to our network challenges. Despite revenue dollar growth exceeding OpEx dollar growth, we experienced a 130 basis point increase in our operating ratio. Recall that at the first quarter conferences, we previewed pressure on our OR, compared to our original expectation of flattish sequentially due to lighter volumes that we were experiencing to start the year and also the rapid rise in fuel expense. The way it landed, fuel prices alone represented 100 basis points of OR headwind relative to our expectations as well as year-over-year. We also booked an accrual adjustment within claims expense that created another 40 basis points of headwind. The volume shortfall also adversely impacted OR as we previewed, along with incremental service related costs. These were only partially offset by the strong RPU improvements. OR side, the operating income and earnings per share were both Q1 records growing 7% and 10%, respectively. Drilling into the breakdown of operating expenses in the quarter on slide 17, you'll see that 60% of the $206 million increase in the quarter was from higher fuel prices on a year-over-year basis. Purchased services was up $31 million or 10%, driven in large part from inflation and service related costs that more than offset benefits that would typically come from lower volumes. Equipment rents increased $13 million or 17%, driven by slower network velocity and less equity earnings from TTX. The $20 million increase in materials and others is driven by a $13 million accrual adjustment in claims related to the 2017 through 2020 years based on an actuarial study. Comp and benefits were up 1%, with compensation inflation offsetting savings from lower employee levels in several categories. Qualified T&E employees were down mostly offset by conductor trainees. The unwanted attrition of qualified T&E employees drove higher overtime cost to move the freight. Shifting to slide 18. In a discussion of the P&L below operating income, other income was a $5 million expense in the quarter, driven largely by losses on the company owned life insurance investments. Pre-tax income was up 5%, while net income was up 4%. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 23%, in line with the 23% to 24% range that we guide. EPS was up 10% on the 4% net income growth, thanks to nearly 2.2 million shares repurchased in the quarter. We're moving nearly 1% of the outstanding shares. Closing with cash flow and shareholder distributions on slide 19, free cash flow was $605 million, down 19% from last year due to property additions in Q1 this year that are $124 million higher. Recall Q1 2021 property additions were quite low to start the year, due in part to weather. Free cash flow conversion in the first quarter was a healthy 86%. Despite a lower free cash flow year-over-year, shareholder distributions were nearly 7% higher with a 19% higher dividend payment and modestly higher share repurchases. We'll now turn it back to Alan for a wrap up. You want to start first? And Scott, with regard to the operating ratio, obviously, we've stuck to our guidance for the full year. And we're going to see progressive improvement sequentially as we go through the year with more of the improvement really in the back half as we enjoy the recovery in service and in particular, in the fourth quarter. But I don't want to get any more granular with that given the dynamics in the marketplace. Well, remember in 2Q, we had a fairly large property gain that was -- really had a good lowering effect on our operating ratio. So all in year-over-year, it would be really hard to get close to that number, but it will be certainly better than where we are right now. We saw within the first quarter, the operating ratio -- the rate of operating ratio improvement from January and February when volumes were very muted to what we saw in February -- in the month of March was a pretty nice improvement. And I expect that in the second quarter with volumes at least holding at these levels and perhaps starting to ramp up a little bit, we'll see a nice jump. But Q2 is a very tough compare because of that that land sale that we had called out. Yeah, sure. Let's talk about coal specifically. That's been a market that's been supported by price driven by capacity tightness. And with the current geopolitical disruptions that are out there, the market's got even hotter. And so we are very well equipped, I believe, with our franchise going to the labors point to deliver value for our customers and for the marketplace on the export side. And that includes -- we are ensuring that we have the fleet necessary to deliver that value. We know that there's some incremental capacity coming on later this year. And so we are working right now to repair those portions of the fleet that are needed so that we have a good order fleet of coal cars that can deliver value over Lamberts Point as well as to the rest of our customers that rely on that fleet. And to reiterate, our customers wants to grow. And on the intermodal side, in particular, we're blessed with a great portfolio of customers who are investing for growth in 2022, and we're making sure that we're going to be able to deliver for them. With the way fuel prices are currently, we have a compelling product in the marketplace, which will only become more compelling as we're able to deliver more capacity. Thanks, Amit. Look, yeah, we ended this first quarter with absolute costs in that 18, 30 [ph] range. And -- when I look out from here, there'll be a step-up even excluding fuel, I think as volumes start to rise, we'll see probably a step up in absolute cost for sure. But I would still think inclusive of fuel, we're going to stay under that $1.9 billion level throughout each of the quarters going forward. Now with regard to the year-over-year change in OR in the second quarter, again, I really don't want to get into any more specifics than to say we could -- we have a good chance to be in that range, ex fuel, but I don't want to put more of a finer point on it than that -- I'm sorry, not ex fuel, ex the land gain from due two of last year. I'm hopeful we can be in that range. But there's too many variables. I don't really want to put a fine point on it. Thank you. Yeah. Second quarter, in particular, was not necessarily going to be as ramp back half, so we're going to ramp toward the back half as service improves. I might just add, TOP21 that we did in 2019 was really in hindsight, a revolutionary operating plan change that unlocked a tremendous amount of productivity that we harvested. I think TOP SPG is more of an evolution from that now, where we're looking to get back into an operating plan that we can execute on a more reliable manner and also resource more reliably because that's where we're dealing with the challenges on the crew resource. So what happened in the middle was the pandemic that really altered a lot of our traffic flows and our traffic mixes or commodity mixes, I should say. And that's really what necessitates us to evolve the plan a little bit and try to get back into balance. So that's one way to think of TOP SPG. So now as we go when we release the new plan, which is being -- we're going through iterations right now, internally and then ultimately with our customers, hopefully, we'll end up with more crews on the ground and we'll be able to execute in a much more predictable fashion. So they're kind of happening simultaneously. Yeah, I would imagine we'll start to see it more pronounced than 3Q. That's not to say that we're not looking for opportunities here in 2Q to inflect upward. That's exactly right. Now I would say -- just to add one other thing. The structure of our network is such that we are blessed with a lot of optionality here, both in terms of the cities that we serve, the major metropolitan areas, but also multiple robust facilities within those metro areas, which we're going to leverage to deliver a simplified and effective train plan for our customers. Absolutely. So the physical capacity is there. We're working on our engagement with our lift contractors with shared service metrics, and we're working on how we can improve our own performance with the trains. And I think that's a recipe for success for our customers."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Nichols, you may begin.\nLuke Nichols: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full disclosure of those risks and uncertainties we view as the most important. Our presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with the reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to comparable GAAP measures. Turning to Slide 3, it's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw.\nAlan Shaw: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Here with me today are Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer; Paul Duncan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer. Last year was historically challenging, with a major derailment to start off the year, followed by network disruptions and compounded by a stubbornly weak freight market. The Eastern Ohio incident tested our resolve. I'm proud that our team responded decisively and responsibly to protect this great franchise and our shareholders, and to address the community's concerns. With an unwavering commitment, we have strengthened our safety and service. We have kept and will continue to keep our promises to make things right in Ohio, to improve our service to our customers, and to make a safe railroad even safer. A crisis allows you to accelerate change, and we acted. This includes a number of positive changes to how we design the network and assemble trains with measurable results. As we show on Slide 4, our improvement in safety is already being highlighted by a dramatic 42% reduction in our mainline accident rate in 2023. 2023 was also historically important for Norfolk Southern because we began to implement and advance our new strategy to position our business for sustainable growth and success. The Intermodal Service Composite chart on the right side of Slide 4 tells an important story that speaks to the clear gains we have made in both resiliency and service, following significant strides in service in 2022. With our investments in resiliency through leadership plan and resources, we demonstrated the ability to execute our strategy to run a safer railroad that delivers a compelling service product to our customers and handles increased business, a balanced approach to safely delivering service, productivity and growth. We overcame multiple significant network disruptions in 2023, and exited the year with the best intermodal service we have delivered in over three years, all while intermodal volume grew 5%. Entering 2024 with a safer and more fluid network that is attracting growth, we have the platform to narrow our focus to specific areas to drive increased productivity, and we are building positive momentum by executing on our strategic vision. Part of that strategic vision is our commitment to industry-competitive margins, and we are determined to deliver on that promise just as we have delivered our promises on service and safety as volumes grew. We will leverage our PSR operating plan with our current resource base to meaningfully improve velocity and resilience within our merchandise network, which accounts for two-thirds of our train starts. As we achieve a high degree of compliance to the plan and merchandise, we will reduce variability, complexity and costs. We are driving that forward now with the results already seen in December and January. It will drive asset velocity that will lead to productivity gains and cost savings. And in 2024, we are targeting a double-digit percentage improvement in terminal dwell, which is a good barometer of the health of our and fluidity of our merchandise network. Paul will go into more detail about how we are planning to build on our success in intermodal, deploying changes to accelerate our merchandise network, which I have noted will be a major source of productivity for Norfolk Southern in 2024 and beyond. To further describe what we are doing to improve profitability and drive smart growth in 2024, Ed will talk about how his team is winning business and pushing hard to negotiate price in excess of inflation. Importantly, we are streamlining our cost structure and eliminating inefficiencies. We invested in 2023 to enhance safety and service. We will see the benefits of this in our cost structure in 2024. We'll take actions this year to reduce costs in other areas. This includes a program to reduce management headcount by roughly 7% to help offset increases in critical operating areas. Our groundbreaking transformation will take time. We recognize the necessary investments in resiliency and service have temporarily increased our cost structure, particularly visible during the trough in this freight cycle. On Slide 5, you'll see we laid out the scenario where during a down cycle, we may modestly underperform in order to be coiled to secure volume and incremental margin when the freight cycle recovers. While we didn't expect 2023 to be a continuation of a soft freight market, coupled with numerous disruptions, we are optimistic that recovery is on the horizon and our investments will yield returns. We will deliver near-term margin improvement as we implement our strategic vision, a balance between safe service, productivity and smart growth. We are on the path to achieve that balance. In the aftermath of the derailment and network disruptions, we have improved safety and service in a responsible manner and are in securing new business. With a stabilized network and a high degree of compliance to the plan, we will continue to iterate the plan, reducing complexity and enhancing executability and balance. All of this will unlock productivity and fluidity, which, in-line with our strategy, will allow us to attract more volume at accretive incremental margins and deliver top-tier revenue and earnings growth at industry-competitive margins. With strong franchise advantages that will serve us well as we move through this economic cycle, we are poised for a bright future as we balance safe service, productivity and growth. I'll turn it over to Mark and the rest of the team, who will add some context around the timing and magnitude of our planned improvements in performance and profitability.\nMark George: Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 7 with an update on our costs related to the Eastern Ohio derailment. During the fourth quarter, we reached a significant milestone with the bulk of the soil remediation being completed. It's an encouraging achievement, however, as you'll note, we incurred $137 million charge in the quarter, which related to an extension the timeline for ongoing testing as well as additional work that will be completed in nearby streams. There was another $89 million incurred in legal costs and other fees. But of note, we received $76 million of insurance recoveries, bringing the total recoveries in 2023 to just over $100 million. From a cash perspective, the net outflow in 2023 was $652 million after the insurance recoveries. While we're pleased with our remediation accomplishments, we currently expect ongoing monitoring efforts and cleanup efforts will continue through 2024. There will be additional costs in the future related to legal settlements and fees, although the amounts and timing cannot currently be estimated. Moving to Slide 8, where we illustrate the impact of these fourth quarter results on our results. Our GAAP results are in the first row, while on row two we isolate the accounting to our Q4 financials related to the incident. At the bottom of the chart, you'll note the comparisons of the adjusted results to prior year. I'll be talking about our adjusted results for the remainder of the discussion. Revenues were down nearly 5%, while adjusted operating expense was 3% higher. The adjusted operating ratio for Q4 2023 was 68.8%, which represented a year-over-year deterioration, but notably was a 30 basis point sequential improvement from our third quarter performance. The sequential improvement is encouraging, but we fell short of our expectations as service-related costs did not come down as we anticipated. While our recovery efforts related to the IT outages in late Q3 restored service quickly for our customers and allowed us to handle more business, it costs more money in the form of crew-related expenses that persisted well into the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, operating income was down 19% year-over-year. Net income and EPS were down 19% and 17%, respectively. Turning now to Slide 9, adjusted operating expense for the quarter was up $59 million. The increase excluding fuel decline was up $123 million. The largest drivers of the increase were employment growth as well as inflation across all categories. In comp and ben, looking to '24, we plan to keep overall headcount levels flat versus the year end 2023 exit rate with some additional mechanical craft hiring to be offset by upcoming reductions in the non-agreement category that Alan discussed. Purchased services was up due to higher costs associated with technology spend, as well as increased mechanical services, including repairs around our auto fleet as we prepare for growth opportunities in 2024. The increase in rents was driven by short-term locomotive resources and increased car supply for our auto fleet. We expect quarterly rents in 2024 to remain slightly above these fourth quarter levels due to more adverse TTX equity costs and volumetric-related increases, partially offset by benefits coming from improved velocity. The increase in materials relates to locomotive and freight car repairs. Claims were lower year-over-year. Recall that in Q4 2022, we had a large adverse adjustment. The other component is unfavorable, driven mainly by fewer real estate gains. Moving now to Slide 10. Last quarter, we introduced this slide to help investors think about our service costs and resiliency investments, which are two components of our current cost structure. On the left side, we see costs that should not be part of our cost structure and have grown out of service that has not met planned levels, mainly related to recrews and overtime. These costs did not step down as expected in Q4 due to the crew-related costs we incurred to accelerate service recovery for our customers after the IT outages. So, while service has been at strong levels exiting the year, Q1 costs will remain somewhat elevated in part from the cold weather we are seeing here in January. Overall service costs should meaningfully unwind in Q2. On the right hand, we show costs tied to our investments in resiliency, mainly related to additional T&E crews that we have added in locations where we were understaffed, as we position Norfolk Southern to realize outsized growth in revenue and margin in a growing volume environment. Our total T&E headcount is now on an appropriate level that will allow us to absorb volume growth in '24 and beyond. There will be some additional hiring in mechanical crafts that will be offset by reductions in non-agreement positions. The additional craft hires mean that resiliency costs will settle in roughly in the $55 million per quarter range in 2024. Adding those resources will drive benefits over time of being an even safer and higher velocity operation. Moving to Slide 11 and results below operating income, other income of $38 million was up $4 million in the quarter, driven by higher interest income on the extra cash we are carrying ahead of the CSR closing. The adjusted effective tax rate was 19.2% due to a rate adjustment on our deferred state income taxes and tax-free gains on favorable company-owned life insurance. For 2024, we expect our tax rate to be in the usual 23% to 24% range. Turning to Slide 12 and recapping our full-year results. We started the year planning for modest top-line growth that would afford a level of expense growth to help drive our strategic track toward resiliency. The disruptive events of the year and an adverse macro environment upended this. Revenue declined 5%, which was meaningfully affected by about 6 points of pressure from lower fuel surcharge revenue and a sharp year-over-year decline in storage fees. At the same time, OpEx rose 5%, fueled by inflation and investments in our business. As a result, operating income fell 18%, with the operating ratio rising to 67.4%. Favorable below-the-line items and benefits from share repurchases held the EPS decline to 15%. In 2023, free cash flow was $1.4 billion lower than the prior year, representing the impact of the $650 million derailment-related outlays, as well as the lower operating income, coupled with higher CapEx. Shareholder distributions in '23 were $1.8 billion, with two-thirds being driven by our rock solid dividend and the remainder from share repurchase activity. I'll mention that we did issue debt in November and built up our cash balance to $1.6 billion at year-end, as we prepare to fund the strategic CSR purchase that is scheduled to close on March 15. As a result, we will see higher interest expense in 2024 and we will temporarily suspend share repurchases while we absorb the asset and bring our credit metrics back into our target range. It's important to remember that CSR is a highly strategic critical artery in our network, for which we had a rare window to secure and guarantee control of the asset forever. This also enables us to control longer-term costs that could have begun to escalate sharply with the upcoming lease renewal. I'll now hand over to Paul, who can provide an update on our operations.\nPaul Duncan: Thank you, Mark, and good morning. Turning to Slide 15 to begin our operations discussion with safety. We made progress in enhancing safety in 2023. We finished the year with our second best injury rate in eight years, but we are striving for better. We enhanced our conductor training program and continue to leverage our partnership with Atkins Nuclear, a foremost expert in safety across all industries. We also closed 2023 with a 42% reduction in our mainline accident rate and the fewest mainline accidents since 1999. Thank you to all of our craft colleagues and leaders for enhancing safety at Norfolk Southern this last year. While these are very noteworthy accomplishments, we must become even safer. When the major incident in Eastern Ohio happened in early 2023, we were already in the process of reviewing and adjusting our train makeup rules and it was a high priority of mine. We ended up accelerating that work by a lot. What we produced was an even better product than we already had, which helped us make such progress in mainline accidents and we are striving to become even safer. This is the platform for which we can now lever up our train plan to deliver productivity and growth. Though the change in our operating rules was implemented on an accelerated timeline and caused network disruption, we know it was the right move for the long term and we kept our promises to restore fluidity and service levels in the second half of 2023. The future of our operation is very bright and I am proud of the work we did in 2023 on this front to keep our promises. Moving to Slide 16 for further discussion on service levels. We took a modest step backwards to begin the quarter related to the system outages that we experienced, but quickly regained footing and continued our glide path of improvement in November and December. It is important to note that we deliberately chose to deploy additional resources so that we could balance restoring fluidity, while delivering peak volume. We were successful on that front. We delivered a very strong service for our intermodal customers during peak season and pushed overall volumes to their highest levels in over two-and-a-half years as you will hear more about from Ed. But as you heard from Mark, it did result in higher-than-planned service recovery costs in the quarter. We remain sharply focused on reducing those and have actively been unwinding more T&E crew expense in recent weeks in areas such as temporary deployments, overtime, recrews and other crew-related expenses. This has included reducing our intensity of Go Team members deployed on the network. Now that we have made this next step function improvement in intermodal service, we expect to remain there as we transition to leveraging our resources to drive greater productivity and growth. Turning to Slide 17 for a discussion on productivity. We've improved 4% sequentially within workforce productivity and expect an improving glide path to continue. We are driving this in four ways: one, by improving fluidity; two, by maintaining strict discipline and accountabilities to plan compliance in our operation; three, through discrete productivity initiatives that we'll discuss in a moment; and finally, through converting trainees to productive employees. As promised last quarter, we ended the year with 600 conductor trainees. We are now confident with the overall size of our T&E workforce to efficiently serve the growth that is on the horizon. On the locomotive front, referencing our service commentary, miles per day remained lower as we kept additional power and service to jumpstart the network with peak volume. This is an area that will benefit significantly from further improvements in velocity as faster train speeds allow us to drive our locomotives in the terminals on time and send them back out on their scheduled connections. And lastly, fuel efficiency finished flat despite the additional locomotives online, thanks to our initiatives, and this is an area we are intensely focused on improving in 2024. Moving to Slide 18, the next phase of our operational improvement will be marked by enhancing the velocity and resilience within our merchandise network. Recall that our TOP|SPG operating plan, which we launched in 2022, brought further PSR principles to our intermodal network, driving enhancements to container velocity and resilience within intermodal. That successful evolution enabled intermodal service to remain strong throughout 2023, particularly in Q4, where we delivered the best intermodal service in over three years, while delivering on peak season. Now we are building on that success with further enhancements in our merchandise network. First, we are improving our execution and discipline to run with a higher level of planned compliance. We're tying together the improvements we've made around our operational strategy, leadership accountabilities and resource allocation by sweating our assets further and strict execution to the plan. Next, we are leveraging precision train building processes embedded into our terminals to optimize connections and depart trains on time. We're already seeing the benefits that arise from success in driving scheduled network velocity. Our success will be demonstrated by making sustained improvement in terminal dwell, whereas Alan mentioned in his opening remarks, we expect to drive a low-double-digit percentage improvement in 2024 versus 2023. Investors can also track our progress in the AAR train speed, particularly the subset of manifest train speed, which has an outsized impact on our cost structure as well as merchandise trip plan compliance and car velocity, the outcomes of improving speed, dwell and disciplined execution of plan. Of course, there is always week-to-week noise in these measures, so we would look for improvements in trends on a rolling 12-week basis. On Slide 19, I'd like to provide more detail on how sustaining these velocity improvements will drive down our cost structure. First, we will see reductions in various buckets of T&E-related expense, and that will also help to lower our headcount intensity. Next, as we spin up the flywheel, we'll get cars moving faster, a critical element to scheduled railroading and overall productivity. Having our yards and mainlines more fluid will indicate that cars are flowing unimpeded through the network. This will drive a capacity and productivity dividend within our fleets in our yards and on our mainlines. That in turn will allow us to bring on growth at low incremental cost, lifting overall workforce and locomotive productivity and achieving service resilience that will allow us to take further share from truck. Driving these benefits in our operation by improving the velocity and resilience of the merchandise network will be a key aspect of delivering progress in 2024. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Elkins: Thanks, Paul, and good morning to everybody on the call. Beginning on Slide 21, let's cover our commercial results for the fourth quarter. Overall volume improved 3%, led by growth in intermodal and our automotive markets. Now, despite volume growth, total revenue and revenue per unit declined for the quarter due to lower revenue from fuel surcharge and intermodal storage and fees, along with negative shipment mix within the portfolio continuing from last quarter, as well as headwinds from a weak truck price environment due to the persistent overabundance of capacity. Looking at merchandise, volume was flat compared to the prior period and revenue was challenged by lower revenue from fuel surcharge compared to that prior period. RPU less fuel increased 1% as price gains more than offset the impacts from negative mix. This increase set a new quarterly record for Norfolk Southern and marks the 34 of the last 35 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in merchandise RPU less fuel. We're committed to driving value through price, and this commitment is demonstrated through quarterly records set in our automotive market for revenue, revenue less fuel, revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel. Let's move to intermodal. Volume in the quarter increased 5% year-over-year with gains in both our domestic and international lines of business. Revenue for intermodal was down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by significantly lower revenue from storage and fees in the prior period. Also lower fuel prices and an excess supply of available trucks as well as negative mix within our international business impacted revenue per unit negatively. Excluding the impacts of fuel and elevated storage and fees, which are related to supply chain congestion, intermodal RPU declined 1% in the quarter. We're confident our domestic franchise is a coiled spring, positioned to yield strong incremental value as the truck market recovers. Turning to coal. Overall volume increased slightly with strong demand for export more than offsetting declines in our utility coal franchise. The market for utility confronted persistently high stockpiles and low natural gas prices. Coal revenue was down 4% year-over-year with lower commodity prices and lower revenue from fuel surcharge negatively impacting RPU. Now, let's turn to Slide 22 and review results for the full year. Total volume came in at 6.7 million units, a 1% decrease from 2022. Volume declines were most significant in intermodal and our energy-related chemical commodities. On the positive side, lower ocean freight rates, advanced demand for international intermodal and rising vehicle production activity drove growth in our automotive franchise, both of which contributed meaningfully to offsetting larger declines. Revenue for the year was $12.2 billion, down 5%, or $590 million from 2022, driven by lower revenue from fuel surcharge and storage fees, as well as lower volume. I do think it's important to point out, however, that if we exclude the $650 million revenue hit from fuel and storage fees, which is essentially a post-pandemic normalization of those items, underlying revenue was actually positive, even with volume down 1%, which speaks to our commitment to core pricing smart growth. RPU, excluding fuel, intermodal storage and fees, increased 2% as we realized above budget price results in merchandise and in coal. In fact, we set annual records for merchandise revenue, revenue less fuel and RPU less fuel. Objectively, the freight environment in 2023 was soft, with weak demand for goods, lower levels of manufacturing activity, and generally less freight coming in from overseas. These conditions amplified the excess capacity in transportation, pressuring margins and growth opportunities. Our focus throughout the year was creating value with a resilient network to drive growth. In the fourth quarter, we saw that growth materialize with improved volume, and that volume will bolster our revenue performance in the coming year as we execute our pricing strategy to grow core revenue per unit. Let's look ahead to 2024 on Slide 23. Our market outlook is for modest volume growth. In merchandise markets, overall volume growth is expected to be driven by gains in steel shipments. Automotive will grow on continued strength in vehicle production, including new EV business. Improved fluidity and increased network velocity will lift our effective capacity in both of these markets. Shifting to intermodal, we are optimistic that increasing levels of international trade will boost demand for both our domestic and international services. There's still uncertainty around how quickly capacity in the truck market right-sizes. Additionally, the strength of the consumer could pressure growth if the economy softens. Lastly, our coal outlook is for relatively flat volume levels compared to last year. Demand for export coal is forecasted to be high, but some of this demand will be met via a shift of historically domestic coal to export markets. Utility demand will be driven by stockpile levels, which are forecast to remain elevated in 2024, aside from extreme weather events. Looking at price, we expect strong pricing conditions in our merchandise markets, aided by our improved service product. However, as mentioned, a persistently weak truck market will mute the opportunity for intermodal price, with contract truck rates expected to trend roughly sideways from their current levels throughout 2024. We also faced some headwinds on coal pricing this year related to difficult comparisons for seaborne coal prices, with additional pressure from high stockpiles and weak natural gas prices. All said, we still expect to generate pricing above rail inflation in 2024. When we take all this together, we are reasonably confident that overall market fundamentals will create opportunities for us to bring on new freight and further the volume trend we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2023, while delivering incremental top-line revenue growth through core pricing gains, as we price into the value of our enhanced service product. Finally, let's turn to Slide 24. I'd like to give you some examples of how our customer-centric approach is yielding smart and sustainable growth. Last February, our team met with FedEx Ground with the intent to enhance Norfolk Southern service for their transportation network. We listened to their business forecast and made strategic adjustments that we knew would set us up to better serve this valued customer. We charted a better way forward for both of our organizations. As a result, we were able to significantly increase our volume for FedEx Ground during peak season, and we look forward to continuing that growth into the future. We also landed a new plastic recycling plant in Ohio with our new customer Pure Cycle, which is expected to launch this quarter. This is a great example of the circular loop that is possible within the plastic supply chain and how Norfolk Southern can deliver that resin in a carbon-friendly manner. Finally, 2023 was another successful year for the Norfolk Southern Industrial Development team. We partnered with 62 customers to facilitate the completion of strategic industrial development projects in 2023. Collectively, these projects represent $3.1 billion in customer investment and the creation of more than 4,150 new jobs along Norfolk Southern lines. As we look into 2024, we're encouraged by the continued robust pipeline of customers that are looking to locate facilities along our lines. These successes in 2023 are indicative of the success that we expect in '24 and demonstrates our strategy to deliver a better way forward for our customers, our communities and for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back over to Alan.\nAlan Shaw: We overcame a number of challenges in 2023 and we are moving forward with confidence. Our resolve to deliver on all aspects of our strategy has never been stronger. We restored service and improved safety in a responsible manner to protect our franchise and long-term shareholder value. We ended 2023 with the best intermodal service we've seen in years and with an encouraging 5% increase in intermodal volume. Now, we enter 2024 with a fluid network, which will drive productivity gains and further growth this year. Turning to our outlook. We anticipate roughly 3 points of revenue growth in 2024. This growth, combined with our productivity initiatives, will yield strong accretive incremental margins, with operating income growing in excess of revenues. Net income and EPS growth will be suppressed in 2024 versus 2023, owing to higher interest expense from the highly strategic acquisition of CSR, along with the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program. As for the progression through the year, typical seasonality suggests that second quarter and third quarter should be our strongest in terms of margin performance. Obviously, the first quarter will have some industry-wide impact from widespread cold weather in January, and our first quarter still has year-over-year headwinds from storage fees, fuel revenue and export coal price. In-line with the Investor Day guidance, over the midterm horizon, we anticipate delivering strong incremental margins, presuming a normal freight cycle and mix, and 3 points to 4 points of revenue growth. A combination of volume absorption, productivity initiatives and a commitment to cost control will be key drivers. We aren't going to give you a specific margin target, but it should result in between 100 basis points to 150 basis points of margin improvement annually, on the pathway to narrow the margin gap with peers and deliver industry-competitive margins. You'll start to see progress along those lines in 2024, once we lap some of the revenue compared challenges in the first half. We see a path to outsize gains on the upcycle, leveraging volume growth within existing resources, ample productivity runway, and strong core pricing that can outpace inflation pressures. As we narrow our margin gap over time, the secular growth prospects of our powerful franchise will deliver shareholder value through earnings momentum and free cash flow generation. And with that, let's open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Yeah, hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to think a little bit about the bigger picture here, Alan. You talked about the 100 basis points to 150 basis points of OR opportunity per year over a three-year period. As we kind of think about you guys relative to some of your closer peers, that's about half of the gap that exists today. So, I guess as you think over, is there more opportunity beyond that? It just takes time to get there? Do you think that there is the potential for a structural gap between you and your closest geographic peer? I just want to get a sense of how you think about the opportunity maybe beyond that three years and how it might play out.\nAlan Shaw: Chris, we've committed to industry-competitive margins. And in '23, we overcame a lot. We made a lot of progress on our strategic plan. We enhanced safety, we improved service, we attracted new business, we overcame challenges. As we look into '24, it's really a focus on productivity, and we feel like we're going to be on that pathway of 100 basis points to 150 basis points a year, particularly as we get into the second half of the year and lap some of these revenue comps. But we gave a three-year outlook, but that's not an endpoint. We have talked about continuous productivity improvement as one of the three components of our balanced strategy of safe service, continuous productivity improvement, and smart growth.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good morning. I guess I'm still surprised by that timeframe, right. Should seem like there's still moves that would get you that leverage a bit quicker, I guess, just compared to some moves we've seen some other rails. So, maybe just was the impetus for some of these changes the headcount, the three-year OR targets? There's been some activist chatter in the market. Is that something that's edging you behind in terms of making some of these changes? And then, I guess ultimately the question is, is pricing accretive to margins in '24? Thanks.\nAlan Shaw: Hey, Ken, with us entering the third year of a freight recession and with the investments that we've made in safety and service that are delivering meaningful results, it's clear that our cost structure is too high for our revenue base entering 2024. And so, we addressed service, we addressed safety, we addressed growth in '23. We did it in a responsible manner to protect our franchise and our shareholders. Now, as we enter 2024, we've got a much more fluid network, much safer network and network that is attracting growth, and it's a focus on productivity. And so, yeah, we're looking at every cost out there. And we're looking at discretionary costs, we're looking at management costs, and we're focused on productivity, because it is a balanced plan. I'll let Ed talk about price.\nEd Elkins: Yeah. We were successful in '23 on price. And in '24, we have a good price plan that's strong and really is going to produce value every quarter of this year. So, we feel good about where we are with price. And there's a couple of things that I'll add to that. We're feeling really good about where we are with our service trajectory at this point. We're hearing from customers that they appreciate the value that we're providing for them, and we're doing it at the facility level, going out and talking to customers, focused on that first and final mile and how we add value, and that's going to produce value for us and for our shareholders all year long.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks. I appreciate it. And I know one question, but I'm just trying to understand, are you saying then we get better margins in '24? Is that pricing outpacing that cost? Sorry, just trying to understand the answer there.\nMark George: That's part of the equation. Yeah, that is part of the equation, for sure.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks, Mark. Thanks, guys.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So, Alan, you've been telling us for a little while now that maybe we'll see weaker decrementals at the trough, but then we'll see better incremental on the way back up. I think about Q4, where we started to see the way back up. We saw some pretty good volume growth, and the incremental margins were still really muted even with a nice fuel lag tailwind. So, how do I think about why we didn't see it this quarter? And then, maybe just going-forward, you just said the cost structure is too high. I don't know that I heard that you're telling us that costs come down from here maybe I misheard. Or do cost come down from here? And then, I don't know, just to put it all together, Mark, sometimes you just give us some color on near-term OpEx and margin. How to think about Q1? That would be helpful. Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Yeah, Scott, we had to overcome a lot in '23, And we made investments in a prudent manner to enhance safety, enhance service and attract growth, particularly in our most service-sensitive markets. And so, we're putting -- with respect we're putting proof points up on the Board. As we move through into the fourth quarter, we were still wrestling with a service product that was off plan, which adds complexity, adds variability and adds cost. We're operating in a really tough freight environment and we were dealing with pretty healthy year-over-year inflation, and we're still lapping some difficult comps with respect to the fuel surcharge revenue and with respect to storage revenue, right?\nMark George: And mix.\nAlan Shaw: And mix. And so, as we move into '24, those things are going to start to unwind themselves, right? We've got a much more fluid network. We're operating on plan. That will drive out our service recovery costs. And then, after that, we're going to continue to iterate to our plan. That's going to help drive productivity, and we're going to attract new business. And as you noted, our strategy is all about outperforming during an upmarket. I don't see that in the next six months. When the economy does recover, it always does, when the freight market does recover and it always does, we're going to be called for growth.\nScott Group: Mark, any color on the OpEx, the OR, Q1, again, just I don't know that I asked -- you said the cost structure is too high. Does it come down or not? I guess I'm not sure what the answer is.\nMark George: So, I think as you go into Q1, you're going to have some of the normal seasonality that has an impact on your OR. So, I think you need to expect that the first half, Q1 in particular, is probably going to step back, but then we feel much better as we lap a lot of the headwinds that we've been talking about from this first half, the intermodal storage charges, some of the fuel price and some of the other RPU challenges we're having on coal price, I think as we get to that back half is where you're going to really start to see much stronger incrementals and drop through.\nScott Group: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Alan, if we look at the three-year plan, I think if you ask every railroad in North America, they tell you that they also would expect to improve margins by 100 basis points to 150 basis points a year from where we are today. So, I guess the negative implication of that outlook is that you're not actually narrowing the gap, you're just improving your position from where you are, but the gap actually stays intact. So, I'd be curious to get your perspective on that. And I think the cost structure is high, which is you're addressing that by taking these difficult actions with non-salaried workers. And I know that's a really difficult decision. But it seems also like when I look at the cost structure, it seems like the answer to something going wrong is throwing as many resources at that problem as possible. If I look at materials expense or rents expense, and if I talk to any kind of operating intensive railroad, their answer is, you never really drown a problem with resources. That's the opposite of what you should do. So, I'm trying to understand the removal of the non-union or the rationalization of the non-union employees is one step in that direction. But are we having a rethink about how we actually operate the railroad day-in and day-out and how we respond to issues? Because it seems like that's kind of the root cause of the problem in terms of where the gap is today. Sorry for the long-winded question, but just want to get your perspective on that.\nAlan Shaw: What was the first part of your question, Amit?\nAmit Mehrotra: Well, just in terms of the -- yeah, sure, Alan, the three-year outlook, 100 basis points to 150 basis points, every rail on the continent will think that. So, you're not actually narrowing the gap. So that was the question.\nAlan Shaw: Well, that's our commitment. Our commitment is industry-competitive margins and top-tier revenue and earnings growth. And we said we were going to do that through an economic cycle. We said we would have difficulty within industry-competitive margins during a trough and the freight market. And candidly, we didn't expect some of the incidents that occurred in 2023, the network disruptions, the Eastern Ohio incident, and a continuation of a very difficult truck market. We invested throughout 2023 for the long term, and in the long-term best interests of Norfolk Southern and our shareholders. And we improved service. We improved safety. Volumes grew in the fourth quarter. Now, we can really narrow our focus, right? We can narrow our focus into productivity, and that's exactly what we're doing. And we're going to drive that by operating to the plan, a high degree of compliance to the plan, that will shed resources, that's going to shed a lot of the service recovery resources that you just referenced. As we get on plan, we'll continue to iterate the plan and look for additional ways to drive out complexity, drive out costs and improve balance.\nMark George: And just adding to what Alan said, as we think back to the fourth quarter, it was all about driving intermodal service, recognizing that the service sensitivity of that was going to directly drive growth to this railroad, which we did see. The shift in the layering on now is towards driving that discipline and rigor inside of our merchandise network. We recognize that is where our single biggest opportunity is. Total T&E is as a result of that, essentially troughed in October. And we expect that we're going to see greater productivity as we continue to dial-in our merchandise network. That's going to be a reduced number of recrews and all the associated costs, taxis, hotels, deadheading, overtime, car hire, equipment expense. We're going to see improved capacity in our merchandise network as cars per carload improves. So that's the flywheel impact that we're talking about. So, to your question about what is fundamentally changing moving forward, it's from where we are now moving forward, a direct focus on merchandise, recognizing that's our next single biggest lever for productivity.\nAlan Shaw: That's where two-thirds of our operating costs are.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. I hate to keep on the guidance a bit, but I'm going to move up to the revenue line here. I'm just trying to understand the roughly 3%. I get that there's macro headwinds. I understand the first half may be difficult. But by the same token, you have incredibly easy volume comps, given all the disruption from February until August. And Ed talked about the continuation of the pricing above inflation. So, one would probably expect the volumes to be a little bit better than 3%, just given the comparisons. So, are we saying that all in yield may be down this year? Or is there just like a healthy element of conservatism that you're putting into the macroeconomy in the first half of the year that may be tamping that number down?\nEd Elkins: I think there is -- this is Ed, by the way. There is a lot of uncertainty around what's going to happen here in the first half of the year. I think the Street has baked a lot of expectations around Fed actions and we'll see where that goes. But frankly, you look at first quarter and we see pretty sedate volume opportunities here in the first quarter, and the recent weather events for the entire industry has kind of confirmed that. But then, we see a steady progression of volume improvement throughout the year. And I think volume improvement will probably lead the parade, so to speak, in terms of revenue and yield improvement for us. But we're pretty confident we might be conservative around coal price, but that's, I think, the right thing to do for ourselves as well as for the rest of the industry.\nJon Chappell: Okay. Thank you, Ed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes in line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah, good morning. I want to ask you one granular one and then kind of a higher level one. So, I guess on the granular question, for Paul, should we think about with a fairly muted volume backdrop that train starts would come down in '24? Or are you thinking kind of, hey, the schedule is set and we'll keep that where it is? And then, the higher-level question, I think when investors look at Norfolk, they say, okay, there is a potential idiosyncratic opportunity to run the system better. Maybe that runs on its own regardless of freight market. But I don't know that that's clear. So, should we look at it as more of a kind of idio improvement story or is this really a freight market, freight cycle leverage story, right, that it is really -- when the freight market improves, if that second half, if that's '25, then you're just really well positioned for that. So, I think just trying to figure out what's really the right way to look at the Norfolk story. Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Paul, why don't you address the first question? I'll take the second.\nPaul Duncan: Yeah, absolutely, Tom, thanks for the question. So, we think about it not just as train starts, but overall T&E productivity, it's all about getting the most from our crews. And we're going to see that improve through not only what we've seen here over the past several weeks for improvements in network velocity, but running more discipline to plan and layering down initiatives. We know running more discipline to plan is already starting to show itself in reductions in T&E expense. You've seen it in the productivity measures from the slides. We're going to make further iterations to the plan as we get more disciplined, particularly in our merchandise network. And that's only going to drive improvements in GTMs per horsepower, but also on the T&E side. We've got a number of initiatives beyond just running the plan more disciplined and seeing that cost come out again that we're layering on. We've got pool transitions taking place. So, as we have gotten more fluid and more consistent, we have transitioned more short pool runs to long pool runs, again because we've got greater consistency and velocity in the network that has productivity benefits. We have put more towards assigned service from a T&E standpoint. That means we've got assigned crew pools and turns that reduces hotels, van expenses, has a quality-of-life benefit. We are going to roll out predictable work scheduling this year on our conductors -- or with our conductor, excuse me. More than 80% of our schedule -- our network is scheduled, meaning as we layer in predictable work scheduling, we will see a benefit in reductions in displacement time. We've got a number of board consolidation initiatives that are taking place, and we're driving accountabilities to run lean and two plan inside of our merchandise yard. So that all translates into we're going to see train length on the merchandise side. We've got line of sight on some improvements we can make there. Not only through further iterations of the plan, we've also got some investments planned this year in some of our major merch channels that are going to drive productivity and train length. Intermodal train length went up in Q4 as a direct result of us not only delivering great service, but customers rewarding us with business. And again, we're going to continue to work on that. And from a bulk standpoint, you've heard us talk about the various longer-term initiatives we have with our customers to invest in facilities, particularly in our [indiscernible] network. Several elevators are investing, and we expect to really see the benefits as those investments come to play.\nAlan Shaw: And Tom, to your second question, as we've gone through 2023 and we've made the necessary improvements in safety, in service, and attractive growth, we can really start to focus on productivity in our own plan and execution of that plan. That provides benefit as well. And then, our whole strategy is about outperforming during the upcycle. Our franchise is built to outperform during the upcycle. You've seen us recover from network disruptions much faster than we have in the past. So, there's a proof point as well. We're not calling when that upcycle occurs, but when it does, we do believe that we will outperform, and we will attract new business with high incremental margins. So, it's improving our own operations and executability with the plan as we can now narrow our focus on really operating to the plan and driving efficiencies and then participating and outperforming during the upcycle.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just quick follow-up for Paul. If you can just give us some sense in terms of how much of those productivity metrics you're talking about are actually independent of volume? I'm sure that would help. But how much do you have line of sight if volume stays flat or maybe doesn't recover in the back half? And then just to ask more broadly, do you think there's a structural margin gap that will always be here for this network versus some of your peers? You do have roughly 10 percentage points more intermodal. It's more truck competitive. You can have shorter length of haul dynamics with international as well, lighter weight, more touches. So, I'd just be curious to hear if that's something you think about in the long term in terms of closing that gap, that might be a hindrance or if there's something I'm not thinking about from a productivity density perspective, that could make that an incorrect assumption. Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Brian, each franchise has unique strengths. We have committed to top-tier revenue and top-tier earnings growth, coupled with industry-competitive margins. We're going to deliver that. We've got a franchise that faces the fastest growing segments of the U.S. economy and a franchise that's poised for growth. We're entering the third year of a freight recession. That will unwind. And when it does, the enhancements that we've made to safety, the enhancements that we've made to service, the ability to attract business in the fourth quarter, and automotive and intermodal, which are our most service-sensitive markets, right, give us a pathway to success going forward and allow us to unlock our full potential. And Paul and his team and entire executive team are intently focused on driving out cost inefficiencies and driving productivity.\nMark George: Let me just add real quick. This entire team recognizes that a margin gap exists today between where we are and where we should be, and we're focused intently on closing and narrowing that gap before we get to an area of talking about why any remaining gap exists. There's a lot of runway still for us organically and self help.\nPaul Duncan: Yeah. The specific around how much is initiatives versus volume adjust, many of those initiatives that I spoke to are going to continue regardless of the volume environment. The iterations to the plan are always going to continue, but that is going to be the lever that is most sensitive to volume. But we're going to continue to drive train life. We're going to continue to drive crew productivity regardless of the volume environment.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. And I guess maybe the frustration from the investor side is that if we go back a couple of analyst meetings, maybe even back to 2015, the mantra here has always been that we're trying to close the gap. But I guess constructively, Paul or Ed, can you help us understand where you are in trip plan compliance with your customers? Because I think ultimately, it's consistency of service that matters, right? So, what can you talk about what did you learn through changing the make-up rules through 2023? And where is the future on service to your customers? What are you seeing today?\nPaul Duncan: Well, let me start off, and I'd love to have Ed jump in here as well. From an intermodal perspective, as we look at where we finished fourth quarter, we delivered the best intermodal service we have put across this railroad in several years, and customers rewarded us with volume as a result. We expect to maintain that level of service based on what we've heard from our customers is their expectation. From a merchandise standpoint, we continue to see improvements in merchandise trip plan compliance throughout the year. To your point around the train makeup rules, we said that we were going to recover after we had moved forward with those, meant to again drive greater safety and resiliency across our network. We feel very confident that we've seen -- merchandise trip line compliance continue to come up throughout the year, and we feel that we're very confident as we look at 2024 based on the further discipline that we are going to build and drive inside of our merchandise network.\nEd Elkins: I'd offer a couple of proof points just to think about that are recent. The first one is we had one of our very largest customers comment to us that come emerging from the weather events that just happened in the past year -- or, excuse me, in the past week, that we recovered better than just about anybody else. And we really take that to heart because they themselves are a broad survey of many other railroads. So, we think that that's really important as a proof point for resilience. As we return back to plan faster and faster after inevitable events, that's going to define a large part of the value that we're offering customers.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks, and good morning. So, for 2024, there are a lot of moving pieces that you've talked about. But when you put it all together, do you think you'll be within that targeted longer-term range of 100 basis points to 150 basis points of annual improvement in the OR? And, Mark, I think you and Alan both mentioned the interest expense headwind you'll have this year. I was wondering if you could help quantify that year-over-year headwind.\nMark George: Yeah. Thanks, Justin. Let's be explicit with interest. We ended 2023 with about $17.2 billion of outstanding debt. The effective interest rate is about 4.7%. So, I would model about $210 million a quarter for interest expense on the go forward. We've essentially kind of pre-funded that CSR acquisition, so that should be relatively steady within a couple of few million dollars per quarter of that. And as we look at the moving pieces, again, we've got some headwinds here in the first half. I think as volume starts to grow as we go from Q2 to Q3 and then into Q4, we should really start to see, with the compares, a pretty good improvement year-over-year. So, I don't see so much in the first quarter certainly. I think there's a risk of regression there. But I think as we navigate the second quarter depending on volumes, but in particular in the second half is where you'll see most of the improvement. And, look, I think that 100 basis points and 150 basis points that we're talking about kind of on the go forward, we should definitely be there in the back half. Whether it translates into a full year amount or not, I think depends on a number of other factors.\nJustin Long: Okay. Thanks.\nMark George: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thank you. Good morning, guys. I'll put the bat away for the horse, that is guidance here, and turn the attention a little bit to what you're seeing in terms of impacts from any diversions on the port side, whether they're from geopolitical events or from the Panama Canal. And if you haven't seen them yet, do you expect to see them? And what sort of impact should we look going forward?\nAlan Shaw: Ed, what do you hear from customers?\nEd Elkins: We're talking to our customers a lot about this. It's a situation that has grown over time. We haven't seen any impact yet to our volumes. Fact is, our East Coast port volumes continue to be remarkably strong, and we are hearing customers start to evaluate their West Coast options, and that makes sense, given some rather unprecedented things that are going on. But regardless, the great thing about our network is we're well positioned to pick up that volume growth, whether it comes in the East Coast or the West Coast. And I think we're going to be able to very ably serve our customers and satisfy their needs.\nJason Seidl: Ed, is there a preference on East Coast versus West Coast in the network?\nEd Elkins: Well, I've got all kinds of preferences, but no, we've got the network built to take on volume, whether it comes through the East Coast or the West Coast. I think there's probably more intermodal conversion opportunity when it comes through the West Coast. But we've gotten very good at doing short haul intermodal with our international customers.\nAlan Shaw: Frankly, that's one of the benefits of our franchise, right?\nEd Elkins: Ture.\nAlan Shaw: We've got the most powerful intermodal franchise in the East, which serves 60% of the consumers. So, no matter whether it comes in the East Coast or West Coast, we're going to handle it.\nEd Elkins: That's right.\nJason Seidl: Appreciate the time, as always, gentlemen.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you.\nEd Elkins: Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. So, with the focus on long-term growth, could you maybe talk to the growth investment embedded in CapEx? Is it higher? Is it lower? And then, with that longer-term margin roadmap, is there an offset embedded in that given just sort of the ongoing investment in service that NS is making? Just any thoughts there. Thanks.\nAlan Shaw: Mark, you want to talk about the capital program, please?\nMark George: Yeah. I mean, the capital guidance actually for '23, I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that was going to be largely flat with 2022. And I would say that the mix within that between reinvesting in the business and safety and resilience, it's about the same as what it was in 2022, call it about 60%, 65%, and the growth element to that is the balance, call it, 35%, and that's pretty consistent between the two years, Allison. Second part of your question again, I don't recall.\nAllison Poliniak: Yeah. Just that longer-term margin roadmap, obviously you're investing in service. Is there sort of an offset embedded in that margin just given this ongoing investment? It certainly doesn't end here. Just trying to think through that.\nAlan Shaw: Well, I know that a faster network is a less expensive network. So, as we invest in service and we invest in resiliency, it translates to fewer recruits, fewer network disruptions, fewer -- less overtime, less equipment rents, improved fuel consumption and fuel efficiency. So yeah, that's the part of our franchise -- or pardon me, of our strategy, right, it's that balance between service, productivity and growth, and they build on each other. Thank you.\nMark George: The velocity piece plays into the growth.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you, Allison.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah, hi. Just a couple of clarifications here, make sure I understand. In terms of thinking about this year, in light of the -- you mentioned, steadily increasing volume assumptions and then increasing incrementals, particularly in the second half and the year-over-year improvement in margin, notably in the second half. I guess the question is what needs to happen to do better than to -- the 100 basis points to 150 basis points, the longer-term target? I would imagine part of the plan for the back half of this year is probably to exceed that, I would think. And then, secondarily, can you give a little more color around the use of cash this year? I think you said you're suspending the buyback, but the interest expense is pretty high. So, is debt reduction part of it? Because I think you also mentioned you want to get the liquidity ratios more in line. So, maybe where do you hope to end the year on that front? Thanks.\nMark George: Yeah, Jordan, on the cash side, yeah, we've got the big CSR purchase here in March. We've gone outside of our preferred debt to EBITDA range at the very end of the year, in part because we've had to also fund these Palestine costs. So that will continue to consume some cash as well in 2024, and then we've got the CSR purchase in addition to that. There are no debt redemptions planned this year. So, it's really an issue of operating cash minus CapEx, gets you to free cash flow. And then, in that free cash flow, we've got our CapEx budget, which is flat with last year, as well as the CSR purchase. From there, we don't expect to have remaining cash to do share repurchase. So, as we go into 2025, we should be in a better track with EBITDA growth to start to have a more normal capital allocation cycle like we've experienced in the past.\nJordan Alliger: Thanks. And then just the first part.\nMark George: Yeah. Why don't you repeat the first part?\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. I mean, sure you've mentioned a few times that you expect steadily increasing volumes and steadily increasing incrementals as we move through the year, with the second half seeing the lion's share, I suppose, of the margin improvements. I guess I'm just curious would the plan contemplate in excess of the 100 basis points to 150 basis points in the back half? And what needs to happen to do that? I assume it's volume, but...\nMark George: Yeah. So, Jordan, I think as you look at it, one thing that's going to happen on the cost side is these service costs that I laid out in my chart will come out. They may not come out as great in the first quarter, largely because of what we're doing to mitigate the cold weather, but they're going to come out and they're going to start coming out in the first quarter. And the plan is that most of those will start to release here in the second quarter, if not, it will be completely gone. So that provides us some traction for sure. A lot of the other fluidity and improvements that Paul mentioned will start to really take hold and provide traction, where we actually think our T&E counts may end the year a little bit lower than where they started the year, which means you're taking on more volume and you're actually having perhaps fewer crews, that's embedded productivity right there. And then, of course, we're doing actions on the non-agreement side that will also yield some benefits. So, we feel really good about our back half and our margin profile. I think a little bit stronger revenue, we can absolutely outperform that 150 basis points in the back half -- the 100 basis points to 150 basis points in the back half, and possibly be there for the full year because of it.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nMark George: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just a high-level question here, maybe going back to some of the previous questions asked and just tying it up. I mean, look, there's obviously a margin gap to your peers and it's kind of easy to point the cost to the reason why. But you guys have been cutting costs for many years and you've taken a lot of resources down and you've done a lot to improve the service product. I think you have the lowest cost per carload of any of your peers. At what point is this not really a cost problem and is more of a revenue problem and that needs the bulk of the resources addressing that rather than trying to take out more cost?\nAlan Shaw: Look, it's a balanced approach, and we overcame a lot of Norfolk Southern specific headwinds in 2023. And we enter 2024 with a safer network, a more fluid network and a network that is attracting business from our most service-sensitive customers. Once we get through this freight recession, and we will, we are poised for outperformance during the upcycle. That is the essence of our strategy. We're doing what we laid out at our Investor Day 14 months ago. And I'm proud of the way that we've overcome these obstacles in 2023 and set the stage for margin improvement in 2024, while protecting the best long-term interest of our shareholders and the Norfolk Southern franchise.\nMark George: Yeah. Make no mistake, Ravi, this franchise, this network is built to handle a lot more volume, but we have a lot of cost runway ahead of us. And that's what we're focused on right now and we're certainly going to welcome the revenue when it comes. And I think again that's going to drive the high incrementals at that point. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon: Hi, thanks guys, and thanks for taking the question. So, Mark, on the topic of cost, I think there were some headlines last night about some headcount actions, non-union workforce. Is there a specific cost program in place with a quantifiable number that we can be thinking about in terms of pursuit of sort of the non-operational costs as we kind of await the flywheel starting to spin?\nMark George: Well, with regard to the non-agreement program, maybe I'm going to assume that's what you're referring to, we had mentioned about 7% was our target and that's kind of deal over 300 people. But I think that the timing will probably start to take effect here in the second quarter, just the way the voluntary program works. So, we'll start to see the cost relief take place here in the second quarter. And frankly, the savings amount will depend upon the mix of the folks that put their names in. So, we certainly internally have a number in mind and we'll see where it settles after that. But we're going to -- aside from that, there are other areas we're going to go after. Again, we're not happy with our purchased service spend. We were in a year of very difficult, challenging situation where we had to quickly get our network up and running again from a number of challenges, be it weather or accidents. So, we've put a lot of money into quickly revamp using some outside services to quickly revamp our network on the mechanical side as well as engineering side. I would hope that those things start to really settle down. That's our focus, Paul and I, as well as even on the technology spend, we've been using a lot more software as a service, cloud-based services, which show up in purchased services as opposed to CapEx. So that's been putting pressure on our purchased services, but we've got to try to again put a lid on that growth. And I will mention that can't discount inflation. Inflation in 2023 was well over 4% in our cost structure. As we go into 2024, I expect to see inflation maybe be half of that impact. So that's going to be another area of tailwind. So, thanks for the question, David.\nDavid Vernon: That's helpful. And maybe just to squeeze one in here on the CSR purchase. Obviously, you're going to be adding depreciation on the rent side. Is there any sort of like net benefit of owning that property versus just renting, or is this just more about avoiding future lease payments?\nMark George: Yeah. Look, I think the biggest issue is these costs could have quickly run away from us upon lease renewal. We did not control what the lease rate was going to be. We knew that, that would go to arbitration and it could be a significant multiple of where we were. So, it's really a benefit when you think about what it could be on the go forward, overall. There is some above-the-line benefits that we have in our depreciation today, that lesson, as well as the rent payment that goes away. But again, the interest burden and a pause on share repurchase provides a temporary hurdle for us. All right, we've got it wrong. We got another question before we wrap up here.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Spracklin: Yeah. Thanks for squeezing me in here. So, Alan, I just want to understand again, at the end of the day here, you're talking about top-tier volume growth at industry-competitive margins. And when I look at industry-competitive margin, say, consensus estimates for next year, it's in the 60% to 61% range of OR for each of these -- each of your peers. And even if they do nothing and they don't move in their OR at all and I just take the midpoint of your 100 basis points to 150 basis points, I mean that's six years before you can get to industry-competitive margins. So, is that what we're communicating here? Is that the setup? Or we just look -- am I looking at it the wrong way? And maybe you can help me there.\nAlan Shaw: [Bascome] (ph), we've given you a roadmap for the next three years on how we're going to narrow the gap with our peers with respect to margin. Our commitment is industry-competitive margins. We've given you an outline of where we're headed based where we see markets. If there's more lift in the freight market, then I fully expect we're going to outperform, because our investments in safety and service and our ability to attract growth in the fastest-growing markets and the most service-sensitive markets are going to yield outsized benefits to Norfolk Southern and our shareholders during an upcycle But we're not calling that yet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.\nBascome Majors: Hey, Mark, you've been candid about the lumpy legal outflows and the insurance inflows on the cash flow front you're going to see from the Eastern Ohio incident and how that's going to be with you for some time here. But as we think about the cost structure, can you talk a little more about the ongoing operating cost increases that came from that and how fully burdened what we saw in the fourth quarter was for that and what may still be ahead? And I'm thinking things like insurance premiums or depreciation or say maintenance or testing contracts, but really anything you can share on the ongoing cost increase and how far along we are in that process would be really helpful. Thank you.\nMark George: So, I'm interpreting the question beyond the East Palestine specific impacts that we reported and kind of the aftereffects of it that are in the operating results. And I'll ask Paul to help, but clearly there were impacts that consequential from East Palestine where we accelerated those train make-up, little changes that certainly had an impact in the second quarter and probably going into the third quarter. I think we've ingested that now, and that's no longer really providing any adverse -- adding adverse impact. We have installed more additional wayside detectors that we're carrying. We're doing more testing. We've got some more people monitoring our wayside deaths, et cetera. I wouldn't say that the incremental direct safety costs that come out of EP are consequential. And frankly, I think ultimately they're going to yield to better results in the go forward, because we are running a safer railroad. We're having a much better derailment experience in terms of less frequency, as a result of some of the operational changes, including the make-up rules have had. So, overall, there's probably some -- for sure, some lingering incremental cost, because we're doing things different, but there will be a benefit longer term. Paul, do you want to add anything?\nPaul Duncan: Yeah, I'll just add to -- thanks, Mark. The proof is in the pudding that we saw a 42% reduction in our mainline accident rate this year. So, as Alan described, part of our strategy has been to safely deliver reliable and resilient service, and 2023 was a challenging year for us, but those are the types of things that are going to move the needle in driving towards \"We have a safer, more resilient product on the railroad.\" So yes, there are going to be some of those costs as Mark just outlined very well that remain embedded, with the offset being, we're going to see and deliver a safer product for our customers and through the communities we serve.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Shaw for final comments.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Alan Shaw",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Here with me today are Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer; Paul Duncan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer. Last year was historically challenging, with a major derailment to start off the year, followed by network disruptions and compounded by a stubbornly weak freight market. The Eastern Ohio incident tested our resolve. I'm proud that our team responded decisively and responsibly to protect this great franchise and our shareholders, and to address the community's concerns. With an unwavering commitment, we have strengthened our safety and service. We have kept and will continue to keep our promises to make things right in Ohio, to improve our service to our customers, and to make a safe railroad even safer. A crisis allows you to accelerate change, and we acted. This includes a number of positive changes to how we design the network and assemble trains with measurable results. As we show on Slide 4, our improvement in safety is already being highlighted by a dramatic 42% reduction in our mainline accident rate in 2023. 2023 was also historically important for Norfolk Southern because we began to implement and advance our new strategy to position our business for sustainable growth and success. The Intermodal Service Composite chart on the right side of Slide 4 tells an important story that speaks to the clear gains we have made in both resiliency and service, following significant strides in service in 2022. With our investments in resiliency through leadership plan and resources, we demonstrated the ability to execute our strategy to run a safer railroad that delivers a compelling service product to our customers and handles increased business, a balanced approach to safely delivering service, productivity and growth. We overcame multiple significant network disruptions in 2023, and exited the year with the best intermodal service we have delivered in over three years, all while intermodal volume grew 5%. Entering 2024 with a safer and more fluid network that is attracting growth, we have the platform to narrow our focus to specific areas to drive increased productivity, and we are building positive momentum by executing on our strategic vision. Part of that strategic vision is our commitment to industry-competitive margins, and we are determined to deliver on that promise just as we have delivered our promises on service and safety as volumes grew. We will leverage our PSR operating plan with our current resource base to meaningfully improve velocity and resilience within our merchandise network, which accounts for two-thirds of our train starts. As we achieve a high degree of compliance to the plan and merchandise, we will reduce variability, complexity and costs. We are driving that forward now with the results already seen in December and January. It will drive asset velocity that will lead to productivity gains and cost savings. And in 2024, we are targeting a double-digit percentage improvement in terminal dwell, which is a good barometer of the health of our and fluidity of our merchandise network. Paul will go into more detail about how we are planning to build on our success in intermodal, deploying changes to accelerate our merchandise network, which I have noted will be a major source of productivity for Norfolk Southern in 2024 and beyond. To further describe what we are doing to improve profitability and drive smart growth in 2024, Ed will talk about how his team is winning business and pushing hard to negotiate price in excess of inflation. Importantly, we are streamlining our cost structure and eliminating inefficiencies. We invested in 2023 to enhance safety and service. We will see the benefits of this in our cost structure in 2024. We'll take actions this year to reduce costs in other areas. This includes a program to reduce management headcount by roughly 7% to help offset increases in critical operating areas. Our groundbreaking transformation will take time. We recognize the necessary investments in resiliency and service have temporarily increased our cost structure, particularly visible during the trough in this freight cycle. On Slide 5, you'll see we laid out the scenario where during a down cycle, we may modestly underperform in order to be coiled to secure volume and incremental margin when the freight cycle recovers. While we didn't expect 2023 to be a continuation of a soft freight market, coupled with numerous disruptions, we are optimistic that recovery is on the horizon and our investments will yield returns. We will deliver near-term margin improvement as we implement our strategic vision, a balance between safe service, productivity and smart growth. We are on the path to achieve that balance. In the aftermath of the derailment and network disruptions, we have improved safety and service in a responsible manner and are in securing new business. With a stabilized network and a high degree of compliance to the plan, we will continue to iterate the plan, reducing complexity and enhancing executability and balance. All of this will unlock productivity and fluidity, which, in-line with our strategy, will allow us to attract more volume at accretive incremental margins and deliver top-tier revenue and earnings growth at industry-competitive margins. With strong franchise advantages that will serve us well as we move through this economic cycle, we are poised for a bright future as we balance safe service, productivity and growth. I'll turn it over to Mark and the rest of the team, who will add some context around the timing and magnitude of our planned improvements in performance and profitability. We overcame a number of challenges in 2023 and we are moving forward with confidence. Our resolve to deliver on all aspects of our strategy has never been stronger. We restored service and improved safety in a responsible manner to protect our franchise and long-term shareholder value. We ended 2023 with the best intermodal service we've seen in years and with an encouraging 5% increase in intermodal volume. Now, we enter 2024 with a fluid network, which will drive productivity gains and further growth this year. Turning to our outlook. We anticipate roughly 3 points of revenue growth in 2024. This growth, combined with our productivity initiatives, will yield strong accretive incremental margins, with operating income growing in excess of revenues. Net income and EPS growth will be suppressed in 2024 versus 2023, owing to higher interest expense from the highly strategic acquisition of CSR, along with the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program. As for the progression through the year, typical seasonality suggests that second quarter and third quarter should be our strongest in terms of margin performance. Obviously, the first quarter will have some industry-wide impact from widespread cold weather in January, and our first quarter still has year-over-year headwinds from storage fees, fuel revenue and export coal price. In-line with the Investor Day guidance, over the midterm horizon, we anticipate delivering strong incremental margins, presuming a normal freight cycle and mix, and 3 points to 4 points of revenue growth. A combination of volume absorption, productivity initiatives and a commitment to cost control will be key drivers. We aren't going to give you a specific margin target, but it should result in between 100 basis points to 150 basis points of margin improvement annually, on the pathway to narrow the margin gap with peers and deliver industry-competitive margins. You'll start to see progress along those lines in 2024, once we lap some of the revenue compared challenges in the first half. We see a path to outsize gains on the upcycle, leveraging volume growth within existing resources, ample productivity runway, and strong core pricing that can outpace inflation pressures. As we narrow our margin gap over time, the secular growth prospects of our powerful franchise will deliver shareholder value through earnings momentum and free cash flow generation. And with that, let's open the call for questions. Chris, we've committed to industry-competitive margins. And in '23, we overcame a lot. We made a lot of progress on our strategic plan. We enhanced safety, we improved service, we attracted new business, we overcame challenges. As we look into '24, it's really a focus on productivity, and we feel like we're going to be on that pathway of 100 basis points to 150 basis points a year, particularly as we get into the second half of the year and lap some of these revenue comps. But we gave a three-year outlook, but that's not an endpoint. We have talked about continuous productivity improvement as one of the three components of our balanced strategy of safe service, continuous productivity improvement, and smart growth. Hey, Ken, with us entering the third year of a freight recession and with the investments that we've made in safety and service that are delivering meaningful results, it's clear that our cost structure is too high for our revenue base entering 2024. And so, we addressed service, we addressed safety, we addressed growth in '23. We did it in a responsible manner to protect our franchise and our shareholders. Now, as we enter 2024, we've got a much more fluid network, much safer network and network that is attracting growth, and it's a focus on productivity. And so, yeah, we're looking at every cost out there. And we're looking at discretionary costs, we're looking at management costs, and we're focused on productivity, because it is a balanced plan. I'll let Ed talk about price. Thank you. Yeah, Scott, we had to overcome a lot in '23, And we made investments in a prudent manner to enhance safety, enhance service and attract growth, particularly in our most service-sensitive markets. And so, we're putting -- with respect we're putting proof points up on the Board. As we move through into the fourth quarter, we were still wrestling with a service product that was off plan, which adds complexity, adds variability and adds cost. We're operating in a really tough freight environment and we were dealing with pretty healthy year-over-year inflation, and we're still lapping some difficult comps with respect to the fuel surcharge revenue and with respect to storage revenue, right? And mix. And so, as we move into '24, those things are going to start to unwind themselves, right? We've got a much more fluid network. We're operating on plan. That will drive out our service recovery costs. And then, after that, we're going to continue to iterate to our plan. That's going to help drive productivity, and we're going to attract new business. And as you noted, our strategy is all about outperforming during an upmarket. I don't see that in the next six months. When the economy does recover, it always does, when the freight market does recover and it always does, we're going to be called for growth. What was the first part of your question, Amit? Well, that's our commitment. Our commitment is industry-competitive margins and top-tier revenue and earnings growth. And we said we were going to do that through an economic cycle. We said we would have difficulty within industry-competitive margins during a trough and the freight market. And candidly, we didn't expect some of the incidents that occurred in 2023, the network disruptions, the Eastern Ohio incident, and a continuation of a very difficult truck market. We invested throughout 2023 for the long term, and in the long-term best interests of Norfolk Southern and our shareholders. And we improved service. We improved safety. Volumes grew in the fourth quarter. Now, we can really narrow our focus, right? We can narrow our focus into productivity, and that's exactly what we're doing. And we're going to drive that by operating to the plan, a high degree of compliance to the plan, that will shed resources, that's going to shed a lot of the service recovery resources that you just referenced. As we get on plan, we'll continue to iterate the plan and look for additional ways to drive out complexity, drive out costs and improve balance. That's where two-thirds of our operating costs are. Paul, why don't you address the first question? I'll take the second. And Tom, to your second question, as we've gone through 2023 and we've made the necessary improvements in safety, in service, and attractive growth, we can really start to focus on productivity in our own plan and execution of that plan. That provides benefit as well. And then, our whole strategy is about outperforming during the upcycle. Our franchise is built to outperform during the upcycle. You've seen us recover from network disruptions much faster than we have in the past. So, there's a proof point as well. We're not calling when that upcycle occurs, but when it does, we do believe that we will outperform, and we will attract new business with high incremental margins. So, it's improving our own operations and executability with the plan as we can now narrow our focus on really operating to the plan and driving efficiencies and then participating and outperforming during the upcycle. Brian, each franchise has unique strengths. We have committed to top-tier revenue and top-tier earnings growth, coupled with industry-competitive margins. We're going to deliver that. We've got a franchise that faces the fastest growing segments of the U.S. economy and a franchise that's poised for growth. We're entering the third year of a freight recession. That will unwind. And when it does, the enhancements that we've made to safety, the enhancements that we've made to service, the ability to attract business in the fourth quarter, and automotive and intermodal, which are our most service-sensitive markets, right, give us a pathway to success going forward and allow us to unlock our full potential. And Paul and his team and entire executive team are intently focused on driving out cost inefficiencies and driving productivity. Ed, what do you hear from customers? Frankly, that's one of the benefits of our franchise, right? We've got the most powerful intermodal franchise in the East, which serves 60% of the consumers. So, no matter whether it comes in the East Coast or West Coast, we're going to handle it. Thank you. Mark, you want to talk about the capital program, please? Well, I know that a faster network is a less expensive network. So, as we invest in service and we invest in resiliency, it translates to fewer recruits, fewer network disruptions, fewer -- less overtime, less equipment rents, improved fuel consumption and fuel efficiency. So yeah, that's the part of our franchise -- or pardon me, of our strategy, right, it's that balance between service, productivity and growth, and they build on each other. Thank you. Thank you, Allison. Look, it's a balanced approach, and we overcame a lot of Norfolk Southern specific headwinds in 2023. And we enter 2024 with a safer network, a more fluid network and a network that is attracting business from our most service-sensitive customers. Once we get through this freight recession, and we will, we are poised for outperformance during the upcycle. That is the essence of our strategy. We're doing what we laid out at our Investor Day 14 months ago. And I'm proud of the way that we've overcome these obstacles in 2023 and set the stage for margin improvement in 2024, while protecting the best long-term interest of our shareholders and the Norfolk Southern franchise. [Bascome] (ph), we've given you a roadmap for the next three years on how we're going to narrow the gap with our peers with respect to margin. Our commitment is industry-competitive margins. We've given you an outline of where we're headed based where we see markets. If there's more lift in the freight market, then I fully expect we're going to outperform, because our investments in safety and service and our ability to attract growth in the fastest-growing markets and the most service-sensitive markets are going to yield outsized benefits to Norfolk Southern and our shareholders during an upcycle But we're not calling that yet. Thank you for joining us today."

            "name": "Ed Elkins",
            "content": "Thanks, Paul, and good morning to everybody on the call. Beginning on Slide 21, let's cover our commercial results for the fourth quarter. Overall volume improved 3%, led by growth in intermodal and our automotive markets. Now, despite volume growth, total revenue and revenue per unit declined for the quarter due to lower revenue from fuel surcharge and intermodal storage and fees, along with negative shipment mix within the portfolio continuing from last quarter, as well as headwinds from a weak truck price environment due to the persistent overabundance of capacity. Looking at merchandise, volume was flat compared to the prior period and revenue was challenged by lower revenue from fuel surcharge compared to that prior period. RPU less fuel increased 1% as price gains more than offset the impacts from negative mix. This increase set a new quarterly record for Norfolk Southern and marks the 34 of the last 35 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in merchandise RPU less fuel. We're committed to driving value through price, and this commitment is demonstrated through quarterly records set in our automotive market for revenue, revenue less fuel, revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel. Let's move to intermodal. Volume in the quarter increased 5% year-over-year with gains in both our domestic and international lines of business. Revenue for intermodal was down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by significantly lower revenue from storage and fees in the prior period. Also lower fuel prices and an excess supply of available trucks as well as negative mix within our international business impacted revenue per unit negatively. Excluding the impacts of fuel and elevated storage and fees, which are related to supply chain congestion, intermodal RPU declined 1% in the quarter. We're confident our domestic franchise is a coiled spring, positioned to yield strong incremental value as the truck market recovers. Turning to coal. Overall volume increased slightly with strong demand for export more than offsetting declines in our utility coal franchise. The market for utility confronted persistently high stockpiles and low natural gas prices. Coal revenue was down 4% year-over-year with lower commodity prices and lower revenue from fuel surcharge negatively impacting RPU. Now, let's turn to Slide 22 and review results for the full year. Total volume came in at 6.7 million units, a 1% decrease from 2022. Volume declines were most significant in intermodal and our energy-related chemical commodities. On the positive side, lower ocean freight rates, advanced demand for international intermodal and rising vehicle production activity drove growth in our automotive franchise, both of which contributed meaningfully to offsetting larger declines. Revenue for the year was $12.2 billion, down 5%, or $590 million from 2022, driven by lower revenue from fuel surcharge and storage fees, as well as lower volume. I do think it's important to point out, however, that if we exclude the $650 million revenue hit from fuel and storage fees, which is essentially a post-pandemic normalization of those items, underlying revenue was actually positive, even with volume down 1%, which speaks to our commitment to core pricing smart growth. RPU, excluding fuel, intermodal storage and fees, increased 2% as we realized above budget price results in merchandise and in coal. In fact, we set annual records for merchandise revenue, revenue less fuel and RPU less fuel. Objectively, the freight environment in 2023 was soft, with weak demand for goods, lower levels of manufacturing activity, and generally less freight coming in from overseas. These conditions amplified the excess capacity in transportation, pressuring margins and growth opportunities. Our focus throughout the year was creating value with a resilient network to drive growth. In the fourth quarter, we saw that growth materialize with improved volume, and that volume will bolster our revenue performance in the coming year as we execute our pricing strategy to grow core revenue per unit. Let's look ahead to 2024 on Slide 23. Our market outlook is for modest volume growth. In merchandise markets, overall volume growth is expected to be driven by gains in steel shipments. Automotive will grow on continued strength in vehicle production, including new EV business. Improved fluidity and increased network velocity will lift our effective capacity in both of these markets. Shifting to intermodal, we are optimistic that increasing levels of international trade will boost demand for both our domestic and international services. There's still uncertainty around how quickly capacity in the truck market right-sizes. Additionally, the strength of the consumer could pressure growth if the economy softens. Lastly, our coal outlook is for relatively flat volume levels compared to last year. Demand for export coal is forecasted to be high, but some of this demand will be met via a shift of historically domestic coal to export markets. Utility demand will be driven by stockpile levels, which are forecast to remain elevated in 2024, aside from extreme weather events. Looking at price, we expect strong pricing conditions in our merchandise markets, aided by our improved service product. However, as mentioned, a persistently weak truck market will mute the opportunity for intermodal price, with contract truck rates expected to trend roughly sideways from their current levels throughout 2024. We also faced some headwinds on coal pricing this year related to difficult comparisons for seaborne coal prices, with additional pressure from high stockpiles and weak natural gas prices. All said, we still expect to generate pricing above rail inflation in 2024. When we take all this together, we are reasonably confident that overall market fundamentals will create opportunities for us to bring on new freight and further the volume trend we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2023, while delivering incremental top-line revenue growth through core pricing gains, as we price into the value of our enhanced service product. Finally, let's turn to Slide 24. I'd like to give you some examples of how our customer-centric approach is yielding smart and sustainable growth. Last February, our team met with FedEx Ground with the intent to enhance Norfolk Southern service for their transportation network. We listened to their business forecast and made strategic adjustments that we knew would set us up to better serve this valued customer. We charted a better way forward for both of our organizations. As a result, we were able to significantly increase our volume for FedEx Ground during peak season, and we look forward to continuing that growth into the future. We also landed a new plastic recycling plant in Ohio with our new customer Pure Cycle, which is expected to launch this quarter. This is a great example of the circular loop that is possible within the plastic supply chain and how Norfolk Southern can deliver that resin in a carbon-friendly manner. Finally, 2023 was another successful year for the Norfolk Southern Industrial Development team. We partnered with 62 customers to facilitate the completion of strategic industrial development projects in 2023. Collectively, these projects represent $3.1 billion in customer investment and the creation of more than 4,150 new jobs along Norfolk Southern lines. As we look into 2024, we're encouraged by the continued robust pipeline of customers that are looking to locate facilities along our lines. These successes in 2023 are indicative of the success that we expect in '24 and demonstrates our strategy to deliver a better way forward for our customers, our communities and for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back over to Alan. Yeah. We were successful in '23 on price. And in '24, we have a good price plan that's strong and really is going to produce value every quarter of this year. So, we feel good about where we are with price. And there's a couple of things that I'll add to that. We're feeling really good about where we are with our service trajectory at this point. We're hearing from customers that they appreciate the value that we're providing for them, and we're doing it at the facility level, going out and talking to customers, focused on that first and final mile and how we add value, and that's going to produce value for us and for our shareholders all year long. I think there is -- this is Ed, by the way. There is a lot of uncertainty around what's going to happen here in the first half of the year. I think the Street has baked a lot of expectations around Fed actions and we'll see where that goes. But frankly, you look at first quarter and we see pretty sedate volume opportunities here in the first quarter, and the recent weather events for the entire industry has kind of confirmed that. But then, we see a steady progression of volume improvement throughout the year. And I think volume improvement will probably lead the parade, so to speak, in terms of revenue and yield improvement for us. But we're pretty confident we might be conservative around coal price, but that's, I think, the right thing to do for ourselves as well as for the rest of the industry. I'd offer a couple of proof points just to think about that are recent. The first one is we had one of our very largest customers comment to us that come emerging from the weather events that just happened in the past year -- or, excuse me, in the past week, that we recovered better than just about anybody else. And we really take that to heart because they themselves are a broad survey of many other railroads. So, we think that that's really important as a proof point for resilience. As we return back to plan faster and faster after inevitable events, that's going to define a large part of the value that we're offering customers. We're talking to our customers a lot about this. It's a situation that has grown over time. We haven't seen any impact yet to our volumes. Fact is, our East Coast port volumes continue to be remarkably strong, and we are hearing customers start to evaluate their West Coast options, and that makes sense, given some rather unprecedented things that are going on. But regardless, the great thing about our network is we're well positioned to pick up that volume growth, whether it comes in the East Coast or the West Coast. And I think we're going to be able to very ably serve our customers and satisfy their needs. Well, I've got all kinds of preferences, but no, we've got the network built to take on volume, whether it comes through the East Coast or the West Coast. I think there's probably more intermodal conversion opportunity when it comes through the West Coast. But we've gotten very good at doing short haul intermodal with our international customers. Ture. That's right. Thank you, Jason."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and good morning. Turning to Slide 15 to begin our operations discussion with safety. We made progress in enhancing safety in 2023. We finished the year with our second best injury rate in eight years, but we are striving for better. We enhanced our conductor training program and continue to leverage our partnership with Atkins Nuclear, a foremost expert in safety across all industries. We also closed 2023 with a 42% reduction in our mainline accident rate and the fewest mainline accidents since 1999. Thank you to all of our craft colleagues and leaders for enhancing safety at Norfolk Southern this last year. While these are very noteworthy accomplishments, we must become even safer. When the major incident in Eastern Ohio happened in early 2023, we were already in the process of reviewing and adjusting our train makeup rules and it was a high priority of mine. We ended up accelerating that work by a lot. What we produced was an even better product than we already had, which helped us make such progress in mainline accidents and we are striving to become even safer. This is the platform for which we can now lever up our train plan to deliver productivity and growth. Though the change in our operating rules was implemented on an accelerated timeline and caused network disruption, we know it was the right move for the long term and we kept our promises to restore fluidity and service levels in the second half of 2023. The future of our operation is very bright and I am proud of the work we did in 2023 on this front to keep our promises. Moving to Slide 16 for further discussion on service levels. We took a modest step backwards to begin the quarter related to the system outages that we experienced, but quickly regained footing and continued our glide path of improvement in November and December. It is important to note that we deliberately chose to deploy additional resources so that we could balance restoring fluidity, while delivering peak volume. We were successful on that front. We delivered a very strong service for our intermodal customers during peak season and pushed overall volumes to their highest levels in over two-and-a-half years as you will hear more about from Ed. But as you heard from Mark, it did result in higher-than-planned service recovery costs in the quarter. We remain sharply focused on reducing those and have actively been unwinding more T&E crew expense in recent weeks in areas such as temporary deployments, overtime, recrews and other crew-related expenses. This has included reducing our intensity of Go Team members deployed on the network. Now that we have made this next step function improvement in intermodal service, we expect to remain there as we transition to leveraging our resources to drive greater productivity and growth. Turning to Slide 17 for a discussion on productivity. We've improved 4% sequentially within workforce productivity and expect an improving glide path to continue. We are driving this in four ways: one, by improving fluidity; two, by maintaining strict discipline and accountabilities to plan compliance in our operation; three, through discrete productivity initiatives that we'll discuss in a moment; and finally, through converting trainees to productive employees. As promised last quarter, we ended the year with 600 conductor trainees. We are now confident with the overall size of our T&E workforce to efficiently serve the growth that is on the horizon. On the locomotive front, referencing our service commentary, miles per day remained lower as we kept additional power and service to jumpstart the network with peak volume. This is an area that will benefit significantly from further improvements in velocity as faster train speeds allow us to drive our locomotives in the terminals on time and send them back out on their scheduled connections. And lastly, fuel efficiency finished flat despite the additional locomotives online, thanks to our initiatives, and this is an area we are intensely focused on improving in 2024. Moving to Slide 18, the next phase of our operational improvement will be marked by enhancing the velocity and resilience within our merchandise network. Recall that our TOP|SPG operating plan, which we launched in 2022, brought further PSR principles to our intermodal network, driving enhancements to container velocity and resilience within intermodal. That successful evolution enabled intermodal service to remain strong throughout 2023, particularly in Q4, where we delivered the best intermodal service in over three years, while delivering on peak season. Now we are building on that success with further enhancements in our merchandise network. First, we are improving our execution and discipline to run with a higher level of planned compliance. We're tying together the improvements we've made around our operational strategy, leadership accountabilities and resource allocation by sweating our assets further and strict execution to the plan. Next, we are leveraging precision train building processes embedded into our terminals to optimize connections and depart trains on time. We're already seeing the benefits that arise from success in driving scheduled network velocity. Our success will be demonstrated by making sustained improvement in terminal dwell, whereas Alan mentioned in his opening remarks, we expect to drive a low-double-digit percentage improvement in 2024 versus 2023. Investors can also track our progress in the AAR train speed, particularly the subset of manifest train speed, which has an outsized impact on our cost structure as well as merchandise trip plan compliance and car velocity, the outcomes of improving speed, dwell and disciplined execution of plan. Of course, there is always week-to-week noise in these measures, so we would look for improvements in trends on a rolling 12-week basis. On Slide 19, I'd like to provide more detail on how sustaining these velocity improvements will drive down our cost structure. First, we will see reductions in various buckets of T&E-related expense, and that will also help to lower our headcount intensity. Next, as we spin up the flywheel, we'll get cars moving faster, a critical element to scheduled railroading and overall productivity. Having our yards and mainlines more fluid will indicate that cars are flowing unimpeded through the network. This will drive a capacity and productivity dividend within our fleets in our yards and on our mainlines. That in turn will allow us to bring on growth at low incremental cost, lifting overall workforce and locomotive productivity and achieving service resilience that will allow us to take further share from truck. Driving these benefits in our operation by improving the velocity and resilience of the merchandise network will be a key aspect of delivering progress in 2024. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Ed. Yeah, absolutely, Tom, thanks for the question. So, we think about it not just as train starts, but overall T&E productivity, it's all about getting the most from our crews. And we're going to see that improve through not only what we've seen here over the past several weeks for improvements in network velocity, but running more discipline to plan and layering down initiatives. We know running more discipline to plan is already starting to show itself in reductions in T&E expense. You've seen it in the productivity measures from the slides. We're going to make further iterations to the plan as we get more disciplined, particularly in our merchandise network. And that's only going to drive improvements in GTMs per horsepower, but also on the T&E side. We've got a number of initiatives beyond just running the plan more disciplined and seeing that cost come out again that we're layering on. We've got pool transitions taking place. So, as we have gotten more fluid and more consistent, we have transitioned more short pool runs to long pool runs, again because we've got greater consistency and velocity in the network that has productivity benefits. We have put more towards assigned service from a T&E standpoint. That means we've got assigned crew pools and turns that reduces hotels, van expenses, has a quality-of-life benefit. We are going to roll out predictable work scheduling this year on our conductors -- or with our conductor, excuse me. More than 80% of our schedule -- our network is scheduled, meaning as we layer in predictable work scheduling, we will see a benefit in reductions in displacement time. We've got a number of board consolidation initiatives that are taking place, and we're driving accountabilities to run lean and two plan inside of our merchandise yard. So that all translates into we're going to see train length on the merchandise side. We've got line of sight on some improvements we can make there. Not only through further iterations of the plan, we've also got some investments planned this year in some of our major merch channels that are going to drive productivity and train length. Intermodal train length went up in Q4 as a direct result of us not only delivering great service, but customers rewarding us with business. And again, we're going to continue to work on that. And from a bulk standpoint, you've heard us talk about the various longer-term initiatives we have with our customers to invest in facilities, particularly in our [indiscernible] network. Several elevators are investing, and we expect to really see the benefits as those investments come to play. Yeah. The specific around how much is initiatives versus volume adjust, many of those initiatives that I spoke to are going to continue regardless of the volume environment. The iterations to the plan are always going to continue, but that is going to be the lever that is most sensitive to volume. But we're going to continue to drive train life. We're going to continue to drive crew productivity regardless of the volume environment. Well, let me start off, and I'd love to have Ed jump in here as well. From an intermodal perspective, as we look at where we finished fourth quarter, we delivered the best intermodal service we have put across this railroad in several years, and customers rewarded us with volume as a result. We expect to maintain that level of service based on what we've heard from our customers is their expectation. From a merchandise standpoint, we continue to see improvements in merchandise trip plan compliance throughout the year. To your point around the train makeup rules, we said that we were going to recover after we had moved forward with those, meant to again drive greater safety and resiliency across our network. We feel very confident that we've seen -- merchandise trip line compliance continue to come up throughout the year, and we feel that we're very confident as we look at 2024 based on the further discipline that we are going to build and drive inside of our merchandise network. Yeah, I'll just add to -- thanks, Mark. The proof is in the pudding that we saw a 42% reduction in our mainline accident rate this year. So, as Alan described, part of our strategy has been to safely deliver reliable and resilient service, and 2023 was a challenging year for us, but those are the types of things that are going to move the needle in driving towards \"We have a safer, more resilient product on the railroad.\" So yes, there are going to be some of those costs as Mark just outlined very well that remain embedded, with the offset being, we're going to see and deliver a safer product for our customers and through the communities we serve."

            "name": "Mark George",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 7 with an update on our costs related to the Eastern Ohio derailment. During the fourth quarter, we reached a significant milestone with the bulk of the soil remediation being completed. It's an encouraging achievement, however, as you'll note, we incurred $137 million charge in the quarter, which related to an extension the timeline for ongoing testing as well as additional work that will be completed in nearby streams. There was another $89 million incurred in legal costs and other fees. But of note, we received $76 million of insurance recoveries, bringing the total recoveries in 2023 to just over $100 million. From a cash perspective, the net outflow in 2023 was $652 million after the insurance recoveries. While we're pleased with our remediation accomplishments, we currently expect ongoing monitoring efforts and cleanup efforts will continue through 2024. There will be additional costs in the future related to legal settlements and fees, although the amounts and timing cannot currently be estimated. Moving to Slide 8, where we illustrate the impact of these fourth quarter results on our results. Our GAAP results are in the first row, while on row two we isolate the accounting to our Q4 financials related to the incident. At the bottom of the chart, you'll note the comparisons of the adjusted results to prior year. I'll be talking about our adjusted results for the remainder of the discussion. Revenues were down nearly 5%, while adjusted operating expense was 3% higher. The adjusted operating ratio for Q4 2023 was 68.8%, which represented a year-over-year deterioration, but notably was a 30 basis point sequential improvement from our third quarter performance. The sequential improvement is encouraging, but we fell short of our expectations as service-related costs did not come down as we anticipated. While our recovery efforts related to the IT outages in late Q3 restored service quickly for our customers and allowed us to handle more business, it costs more money in the form of crew-related expenses that persisted well into the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, operating income was down 19% year-over-year. Net income and EPS were down 19% and 17%, respectively. Turning now to Slide 9, adjusted operating expense for the quarter was up $59 million. The increase excluding fuel decline was up $123 million. The largest drivers of the increase were employment growth as well as inflation across all categories. In comp and ben, looking to '24, we plan to keep overall headcount levels flat versus the year end 2023 exit rate with some additional mechanical craft hiring to be offset by upcoming reductions in the non-agreement category that Alan discussed. Purchased services was up due to higher costs associated with technology spend, as well as increased mechanical services, including repairs around our auto fleet as we prepare for growth opportunities in 2024. The increase in rents was driven by short-term locomotive resources and increased car supply for our auto fleet. We expect quarterly rents in 2024 to remain slightly above these fourth quarter levels due to more adverse TTX equity costs and volumetric-related increases, partially offset by benefits coming from improved velocity. The increase in materials relates to locomotive and freight car repairs. Claims were lower year-over-year. Recall that in Q4 2022, we had a large adverse adjustment. The other component is unfavorable, driven mainly by fewer real estate gains. Moving now to Slide 10. Last quarter, we introduced this slide to help investors think about our service costs and resiliency investments, which are two components of our current cost structure. On the left side, we see costs that should not be part of our cost structure and have grown out of service that has not met planned levels, mainly related to recrews and overtime. These costs did not step down as expected in Q4 due to the crew-related costs we incurred to accelerate service recovery for our customers after the IT outages. So, while service has been at strong levels exiting the year, Q1 costs will remain somewhat elevated in part from the cold weather we are seeing here in January. Overall service costs should meaningfully unwind in Q2. On the right hand, we show costs tied to our investments in resiliency, mainly related to additional T&E crews that we have added in locations where we were understaffed, as we position Norfolk Southern to realize outsized growth in revenue and margin in a growing volume environment. Our total T&E headcount is now on an appropriate level that will allow us to absorb volume growth in '24 and beyond. There will be some additional hiring in mechanical crafts that will be offset by reductions in non-agreement positions. The additional craft hires mean that resiliency costs will settle in roughly in the $55 million per quarter range in 2024. Adding those resources will drive benefits over time of being an even safer and higher velocity operation. Moving to Slide 11 and results below operating income, other income of $38 million was up $4 million in the quarter, driven by higher interest income on the extra cash we are carrying ahead of the CSR closing. The adjusted effective tax rate was 19.2% due to a rate adjustment on our deferred state income taxes and tax-free gains on favorable company-owned life insurance. For 2024, we expect our tax rate to be in the usual 23% to 24% range. Turning to Slide 12 and recapping our full-year results. We started the year planning for modest top-line growth that would afford a level of expense growth to help drive our strategic track toward resiliency. The disruptive events of the year and an adverse macro environment upended this. Revenue declined 5%, which was meaningfully affected by about 6 points of pressure from lower fuel surcharge revenue and a sharp year-over-year decline in storage fees. At the same time, OpEx rose 5%, fueled by inflation and investments in our business. As a result, operating income fell 18%, with the operating ratio rising to 67.4%. Favorable below-the-line items and benefits from share repurchases held the EPS decline to 15%. In 2023, free cash flow was $1.4 billion lower than the prior year, representing the impact of the $650 million derailment-related outlays, as well as the lower operating income, coupled with higher CapEx. Shareholder distributions in '23 were $1.8 billion, with two-thirds being driven by our rock solid dividend and the remainder from share repurchase activity. I'll mention that we did issue debt in November and built up our cash balance to $1.6 billion at year-end, as we prepare to fund the strategic CSR purchase that is scheduled to close on March 15. As a result, we will see higher interest expense in 2024 and we will temporarily suspend share repurchases while we absorb the asset and bring our credit metrics back into our target range. It's important to remember that CSR is a highly strategic critical artery in our network, for which we had a rare window to secure and guarantee control of the asset forever. This also enables us to control longer-term costs that could have begun to escalate sharply with the upcoming lease renewal. I'll now hand over to Paul, who can provide an update on our operations. That's part of the equation. Yeah, that is part of the equation, for sure. And mix. So, I think as you go into Q1, you're going to have some of the normal seasonality that has an impact on your OR. So, I think you need to expect that the first half, Q1 in particular, is probably going to step back, but then we feel much better as we lap a lot of the headwinds that we've been talking about from this first half, the intermodal storage charges, some of the fuel price and some of the other RPU challenges we're having on coal price, I think as we get to that back half is where you're going to really start to see much stronger incrementals and drop through. And just adding to what Alan said, as we think back to the fourth quarter, it was all about driving intermodal service, recognizing that the service sensitivity of that was going to directly drive growth to this railroad, which we did see. The shift in the layering on now is towards driving that discipline and rigor inside of our merchandise network. We recognize that is where our single biggest opportunity is. Total T&E is as a result of that, essentially troughed in October. And we expect that we're going to see greater productivity as we continue to dial-in our merchandise network. That's going to be a reduced number of recrews and all the associated costs, taxis, hotels, deadheading, overtime, car hire, equipment expense. We're going to see improved capacity in our merchandise network as cars per carload improves. So that's the flywheel impact that we're talking about. So, to your question about what is fundamentally changing moving forward, it's from where we are now moving forward, a direct focus on merchandise, recognizing that's our next single biggest lever for productivity. Let me just add real quick. This entire team recognizes that a margin gap exists today between where we are and where we should be, and we're focused intently on closing and narrowing that gap before we get to an area of talking about why any remaining gap exists. There's a lot of runway still for us organically and self help. Yeah. Thanks, Justin. Let's be explicit with interest. We ended 2023 with about $17.2 billion of outstanding debt. The effective interest rate is about 4.7%. So, I would model about $210 million a quarter for interest expense on the go forward. We've essentially kind of pre-funded that CSR acquisition, so that should be relatively steady within a couple of few million dollars per quarter of that. And as we look at the moving pieces, again, we've got some headwinds here in the first half. I think as volume starts to grow as we go from Q2 to Q3 and then into Q4, we should really start to see, with the compares, a pretty good improvement year-over-year. So, I don't see so much in the first quarter certainly. I think there's a risk of regression there. But I think as we navigate the second quarter depending on volumes, but in particular in the second half is where you'll see most of the improvement. And, look, I think that 100 basis points and 150 basis points that we're talking about kind of on the go forward, we should definitely be there in the back half. Whether it translates into a full year amount or not, I think depends on a number of other factors. Thank you. Yeah. I mean, the capital guidance actually for '23, I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that was going to be largely flat with 2022. And I would say that the mix within that between reinvesting in the business and safety and resilience, it's about the same as what it was in 2022, call it about 60%, 65%, and the growth element to that is the balance, call it, 35%, and that's pretty consistent between the two years, Allison. Second part of your question again, I don't recall. The velocity piece plays into the growth. Yeah, Jordan, on the cash side, yeah, we've got the big CSR purchase here in March. We've gone outside of our preferred debt to EBITDA range at the very end of the year, in part because we've had to also fund these Palestine costs. So that will continue to consume some cash as well in 2024, and then we've got the CSR purchase in addition to that. There are no debt redemptions planned this year. So, it's really an issue of operating cash minus CapEx, gets you to free cash flow. And then, in that free cash flow, we've got our CapEx budget, which is flat with last year, as well as the CSR purchase. From there, we don't expect to have remaining cash to do share repurchase. So, as we go into 2025, we should be in a better track with EBITDA growth to start to have a more normal capital allocation cycle like we've experienced in the past. Yeah. Why don't you repeat the first part? Yeah. So, Jordan, I think as you look at it, one thing that's going to happen on the cost side is these service costs that I laid out in my chart will come out. They may not come out as great in the first quarter, largely because of what we're doing to mitigate the cold weather, but they're going to come out and they're going to start coming out in the first quarter. And the plan is that most of those will start to release here in the second quarter, if not, it will be completely gone. So that provides us some traction for sure. A lot of the other fluidity and improvements that Paul mentioned will start to really take hold and provide traction, where we actually think our T&E counts may end the year a little bit lower than where they started the year, which means you're taking on more volume and you're actually having perhaps fewer crews, that's embedded productivity right there. And then, of course, we're doing actions on the non-agreement side that will also yield some benefits. So, we feel really good about our back half and our margin profile. I think a little bit stronger revenue, we can absolutely outperform that 150 basis points in the back half -- the 100 basis points to 150 basis points in the back half, and possibly be there for the full year because of it. Thank you. Yeah. Make no mistake, Ravi, this franchise, this network is built to handle a lot more volume, but we have a lot of cost runway ahead of us. And that's what we're focused on right now and we're certainly going to welcome the revenue when it comes. And I think again that's going to drive the high incrementals at that point. Thank you. Well, with regard to the non-agreement program, maybe I'm going to assume that's what you're referring to, we had mentioned about 7% was our target and that's kind of deal over 300 people. But I think that the timing will probably start to take effect here in the second quarter, just the way the voluntary program works. So, we'll start to see the cost relief take place here in the second quarter. And frankly, the savings amount will depend upon the mix of the folks that put their names in. So, we certainly internally have a number in mind and we'll see where it settles after that. But we're going to -- aside from that, there are other areas we're going to go after. Again, we're not happy with our purchased service spend. We were in a year of very difficult, challenging situation where we had to quickly get our network up and running again from a number of challenges, be it weather or accidents. So, we've put a lot of money into quickly revamp using some outside services to quickly revamp our network on the mechanical side as well as engineering side. I would hope that those things start to really settle down. That's our focus, Paul and I, as well as even on the technology spend, we've been using a lot more software as a service, cloud-based services, which show up in purchased services as opposed to CapEx. So that's been putting pressure on our purchased services, but we've got to try to again put a lid on that growth. And I will mention that can't discount inflation. Inflation in 2023 was well over 4% in our cost structure. As we go into 2024, I expect to see inflation maybe be half of that impact. So that's going to be another area of tailwind. So, thanks for the question, David. Yeah. Look, I think the biggest issue is these costs could have quickly run away from us upon lease renewal. We did not control what the lease rate was going to be. We knew that, that would go to arbitration and it could be a significant multiple of where we were. So, it's really a benefit when you think about what it could be on the go forward, overall. There is some above-the-line benefits that we have in our depreciation today, that lesson, as well as the rent payment that goes away. But again, the interest burden and a pause on share repurchase provides a temporary hurdle for us. All right, we've got it wrong. We got another question before we wrap up here. So, I'm interpreting the question beyond the East Palestine specific impacts that we reported and kind of the aftereffects of it that are in the operating results. And I'll ask Paul to help, but clearly there were impacts that consequential from East Palestine where we accelerated those train make-up, little changes that certainly had an impact in the second quarter and probably going into the third quarter. I think we've ingested that now, and that's no longer really providing any adverse -- adding adverse impact. We have installed more additional wayside detectors that we're carrying. We're doing more testing. We've got some more people monitoring our wayside deaths, et cetera. I wouldn't say that the incremental direct safety costs that come out of EP are consequential. And frankly, I think ultimately they're going to yield to better results in the go forward, because we are running a safer railroad. We're having a much better derailment experience in terms of less frequency, as a result of some of the operational changes, including the make-up rules have had. So, overall, there's probably some -- for sure, some lingering incremental cost, because we're doing things different, but there will be a benefit longer term. Paul, do you want to add anything?"

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Nichols. You may now begin.\nLuke Nichols: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results.

Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section, along with a reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. Turning to Slide 3; it's now my distinct honour to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw.\nAlan Shaw: Good morning, and welcome to our discussion of third quarter earnings. Here with me are Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer; Paul Duncan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer. I want to begin by thanking my Norfolk Southern colleagues for working safely, serving our customers, and driving our strategic plan forward. When we charted a new course in the industry, we understood unlocking the full potential of our powerful franchise would require an enhanced focus on resilience and operational excellence across every aspect of our business. Our transformation into a more customer-centric, operations-driven service organization reveals opportunities to strengthen our franchise. We saw some of that in the third quarter with two technology outages. The first, on August 28, was caused by a defect in a vendor's software. The second, on September 29, involved a firmware maintenance issue. These incidents were unrelated and were not cybersecurity issues. We are taking measures to prevent a reoccurrence, and importantly, we are not stopping there. We have launched a top-to-bottom review of our technology infrastructure with the assistance of leading third-party experts. Operations driven means pursuing operational excellence in every aspect of our business and that includes IT. Demonstrating our progress in building resiliency, our strengthened operations leadership, enhanced operating plan and greater crew capacity enabled us to manage the technology incidents with limited disruption to our customers and grow volume through the service recovery. Throughout the third quarter, we continued to do exactly what we said we'd do when we announced our strategy. We are making smart investments and safe, reliable and resilient service. Although the macroeconomic environment of abnormally low volumes is an unwelcome headwind, it has not changed our approach or diminished our confidence that our strategy is a better way forward. The market will recover and we will be poised and leveraged to capture growth with strong incremental margins. Mark will provide detail on other cost drivers in the quarter including fuel prices and higher labor costs as a result of last year's historic wage increase for our craft colleagues. These costs combined with investments in our strategy and the backdrop of historically low volumes in the quarter contributed to significant pressure on our operating ratio, which deteriorated year-over-year and sequentially. We are clearly not satisfied with these results. We will recover from these short-term impacts to our operating ratio. As we articulated when we launched our strategy, continuous productivity improvement is a core element of our balanced approach. We are committed to achieving and maintaining industry competitive margins over the long term. Our focus on productivity is unrelenting. Under the strong leadership of Paul and his team in operations, we have an increasingly stable network with a high degree of plan compliance allowing us to iterate the plan for service and productivity and as Paul will describe, we are reducing our pipeline of conductor trainees through year-end to more normal levels among other steps. Balanced against the challenges of the quarter, there were several encouraging developments that demonstrate progress on our strategy and point to growth and profit improvement in the quarters ahead. Notably, service in the third quarter improved both year-over-year and sequentially, allowing us to onboard more business. Volume improved as well and appears to have turned a corner with each of the last four weeks running above 136,000 carloads. That's a level we haven't seen consistently since the second quarter of 2022. In part, this was a function of customers awarding us new business. Our customers see the commitment we are making to deliver more consistent, reliable service and our marketing team is creating innovative solutions to amplify the value of that service, even in a weak freight environment. Ed will talk more about this later. In addition to service and volume gains, we delivered improvements in safety as well. Our mainline train accident rate is down more than 40% year-over-year as we strengthen our safety culture and performance. In East Palestine and the surrounding communities, we continue to deliver on our commitments. Mark will provide an update on costs associated with our ongoing efforts to make things right. I visit regularly as we make significant progress cleaning the site and investing in the community's future. I'll now turn it over to Mark.\nMark George: Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 5 with an update on our accruals related to the Eastern Ohio derailment. We are pleased to report that we will be completing soil removal from the derailment site shortly, but expect that there will be ongoing testing efforts to ensure continued safety of the air, soil and water through April of 2024. And as such, we accrued $118 million in Q3 to account for this timeline extension. Additionally, we recorded another $70 million for legal and other costs incurred in the quarter. Of note, we did file our initial claim for reimbursement with our insurers during the third quarter and will continue to file claims as costs accumulate. We did receive notification of our first reimbursement under our policy of $25 million and accordingly recognize this as an offset to the costs incurred in the third quarter. The cash was actually received last week. While we were encouraged by the speed of this initial reimbursement, there are dozens of parties sharing exposure at 10 layers in the insurance tower. So we expect this cost recovery process to be protracted. Also, of the $966 million recorded as expense thus far, just more than half has been paid through September 30. Of the remaining $450 million, I'd expect roughly half to be spent in the fourth quarter and the rest to be spent in 2024. I will remind you that this situation remains fluid and we will continue working through these issues for many quarters to come. We expect that there will be additional costs that have not yet been incurred related to future settlements, fines and penalties, as well as legal fees, and we cannot predict the amounts at this time. Moving to Slide 6, where we illustrate the impact of these third quarter costs on our results; our GAAP results are in the first row, while on row 2, we isolate the accounting to our Q3 financials related to the incident and our response. At the bottom of the chart, you'll note the comparisons of the adjusted financial results to the prior year. I'll be talking about our adjusted results for the remainder of the discussion. Revenues were down 11%, adjusted operating expense was down modestly, the adjusted operating ratio for Q3 was 69.1%, which notably includes 270 basis points of headwind from net fuel price impacts. On an adjusted basis, operating income was down 28%, net income and EPS were down 37% and 35% respectively, but recall last year, we enjoyed a benefit from a state income tax change of $136 million, distorting the year-over-year comparison. Let's turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our operating revenues; and it's a quick look at the drivers of the revenue change from last year in advance of Ed getting into the market details. The biggest driver in the year-over-year revenue decline is the meaningful reduction in fuel surcharge revenue. Volumes were down 2%, which equates to a $74 million revenue decline and we are highlighting here the reduction in intramodal storage revenue of $71 million, as we are now back to more normal levels and will continue to have tough compares through Q1 of 2024. Ed will talk later about the traction we have on pricing as well as mix dynamics in the quarter that collectively inform the positive $27 million of rate mix and other. On Slide 8, let's drill into the operating expenses. Adjusted operating expenses for the quarter were down $19 million, or 1%, on a year-over-year basis. Fuel expense was down $94 million, or 25%, driven mainly by lower fuel prices. Comp and ben was down $20 million, or 3% year-over-year, as higher pay rates and employee levels were offset by a favorable comparison with Q3 last year from the $85 million charge we took related to the retroactive wage accruals. Depreciation expense was up in line with our earlier guidance. Purchase services was up due to higher costs associated with engineering activities on our network, as well as technology spend. The increase in materials and other was up $42 million and driven primarily by an adverse comp on a favorable legal settlement last year, as well as higher consumption of materials for locomotive repairs. Property sales were also lower this quarter. Moving to Slide 9, while we expect costs related to the past service issues to begin unwinding in the third quarter, additional service challenges in the quarter resulted in a delay with only moderate easing. We expect the unwind to accelerate here in the fourth quarter. Now, offsetting these fourth-quarter savings will be an increase in incremental costs related to building resiliency in a couple key areas that will pay dividends in the years ahead. Firstly, there are investments in the continuation of our hiring and locomotives in order to support both future growth and faster recoveries. Second are the investments in our craft workforce, including the quality of life enhancements like paid sick leave. These investments overall should allow for the accommodation of higher volumes that will help cover these costs along with more productivity. And on Slide 10, let's talk to a couple P&L items below operating income. Other income was up $42 million in the quarter, driven by favorable returns from our company-owned life insurance. The adjusted effective tax rate was 22.7% in line with what we normally guide. And turning to free cash flow and shareholder distribution on Slide 11, through the first nine months, free cash flow was $1.1 billion lower than prior year, with half due to derailment-related expenditures and the remainder from a combination of lower core operating results and higher CapEx. Shareholder distributions over the same nine months were $1.4 billion, thanks to our solid dividend and continued share repurchase activity. I will remind that the citizen vote in Cincinnati to approve the proposed $1.6 billion purchase of the CSR asset will take place in November. So we are reserving capital capacity for that potential transaction, which would close in mid-March of 2024. I'll now hand off to Paul to provide an update on our operations.\nPaul Duncan: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. At Norfolk Southern, everything starts with safety, so let's turn to Slide 13 for an update. In the quarter, we have made significant strides. Our injury rate is up slightly versus last year, but it has improved 30% from where we were just three years ago. Our accident rate is trending down from where we have been the past two years, and we also continue to maintain a significant reduction in our mainline accident rate through the many efforts and initiatives we have put forth, including the enhancements to our train-maker rules implemented earlier this year. While those enhancements required a significant period of operational adjustment earlier this year, they are now paying off in terms of our mainline accident rate improvement. We also remain very focused on reducing exposures and improving outcomes in our yard and terminal operations. We have made further investments in our people, including enhancements to our training and PPE programs, as well as leadership development. On all of these fronts, the results are encouraging, but we are not satisfied and will continue to drive towards our goal of being the industry leader in safety. Turning to Slide 14 for an update on service; this is another area where we have made sustained progress this last quarter. Train speeds have resumed the improving trajectory they were on before our challenging second quarter. We have also pushed to reduce dwell and improve schedule rigor in our terminals, which well now improved to its best level in two years. We're sustaining this progress in October while bringing weekly car loadings up to their highest level since Q2 2022, and while developing new service offerings that Ed will outline. As part of our scheduled railroad model though, we will drive further progress. We have to continue to minimize car dwell, maximize velocity across the railroad, sustain safe, reliable and resilient service and drive productivity. On the next two slides, we will cover how we plan to accomplish this. Turning to Slide 15, our locomotive velocity was flat year-over-year. Now that we are seeing improvements in train velocity and terminal dwell, this is an opportunity we are focused on driving further velocity and productivity in. As our terminal discipline initiatives take further hold and as network velocity takes the next step above 21 miles per hour, we expect to see this metric improve along with fuel efficiency as we bring additional tonnage onto the network. We now have a qualified teeny workforce that is sized appropriately in aggregate, although we are still investing to get them all in the right locations. We're on track to have our conductor training pipeline below 600 by yearend as indicated last quarter. As our initiatives take hold and as GTMs increase, this measure of productivity will improve from here. Moving to Slide 16 to discuss how we are driving service improvement aligned with our scheduled railroad model and how it will translate it into additional gains in resilience, productivity and ultimately growth. First is disciplined terminal execution. This starts with strict adherence to the operating plan to ensure trains are arriving on plan to balance terminal flows in both our merchandise yards and intermodal facilities. We're minimizing dwell by switching cars within six hours of arrival. At our intermodal facilities, it's ensuring we're driving precision execution to the trip plan of containers and leveraging our high frequency intermodal model. It involves maximizing connection performance, getting the right cars on the right train and departing our trains on time. The second bullet point, we are driving a culture of strict compliance to the operating plan, both at the train, car, and intermodal unit level and expect that this will drive further reductions in dwell and even greater consistency in our terminals. Next, we're investing in our people and modernizing our workforce to become more resilient and productive. For example, 250 conductors are receiving locomotive engineer training this year. This gives us resilience and flexibility to fill assignments whether the need is an engineer or a conductor or protecting future growth with an investment today. We are moving forward with the first phase of extra board consolidations, cross training 260 employees at seven key terminals across the network. Let me explain what this is. As railroads and labor agreements evolved and merged over the decades, territorial boundaries remained that prevented certain employees from working assignments that were within their geography. At many of these locations we've worked collaboratively with labor to remove those boundaries but have yet to get folks qualified to work all potential assignments. With our new focus on resilience, we're investing in our craft employees and getting them qualified to hold more assignments, providing them with greater work opportunities and offering Norfolk Southern enhanced operational flexibility and efficiency. To complement these labor modernization efforts, we are implementing predictable work scheduling, a groundbreaking work-life balance initiative negotiated with our craft colleagues, which will also streamline our back office crew management functions and drive further productivity. Lastly we are kicking off a system-wide initiative that will drive productivity and enhance our first mile last mile service. This is a substantial initiative aligned with delivering reliable service, productivity and most importantly driving additional growth of the network. To close, running a safe reliable and resilient scheduled railroad using these principles is going to improve service consistency, generate greater productivity and create capacity for growth. I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Elkins: Thanks Paul and good morning to everybody on the call. Now before we get into the numbers, I want to call out the collaboration between our teams and marketing and operations as we improve service and innovate solutions to deliver value for our shareholders and for our customers. I'll talk about it more as we move along here, but I think it's important to recognize the steady progress that we're seeing deep in these organizations that's starting to pay off. Let's start on Slide 18 and review our results for the third quarter. Norfolk Southern volumes and revenue was down 2% and 11% respectively year-over-year in the third quarter. Revenue declines, outpaced volume due to lower fuel surcharge and intermediate storage revenue compared to the prior period. Within merchandise, weakness in several energy markets was the leading driver of a 3% decline in total volume. Crude oil shipments were challenged by unfavorable fuel price differentials that discouraged crude by rail to East Coast refineries that we serve. Also, low natural gas prices negatively impacted shipments of sand and NGLs. Helping to offset those declines in energy markets was strength in automotive where volume increased 7% year-over-year in the third quarter. Growth was driven by continued strength and demand for finished vehicles as well as high shippable ground counts. Merchandise revenue was down 7% due to lower revenue from fuel surcharge and lower volume. However, revenue per unit excluding fuel set a new record as it improved 3% showing sustained price and mix improvement. This quarter marks 33 quarters out of the last 34 consecutive quarters where we've been able to achieve year-over-year growth in merchandise revenue per unit excluding fuel. Moving on to intermodal, volume was down slightly compared with last year as growth in international intermodal largely offset declines in domestic. On the domestic side, persistently abundant truck capacity and weak freight demand challenged volume. While on the international side, volume improved as customers continued to return freight to IPI service. Intermodal revenue was down 22% as revenue per unit excluding fuel declined 15%. Lower intermodal storage fees represented more than two-thirds of this decline, followed by adverse mix effects from strong international volumes and the impact of persistent competitive pressure in a loose trucking environment. We're also seeing negative mix effects within the international business. First, shippers are returning to lower yielding short haul lanes that shifted to the highway during the pandemic and second, growth in lower yielding empty shipments is also outpacing loaded shipments. Intermodal storage has returned to a normal level and we expect a lap this headwind in the second quarter of next year. Lastly, within coal, volume dropped 9% year-over-year with weak conditions in our utility markets, which more than offset strength in our export markets. Utility coal volume was down roughly 26% from prior year levels driven by high stock piles and low natural gas prices and prolonged customer and producer outages. Export volume increased year-over-year driven by strong Asian demand. Coal revenue declined 8% primarily due to lower volume. Revenue per unit excluding fuel set a new record and revenue per unit also increased as positive mix and stronger than expected seawarm coal pricing and modest liquidated damages more than offset a decline in fuel surcharge revenue. Turning to slide 19, for the fourth quarter, we expect to see slow volume recovery amid uncertain economic conditions. September presented us with some encouraging data that the contraction in manufacturing is slowing and onshoring to the US is on the rise. However, we remain cautious in our optimism as uncertainty surrounding future Fed actions, strike outcomes and geopolitical tension is very pronounced. Although the macro environment is unclear, we are steadfast in our business development initiatives and I'll talk about those in a few minutes. Our merchandised markets have upside potential in the automotive and metals markets. We expect growth in automotive as we continue to work through the backlog of shippable vehicles, improve our cycle times and grow our fleet size. We also still see unmet demand in our metals market, which we should realize as improving service should drive year-over-year growth. Offsetting anticipated growth in the fourth quarter will be sustained, soft conditions in energy markets as the headwinds that pressured crude, NGL and sand volumes in the third quarter are expected to continue through the remainder of the year. Automotive production is a key driver for many of our merchandised markets beyond automotive, so the duration and scope of the ongoing UAW strike is a downside risk to our overall merchandise volumes. Our marketing and operations teams are collaborating to deliver incremental business wins across the portfolio of carload markets that we serve by identifying and solving business challenges for our customers at an accelerating pace. This innovation and collaboration will be a driver of future growth for NS. Intermodal volume is expected to improve year-over-year in the fourth quarter from sustained service recovery and improving market conditions. We're encouraged by the momentum that we're seeing in our domestic market. Our customers are seeing improvements in bid compliance and demand, which has us trending positively in October, but we continue to see a relatively muted peak season which will temper overall volumes. International markets will benefit from strong East Coast import demand and favorable ocean rates driving demand for IPI. We expect the negative mix effects from the shift back to short haul lanes to persist in the fourth quarter, and we continue to experiment and develop new services for our intermodal customers, and I'll talk about that in just a minute. Coal volumes should be stable in the fourth quarter with upside potential in export markets as new production comes online. In addition, recent trends in seaborne coal prices suggest higher prices throughout the remainder of the year due to supply constraints out of Australia as well as continued strong demand out of China and India. Domestic coal shipments should improve sequentially in the fourth quarter on improved service and fewer outages, but headwinds from low natural gas prices will continue to be a limiting factor and while uncertainty in the economy continues to persist, we're confident in our ability to collaborate with our customers to drive incremental volume and to continue providing value in a manner that drives growth in the future. Now before I turn it back to Alan, I would like to expand briefly on how we're providing value in ways that drive growth in an unfavorable market. Slide 20 features key examples of new service offerings we developed this quarter aimed at making Norfolk Southern the preferred option for freight transportation and driving modal conversion. It's important to recognize that collaboration and teamwork invested by both marketing and operations to bring these projects to life. In October, we partnered with CN to expand intermodal service and connect customers in Atlanta and Kansas City with markets on the CN in Canada. We also partnered with Florida East Coast Railway to expand both domestic and international intermodal services in Florida. These new services are designed to give our customers flexibility, expand the reach of the NS intermodal network into key growth markets, and give more ways for our customers to reduce their supply chain greenhouse gas emissions. Early in September, we also announced an investment in DrayNow, a company focused on modernizing technology solutions for intermodal. DrayNow is revolutionizing intermodals' first and final mile journey through an app that provides customers with real-time shipment tracking and document capture of drayage shipments. Norfolk Southern is the operator of the most extensive intermodal network in the Eastern US and together with DrayNow and our best-in-class customers, we will drive more transparency into a fragmented supply chain and increase the ability to best serve our intermodal customers. And lastly, our persistent industrial development efforts paid off as both new and expanded industries turned on additional volume in the third quarter, including a new cement transload, an ethanol terminal, and a container board warehouse, as well as expanded rail operations and an established grain elevator. We'd like to thank our customers for locating on our network and allowing NS to serve their market needs. Together, these diverse projects will generate over 7,800 new car loads annually at full production. We're aggressively pursuing project-oriented growth to enhance the NS network in a fragile freight environment. We're not sitting back and waiting for car loads to come to us, but rather we are proactively making enhancements to our service portfolio to become a preferred service provider for our customers and drive sustainable and smart growth in the future. And concluding on Slide 21, let's look at our 2023 outlook. Based on lower Q3 revenue, which included significantly lower fuel surcharge, we're now expecting 2023 revenue to be down closer to 4% year over year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Alan to bring us home.\nAlan Shaw: Closing on Slide 22, although this year has presented a number of challenges, we are emerging a stronger company due to our response and our decisive action to effect necessary improvements. I'm more confident than ever that our innovative strategy is a better way forward. We are already seeing the benefits from leadership changes, plan refinements and resource investments as we drive towards our strategy. We are achieving wins with our customer base, and we are incorporating operational discipline that drives consistency and enables productivity enhancements in the quarters ahead. I am extremely optimistic about our future. We will now open the call to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess maybe we want to start on Slide 9. Mark, you laid out some of the temporary service costs and the incremental resiliency investments that you're making. I guess I want to make sure I understand how to think about that as we move into the fourth quarter, and then also really more 2024. I guess, are you able to absorb these costs and generate sequential OR improvement in the fourth quarter? And then as you look out to next year, how much of this cost kind of sticks around? How much of it actually will go away and any thoughts around the cadence of that? So thanks for that.\nMark George: Okay, thanks, Chris. Yeah, so if you start first on the service costs, we saw a slight reduction here in the third quarter. We were hoping for a little bit more, but obviously we had some disruptions to the network that delayed that. We do expect the reduction to continue here in the fourth quarter, and eventually this should unwind over the next couple quarters. As fluidity on the network improves, as we qualify more of our T&Es in the right critical locations as well, and we start to build some solid processes around delivering service as opposed to putting the band-aids on, like we are today with overtime, etcetera. So those will start to unwind here in the next couple quarters. The right-hand part of that slide, those are -- I think you need to think about those as structural cost increases. And those are really around developing and building resiliency. That's the whole point. A lot of this is related to the T&E ramp-up that we've seen as well as the investments in our locomotives. There are also costs related to the quality of life improvements that we've announced with our craft workforce and I'd say that of these costs, 75% of those will probably reside in the comp and band line, and then after that you'll see costs sitting in purchase services and also in some materials. But in terms of cadence as we go into Q4, like I said, service costs will start to come down, but that will be offset by another increase there in the structural resiliency costs.by another increase there in the structural resiliency cost. And then I think at that point, we should probably be moderating going forward into '24, but we'll give you more '24 guidance when we reconvene in January.\nAlan Shaw: And Chris, one way to look at this is, our investments in resiliency are investments in the elimination of the service recovery costs and it's also an investment in top-tier growth and in industry competitive margins. That's our vision for the future and that's what we said we were going to do when we laid this out in December of last year.\nMark George: Yeah. Ultimately, these are going to get paid for by the elimination of those temporary service costs, but also by accommodating more volume than we typically would be able to, as well as, pricing and productivity. So it's exaggerated here because we're in a down cycle.\nChris Wetherbee: And does this give you the ability to improve OR in fourth quarter still?\nMark George: Yeah, I think we're at a trough. I think we're at a trough right here.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Pleased proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi, guys. Maybe first question, can you just give us the liquidated damages in coal and where we think coal yields can trend from the high 3Q levels? And, Alan, just a bigger picture question, every rail right now has a cyclical challenge. Everybody has a fuel headwind. You guys are still reporting margins that are 600 basis points, 700 basis points worse than your direct competitor and just generally industry. I look at that as an opportunity because obviously with top SPG you've fixed the network, you're improving the service, the volumes are coming. So there's obviously progress made there, but is there an opportunity to look deeper inside the cost structure of the organization to say, listen, we're dealing with all these headwinds just like all our competitors are, but we're still our cost structure is still seemingly very, very high and what's the opportunity there if you're looking at it and how you're going about addressing those differences? Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Amit, thank you for that question. Why don't I address the second part of your one question first and then turn it over to Ed and talk about coal yields. Look, we're committed to industry competitive margins. We said that from the get-go. We've also said that returns follow the investment. We're investing over the long term and we're not going to chase short-term OR targets. We illustrated very clearly, Mark had a chart, I believe, at Investor Day that showed during a economic trough, right, our margins would get a little worse as we invested over the long term, but as you evaluate this through an economic cycle, this is the better way forward for Norfolk Southern to invest in long-term growth, deliver top-tier growth, industry competitive margins, and drive long-term shareholder value. We're not happy with our cost structure right now. As we drive operational discipline into our network, as we refresh our operations team, as we drive a high degree of plan compliance, it allows us to continue to iterate the plan for productivity and service and that's exactly what we're doing right now. Ed, you want to talk about gold yields?\nEd Elkins: Sure. Yeah. I think you asked about LDs in the quarter and I think I said in the prepared remarks, these are episodic. We don't expect them to continue. Its high single digits in terms of millions of dollars and when we look out into the fourth quarter, and again, restating what I said in the prepared remarks, we're forecasting prices to be sideways through the end of the quarter and the year and that's really predicated off the continuation of strong demand out of India and China for next quarter.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good morning and Ed, solid job on the new lanes. Interesting stuff. Alan, I just want to follow up on that question maybe a little bit more, right? So you have a lot of temporary costs and restructuring costs. Do you think you need to bring in PSR expertise to handle some of that network resiliency? That seems to be the thing that PSR does, right? It allows the quick snapback, at least for some of the peers that have implemented that process. And I'm a little confused on the resiliency investments. It sounded like when Mark went through some of them, is it paid sick leave or is there more on the resiliency expenditures? I just want to understand what's outside of agreements or costs that you've already implemented on the resiliency side. Thanks.\nAlan Shaw: Yeah. Well, thank you, Ken. Look, I've been CEO for a year and a half. We've been kinetic here. We've refreshed our operations leadership. We've implemented a new operating plan. We've launched a brand new strategy, something that's never been done in this industry. We've revamped the marketing organization. We brought in a number of outsiders and leadership roles; outsiders to the rail industry, outsiders to Norfolk Southern. I believe we've got the right team going forward. We will continue to look for opportunities to improve our strategic talent base. With respect to the resiliency costs, some of that has to do with predictable work schedules. Some of that has to do with the historic wage increase that the rail industry and labor came to agreement on last year. Some of it has to do with hiring or investing in additional resources and as a result of that, what you're seeing is third quarter service is better year over year and better sequentially. Our safety figures improved in the third quarter and our volume growth right now, our volumes the last four weeks are at levels that we haven't seen in the last, say, second quarter of last year. So we are making progress. We're doing exactly what we said we're going to do. This is the better way forward for Norfolk Southern to drive long-term shareholder value.\nEd Elkins: And Ken, just to put a fine point on the resiliency expense, about a third of that cost in the third quarter is related to the quality of life benefits, which are essentially paid sick leave. That has a cost to it. And the rest is really around the headcount additions for primarily T&E, but also some mechanical staff and then the rest is locomotive investments as well to be able to accommodate and accelerate the network. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question is in the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Mark, I wasn't sure what you were trying to say on overall cost, ex fuel in Q4 versus Q3, so if you have any color there. And then, Al, I just want to go back to that big picture question. You've been clear and consistent with your message. We're not going to chase short-term OR, but long-term we want to have industry competitive margin. I guess my question is, what does 2024 look like in that short-term versus long-term view? Like, are we committed to margin improvement next year? Are we committed to starting to narrow this margin gap next year, because it is getting pretty wide right now. So I just want to know, when do we start to see it get to industry competitive again?\nAlan Shaw: Mark, you want to address the first one?\nMark George: Oh, yeah. Sorry. Scott, look, I think the way you look at cost, ex fuel, to answer your specific question, it should be largely sideways and then, you sprinkle in the nice uptick we've seen in volumes. I think we've definitely probably troughed here in Q3, and we should see sequential margin improvement. Model out what you think that volume is going to be as we navigate through the quarter, and we report our volumes and you can pretty much assign traditional incremental margin rate to that. So I think we've troughed here in Q3, and it should improve from there.\nAlan Shaw: And Scott, with respect to industry competitive margins, we are committed to it. We're committed to it over the long term. Now, what we'll see is that as service continues to improve, we'll have greater opportunity to eliminate the service recovery cost. We'll have greater opportunity to drive productivity throughout our organization as we standardize our operating practices. We'll have greater opportunity to generate more volume. We'll have greater opportunity to generate more price, reflecting the value of the product that we sell and all of those things will contribute to improvements in our margins and industry competitive margins and I think we're going to see improvement in that next year.\nScott Group: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah, good morning. So I think it seems fairly clear that it's not so much a cost story, but it's much more volume and a revenue story that you need to drive that margin improvement and correct me if you think I'm wrong on that, but the question is really, what do you think is necessary to really get that revenue story improving? I think we look at the intermodal revenue per car was pretty weak in the quarter. I know there's some mix, but how do you think about that intermodal revenue strengthening? Is that mix going to improve over a couple quarters? Do we really need to see some tightening in the truckload market? I know a lot of your business is truck competitive, so is that something that truck rates are key. Just maybe if you could offer some thoughts, I guess intermodal on that revenue per car, but broader thoughts on '24, what should we be looking for to really potentially drive that revenue story stronger?\nAlan Shaw: Yeah, Tom, to be clear, this is a balanced approach. It's not just about revenue growth. We will continue to drive productivity into our organization. I'm committed to that. Our improved service product is going to help us with productivity. Our improved service product is going to help us attract more volume. Our improved service product is going to help us price to the value of our product. So there's a lot of value in there as we continue to invest in network resiliency long term. Ed, why don't you talk about what you're seeing in the market itself?\nEd Elkins: Sure. It's a really important question that I appreciate you asking and we want to unpeel the onion here and make sure that everybody understands. First of all, let me say, year to date, we are positive in our core pricing in every single market we serve, okay. Now, let's dig into intermodal. The largest impact once we stripped fuel out was a decline in our intermodal storage revenue. We knew that that was going to happen. And as I think I said in the prepared remarks, that storage figure accounts for over two-thirds of the RPU decline that we saw in the quarter and then we had a couple other things that were very important for folks to understand. We had substantial negative mix in the quarter, and that comes in two forms. The first is international shipments grew while domestic shipments were very anemic given the amount of pressure that's out there in the truckload market. Our domestic shipments have a higher yield than international, so this was a substantial headwind. We also saw negative mix in two different ways within our international business. First of all, we're seeing much higher growth in short haul lanes, and those are lanes that really shifted to the highway during the pandemic and then are now rolling back to us. 85% of the growth in the third quarter in international came from those short haul lanes, and those are intrastate lanes, so it's very important to understand that. Lastly, the amount of empties that we moved is, frankly, much faster-paced growth than the lows that we saw. That is another decrimental pressure on RPUs. So a lot going on there. The truck market continues to be loose. I think the cash rate index has been down for 21 straight months. Contract rates on the highway peaked in March of last year. There's a lot of downward pressure, but here's what I'm confident of. Number one, I'm confident that the market in general will rotate back to growth. It always does. The excess capacity that's on the highway will evacuate. It always does and Norfolk Southern is going to be really well positioned, exceptionally well positioned to take advantage of not only the volume increases, but also the opportunity to reprice.\nOperator: Our next question is in the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It may be a two-parter for Ed. Can you just give us an update? I think last time you mentioned that the $650 million headwind in the back half of the year for coal and accessorials or intermodal storage fees. Is that sort of still tracking in line with expectations? And then secondly to your point about core pricing, can you just give a little more color on where that is relative to inflation? I think we have seen a decent disconnect in terms of just the core pricing realization for Norfolk and for some of the industry in terms of how that trended versus inflation, which is higher than expected. So when do you expect to really sort of catch up with that? Is there something structural that's been keeping it lower than what we would have anticipated? Or is this more a matter of timing with contracts, repricing and service? How do you expect that rolling forward?\nAlan Shaw: Well, let me try to answer both of those. First one, I think you were asking about some of the known headwinds that we had coming in the second half and if they're intact. And I would say yes. We've seen the storage revenue really normalized to pre-pandemic levels and that's persisted and it's been very consistent throughout most of the year. We all know what fuel's doing. On that storage piece, we expect to lap that probably second quarter of next year and so that's going to be a headwind until then. Coal pricing is a surprise to the upside and we'll see where it goes from here. So that's sort of the known pieces of this. On the core pricing side, I think it's probably worth reviewing, what our strategy is and that's, number one, we're always compelled to deliver a competitive price in the marketplace that our customers can recognize value in, but we define that by long-term contract pricing, not by what's going on in the spot markets. That recipe over time has generated above-rail inflation pricing for many, many quarters now. We're confident that it will in the future. Okay, it's a very unusual truck market right now. We know that. But on our merchandise business in particular, we recognize our mid-single-digit pricing in this quarter and again, we're positive for price here today.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. Last quarter, you talked about $175 million to $200 million of lost revenue from the operational disruptions associated with East Palestine. Any updated thoughts on the timing of when this revenue can be recovered? I'm curious if that's something that could be driving some of the improvement in volumes and then on the two tech outages, any way you can quantify the impact you've seen from those thus far?\nAlan Shaw: Ed, why don't you talk about revenue outlook and the cadence?\nEd Elkins: Sure. As service improves, and it is improving both sequentially and year-over-year. Our customers are very encouraged by that, and they're telling us that. That improvement in service is going to bring freight back to Norfolk Southern. We know our customers are very sophisticated supply chain managers and purchasers and when we're not on plan, they have to make other plans to keep their factories running. Some of our customers are going to see that value faster and as we cycle equipment faster, they're immediately going to be able to load more revenue onto Norfolk Southern. I think of markets like metals, like automotive, even though there is a strike right now, I think of that in the construction market and the aggregates market and some of the more flexible freight markets, we have to demonstrate persistent value in the form of reliable, sustainable service over a longer period of time, but we're making sure that our customers are well aware of our progress.\nAlan Shaw: Yeah, with respect to the tech outages, really, the revenue impact was largely inconsequential. It was more of a service issue and a cost issue associated with the slower network and the recruits. Really, what it does for us is it reaffirms the importance in investing in the resiliency of our network so we can weather anything that comes at us.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJonathan Chappell: Thank you. Ed, Alan pointed out you've had four weeks now of volumes that have been back to the 2Q '22 levels, but it seems like you still have a lot of red traffic lights or yellow traffic lights on the freight category that you laid out in your slides. How much can we see acceleration if some of those traffic lights turn in your favor? This run rate that you've had the last four weeks seems to be kind of a catch-up and service-related, but if you get a macro tailwind behind you, what can those levels go to with the service operating at the levels that it is today?\nAlan Shaw: I'm going to try to be very tight with this answer. Number one, we're really glad to see a peak season happen this year, and we're encouraged by that. Our services allow us to deliver that. This network is built for a lot more freight than we're handling right now and as our customers recognize and are able to deliver that value to their customers, we're going to be able to handle a lot more freight. I'm confident in that. The fact is, and this is the last thing I'll say on it, economic uncertainty and geopolitical uncertainty are very high right now and I think we see that in the headlines every single day and it's just something that we have to keep in mind. That's probably why some of those lights are colored the way they are right now.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. I just want to go back to Intermodal and I would say the share recapture there. I know you talked about service and you talked about sort of that time to sort of regain that confidence. Is that something you're starting to see now or hear now from your customers where we could see that start to accelerate in the next few months despite what's going on in the overall macro Intermodal market? Just any thoughts there on your opportunities set for that?\nAlan Shaw: Well, you're right. We are seeing volume come back and I can't say enough about the quality of the customers that we have in our portfolio. We're very lucky to have our customers. They are certainly best in class. They're out on the street everyday converting freight from the highway to Norfolk Southern and it's because we're able to offer value that they can demonstrate to those customers. So, yes, I think that we have the opportunity here to deliver additional value to our shareholders in the form of more volume, more revenue, particularly from the Intermodal market. We have a network that's really built for that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Alan, I think in response to a question earlier, you talked about standardizing operating practices across the network as you look into next year. Maybe I'm mischaracterizing what you said, but I guess can you put that in context for us? I thought the op plan had been set. You guys had learned the changes from the train makeup rules, but maybe there's more to come.\nAlan Shaw: Yeah, that's been an ongoing effort by Paul and his team to standardize the operating practices within our terminals, which allows us to drive further productivity and further capacity improvements and further service improvements. And that's just part of, you know, the PSR principles.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah, hi. Just a follow-up, with Velocity and Dwell recovering so well of late, is there a way to assess, how much of that comes from the better operations, the changes you've made there versus adding the headcount to get it closer to where you need to be? And do we think about headcount sort of flatlining from here on out, roughly? Thanks.\nAlan Shaw: Yeah, Jordan, we've always said that service is a function of leadership, plan and resources. We've refreshed our leadership within operations. We've implemented a new plan and we're driving a high degree of compliance to the plan. And we're investing in resources, whether that's additional T and E employees, cross-training conductors to become engineers or investing in quality of life issues. Those are all generating results for us, and you can see that with the service metrics. You can see that with the volume metrics as well. Mark, you want to talk about overall headcount?\nMark George: Yeah, the headcount certainly helps. We've augmented in a lot of our critical locations, the staffing in order to improve our fluidity there. So that's a big driver. We've invested money in locomotives, so we have more locomotives available as well. And frankly, Paul, why don't you talk a little bit about the process changes that we're making in the terminals, which really are sticky and fundamental drivers for running a scheduled railroad?\nPaul Duncan: Well, you're spot on. We are seeing results from refreshing our operating leadership, resourcing up, and executing the plan in both volume train speed, and terminal dwell and as Alan highlighted, matched to our premise of running as a scheduled railroad, it's a focus on running the plan; right car, right train, right day, enforcing a high degree of compliance to the plan. Again, that is a fundamental tenant of running a scheduled railroad. It's driving that accountability. We expect to see further consistency as the year progresses. Certainly expect to see dwell continue to improve, train speed continue to improve and as we have seen these metrics quarter our velocity improve, we're going to layer on productivity initiatives as we talked, and that's going to be the focus of us in 2024. Running reliable service and layering on productivity.\nAlan Shaw: Jordan, you asked about where headcount's going. Let me just put a fine point on that. I do think that our conductor training pipeline really starts to taper down here in the fourth quarter, and I'd expect that we'd probably end the year just under 600. We have enough qualified T&E here probably in the fourth quarter to start capturing meaningful growth that might be on the horizon. And it's really about balancing where those T&E are amongst our hiring locations and we want to make sure that we're not just adequately staffed, but we're at resilient levels in those critical locations. But probably, I would say the other area of headcount, we're going to need some more supervisors now as you add a lot more T&E. So that's probably the remaining pickup you'll see in some of the resilience investments that we're making in the fourth quarter is really around the area of field supervision. But in terms of overall T&E, I think we're cresting here. And now we'll be able to handle more volume and start driving productivity to also take another step up in volume absorption. So that's kind of the roadmap on T&E.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Alan and team, good morning. Wanted to follow up a little bit on the automotive side. You guys mentioned that there's a backlog of finished vehicles that you could move. Can you give us a sense of how many weeks you think that backlog is for you guys just in case the UAW strike drags on longer than most people would want? And then you made a comment about near shoring and how that is looking really good for you potentially down the road. Do you have any numbers from your industrial development projects? If you can compare in the prior years, that'd be great. Thank you.\nEd Elkins: Sure. And thanks for the question. This is Ed. On the automotive side, yes, there have been high shipable ground counts at a lot of places that we originate from. The strike duration is probably longer than I want it to be right now, to be honest with you. And those shipable ground counts are going to dwindle over time and we'll see where it goes. I really can't be more granular than that because of the nature of the strike, which has moved from place to place. On the industrial development side, there's over 600 projects in the pipeline right now. We've seen tremendous investment, mostly in the southeast and the Midwest, which is very beneficial for our network and for our customers. I highlighted a few of those during the prepared remarks and just to be more anecdotal about it, in September we had three new lumber shippers that either originated or started receiving traffic just that month and that's really highlighting, number one, the strength of that, what I would call non-res or manufacturing construction economy, which is, I think, higher now than it was during the entire 2000s for the U.S. Most of that is focused east of the Mississippi River, and most of that is focused again in the Midwest and the Southeast. So we think we're really well teed up, really well positioned for what I think Alan has referred to as a manufacturing super cycle in the coming decade.\nJason Seidl: Well, I certainly hope so. You mentioned 600 projects. How does that compare to, say, pre-pandemic?\nEd Elkins: Still elevated from a pre-pandemic level. The EV supply chain is really a new frontier that's out there and I think in one of our previous calls I mentioned that there's been over $70 billion invested into that, and about 30% of that is on our lines. Whether it's the Infrastructure Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS Act, there are a lot of compelling reasons, along with geopolitical instability and affordable and reliable energy, to make the U.S. a very compelling place to be.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks, everybody. Just to follow up, the comments on the customer preference for short-haul moves and the empty moves is pretty interesting. Do you have a sense that this is cyclical, or could this be structural given evolutions of supply chains and when the up cycle comes, are you confident that shippers will not choose to prefer faster, shorter-haul truck moves over rail moves?\nAlan Shaw: Thanks for the question. On the international side, we saw those lanes suffer the most during the pandemic, where steamship lines were basically moving port to port and then allowing customers to pick it up there. That naturally is the part that has reverted back the most and I would say it's naturally reverted back the most strongly because of the capability that we have in some of those markets, like from Savannah into the Southeast, like from Charleston into the Southeast, like from Norfolk into the Midwest, and even from the Port of New York into the hinterland markets. We have a really good portfolio of intermodal services and I'll remind you that over 100 million Americans wake up every morning within 50 miles of one of our intermodal terminals. That is a compelling strength that we think is going to allow us to succeed both on the international end and the domestic side.\nEd Elkins: Yeah, look, this is a positive for us, right? This shows that we can add value into the market and even short-haul lanes where rail traditionally has not been competitive and we can do that because of our focus on productivity. We can do that because of our focus on the value of our service product. In the East, that's why we're very confident, right, that we've got a franchise that faces the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. economy.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nBascome Majors: Mark, thanks for all the detail you gave us on the Eastern Ohio spending in the plan forward. Can you talk about, without necessarily quantifying, but the timeline of any major charges or outflows that you have a little bit of visibility into that are still ahead of you and is there a point where your ongoing spending tapers off, but the insurance and legal recoveries are still coming in, and your response to this incident shifts from a cash flow burden to a cash flow tailwind? Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Okay, Bascome. Thank you very much for that, for the question. We're certainly pleased that we're winding down the site remediation work, which obviously has been costly, as you've seen from my chart and the impact there, but I do think we've got issues that we're going to be working through for several quarters to come and it's really impossible right now, Bascome, to predict the amounts or the timing and, there could be a lot more developments that lead to additional costs, and in particular with regard to litigation matters, fines, penalties, legal fees and these could end up being material, but at the same time, we do have insurance recoveries that have started. We actually got our first cash recovery, that $25 million I cited, that we recorded in the quarter. We actually got the cash last week for that, so that's good. But I don't think that you should expect to see significant, meaningful cash recoveries from insurance in the near term. I think these things are really going to become protracted, but so it's hard to even match the timeline of those inflows with what potential future outflows might be. I think with regard to insurance in general, I think, just bear in mind, it would be reasonable to expect significant premium increases going forward as a result of an incident of this size. So hopefully that's helpful, Bascome. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is in the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Nolan: Yeah, hi. I appreciate it. I wanted to go back to some of the development that you're seeing from some of your customers, and specifically, it's sort of a little bit of a mixed signal. It sounds like there's a lot of people moving forward, but then the lights are not all green. I guess I was curious, have you seen any, as a function of higher interest rates or ambiguity in the market or whatever, any of those projects that make up that $600 on your book here, have any of those shifted to the right, or is there any reason to think that maybe those aren't all full steam ahead?\nAlan Shaw: Yeah, and well, let me start by reminding everybody, those lives are just for the fourth quarter, so to speak, near-term outlook. Here's what we've seen. We've seen an acceleration in projects associated with manufacturing, probably seen some tail-off or deceleration in projects associated with warehousing and I think that's a direct function of some of the pressure that's coming from interest rates out there. But, you think about whether it's aggregates, whether it's lumber, whether it's structural steel, there is a lot of pent-up demand out there to move product into these building sites. You think about any energy-intensive industry around the world, if you want to be in a place that is not only ecologically responsible, but has reliable, stable, predictable, affordable energy, and great infrastructure to connect you to the rest of the world, the U.S. is compelling. The eastern U.S. is very compelling with its customer base, and the southeast is exceptionally compelling for those.\nOperator: Our final question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for the call today. So, Mark, I wanted to go back to one of your earlier comments about sort of expecting average incrementals when volumes do turn. I'm just trying to figure out how I can get comfortable with that, thinking about costs being structurally higher and some of the mixed headwinds that Ed's pointing to in terms of both the short-haul intermodal, bringing back more international entities into the network, and seasoning some of these new intermodal services. Is that average incrementals, is that sort of the day one when volume turns, or should we be thinking about that more as the middle part of the cycle when we think about incremental margins? Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Yeah, look, I think we've had a challenging mixed environment here the past couple quarters that have been consuming a lot of the positive pricing, core pricing that Ed and his team have been capturing. At some point, that mixed headwind will reverse, it usually does. But as we think sequentially going into Q4, we're going to have some of the structural headwinds for sure, but that should be offset by the temporary costs related to the service. So I think we're kind of neutral there. And then we're not going to have the same type of fuel headwinds that we had in the third quarter. In fact, I don't think, I think it could be probably flat neutral, maybe slightly, slightly positive. So really, we're talking about volume dropping through. We have seen a nice uptick sequentially in volume, and that should drop through with those normal incrementals of call it 60% or plus. So that's the way I think about Q4 and then longer term, things should play out that way. In any given quarter, obviously, mix is playing a role and hopefully, it's not adverse going into 2024, the way it's been here these past couple few quarters.\nOperator: This concludes the question and answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Alan Shaw for closing comments.\nAlan Shaw: We certainly appreciate your participation and your questions this morning. Thanks for joining.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alan Shaw",
            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to our discussion of third quarter earnings. Here with me are Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer; Paul Duncan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer. I want to begin by thanking my Norfolk Southern colleagues for working safely, serving our customers, and driving our strategic plan forward. When we charted a new course in the industry, we understood unlocking the full potential of our powerful franchise would require an enhanced focus on resilience and operational excellence across every aspect of our business. Our transformation into a more customer-centric, operations-driven service organization reveals opportunities to strengthen our franchise. We saw some of that in the third quarter with two technology outages. The first, on August 28, was caused by a defect in a vendor's software. The second, on September 29, involved a firmware maintenance issue. These incidents were unrelated and were not cybersecurity issues. We are taking measures to prevent a reoccurrence, and importantly, we are not stopping there. We have launched a top-to-bottom review of our technology infrastructure with the assistance of leading third-party experts. Operations driven means pursuing operational excellence in every aspect of our business and that includes IT. Demonstrating our progress in building resiliency, our strengthened operations leadership, enhanced operating plan and greater crew capacity enabled us to manage the technology incidents with limited disruption to our customers and grow volume through the service recovery. Throughout the third quarter, we continued to do exactly what we said we'd do when we announced our strategy. We are making smart investments and safe, reliable and resilient service. Although the macroeconomic environment of abnormally low volumes is an unwelcome headwind, it has not changed our approach or diminished our confidence that our strategy is a better way forward. The market will recover and we will be poised and leveraged to capture growth with strong incremental margins. Mark will provide detail on other cost drivers in the quarter including fuel prices and higher labor costs as a result of last year's historic wage increase for our craft colleagues. These costs combined with investments in our strategy and the backdrop of historically low volumes in the quarter contributed to significant pressure on our operating ratio, which deteriorated year-over-year and sequentially. We are clearly not satisfied with these results. We will recover from these short-term impacts to our operating ratio. As we articulated when we launched our strategy, continuous productivity improvement is a core element of our balanced approach. We are committed to achieving and maintaining industry competitive margins over the long term. Our focus on productivity is unrelenting. Under the strong leadership of Paul and his team in operations, we have an increasingly stable network with a high degree of plan compliance allowing us to iterate the plan for service and productivity and as Paul will describe, we are reducing our pipeline of conductor trainees through year-end to more normal levels among other steps. Balanced against the challenges of the quarter, there were several encouraging developments that demonstrate progress on our strategy and point to growth and profit improvement in the quarters ahead. Notably, service in the third quarter improved both year-over-year and sequentially, allowing us to onboard more business. Volume improved as well and appears to have turned a corner with each of the last four weeks running above 136,000 carloads. That's a level we haven't seen consistently since the second quarter of 2022. In part, this was a function of customers awarding us new business. Our customers see the commitment we are making to deliver more consistent, reliable service and our marketing team is creating innovative solutions to amplify the value of that service, even in a weak freight environment. Ed will talk more about this later. In addition to service and volume gains, we delivered improvements in safety as well. Our mainline train accident rate is down more than 40% year-over-year as we strengthen our safety culture and performance. In East Palestine and the surrounding communities, we continue to deliver on our commitments. Mark will provide an update on costs associated with our ongoing efforts to make things right. I visit regularly as we make significant progress cleaning the site and investing in the community's future. I'll now turn it over to Mark. Closing on Slide 22, although this year has presented a number of challenges, we are emerging a stronger company due to our response and our decisive action to effect necessary improvements. I'm more confident than ever that our innovative strategy is a better way forward. We are already seeing the benefits from leadership changes, plan refinements and resource investments as we drive towards our strategy. We are achieving wins with our customer base, and we are incorporating operational discipline that drives consistency and enables productivity enhancements in the quarters ahead. I am extremely optimistic about our future. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? And Chris, one way to look at this is, our investments in resiliency are investments in the elimination of the service recovery costs and it's also an investment in top-tier growth and in industry competitive margins. That's our vision for the future and that's what we said we were going to do when we laid this out in December of last year. Amit, thank you for that question. Why don't I address the second part of your one question first and then turn it over to Ed and talk about coal yields. Look, we're committed to industry competitive margins. We said that from the get-go. We've also said that returns follow the investment. We're investing over the long term and we're not going to chase short-term OR targets. We illustrated very clearly, Mark had a chart, I believe, at Investor Day that showed during a economic trough, right, our margins would get a little worse as we invested over the long term, but as you evaluate this through an economic cycle, this is the better way forward for Norfolk Southern to invest in long-term growth, deliver top-tier growth, industry competitive margins, and drive long-term shareholder value. We're not happy with our cost structure right now. As we drive operational discipline into our network, as we refresh our operations team, as we drive a high degree of plan compliance, it allows us to continue to iterate the plan for productivity and service and that's exactly what we're doing right now. Ed, you want to talk about gold yields? Yeah. Well, thank you, Ken. Look, I've been CEO for a year and a half. We've been kinetic here. We've refreshed our operations leadership. We've implemented a new operating plan. We've launched a brand new strategy, something that's never been done in this industry. We've revamped the marketing organization. We brought in a number of outsiders and leadership roles; outsiders to the rail industry, outsiders to Norfolk Southern. I believe we've got the right team going forward. We will continue to look for opportunities to improve our strategic talent base. With respect to the resiliency costs, some of that has to do with predictable work schedules. Some of that has to do with the historic wage increase that the rail industry and labor came to agreement on last year. Some of it has to do with hiring or investing in additional resources and as a result of that, what you're seeing is third quarter service is better year over year and better sequentially. Our safety figures improved in the third quarter and our volume growth right now, our volumes the last four weeks are at levels that we haven't seen in the last, say, second quarter of last year. So we are making progress. We're doing exactly what we said we're going to do. This is the better way forward for Norfolk Southern to drive long-term shareholder value. Mark, you want to address the first one? And Scott, with respect to industry competitive margins, we are committed to it. We're committed to it over the long term. Now, what we'll see is that as service continues to improve, we'll have greater opportunity to eliminate the service recovery cost. We'll have greater opportunity to drive productivity throughout our organization as we standardize our operating practices. We'll have greater opportunity to generate more volume. We'll have greater opportunity to generate more price, reflecting the value of the product that we sell and all of those things will contribute to improvements in our margins and industry competitive margins and I think we're going to see improvement in that next year. Yeah, Tom, to be clear, this is a balanced approach. It's not just about revenue growth. We will continue to drive productivity into our organization. I'm committed to that. Our improved service product is going to help us with productivity. Our improved service product is going to help us attract more volume. Our improved service product is going to help us price to the value of our product. So there's a lot of value in there as we continue to invest in network resiliency long term. Ed, why don't you talk about what you're seeing in the market itself? Well, let me try to answer both of those. First one, I think you were asking about some of the known headwinds that we had coming in the second half and if they're intact. And I would say yes. We've seen the storage revenue really normalized to pre-pandemic levels and that's persisted and it's been very consistent throughout most of the year. We all know what fuel's doing. On that storage piece, we expect to lap that probably second quarter of next year and so that's going to be a headwind until then. Coal pricing is a surprise to the upside and we'll see where it goes from here. So that's sort of the known pieces of this. On the core pricing side, I think it's probably worth reviewing, what our strategy is and that's, number one, we're always compelled to deliver a competitive price in the marketplace that our customers can recognize value in, but we define that by long-term contract pricing, not by what's going on in the spot markets. That recipe over time has generated above-rail inflation pricing for many, many quarters now. We're confident that it will in the future. Okay, it's a very unusual truck market right now. We know that. But on our merchandise business in particular, we recognize our mid-single-digit pricing in this quarter and again, we're positive for price here today. Ed, why don't you talk about revenue outlook and the cadence? Yeah, with respect to the tech outages, really, the revenue impact was largely inconsequential. It was more of a service issue and a cost issue associated with the slower network and the recruits. Really, what it does for us is it reaffirms the importance in investing in the resiliency of our network so we can weather anything that comes at us. I'm going to try to be very tight with this answer. Number one, we're really glad to see a peak season happen this year, and we're encouraged by that. Our services allow us to deliver that. This network is built for a lot more freight than we're handling right now and as our customers recognize and are able to deliver that value to their customers, we're going to be able to handle a lot more freight. I'm confident in that. The fact is, and this is the last thing I'll say on it, economic uncertainty and geopolitical uncertainty are very high right now and I think we see that in the headlines every single day and it's just something that we have to keep in mind. That's probably why some of those lights are colored the way they are right now. Well, you're right. We are seeing volume come back and I can't say enough about the quality of the customers that we have in our portfolio. We're very lucky to have our customers. They are certainly best in class. They're out on the street everyday converting freight from the highway to Norfolk Southern and it's because we're able to offer value that they can demonstrate to those customers. So, yes, I think that we have the opportunity here to deliver additional value to our shareholders in the form of more volume, more revenue, particularly from the Intermodal market. We have a network that's really built for that. Yeah, that's been an ongoing effort by Paul and his team to standardize the operating practices within our terminals, which allows us to drive further productivity and further capacity improvements and further service improvements. And that's just part of, you know, the PSR principles. Yeah, Jordan, we've always said that service is a function of leadership, plan and resources. We've refreshed our leadership within operations. We've implemented a new plan and we're driving a high degree of compliance to the plan. And we're investing in resources, whether that's additional T and E employees, cross-training conductors to become engineers or investing in quality of life issues. Those are all generating results for us, and you can see that with the service metrics. You can see that with the volume metrics as well. Mark, you want to talk about overall headcount? Jordan, you asked about where headcount's going. Let me just put a fine point on that. I do think that our conductor training pipeline really starts to taper down here in the fourth quarter, and I'd expect that we'd probably end the year just under 600. We have enough qualified T&E here probably in the fourth quarter to start capturing meaningful growth that might be on the horizon.

So that's probably the remaining pickup you'll see in some of the resilience investments that we're making in the fourth quarter is really around the area of field supervision. But in terms of overall T&E, I think we're cresting here. And now we'll be able to handle more volume and start driving productivity to also take another step up in volume absorption. So that's kind of the roadmap on T&E. Thanks for the question. On the international side, we saw those lanes suffer the most during the pandemic, where steamship lines were basically moving port to port and then allowing customers to pick it up there. That naturally is the part that has reverted back the most and I would say it's naturally reverted back the most strongly because of the capability that we have in some of those markets, like from Savannah into the Southeast, like from Charleston into the Southeast, like from Norfolk into the Midwest, and even from the Port of New York into the hinterland markets. We have a really good portfolio of intermodal services and I'll remind you that over 100 million Americans wake up every morning within 50 miles of one of our intermodal terminals. That is a compelling strength that we think is going to allow us to succeed both on the international end and the domestic side. Okay, Bascome. Thank you very much for that, for the question. We're certainly pleased that we're winding down the site remediation work, which obviously has been costly, as you've seen from my chart and the impact there, but I do think we've got issues that we're going to be working through for several quarters to come and it's really impossible right now, Bascome, to predict the amounts or the timing and, there could be a lot more developments that lead to additional costs, and in particular with regard to litigation matters, fines, penalties, legal fees and these could end up being material, but at the same time, we do have insurance recoveries that have started. We actually got our first cash recovery, that $25 million I cited, that we recorded in the quarter. We actually got the cash last week for that, so that's good. But I don't think that you should expect to see significant, meaningful cash recoveries from insurance in the near term. I think these things are really going to become protracted, but so it's hard to even match the timeline of those inflows with what potential future outflows might be. I think with regard to insurance in general, I think, just bear in mind, it would be reasonable to expect significant premium increases going forward as a result of an incident of this size. So hopefully that's helpful, Bascome. Thank you. Yeah, and well, let me start by reminding everybody, those lives are just for the fourth quarter, so to speak, near-term outlook. Here's what we've seen. We've seen an acceleration in projects associated with manufacturing, probably seen some tail-off or deceleration in projects associated with warehousing and I think that's a direct function of some of the pressure that's coming from interest rates out there. But, you think about whether it's aggregates, whether it's lumber, whether it's structural steel, there is a lot of pent-up demand out there to move product into these building sites. You think about any energy-intensive industry around the world, if you want to be in a place that is not only ecologically responsible, but has reliable, stable, predictable, affordable energy, and great infrastructure to connect you to the rest of the world, the U.S. is compelling. The eastern U.S. is very compelling with its customer base, and the southeast is exceptionally compelling for those. Yeah, look, I think we've had a challenging mixed environment here the past couple quarters that have been consuming a lot of the positive pricing, core pricing that Ed and his team have been capturing. At some point, that mixed headwind will reverse, it usually does. But as we think sequentially going into Q4, we're going to have some of the structural headwinds for sure, but that should be offset by the temporary costs related to the service. So I think we're kind of neutral there. And then we're not going to have the same type of fuel headwinds that we had in the third quarter. In fact, I don't think, I think it could be probably flat neutral, maybe slightly, slightly positive. So really, we're talking about volume dropping through. We have seen a nice uptick sequentially in volume, and that should drop through with those normal incrementals of call it 60% or plus. So that's the way I think about Q4 and then longer term, things should play out that way. In any given quarter, obviously, mix is playing a role and hopefully, it's not adverse going into 2024, the way it's been here these past couple few quarters. We certainly appreciate your participation and your questions this morning. Thanks for joining."

            "name": "Ed Elkins",
            "content": "Thanks Paul and good morning to everybody on the call. Now before we get into the numbers, I want to call out the collaboration between our teams and marketing and operations as we improve service and innovate solutions to deliver value for our shareholders and for our customers. I'll talk about it more as we move along here, but I think it's important to recognize the steady progress that we're seeing deep in these organizations that's starting to pay off. Let's start on Slide 18 and review our results for the third quarter. Norfolk Southern volumes and revenue was down 2% and 11% respectively year-over-year in the third quarter. Revenue declines, outpaced volume due to lower fuel surcharge and intermediate storage revenue compared to the prior period. Within merchandise, weakness in several energy markets was the leading driver of a 3% decline in total volume. Crude oil shipments were challenged by unfavorable fuel price differentials that discouraged crude by rail to East Coast refineries that we serve. Also, low natural gas prices negatively impacted shipments of sand and NGLs. Helping to offset those declines in energy markets was strength in automotive where volume increased 7% year-over-year in the third quarter. Growth was driven by continued strength and demand for finished vehicles as well as high shippable ground counts. Merchandise revenue was down 7% due to lower revenue from fuel surcharge and lower volume. However, revenue per unit excluding fuel set a new record as it improved 3% showing sustained price and mix improvement. This quarter marks 33 quarters out of the last 34 consecutive quarters where we've been able to achieve year-over-year growth in merchandise revenue per unit excluding fuel. Moving on to intermodal, volume was down slightly compared with last year as growth in international intermodal largely offset declines in domestic. On the domestic side, persistently abundant truck capacity and weak freight demand challenged volume. While on the international side, volume improved as customers continued to return freight to IPI service. Intermodal revenue was down 22% as revenue per unit excluding fuel declined 15%. Lower intermodal storage fees represented more than two-thirds of this decline, followed by adverse mix effects from strong international volumes and the impact of persistent competitive pressure in a loose trucking environment. We're also seeing negative mix effects within the international business. First, shippers are returning to lower yielding short haul lanes that shifted to the highway during the pandemic and second, growth in lower yielding empty shipments is also outpacing loaded shipments. Intermodal storage has returned to a normal level and we expect a lap this headwind in the second quarter of next year. Lastly, within coal, volume dropped 9% year-over-year with weak conditions in our utility markets, which more than offset strength in our export markets. Utility coal volume was down roughly 26% from prior year levels driven by high stock piles and low natural gas prices and prolonged customer and producer outages. Export volume increased year-over-year driven by strong Asian demand. Coal revenue declined 8% primarily due to lower volume. Revenue per unit excluding fuel set a new record and revenue per unit also increased as positive mix and stronger than expected seawarm coal pricing and modest liquidated damages more than offset a decline in fuel surcharge revenue. Turning to slide 19, for the fourth quarter, we expect to see slow volume recovery amid uncertain economic conditions. September presented us with some encouraging data that the contraction in manufacturing is slowing and onshoring to the US is on the rise. However, we remain cautious in our optimism as uncertainty surrounding future Fed actions, strike outcomes and geopolitical tension is very pronounced. Although the macro environment is unclear, we are steadfast in our business development initiatives and I'll talk about those in a few minutes. Our merchandised markets have upside potential in the automotive and metals markets. We expect growth in automotive as we continue to work through the backlog of shippable vehicles, improve our cycle times and grow our fleet size. We also still see unmet demand in our metals market, which we should realize as improving service should drive year-over-year growth. Offsetting anticipated growth in the fourth quarter will be sustained, soft conditions in energy markets as the headwinds that pressured crude, NGL and sand volumes in the third quarter are expected to continue through the remainder of the year. Automotive production is a key driver for many of our merchandised markets beyond automotive, so the duration and scope of the ongoing UAW strike is a downside risk to our overall merchandise volumes. Our marketing and operations teams are collaborating to deliver incremental business wins across the portfolio of carload markets that we serve by identifying and solving business challenges for our customers at an accelerating pace. This innovation and collaboration will be a driver of future growth for NS. Intermodal volume is expected to improve year-over-year in the fourth quarter from sustained service recovery and improving market conditions. We're encouraged by the momentum that we're seeing in our domestic market. Our customers are seeing improvements in bid compliance and demand, which has us trending positively in October, but we continue to see a relatively muted peak season which will temper overall volumes. International markets will benefit from strong East Coast import demand and favorable ocean rates driving demand for IPI. We expect the negative mix effects from the shift back to short haul lanes to persist in the fourth quarter, and we continue to experiment and develop new services for our intermodal customers, and I'll talk about that in just a minute. Coal volumes should be stable in the fourth quarter with upside potential in export markets as new production comes online. In addition, recent trends in seaborne coal prices suggest higher prices throughout the remainder of the year due to supply constraints out of Australia as well as continued strong demand out of China and India. Domestic coal shipments should improve sequentially in the fourth quarter on improved service and fewer outages, but headwinds from low natural gas prices will continue to be a limiting factor and while uncertainty in the economy continues to persist, we're confident in our ability to collaborate with our customers to drive incremental volume and to continue providing value in a manner that drives growth in the future. Now before I turn it back to Alan, I would like to expand briefly on how we're providing value in ways that drive growth in an unfavorable market. Slide 20 features key examples of new service offerings we developed this quarter aimed at making Norfolk Southern the preferred option for freight transportation and driving modal conversion. It's important to recognize that collaboration and teamwork invested by both marketing and operations to bring these projects to life. In October, we partnered with CN to expand intermodal service and connect customers in Atlanta and Kansas City with markets on the CN in Canada. We also partnered with Florida East Coast Railway to expand both domestic and international intermodal services in Florida. These new services are designed to give our customers flexibility, expand the reach of the NS intermodal network into key growth markets, and give more ways for our customers to reduce their supply chain greenhouse gas emissions. Early in September, we also announced an investment in DrayNow, a company focused on modernizing technology solutions for intermodal. DrayNow is revolutionizing intermodals' first and final mile journey through an app that provides customers with real-time shipment tracking and document capture of drayage shipments. Norfolk Southern is the operator of the most extensive intermodal network in the Eastern US and together with DrayNow and our best-in-class customers, we will drive more transparency into a fragmented supply chain and increase the ability to best serve our intermodal customers. And lastly, our persistent industrial development efforts paid off as both new and expanded industries turned on additional volume in the third quarter, including a new cement transload, an ethanol terminal, and a container board warehouse, as well as expanded rail operations and an established grain elevator. We'd like to thank our customers for locating on our network and allowing NS to serve their market needs. Together, these diverse projects will generate over 7,800 new car loads annually at full production. We're aggressively pursuing project-oriented growth to enhance the NS network in a fragile freight environment. We're not sitting back and waiting for car loads to come to us, but rather we are proactively making enhancements to our service portfolio to become a preferred service provider for our customers and drive sustainable and smart growth in the future. And concluding on Slide 21, let's look at our 2023 outlook. Based on lower Q3 revenue, which included significantly lower fuel surcharge, we're now expecting 2023 revenue to be down closer to 4% year over year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Alan to bring us home. Sure. Yeah. I think you asked about LDs in the quarter and I think I said in the prepared remarks, these are episodic. We don't expect them to continue. Its high single digits in terms of millions of dollars and when we look out into the fourth quarter, and again, restating what I said in the prepared remarks, we're forecasting prices to be sideways through the end of the quarter and the year and that's really predicated off the continuation of strong demand out of India and China for next quarter. And Ken, just to put a fine point on the resiliency expense, about a third of that cost in the third quarter is related to the quality of life benefits, which are essentially paid sick leave. That has a cost to it. And the rest is really around the headcount additions for primarily T&E, but also some mechanical staff and then the rest is locomotive investments as well to be able to accommodate and accelerate the network. Thanks for the question. Sure. It's a really important question that I appreciate you asking and we want to unpeel the onion here and make sure that everybody understands. First of all, let me say, year to date, we are positive in our core pricing in every single market we serve, okay. Now, let's dig into intermodal. The largest impact once we stripped fuel out was a decline in our intermodal storage revenue. We knew that that was going to happen. And as I think I said in the prepared remarks, that storage figure accounts for over two-thirds of the RPU decline that we saw in the quarter and then we had a couple other things that were very important for folks to understand. We had substantial negative mix in the quarter, and that comes in two forms. The first is international shipments grew while domestic shipments were very anemic given the amount of pressure that's out there in the truckload market. Our domestic shipments have a higher yield than international, so this was a substantial headwind. We also saw negative mix in two different ways within our international business. First of all, we're seeing much higher growth in short haul lanes, and those are lanes that really shifted to the highway during the pandemic and then are now rolling back to us. 85% of the growth in the third quarter in international came from those short haul lanes, and those are intrastate lanes, so it's very important to understand that. Lastly, the amount of empties that we moved is, frankly, much faster-paced growth than the lows that we saw. That is another decrimental pressure on RPUs. So a lot going on there. The truck market continues to be loose. I think the cash rate index has been down for 21 straight months. Contract rates on the highway peaked in March of last year. There's a lot of downward pressure, but here's what I'm confident of. Number one, I'm confident that the market in general will rotate back to growth. It always does. The excess capacity that's on the highway will evacuate. It always does and Norfolk Southern is going to be really well positioned, exceptionally well positioned to take advantage of not only the volume increases, but also the opportunity to reprice. Sure. As service improves, and it is improving both sequentially and year-over-year. Our customers are very encouraged by that, and they're telling us that. That improvement in service is going to bring freight back to Norfolk Southern. We know our customers are very sophisticated supply chain managers and purchasers and when we're not on plan, they have to make other plans to keep their factories running. Some of our customers are going to see that value faster and as we cycle equipment faster, they're immediately going to be able to load more revenue onto Norfolk Southern. I think of markets like metals, like automotive, even though there is a strike right now, I think of that in the construction market and the aggregates market and some of the more flexible freight markets, we have to demonstrate persistent value in the form of reliable, sustainable service over a longer period of time, but we're making sure that our customers are well aware of our progress. Sure. And thanks for the question. This is Ed. On the automotive side, yes, there have been high shipable ground counts at a lot of places that we originate from. The strike duration is probably longer than I want it to be right now, to be honest with you. And those shipable ground counts are going to dwindle over time and we'll see where it goes. I really can't be more granular than that because of the nature of the strike, which has moved from place to place. On the industrial development side, there's over 600 projects in the pipeline right now. We've seen tremendous investment, mostly in the southeast and the Midwest, which is very beneficial for our network and for our customers. I highlighted a few of those during the prepared remarks and just to be more anecdotal about it, in September we had three new lumber shippers that either originated or started receiving traffic just that month and that's really highlighting, number one, the strength of that, what I would call non-res or manufacturing construction economy, which is, I think, higher now than it was during the entire 2000s for the U.S. Most of that is focused east of the Mississippi River, and most of that is focused again in the Midwest and the Southeast. So we think we're really well teed up, really well positioned for what I think Alan has referred to as a manufacturing super cycle in the coming decade. Still elevated from a pre-pandemic level. The EV supply chain is really a new frontier that's out there and I think in one of our previous calls I mentioned that there's been over $70 billion invested into that, and about 30% of that is on our lines. Whether it's the Infrastructure Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS Act, there are a lot of compelling reasons, along with geopolitical instability and affordable and reliable energy, to make the U.S. a very compelling place to be. Yeah, look, this is a positive for us, right? This shows that we can add value into the market and even short-haul lanes where rail traditionally has not been competitive and we can do that because of our focus on productivity. We can do that because of our focus on the value of our service product. In the East, that's why we're very confident, right, that we've got a franchise that faces the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. economy."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. At Norfolk Southern, everything starts with safety, so let's turn to Slide 13 for an update. In the quarter, we have made significant strides. Our injury rate is up slightly versus last year, but it has improved 30% from where we were just three years ago. Our accident rate is trending down from where we have been the past two years, and we also continue to maintain a significant reduction in our mainline accident rate through the many efforts and initiatives we have put forth, including the enhancements to our train-maker rules implemented earlier this year. While those enhancements required a significant period of operational adjustment earlier this year, they are now paying off in terms of our mainline accident rate improvement. We also remain very focused on reducing exposures and improving outcomes in our yard and terminal operations. We have made further investments in our people, including enhancements to our training and PPE programs, as well as leadership development. On all of these fronts, the results are encouraging, but we are not satisfied and will continue to drive towards our goal of being the industry leader in safety. Turning to Slide 14 for an update on service; this is another area where we have made sustained progress this last quarter. Train speeds have resumed the improving trajectory they were on before our challenging second quarter. We have also pushed to reduce dwell and improve schedule rigor in our terminals, which well now improved to its best level in two years. We're sustaining this progress in October while bringing weekly car loadings up to their highest level since Q2 2022, and while developing new service offerings that Ed will outline. As part of our scheduled railroad model though, we will drive further progress. We have to continue to minimize car dwell, maximize velocity across the railroad, sustain safe, reliable and resilient service and drive productivity. On the next two slides, we will cover how we plan to accomplish this. Turning to Slide 15, our locomotive velocity was flat year-over-year. Now that we are seeing improvements in train velocity and terminal dwell, this is an opportunity we are focused on driving further velocity and productivity in. As our terminal discipline initiatives take further hold and as network velocity takes the next step above 21 miles per hour, we expect to see this metric improve along with fuel efficiency as we bring additional tonnage onto the network. We now have a qualified teeny workforce that is sized appropriately in aggregate, although we are still investing to get them all in the right locations. We're on track to have our conductor training pipeline below 600 by yearend as indicated last quarter. As our initiatives take hold and as GTMs increase, this measure of productivity will improve from here. Moving to Slide 16 to discuss how we are driving service improvement aligned with our scheduled railroad model and how it will translate it into additional gains in resilience, productivity and ultimately growth. First is disciplined terminal execution. This starts with strict adherence to the operating plan to ensure trains are arriving on plan to balance terminal flows in both our merchandise yards and intermodal facilities. We're minimizing dwell by switching cars within six hours of arrival. At our intermodal facilities, it's ensuring we're driving precision execution to the trip plan of containers and leveraging our high frequency intermodal model. It involves maximizing connection performance, getting the right cars on the right train and departing our trains on time. The second bullet point, we are driving a culture of strict compliance to the operating plan, both at the train, car, and intermodal unit level and expect that this will drive further reductions in dwell and even greater consistency in our terminals. Next, we're investing in our people and modernizing our workforce to become more resilient and productive. For example, 250 conductors are receiving locomotive engineer training this year. This gives us resilience and flexibility to fill assignments whether the need is an engineer or a conductor or protecting future growth with an investment today. We are moving forward with the first phase of extra board consolidations, cross training 260 employees at seven key terminals across the network. Let me explain what this is. As railroads and labor agreements evolved and merged over the decades, territorial boundaries remained that prevented certain employees from working assignments that were within their geography. At many of these locations we've worked collaboratively with labor to remove those boundaries but have yet to get folks qualified to work all potential assignments. With our new focus on resilience, we're investing in our craft employees and getting them qualified to hold more assignments, providing them with greater work opportunities and offering Norfolk Southern enhanced operational flexibility and efficiency. To complement these labor modernization efforts, we are implementing predictable work scheduling, a groundbreaking work-life balance initiative negotiated with our craft colleagues, which will also streamline our back office crew management functions and drive further productivity. Lastly we are kicking off a system-wide initiative that will drive productivity and enhance our first mile last mile service. This is a substantial initiative aligned with delivering reliable service, productivity and most importantly driving additional growth of the network. To close, running a safe reliable and resilient scheduled railroad using these principles is going to improve service consistency, generate greater productivity and create capacity for growth. I'll now turn the call over to Ed. Well, you're spot on. We are seeing results from refreshing our operating leadership, resourcing up, and executing the plan in both volume train speed, and terminal dwell and as Alan highlighted, matched to our premise of running as a scheduled railroad, it's a focus on running the plan; right car, right train, right day, enforcing a high degree of compliance to the plan. Again, that is a fundamental tenant of running a scheduled railroad. It's driving that accountability. We expect to see further consistency as the year progresses. Certainly expect to see dwell continue to improve, train speed continue to improve and as we have seen these metrics quarter our velocity improve, we're going to layer on productivity initiatives as we talked, and that's going to be the focus of us in 2024. Running reliable service and layering on productivity."

            "name": "Mark George",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 5 with an update on our accruals related to the Eastern Ohio derailment. We are pleased to report that we will be completing soil removal from the derailment site shortly, but expect that there will be ongoing testing efforts to ensure continued safety of the air, soil and water through April of 2024. And as such, we accrued $118 million in Q3 to account for this timeline extension. Additionally, we recorded another $70 million for legal and other costs incurred in the quarter. Of note, we did file our initial claim for reimbursement with our insurers during the third quarter and will continue to file claims as costs accumulate. We did receive notification of our first reimbursement under our policy of $25 million and accordingly recognize this as an offset to the costs incurred in the third quarter. The cash was actually received last week. While we were encouraged by the speed of this initial reimbursement, there are dozens of parties sharing exposure at 10 layers in the insurance tower. So we expect this cost recovery process to be protracted. Also, of the $966 million recorded as expense thus far, just more than half has been paid through September 30. Of the remaining $450 million, I'd expect roughly half to be spent in the fourth quarter and the rest to be spent in 2024. I will remind you that this situation remains fluid and we will continue working through these issues for many quarters to come. We expect that there will be additional costs that have not yet been incurred related to future settlements, fines and penalties, as well as legal fees, and we cannot predict the amounts at this time. Moving to Slide 6, where we illustrate the impact of these third quarter costs on our results; our GAAP results are in the first row, while on row 2, we isolate the accounting to our Q3 financials related to the incident and our response. At the bottom of the chart, you'll note the comparisons of the adjusted financial results to the prior year. I'll be talking about our adjusted results for the remainder of the discussion. Revenues were down 11%, adjusted operating expense was down modestly, the adjusted operating ratio for Q3 was 69.1%, which notably includes 270 basis points of headwind from net fuel price impacts. On an adjusted basis, operating income was down 28%, net income and EPS were down 37% and 35% respectively, but recall last year, we enjoyed a benefit from a state income tax change of $136 million, distorting the year-over-year comparison. Let's turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our operating revenues; and it's a quick look at the drivers of the revenue change from last year in advance of Ed getting into the market details. The biggest driver in the year-over-year revenue decline is the meaningful reduction in fuel surcharge revenue. Volumes were down 2%, which equates to a $74 million revenue decline and we are highlighting here the reduction in intramodal storage revenue of $71 million, as we are now back to more normal levels and will continue to have tough compares through Q1 of 2024. Ed will talk later about the traction we have on pricing as well as mix dynamics in the quarter that collectively inform the positive $27 million of rate mix and other. On Slide 8, let's drill into the operating expenses. Adjusted operating expenses for the quarter were down $19 million, or 1%, on a year-over-year basis. Fuel expense was down $94 million, or 25%, driven mainly by lower fuel prices. Comp and ben was down $20 million, or 3% year-over-year, as higher pay rates and employee levels were offset by a favorable comparison with Q3 last year from the $85 million charge we took related to the retroactive wage accruals. Depreciation expense was up in line with our earlier guidance. Purchase services was up due to higher costs associated with engineering activities on our network, as well as technology spend. The increase in materials and other was up $42 million and driven primarily by an adverse comp on a favorable legal settlement last year, as well as higher consumption of materials for locomotive repairs. Property sales were also lower this quarter. Moving to Slide 9, while we expect costs related to the past service issues to begin unwinding in the third quarter, additional service challenges in the quarter resulted in a delay with only moderate easing. We expect the unwind to accelerate here in the fourth quarter. Now, offsetting these fourth-quarter savings will be an increase in incremental costs related to building resiliency in a couple key areas that will pay dividends in the years ahead. Firstly, there are investments in the continuation of our hiring and locomotives in order to support both future growth and faster recoveries. Second are the investments in our craft workforce, including the quality of life enhancements like paid sick leave. These investments overall should allow for the accommodation of higher volumes that will help cover these costs along with more productivity. And on Slide 10, let's talk to a couple P&L items below operating income. Other income was up $42 million in the quarter, driven by favorable returns from our company-owned life insurance. The adjusted effective tax rate was 22.7% in line with what we normally guide. And turning to free cash flow and shareholder distribution on Slide 11, through the first nine months, free cash flow was $1.1 billion lower than prior year, with half due to derailment-related expenditures and the remainder from a combination of lower core operating results and higher CapEx. Shareholder distributions over the same nine months were $1.4 billion, thanks to our solid dividend and continued share repurchase activity. I will remind that the citizen vote in Cincinnati to approve the proposed $1.6 billion purchase of the CSR asset will take place in November. So we are reserving capital capacity for that potential transaction, which would close in mid-March of 2024. I'll now hand off to Paul to provide an update on our operations. Okay, thanks, Chris. Yeah, so if you start first on the service costs, we saw a slight reduction here in the third quarter. We were hoping for a little bit more, but obviously we had some disruptions to the network that delayed that. We do expect the reduction to continue here in the fourth quarter, and eventually this should unwind over the next couple quarters. As fluidity on the network improves, as we qualify more of our T&Es in the right critical locations as well, and we start to build some solid processes around delivering service as opposed to putting the band-aids on, like we are today with overtime, etcetera. So those will start to unwind here in the next couple quarters. The right-hand part of that slide, those are -- I think you need to think about those as structural cost increases. And those are really around developing and building resiliency. That's the whole point. A lot of this is related to the T&E ramp-up that we've seen as well as the investments in our locomotives. There are also costs related to the quality of life improvements that we've announced with our craft workforce and I'd say that of these costs, 75% of those will probably reside in the comp and band line, and then after that you'll see costs sitting in purchase services and also in some materials. But in terms of cadence as we go into Q4, like I said, service costs will start to come down, but that will be offset by another increase there in the structural resiliency costs.by another increase there in the structural resiliency cost. And then I think at that point, we should probably be moderating going forward into '24, but we'll give you more '24 guidance when we reconvene in January. Yeah. Ultimately, these are going to get paid for by the elimination of those temporary service costs, but also by accommodating more volume than we typically would be able to, as well as, pricing and productivity. So it's exaggerated here because we're in a down cycle. Yeah, I think we're at a trough. I think we're at a trough right here. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Scott, look, I think the way you look at cost, ex fuel, to answer your specific question, it should be largely sideways and then, you sprinkle in the nice uptick we've seen in volumes. I think we've definitely probably troughed here in Q3, and we should see sequential margin improvement. Model out what you think that volume is going to be as we navigate through the quarter, and we report our volumes and you can pretty much assign traditional incremental margin rate to that. So I think we've troughed here in Q3, and it should improve from there. Yeah, the headcount certainly helps. We've augmented in a lot of our critical locations, the staffing in order to improve our fluidity there. So that's a big driver. We've invested money in locomotives, so we have more locomotives available as well. And frankly, Paul, why don't you talk a little bit about the process changes that we're making in the terminals, which really are sticky and fundamental drivers for running a scheduled railroad?"

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.\nLuke Nichols: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section, along with a reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. Turning to Slide 3. It's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw.\nAlan Shaw: Good morning, and welcome to our discussion of second quarter earnings. Here with me today are Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer; Paul Duncan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer. I would like to begin by thanking all of my colleagues at Norfolk Southern for their tremendous work this quarter. As you will hear this morning, we are delivering on our commitment to recover service quickly. We are delivering on our commitment to make a safe railroad even safer. We are delivering on our commitment to address quality of life issues for our hardworking craft railroaders, and we continue to deliver on our commitment to make things right for the people of East Palestine and the surrounding communities. We have a vision for a better way forward for Norfolk Southern. Last December, we outlined a groundbreaking strategy that balances service, productivity and growth. It is designed to create long-term value for our customers, employees, shareholders and the communities we serve. Our commitment to that strategy was tested on February 3 with the derailment in East Palestine. Adversity reveals character and tests resolve. I'm proud of the way our team rose to the challenge. Our response in East Palestine has been fully aligned with our better way forward, making decisions in the best long-term interest of the community and surrounding areas has achieved significant progress. Our financial results were challenged this quarter as we noted in May that they would be. They reflect the decisive actions we have taken to advance our strategy and keep our promises in East Palestine. With every step forward, we are doing exactly what we said we would do when we announced our strategy last December. We are investing in the long-term success of our company. With our strategy as our road map, we made significant progress in the second quarter, building the foundation for long-term value creation. This morning, I'll share a few notable examples of our progress. I'll start with service. In the first quarter, we expressed confidence that our service challenges were a temporary disruption due to deliberate management actions in response to the derailment and that our recovery plan would show results quickly. We delivered. As Paul will describe shortly, service is now at levels comparable to our best performance in 2019. When we announced our strategy last year, I indicated that we will continue to make disciplined investments in our business through economic cycles. As Mark will describe, we are doing exactly what we said we would do. We continue to expand the ranks of our frontline craft railroaders, and we are investing in locomotives, intermodal infrastructure, new sidings, technology and other assets that will drive service, productivity and growth. We are looking beyond this cycle to be ready to serve our customers and support their growth during the recovery and into the future. Another important way we moved our strategy forward in the second quarter was through our continuing progress engaging more effectively with our frontline railroaders. This is one of my top priorities as CEO, and it is a reason I spent so much time in the field. I've learned from every conversation with my craft colleagues. After the conclusion of our national labor negotiations last year, I promised to work with union leadership at the local level to address quality of life issues. We kept that commitment, and I'm especially proud Norfolk Southern was the first Class 1 railroad to provide paid sick leave for all of our craft employees. We are building on that momentum. It was an extraordinary moment to co-author an open letter with the leaders of 12 railroad unions committing to collaborate on safety. And then a few days later, to share a stage with many of those same leaders in an all-employee town hall meeting to talk about safety and our strategy. Our people are excited to be part of a vision that focuses on growth. Our actions this quarter to advance our strategy extend well beyond operations. They run throughout our company. In marketing, we reorganized the team to align with our strategy, positioning us to maintain the deep customer relationships that characterize Norfolk Southern while simultaneously pursuing growth in high-value markets that make sense for our network. As part of that change, we made the innovative move this quarter to create the industry's first Vice President of First Mile Last Mile, building an entrepreneurial spirit and growth mindset into our organizational structure, continuous productivity improvement through cost management and smart revenue growth is a core element of our strategy. In the second quarter, we created a new performance excellence team within operations, charged with building additional rigor and discipline into our processes. This work is foundational to our strategy. Standardizing our processes supports a high degree of planned compliance, which in turn gives us greater flexibility to innovate and test, targeted improvements that enhance consistent and reliable service and provide productivity opportunities, thus unlocking growth potential. Additionally, we continue to make progress this quarter, strengthening our safety culture, implementing best practices and accelerating technology improvements. We look beyond the rail industry for a partner that would challenge and inspire us. We chose Atkins Nuclear Solutions, which brings experience from the Nuclear Navy, the gold standard of operational excellence and industrial safety. Then, we reached out to the leaders of the national unions representing our frontline craft railroaders, and ask them to work with us to enhance rail safety. Our work is producing results. As Paul will describe in more detail, our safety metrics demonstrate significant improvement. As a result of these initiatives and more, Norfolk Southern today is a railroad poised for long-term value creation. We are implementing our innovative strategic plan and correlating to serve our customers and capture growth when demand inevitably returns. And now, I'll turn it over to Mark for a detailed look at our second quarter results.\nMark George: Thank you, Alan, and good morning to everyone. Before we get into the operating results for the quarter, Slide 6 illustrates the financial impact from the Eastern Ohio derailment. There was another $416 million of costs recorded in Q2, primarily driven by environmental cleanup activities. Our estimates reflect the significant progress we've made remediating the site and the continued efforts we expect to undertake related to further restoration efforts. While our estimates reflect our expectation that activity at the site will meaningfully moderate in the fourth quarter, any changes in the nature, extent and duration of the remaining cleanup activities and government oversight activities may impact our current estimate. Additionally, developments with respect to the healthcare fund, which we are creating for affected residents as well as the potential fines, penalties or settlements and ongoing legal expenses will all likely impact our costs in future quarters. Of the $803 million recorded so far this year, only $287 million of the cash has been paid through June 30. We currently expect about half of our accrued balance to be paid over the remainder of the year with the rest in 2024 or later. Our 2023 results do not reflect potential recoveries from third parties or under our insurance coverage. Importantly, you will see in the quarter that we have started the process of pursuing recovery from third parties, a process we will continue to explore where appropriate in connection with our other lawsuits. As for our insurance coverage, we expect to begin filing insurance claims here in the third quarter. This will be the first of many claims that will be made over the coming quarters. To remind everyone, we can only make claims upon payments being made not based on accruals. As you can imagine, insurance reimbursements and third-party recoveries will take time to materialize. Turning to Slide 7. Here, we illustrate the accounting impacts of the incident and response on our key metrics for Q2. At the bottom, you see the adjusted results excluding those impacts. Revenues were down 8% to last year, while adjusted operating expense was flattish. It's important to understand that the incident meaningfully harmed revenues in the quarter because of the resulting service disruption, but that impact is not adjusted from our GAAP figures and mitigating those service impacts cost us money to fix and those costs are also not accounted for in the $416 million operating expense adjustment. Consequently, the adjusted operating ratio was 66.7%. Had we been able to move a couple of hundred million more of revenue with our Q2 cost structure, our margins would have been much stronger. On an adjusted basis, operating income was down 22%, net Income was down 18%, and EPS was down 14%. Moving to Slide 8. Adjusted operating expenses for the quarter were up slightly on a year-over-year basis. Compensation and benefits were up $79 million or 13% in the quarter due to wage inflation and ongoing hiring to primarily shore up the remaining challenged locations on our network and in support of our strategic plan to build long-term network resiliency. Materials and other expenses in the quarter were up $33 million or 19% driven primarily by a continuation of the locomotive related work we discussed during the first quarter call, bringing part of the stored fleet back into service to successfully accelerate the network, which you will hear more about from Paul. Additionally, in other, the quarter was impacted by lower gains on the sale of property. Purchased services and rents were up $25 million or 5% this quarter as the challenge network created more headwinds to the category in addition to our continued investments in technology. Depreciation was up $17 million in the quarter, in line with our guidance. Mitigating these increases were fuel expenses which were down $145 million or 36% in the quarter. Turning to Slide 9. Let's look at the adjusted P&L results below the line. Partially mitigating the $279 million reduction in adjusted operating income was a $71 million increase in other income, driven by favorable investment returns and compares from company-owned life insurance. Net income and EPS were down 18% and 14%, respectively, in the quarter. Moving to free cash flow and shareholder returns on Slide 10. Through the first six months, free cash flow was lower by $276 million due to combined pressure from the derailment-related expenditures as well as investments in roadway and equipment. Shareholder distributions during the first half were $918 million, thanks to our solid dividend and share repurchase activity. I'll now turn it over to Paul for a discussion on our operations.\nPaul Duncan: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let's jump right into our safety update on Slide 12. Everything starts with safety. We continue to make progress this year enhancing safety. Our injury frequency ratio is trending down 12% year-to-date versus last year. Our accident rates for the first half of the year is also down from prior years and our mainline train accident rate is trending improved 40% year-to-date versus last year. I want to take a moment to thank our leaders and our craft colleagues for collectively enhancing safety and driving these outcomes for our team, the communities we serve and our customers. We'll transition to our progress in safely delivering a reliable and resilient service product on Slide 13. You will recall during our last earnings call that we expected service to improve in summer and we have delivered on that promise. We've successfully restored our double-track mainline through East Palestine in a safe and environmentally appropriate way and we wasted no time resetting network performance levels our customers expect in this quarter between the Midwest and the Northeast. We have significantly improved train velocity, dwell and service across our network to two-year best resulting from these improvements. With service improved, our focus now is driving further reliability, productivity and resiliency in our network aligned with our strategic vision outlined in December. Touching on Slide 14. Now, what we told you would be an important measure of our service recovery reduction in cars online. Following the first quarter service interruptions, we had an inventory buildup. We set in place a plan to work down to build up as quickly as possible while also restoring our mainline and overall network conditions. We successfully executed on that plan and railcars are now cycling throughout our network faster than they have since before 2022, achieving greater railcar fleet productivity. Turning to Slide 15 for an update on our hiring progress. Our efforts to right-size our team accrual based have continued the first half of this year. We are now at a point at which the training pipeline has crested and will begin to taper down over the back half of the year. We are committed to maintaining an appropriately-sized workforce to drive reliability and long-term resilience as part of our strategy. Our productivity metrics are shown on Slide 16. Our short-term service challenges described earlier contributed to productivity impacts as we work to restore service and velocity. Mark mentioned earlier that we return to serve as a portion of our road locomotive fleet to expedite our service recovery. With service and locomotive velocity much improved as we enter summer, we have now right-sized our road fleet and are now achieving velocity near 200 miles per day with our locomotives. As part of our strategy to become not only reliable, but more resilient we have allocated a portion of our road locomotive fleet to surge capacity to be hot and ready to run at key locations of our network when needed. We continue to have a solid outlook for our locomotive fleet. Our DC to AC program is ongoing, which will provide us with a capacity dividend not only in terms of AC traction but also improvements in fuel efficiency. Transitioning to the workforce. T&E productivity was challenged due to the effort we put in place to accelerate the network, coupled with the contraction in volumes. Moving forward, we expect to improve T&E productivity through a variety of initiatives improving velocity, absorbing volume on existing trains and normalizing our CT pipeline. Lastly, on fuel, we took a step back for the first time in seven quarters. This was largely due to lower velocity and fewer GTMs on the network as we are restoring service. We are very confident that our initiatives that have been paying regular dividends will continue driving us towards further fuel efficiency as we continue to see the benefits of an improving network. Moving forward on Slide 17. Our focus will be on safely and productively delivering reliable and resilient service. Every conversation will start with safety as we continue to enhance it through the initiatives that we discussed. With service improved, our goal now is to continue to build further reliability and resiliency in the network but to do so productively. Velocity and service improvements will provide us further opportunities to leverage and spin our assets while pushing to drive further process standardization into our scheduled network to drive productivity. This is the primary focus of our new performance excellence team, which was created this year. We will also continue to leverage the capital investments we have made to increase productivity, including recent siding projects between Chicago and Cincinnati that will allow us to increase train length and capacity in this quarter. Thank you and I will now hand it off to Ed Elkins.\nEd Elkins: Thanks, Paul, and good morning to everybody on the call. Beginning on Slide 19, I'll review our commercial results for the quarter. Now as we expected, the second quarter came with challenges related to ongoing soft freight demand, lower commodity prices and still recovering service levels. In total, we generated just under $3 billion in revenue for the quarter, down 8% from the second quarter of last year and that's driven by a 6% drop in volume and lower revenue from fuel and accessorials. ARPU was also down year-over-year. However, revenue per unit less fuel improved 1% reflecting gains in price and favorable mix, and that's driven by tempered demand for intermodal and utility coal. I'd like to note here that underneath this favorable overall mix narrative, there was significant negative mix within markets that tempered overall revenue per unit performance, which I'll note below. Now merchandise results were varied as favorable conditions in the markets for automotive and agriculture products were offset by headwinds in chemicals markets. And that's a good example of the challenging RPU mix within markets that I just mentioned. Automotive volumes were driven by robust finished vehicle production and agriculture shipments were strong due to new lane offerings and a weak local crop in the Southeast. Offsetting this growth was weakness in several of our chemical commodities as well as challenges to meet customer demand in key markets such as metals, aggregates and finished vehicles. Taken together, total merchandise volume and revenue for the second quarter came in 1% below prior year levels. Revenue per unit was flat year-over-year, but RPU less fuel grew 2%, which makes 32 out of the last 33 quarters that we've achieved growth in this metric. And I think that is a clear signal that our diverse portfolio and strong pricing discipline are delivering results. Turning to Intermodal. Continued market headwinds were felt the strongest in our domestic lines of business where volumes declined 14% year-over-year as weak freight demand, high inventories and excess truck capacity weighed on performance. Conversely, in a continuation of the first quarter trend, international volumes increased 1% year-over-year and 5.8% sequentially over last quarter. As we guided to before, our customers have continued to shift highway freight back into IPI services and storage charges have declined as supply chain fluidity and container dwell have returned to pre-pandemic normalcy. As you would expect with this performance, Intermodal is another segment where ARPU mix with end markets was challenging for us. Both RPU and RPU less fuel were down significantly due to lower revenue from fuel surcharge and storage charges. Lastly, coal volume was flat year-over-year, but coal revenue fell 4% as RPU declined. Utility volumes were down 17% year-over-year due to historically low natural gas prices and elevated stockpiles. These declines were offset by gains in export shipments as a result of increased production and robust overseas demand. Although export volumes increased, the mix between export steam and export metallurgical coal shifted unfavorably and comparatively lower seaborne coal prices yielded lower revenue per unit. Again, a key segment where ARPU mix within markets was a headwind. With that, let's turn to Slide 20 and review our outlook for the remainder of 2023. Overall, we're confident that our service product positions us to realize growth when market conditions improve. And as the year progresses, we are focused on pursuing the opportunities in markets that have the highest potential for growth for Norfolk Southern. We expect to increase our share in these markets as an improving service product and a sharply focused organization allows us to realize more of the ongoing demand for our services. Beginning with merchandise markets, conditions vary by individual market, and we see strong levels of nonresidential construction as reshoring and infrastructure projects increase which will drive strength in metals and construction volume. Pent-up demand for U.S. light vehicles will continue to support metals and automotive volumes. However, we expect continued weakness in our chemicals markets in the second half. Turning to Intermodal. We expect international volumes to continue its growth trend with an expected rebound in import volumes and the continued share growth of IPI. Storage charges will continue to be a revenue and RPU headwind compared to last year. On the domestic side, overall growth will be dependent on the U.S. consumer, retail inventory levels and the truck market. We worked really hard with our best-in-class channel partners to sustain our service levels throughout the quarter during the crucial climax of bid season, and we're hearing from our key partners that our strategy is helping them increase their share of bid wins. We look forward to leveraging our capacity to realize this growth as market conditions improve. And finally, within our coal markets, we expect overall volume growth as continued strength in export markets more than offset weakness in utility coal. Coal production levels at NS-served mines will drive growth in export shipments, although we do expect lower seaborne coal prices to negatively impact RPU. The utility outlook is largely dependent on the weather, on existing stockpiles and natural gas prices. The net result is we expect total coal RPU to sequentially decline by a low double-digit percentage. Despite uncertainty across the economy, our focus on service, productivity and growth remains at the core of our strategy, and we're confident in our ability to grow our franchise and deliver value for our customers. On that note, I'd like to draw your attention to Slide 21, which highlights the strength of Norfolk Southern's network and our ability to drive growth both now and in the future. The ecosystem for electric vehicles has been steadily developing in recent years as demonstrated by last quarter's announcement of the new Scout Motors plant on Norfolk Southern. We are focused on all facets of this emerging EV supply chain, including the EV battery and battery components. Over the last 18 months, more than $70 billion in new investment has been announced for building out EV battery manufacturing plants across North America. Our commercial team has worked to help locate nearly 1/3 of that investment on our network, including most recently in the second quarter, a new $3 billion General Motors and Samsung battery manufacturing plant in Indiana, on a Norfolk Southern main line. Norfolk Southern's network is well positioned for future industrial development. We reached 60% of the U.S. population and cover 50% of our manufacturing base. We look forward to amplifying that strength through continued industrial development wins. Year-to-date, our industrial development team has reported $2.6 billion in industry investment that's been completed along Norfolk Southern lines, bringing 3,200 new jobs to the local communities that we serve. We continue to invest in site readiness for our highest potential industrial sites, and we're confident our diverse portfolio of shovel-ready sites combined with the strength of our network, we'll continue to land new opportunities across our network. With that, I'll turn it back over to Alan to bring us home.\nAlan Shaw: Thanks, Ed. Let's turn to Slide 22. As we have reached midpoint of 2023, I want to provide you with an update to our outlook. Although we entered the year expecting to achieve revenues comparable to 2022, the first half revenue shortfalls require us to modify our full year outlook. We now anticipate revenue to be down at least 3% in 2023 implying some modest volume improvements in the back half. We're also expecting modestly higher capital expenditures for the year as we accelerate investments in safety, service, productivity and growth. Finally, I want to close our prepared remarks by reconfirming the commitment of the entire Norfolk Southern team to delivering long-term shareholder value through top-tier revenue and earnings growth at industry competitive margins with balanced capital deployment. I'm confident that our strategy will help us achieve our full potential, and I'm encouraged by our progress and investments. We will now open the call to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Alan, I guess, can you give us an update on lessons learned here as you've reworked your train makeup, I think, through the second quarter? And how has that impacted your operational planning going forward? And does that create incremental capacity for you guys if markets recover, which I think Mark was alluding to earlier.\nAlan Shaw: Brendon, we remade our train makeup and starting in March. And we guided to the fact that we would expect service to improve as we moved out of the second quarter and into the third quarter coupled with the fact that we're going to get the second track back in East Palestine that's absolutely what we delivered. Our service is on the trajectory that we had guided to. And what we're seeing as a result over the last couple of weeks is real strength in our volume sequentially and also relative to the rest of the industry. With respect to our updated operating plan and train makeup rules, it gives us an opportunity to create more capacity as we've increased the utilization of distributed power which helps our cost structure, helps our service product and helps our capacity for growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Just before I get to the question, two clarifications, Mark. You said 1% ARPU gain ex-fuel on mix and price. So if mix was positive, are you saying pricing is less than 1%? Or are you saying intra-category mix hides the pricing gain. And then second, you mentioned the real estate gain. Did you mention what it was in the quarter? And then my question is on carload growth. Alan, you mentioned accelerating growth in the second half of the year. Peers are talking about RTMs or industrial production being down slightly. I just want to understand how you're targeting that acceleration in the second half, maybe detail that a little more.\nMark George: Yes, Ken, we were talking about intra-category price there. And then with regard to the real estate gains in the quarter, I think we said it was $19 million absolute in the quarter itself. Go ahead...\nAlan Shaw: Yes. Ken. And with respect to volumes moving forward, clearly, our volumes were pressured in the second quarter and in the last two months of the first quarter because of the service degradation. That's why it was really important for us to hit the service targets and the service recovery trajectory that we had committed to publicly and with our customers. We've done that. And as a result, our equipment is turning faster and customers are talking to us about incorporating Norfolk Southern into their long-term supply chain solutions. Ed, do you want to give a little bit more color on that?\nEd Elkins: Yes. When we look at our volumes compared to the other Class 1s over the course of 2023, our volumes outperformed the industry average for nine of the first 10 weeks of the year and we were feeling good. And then as you know, the network slowed and congestion build up, our performance suffered, but as we started to speed up, our relative performance also has started to recover. And over the last 11 weeks, I think this is important. We've outperformed the industry average for nine of those weeks. And the outperformance that we've been experiencing is accelerating placing us in the top two of the Class 1 railroads for four of the five last weeks. And I will tell you, I spoke about it in the prepared remarks, there are a few bright spots out there where we're focused on delivering growth for our customers through better service. That includes in the automotive industry where we see clear line of sight on continued demand. And then you think about infrastructure spending that's going on all around the country, but particularly in our footprint as well as residential construction that's really tied to new home construction because people with low interest rates are just staying in those houses. So folks who need a home are going out and building a new one, we see some clear bright spots there. And the real key is, we're focused on those markets. We're present in those markets with our sales teams and our operating teams. And as the network continues to speed up, we're going to deliver more value for those customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Just wondering what inning we are here in terms of the sequential drawdown in intermodal yields. I assume you've got some new pricing that's being implemented on July 1. You've got more runoff of the storage fees. What's the right way to think about intermodal yields from here? And then Mark, there's a lot of like puts and takes on profit cadence from here. On one side, there's a lot of service issues and inefficiencies related to that in the second quarter, but then you've got the coal yield dropping off, maybe a little bit more yield pressure on fuel that impacts operating income. I mean do we grow operating income off of the second quarter in the back half? If you can just kind of give us some of the puts and takes there.\nAlan Shaw: Ed, you want to take the first question?\nEd Elkins: Yes. Yes. If you want to -- let's talk about RPU first, particularly within intermodal. Core pricing remains positive for Intermodal. And more importantly, I think I highlighted it during the prepared remarks, the mix within Intermodal has been pretty dynamic. And because of our success in those international markets and delivering value through more IPI business, that mix is negative for overall ARPU within intermodal. Sure. Again, when we think about supply chain congestion, I think it's pretty much gone. I'd say supply chains are really about as fluid now as they were prior to the pandemic. And in fact, there may be a little bit more capacity. We monitor warehouse activity pretty closely and the supply chains index -- or excuse me, the Logistics Managers Index, which we pay attention to noted that warehouse capacity has increased at the fastest rate since the start of the pandemic. It's a challenge, and we've seen those storage charges roll-off and essentially turn to really a pre-pandemic normal.\nAlan Shaw: You've also seen us take share from truck in the international market.\nEd Elkins: Yes, that is what I was referring to with increased IPI shipments. The international markets are looking for ways to add value for their customers and the service we're providing in IPI is a clear way for them to do that.\nMark George: Amit, let me go through a little bit of the first half, second half dynamic because there are some changes here for sure. We do expect some modestly higher volumes from the better service product we have here in the back half. So that's definitely going into the tailwind category. We will start to see a partial wind down of the service costs here in the second half as well. And fuel expense is going to be less of a headwind than it was in the first half. But we got some sizable headwinds here in the back half, principally on the ARPU side. The fuel surcharge really starts to diminish here and the lag benefit disappears on us. So this fuel will be a real negative in the back half, certainly to margins. And as Ed mentioned, intermodal storage is basically back at pre-pandemic levels now, which means we're going to continue to have quarter-over-quarter headwinds until we lap this probably in the second quarter of next year. And then, of course, if the futures hold, we're going to have international seaborne coal pricing headwind as well in the RPU side. So that's pretty much the headwind and tailwind equation. So if the volumes come in, like we think a little bit of back half tailwind, we should get some OR improvement from here and the more the better because we got a lot of capacity on the railroad right now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: So Mark, you're saying hopefully, some OR, just you're saying, hopefully, some OR improvement from Q2 into the back half of the year?\nMark George: Yes. Volumes, we expect to really provide us a little bit of tailwind here. And I think it's all going to depend on how much volume we're able to bring on to the railroad.\nAlan Shaw: Look, we were really clear in May that OR would be really pressured in the second quarter because we're going to have three months of service disruption as we've delivered on our commitment to improve service throughout the quarter and moving into third quarter. That creates more opportunity for volume and it creates a better cost structure for us. We will still have those headwinds that Mark called out, particularly with respect to fuel surcharge and comps on...\nMark George: On coal pricing\nAlan Shaw: On coal pricing but the underlying product and our ability to onboard volume at strong incrementals is improving.\nScott Group: And so ultimately, I guess, you've given us a little bit of color on OR and some color on coal RPU. But how should we think about overall RPU when I factor in the fuel headwind, some of the maybe continued storage headwind? Like what's -- how much do you think is overall RPU going to be down in Q3? Just that I think it would be helpful.\nEd Elkins: This is Ed. When we look at the second half of the year, on the RPU front, reduced storage and fuel surcharge revenues are going to persist. We've talked about that. I talked about that in our prepared remarks. Collectively, those current projections for us fuel storage and coal pricing is roughly $650 million.\nMark George: Year-over-year revenue contraction.\nEd Elkins: That's right.\nMark George: So that's the headwind we're swimming against.\nScott Group: 650 in what period?\nMark George: Second half versus second half.\nScott Group: Okay. That's revenue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: So maybe a little bit on hedge here. I guess I'm curious, how do we think about -- you talked about the pipeline of string new rolling kind of moderating in the back half of the year? So how do we think about actual employee levels in the back half of the year, maybe 3Q, 4Q? And then, Mark, in the past, you talked a little bit about OpEx and maybe putting the profit aside, I know obviously, there's RPU headwinds on the revenue piece. Is OpEx kind of flattish from where you were in the second quarter? Or is there an ability to actually improve on that given the network kind of reopening and getting some of that productivity back into the model?\nAlan Shaw: Why don't you address the question on conductor trainees and craft colleagues.\nPaul Duncan: Yes. Thanks, Alan. So as you saw on the -- hunting chart on the stats, we continue to make progress on staffing. And really, at this point, we plan to reduce the CT pipeline to around 600 or less as we continue to focus on attrition and filling in some of those remaining locations. But at this point, with what we've been able to do from a hiring standpoint, we have further leveraged and gained velocity across the network and facilitate having those folks that are at healthy locations send to some of those hotspots. And again, that is a contributor to the velocity improvements and the service improvements that we've seen here over the past several weeks that we expect to continue through the latter half of the year.\nAlan Shaw: And Paul, your guidance on a pipeline of around 600 is more pointed towards the end of the year.\nPaul Duncan: Correct. Correct.\nMark George: And Chris, with regard to OpEx, I think we've obviously seen a step-up in our cost structure as we've been dealing with a lot of the service issues and trying to start to build some resiliency going forward. I think what you'll see now is emanation of those service-related costs as we go through the back half of the year. However, don't forget, we've got that 4% wage increase that took effect July 1. So, those kind of start to wash each other out. And with regard to some of the other P&L line items, in aggregate, probably flattish sequentially. We see those kind of holdings. So that's why the leverage is there now to take on to take on volume. We believe we've got the capacity to handle a lot of volume without much incremental cost and really gets down to facing these RPU headwinds that are going to provide pretty sizable headwind for us on the margin side, $650 million as we just touched on.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. And average heads are up a little bit in the back half of the year, I think is what I heard.\nMark George: I'm sorry, can you repeat that?\nChris Wetherbee: Average head count is going to be up a little bit sequentially in the back half of the year.\nMark George: Yes, correct.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, please limit yourself to one question so we allow as many as possible to join us. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell: Mark, I thought Slide 7 was super helpful. And then also, you noted that there's volume, revenue and cost impacts that you wouldn't kind of strip out as being onetime in nature. Is there any way to quantify those two, let's call them, non-adjusted impacts to the second quarter results? And as we think about a return to normalization, is that kind of a slow grind as the line comes back on and builds the full capacity where you can be kind of on an apples-to-apples basis at the start of the fourth quarter? Or do you think that it's going to take all the way until 2024 to say kind of base revenue and base costs from the entire network.\nMark George: Yes. So, the way we look at it, and we've done some analysis here with Ed and his team, we think we left about $175 million to $200 million of revenue behind because of the service disruptions and the shutdown of the line there in East Palestine. So, that's kind of on the revenue side. And on the cost side, we were dealing with growing a lot of costs and trying to accelerate the network, and we've done that successfully. So, now we're going to probably use the next six months to really work those costs off and get back to more productive levels of service. So, I think you'll see that those costs will wind down here in the third quarter. And I think by the fourth quarter, most of those costs will be removed from our system. So, we talk about probably $40 million to $45 million here in the second quarter of kind of poor service related costs, and that will start to unwind here.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Maybe just go back to the average comp per employee. And Mark, you were talking about the 4% increase for the craft employees. Can you just give us a sense of what that looks like on an all-in basis because you've got over time, you've got mix, you got trainees in there. What does it look like in the back half of this year and how does that carry forward into next year? And then beyond that point, can you just talk more broadly about the cost for paid sick leave, what role changes and how we should think about those, including any potential offsets and when you might see them?\nMark George: Thanks, Brian. So I think I guided earlier in the year to about 35,000 and change each quarter, anticipating that we were going to have this 4% step-up in rates in the third quarter, but that would be neutralized by the wind-down of service-related costs. So that guidance pretty much holds. I would -- if I were you all, I'd be modeling around 35 and change average comp per employee each quarter. Sorry, the second part of that one question was what?\nBrian Ossenbeck: The work rule changes...\nMark George: Oh, yes. Sorry. Clearly, these things aren't free. So there's definitely a little bit of a headwind that we're swimming against with a lot of these work rule changes. I'm not going to put a fine number on it other than to say that, obviously, we're going to have to pay for that with some productivity initiatives in the future. And that's what Paul and his team are looking at now. But clearly, some short-term headwinds from a lot of what you've seen published.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Sort of curious maybe from a sensitivity perspective, you've done a really good job getting the network back into shape in the second quarter. And you talked about maybe hopefully improving OR with some volume sequentially versus the second quarter OR. But I'm actually curious, is there -- given the headwinds you've talked about and maybe even looking into next year, is there a level of volume growth that needs to come into the network to show year-over-year OR improvement?\nMark George: Well, I'll jump in and just say that you go back to our financial framework, our goal, the one we launched back in December, kind of -- we're aiming for mid-single-digit revenue growth on average in most years. And that would imply a few points at least of volume and a couple of points of pricing. So we think that, that is the right equation for us where we can then leverage it and drive productivity so that we have op income growth that's greater than the revenue growth. So, that's pretty much the model. And I would expect in '24 that to play out.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Now that you've had a little more time to digest the aftermath of the accident, do you have a better sense of when we might know the final kind of financial impact here? Kind of is that 3Q event, is a 2024 event? Is it going to take several years? How does that play out?\nAlan Shaw: Mark, why don't you address that, please?\nMark George: Sure. I mean, this is going to take a little bit more time. The way to look at this, Ravi, is as we've entered Q2, we've got a lot more visibility now than we did in Q1. And our current estimates assume that the cleanup activity continues into October and then kind of moderates meaningfully during the fourth quarter. Future periods are going to be impacted by ongoing legal costs and may be impacted by other items as well such as fines and penalties, which are currently unknown. And frankly, we can't estimate. So what I would encourage is that maybe you look at the 10-Q disclosures later today related to the matter, we kind of go into a fair amount of detail of the types of things that could continue to impact us in the future. And we'll continue to monitor this and keep you all apprised as things change. But right now, the largest part of what we're accruing for has really been the environmental cleanup costs. And the visibility now is we think as we get into October, things really start to wind down, and that's the basis of these estimates. Now I'll take a moment and just say, we've started the process, like I said in my prepared remarks of seeking recovery from third parties, and we are going to start here in the third quarter, making claims against our insurance -- making claims against our insurance policies. So that's going to take some time to play out. And we're probably talking quarters, not months.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: We had another Class 1 rail yesterday come out and announced that they're pausing buyback activity for the second half. So I wanted to get your thoughts around buybacks as we move into the next couple of quarters? And any update on the timing of the Cincinnati Southern acquisition closing and how that deal will be funded?\nMark George: Yes, thanks. We continue doing some share repurchasing in the second quarter similar levels to what we had done in the first. And again, we get back to what our model is and nothing changes. The first thing we do with our returns is reinvest back in the business to drive safety, resiliency, growth productivity. And this year, that is going to be $2.2 billion of CapEx spend. After that, we pay a dividend in that 35% to 40% payout ratio range. Sometimes it goes outside of that a little bit, but we'll grow back into it. And then with the remaining excess cash, we've been very mindful of our leverage, we return that cash to shareholders through the repurchase of shares. This year is a little unique in that we have signaled we're going to do that CSR purchase. The timing of that is also becoming clearer. That is likely toward the end of Q1 of next year of closing should the citizens vote affirmatively in Cincinnati to go forward. So we will be mindful of that because part of that purchase will be coming from internally generated cash flow. That doesn't mean we're stopping share repurchase, but it will definitely be at much lower levels than we've seen in the prior couple of years where we were doing $3 billion a year or more.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Kauffman: A lot of my questions has been answered, but let me ask this one because you threw it out earlier. You talked a little bit about bringing in first mile, last mile head. Now not the right time, we're focused on rehabbing the network and fixing what needs to be fixed. But could you talk a little bit about longer term why this makes a difference and why you're one of the few rails that's actually stepped in that direction?\nAlan Shaw: Ed, why don't you address that?\nEd Elkins: Sure, I'd be glad to. We know from talking to our customers, and we've done this over a long period of time and spent a lot of time with our customers. First and last mile is a critical component of the customer experience. And we know that there are a few key vectors of value that we're going to be -- that we have to focus on delivering. Service quality is one of those. And first and last mile is a portion of service quality. It's also customer experience, it's also commercial sophistication. In all three of those categories, first and last mile plays a significant and substantial role. And it's not just in the merchandise business. It's also in our TBT or bulk transfer facilities. It's also with our third grade directed product. It's also with Triple Crown. So we view it as a key component of our future success.\nAlan Shaw: And it's all part of our long-term strategy to drive service, productivity and growth.\nMark George: We've got to do different things if we want to grow. Yes. So this is a great example.\nAlan Shaw: Yes. And we're willing to take a lead role in the industry on that.\nMark George: That's right.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: So I wanted to ask you, I think you talked a little bit about maybe what you need on the volume side to -- or revenue side to improve OR. But I guess I'm thinking if you look, I don't know, into '24 or just let's say, beyond the next quarter or two, it does seem like you identified a pretty big revenue headwind in the second half. And I don't know that those revenues would come back in terms of storage or coal RPU and fuel surcharge, obviously, can be up or down. But I'm just -- and on the cost side, it doesn't seem like you're going to cut headcount. So is it just all about volume? And should we be optimistic about moving out of the mid-60s? Or is there an operating ratio? Or is there a challenge where you're kind of stuck in the mid-60s for a period of time on the operating ratio. It just seems hard to see what's going to move in a big way out of the mid-60s OR other than volume really being a lot better.\nMark George: The single biggest lever we've got right now is to absorb volume growth into our current cost structure. So, that is really going to provide a bit of peel out from where we are today. And then I think at the same time, Paul and his team, in particular, are working hard on productivity initiatives because we've dug service out of the hole we were in, maybe not in the most productive way. We've been growing a lot of costs and resources to accelerate the network. So now there's a lot of opportunity to take the costs out and start driving productivity again. And that's what Paul and his team are heavily focused on. We're not going to give an OR projection here or the pace at which we're going to improve. There are a lot of levers. And you touched on most of them. RPU being a big piece. We'll see what happens here with coal pricing in the future. That's been a driver. The same thing with fuel. That's going to be -- it's been very supportive fuel to our OR in the first half, and it's going to be equally negative now here in the back half. So that dynamic could change going forward. So we're not in a position to project where the OR goes in the next 12 or 18 months. But I will tell you, we are coiled up with the investments we've made to start driving improvements by taking on volume. We are reading employees to take on volume.\nTom Wadewitz: It just seems like the revenue headwinds are a lot bigger than the $45 million a quarter cost inefficiencies?\nMark George: Yes. I mean we laid them out. There are some revenue RPU type of headwinds, but we do think that there is volume out there for the taking. And as long as we don't go into an economic downturn, which is we're feeling a little bit better about lately, we think there's some share recapture opportunity that's out there and other areas where we can take the volume on. But yes, we're going to have short-term headwinds.\nAlan Shaw: And look, as the service product has stabilized, it gives us the opportunity to continue to iterate our plan and drive productivity and efficiencies into the base plan as well. So it's not just the elimination of the service recovery cost. We're going to make the base plan better. And that's exactly what we're doing now, and that's the structure that Paul has built into his organization.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Just going back to that $2.6 billion that you highlight on industrial development, is there a way to better understand how that converts to a potential volume opportunity for you. And I would say similarly with the EV battery plants per plan, is there a kind of an algorithm to think through in terms of the volume opportunity as they come online?\nEd Elkins: I appreciate the question. I'm not sure, I think, in terms of algorithms for that stuff. The value of the product that we're delivering varies by the size of the project. And it could be months to manifest volume. It could be years depending on the size of the project. We're encouraged by the EV battery facilities that have located along our lines. But let me be also clear, we're encouraged by EV battery production or facilities that are not on our lines because being the largest producer we serve more auto plants than any other railroad. We're going to benefit from that off-line production as well. So I don't -- I think when we think through it, it is a multi-year manifestation of volume over time.\nAlan Shaw: Yes. I think the salient point is the macro trends in the economy play to the strengths of our unique franchise. That's why we have a lot of confidence moving forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Two quick things here. One, how should we think about sort of other income below the line, you guys did a great job of laying out sort of what you think about revenue, what you think about OR but there's a big swing year-over-year in other income, so just curious about second half? And Alan, any thoughts on potential regulation and maybe the recent steps by the FRA to do a public comment period on train size and weights.\nMark George: Jason, other income, remember, a big driver of other income is the Company owned -- the returns on company-owned life insurance investments. And here in the first half, we had some pretty good compares because last year, in Q1, Q2, we had losses on those company-owned life insurance policies. So now, we've swung to returns again, which is historically long term, been the more normal. And so the $64 million or so in Q2, which is year-over-year compare on company-owned life insurance will probably not be as big in the back half. So, I'd get back to more back half numbers like you've seen historically in that $20 million to $30 million a quarter range.\nAlan Shaw: And Jason, with respect to your question about regulation, I've been fully engaged with our elected officials and our regulators, really advancing and offering my full throat in endorsement for a lot of the provisions that are in the various bills that are moving through the house or moving through the Senate. A lot of them make perfect sense to us or just they're commonsensical. I don't see anything out there right now that is going to be too onerous on the rail industry cost structure, which includes railroads or our customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.\nBascome Majors: Mark, you gave us a lot of color on the timing of recoveries versus spend and some of the issues with East Palestine. I think it would be helpful if you could kind of frame what you're feeling for free cash flow this year, and just ballpark, any amount that might be a shift into 2024? Or that's how we should look at it given that claims and recoveries will be ongoing and could take years? Thank you.\nMark George: Yes, Bascom, it's really because of the timing with EP and the uncertainties around. I had mentioned that the accrued balance that sits there today, $287 million of cash has gone out. We've got over $800 million that we had accrued for. So the remaining $500-or-so million, half of that is going to come out in the back half of this year, the other half probably next year, some may slip into 2025 even. Beyond that, we have no visibility to the timing on recoveries. It's unlikely that we'll see any recoveries actually here in 2023. It's a matter of when in 2024, they start to come in. And we'll get back to, again, the insurance process where you can't really ask for insurance coverage on costs you've incurred until you actually incur the expense, meaning the cash goes out. So we're only just now starting to make those claims. So it is going to take several quarters probably before you go through the process and get the free cash flow benefit on the proceeds.\nBascome Majors: Do you have any thoughts without really tying you to the timing of when those recoveries may or may not happen? What free cash flow could look like for the business this year?\nMark George: I don't want to get into that level of guidance right here.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Nolan: Yes. We've heard a little bit about the possibility of seeing some intermodal shifting back to the West Coast from the East Coast given the hopefully, normalization of labor over there. Curious if you guys have seen any initial signs of that at all or if you see that as a potential risk or not?\nEd Elkins: I would say we haven't seen any real signs of it yet, but let's be clear. We have a network that's built for volume growth from the West as well as from the East, and we can benefit from freight that comes in either cost.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Sanford: So is there a way to quantify the share loss in 2Q that has happened from the East Palestine derailment? I'm just trying to get a sense for some -- how much volume might have moved away related to the weaker macro? And then, Mark, is there a way to think about as you look forward to all the things that are potentially out there, obviously, we've accrued for a lot of things. We're going to get some recoveries. If we think about the net, the good guys versus the bad guys. Is there a way to think about whether the liability from this thing is going to net grow or maybe say constant or maybe shrink a little bit when you think about all the puts and takes on a multiyear view?\nEd Elkins: This is Ed. I'll start. There's no doubt, we went through a tough stretch there with service that for some of our customers to find alternatives to keep their supply chains running. Those alternatives probably included additional inventory, truck substitution as well as other railroads. And I think Mark actually mentioned $175 million to $200 million in the quarter that we -- we wish we had back. I think that's a fair number. We work pretty closely on that. But we also know that our customers recognize the long-term benefit that we deliver. And I told you earlier that I'm already encouraged about the recent trajectory of our volumes. We're able to save our customers money, and they are looking forward for us doing that. We focused on two things during the quarter as we got service back. Number one, get it back as quickly as possible. And number two, make sure we stayed really close to our customers, so they knew that they could unwind those alternatives and come back to us. We think we're seeing that.\nAlan Shaw: Look, that's a central point to our long-term strategy and consistent service as consequences. And that we're going to make service -- competitive service, excellent service and enduring competitive strength for NS.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Shaw for any final comments.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to further conversations at start of the third quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alan Shaw",
            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to our discussion of second quarter earnings. Here with me today are Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer; Paul Duncan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer. I would like to begin by thanking all of my colleagues at Norfolk Southern for their tremendous work this quarter. As you will hear this morning, we are delivering on our commitment to recover service quickly. We are delivering on our commitment to make a safe railroad even safer. We are delivering on our commitment to address quality of life issues for our hardworking craft railroaders, and we continue to deliver on our commitment to make things right for the people of East Palestine and the surrounding communities. We have a vision for a better way forward for Norfolk Southern. Last December, we outlined a groundbreaking strategy that balances service, productivity and growth. It is designed to create long-term value for our customers, employees, shareholders and the communities we serve. Our commitment to that strategy was tested on February 3 with the derailment in East Palestine. Adversity reveals character and tests resolve. I'm proud of the way our team rose to the challenge. Our response in East Palestine has been fully aligned with our better way forward, making decisions in the best long-term interest of the community and surrounding areas has achieved significant progress. Our financial results were challenged this quarter as we noted in May that they would be. They reflect the decisive actions we have taken to advance our strategy and keep our promises in East Palestine. With every step forward, we are doing exactly what we said we would do when we announced our strategy last December. We are investing in the long-term success of our company. With our strategy as our road map, we made significant progress in the second quarter, building the foundation for long-term value creation. This morning, I'll share a few notable examples of our progress. I'll start with service. In the first quarter, we expressed confidence that our service challenges were a temporary disruption due to deliberate management actions in response to the derailment and that our recovery plan would show results quickly. We delivered. As Paul will describe shortly, service is now at levels comparable to our best performance in 2019. When we announced our strategy last year, I indicated that we will continue to make disciplined investments in our business through economic cycles. As Mark will describe, we are doing exactly what we said we would do. We continue to expand the ranks of our frontline craft railroaders, and we are investing in locomotives, intermodal infrastructure, new sidings, technology and other assets that will drive service, productivity and growth. We are looking beyond this cycle to be ready to serve our customers and support their growth during the recovery and into the future. Another important way we moved our strategy forward in the second quarter was through our continuing progress engaging more effectively with our frontline railroaders. This is one of my top priorities as CEO, and it is a reason I spent so much time in the field. I've learned from every conversation with my craft colleagues. After the conclusion of our national labor negotiations last year, I promised to work with union leadership at the local level to address quality of life issues. We kept that commitment, and I'm especially proud Norfolk Southern was the first Class 1 railroad to provide paid sick leave for all of our craft employees. We are building on that momentum. It was an extraordinary moment to co-author an open letter with the leaders of 12 railroad unions committing to collaborate on safety. And then a few days later, to share a stage with many of those same leaders in an all-employee town hall meeting to talk about safety and our strategy. Our people are excited to be part of a vision that focuses on growth. Our actions this quarter to advance our strategy extend well beyond operations. They run throughout our company. In marketing, we reorganized the team to align with our strategy, positioning us to maintain the deep customer relationships that characterize Norfolk Southern while simultaneously pursuing growth in high-value markets that make sense for our network. As part of that change, we made the innovative move this quarter to create the industry's first Vice President of First Mile Last Mile, building an entrepreneurial spirit and growth mindset into our organizational structure, continuous productivity improvement through cost management and smart revenue growth is a core element of our strategy. In the second quarter, we created a new performance excellence team within operations, charged with building additional rigor and discipline into our processes. This work is foundational to our strategy. Standardizing our processes supports a high degree of planned compliance, which in turn gives us greater flexibility to innovate and test, targeted improvements that enhance consistent and reliable service and provide productivity opportunities, thus unlocking growth potential. Additionally, we continue to make progress this quarter, strengthening our safety culture, implementing best practices and accelerating technology improvements. We look beyond the rail industry for a partner that would challenge and inspire us. We chose Atkins Nuclear Solutions, which brings experience from the Nuclear Navy, the gold standard of operational excellence and industrial safety. Then, we reached out to the leaders of the national unions representing our frontline craft railroaders, and ask them to work with us to enhance rail safety. Our work is producing results. As Paul will describe in more detail, our safety metrics demonstrate significant improvement. As a result of these initiatives and more, Norfolk Southern today is a railroad poised for long-term value creation. We are implementing our innovative strategic plan and correlating to serve our customers and capture growth when demand inevitably returns. And now, I'll turn it over to Mark for a detailed look at our second quarter results. Thanks, Ed. Let's turn to Slide 22. As we have reached midpoint of 2023, I want to provide you with an update to our outlook. Although we entered the year expecting to achieve revenues comparable to 2022, the first half revenue shortfalls require us to modify our full year outlook. We now anticipate revenue to be down at least 3% in 2023 implying some modest volume improvements in the back half. We're also expecting modestly higher capital expenditures for the year as we accelerate investments in safety, service, productivity and growth. Finally, I want to close our prepared remarks by reconfirming the commitment of the entire Norfolk Southern team to delivering long-term shareholder value through top-tier revenue and earnings growth at industry competitive margins with balanced capital deployment. I'm confident that our strategy will help us achieve our full potential, and I'm encouraged by our progress and investments. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Brendon, we remade our train makeup and starting in March. And we guided to the fact that we would expect service to improve as we moved out of the second quarter and into the third quarter coupled with the fact that we're going to get the second track back in East Palestine that's absolutely what we delivered. Our service is on the trajectory that we had guided to. And what we're seeing as a result over the last couple of weeks is real strength in our volume sequentially and also relative to the rest of the industry. With respect to our updated operating plan and train makeup rules, it gives us an opportunity to create more capacity as we've increased the utilization of distributed power which helps our cost structure, helps our service product and helps our capacity for growth. Yes. Ken. And with respect to volumes moving forward, clearly, our volumes were pressured in the second quarter and in the last two months of the first quarter because of the service degradation. That's why it was really important for us to hit the service targets and the service recovery trajectory that we had committed to publicly and with our customers. We've done that. And as a result, our equipment is turning faster and customers are talking to us about incorporating Norfolk Southern into their long-term supply chain solutions. Ed, do you want to give a little bit more color on that? Ed, you want to take the first question? You've also seen us take share from truck in the international market. Look, we were really clear in May that OR would be really pressured in the second quarter because we're going to have three months of service disruption as we've delivered on our commitment to improve service throughout the quarter and moving into third quarter. That creates more opportunity for volume and it creates a better cost structure for us. We will still have those headwinds that Mark called out, particularly with respect to fuel surcharge and comps on... On coal pricing but the underlying product and our ability to onboard volume at strong incrementals is improving. Why don't you address the question on conductor trainees and craft colleagues. And Paul, your guidance on a pipeline of around 600 is more pointed towards the end of the year. Mark, why don't you address that, please? Ed, why don't you address that? And it's all part of our long-term strategy to drive service, productivity and growth. Yes. And we're willing to take a lead role in the industry on that. And look, as the service product has stabilized, it gives us the opportunity to continue to iterate our plan and drive productivity and efficiencies into the base plan as well. So it's not just the elimination of the service recovery cost. We're going to make the base plan better. And that's exactly what we're doing now, and that's the structure that Paul has built into his organization. Yes. I think the salient point is the macro trends in the economy play to the strengths of our unique franchise. That's why we have a lot of confidence moving forward. And Jason, with respect to your question about regulation, I've been fully engaged with our elected officials and our regulators, really advancing and offering my full throat in endorsement for a lot of the provisions that are in the various bills that are moving through the house or moving through the Senate. A lot of them make perfect sense to us or just they're commonsensical. I don't see anything out there right now that is going to be too onerous on the rail industry cost structure, which includes railroads or our customers. Look, that's a central point to our long-term strategy and consistent service as consequences. And that we're going to make service -- competitive service, excellent service and enduring competitive strength for NS. Thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to further conversations at start of the third quarter."

            "name": "Ed Elkins",
            "content": "Thanks, Paul, and good morning to everybody on the call. Beginning on Slide 19, I'll review our commercial results for the quarter. Now as we expected, the second quarter came with challenges related to ongoing soft freight demand, lower commodity prices and still recovering service levels. In total, we generated just under $3 billion in revenue for the quarter, down 8% from the second quarter of last year and that's driven by a 6% drop in volume and lower revenue from fuel and accessorials. ARPU was also down year-over-year. However, revenue per unit less fuel improved 1% reflecting gains in price and favorable mix, and that's driven by tempered demand for intermodal and utility coal. I'd like to note here that underneath this favorable overall mix narrative, there was significant negative mix within markets that tempered overall revenue per unit performance, which I'll note below. Now merchandise results were varied as favorable conditions in the markets for automotive and agriculture products were offset by headwinds in chemicals markets. And that's a good example of the challenging RPU mix within markets that I just mentioned. Automotive volumes were driven by robust finished vehicle production and agriculture shipments were strong due to new lane offerings and a weak local crop in the Southeast. Offsetting this growth was weakness in several of our chemical commodities as well as challenges to meet customer demand in key markets such as metals, aggregates and finished vehicles. Taken together, total merchandise volume and revenue for the second quarter came in 1% below prior year levels. Revenue per unit was flat year-over-year, but RPU less fuel grew 2%, which makes 32 out of the last 33 quarters that we've achieved growth in this metric. And I think that is a clear signal that our diverse portfolio and strong pricing discipline are delivering results. Turning to Intermodal. Continued market headwinds were felt the strongest in our domestic lines of business where volumes declined 14% year-over-year as weak freight demand, high inventories and excess truck capacity weighed on performance. Conversely, in a continuation of the first quarter trend, international volumes increased 1% year-over-year and 5.8% sequentially over last quarter. As we guided to before, our customers have continued to shift highway freight back into IPI services and storage charges have declined as supply chain fluidity and container dwell have returned to pre-pandemic normalcy. As you would expect with this performance, Intermodal is another segment where ARPU mix with end markets was challenging for us. Both RPU and RPU less fuel were down significantly due to lower revenue from fuel surcharge and storage charges. Lastly, coal volume was flat year-over-year, but coal revenue fell 4% as RPU declined. Utility volumes were down 17% year-over-year due to historically low natural gas prices and elevated stockpiles. These declines were offset by gains in export shipments as a result of increased production and robust overseas demand. Although export volumes increased, the mix between export steam and export metallurgical coal shifted unfavorably and comparatively lower seaborne coal prices yielded lower revenue per unit. Again, a key segment where ARPU mix within markets was a headwind. With that, let's turn to Slide 20 and review our outlook for the remainder of 2023. Overall, we're confident that our service product positions us to realize growth when market conditions improve. And as the year progresses, we are focused on pursuing the opportunities in markets that have the highest potential for growth for Norfolk Southern. We expect to increase our share in these markets as an improving service product and a sharply focused organization allows us to realize more of the ongoing demand for our services. Beginning with merchandise markets, conditions vary by individual market, and we see strong levels of nonresidential construction as reshoring and infrastructure projects increase which will drive strength in metals and construction volume. Pent-up demand for U.S. light vehicles will continue to support metals and automotive volumes. However, we expect continued weakness in our chemicals markets in the second half. Turning to Intermodal. We expect international volumes to continue its growth trend with an expected rebound in import volumes and the continued share growth of IPI. Storage charges will continue to be a revenue and RPU headwind compared to last year. On the domestic side, overall growth will be dependent on the U.S. consumer, retail inventory levels and the truck market. We worked really hard with our best-in-class channel partners to sustain our service levels throughout the quarter during the crucial climax of bid season, and we're hearing from our key partners that our strategy is helping them increase their share of bid wins. We look forward to leveraging our capacity to realize this growth as market conditions improve. And finally, within our coal markets, we expect overall volume growth as continued strength in export markets more than offset weakness in utility coal. Coal production levels at NS-served mines will drive growth in export shipments, although we do expect lower seaborne coal prices to negatively impact RPU. The utility outlook is largely dependent on the weather, on existing stockpiles and natural gas prices. The net result is we expect total coal RPU to sequentially decline by a low double-digit percentage. Despite uncertainty across the economy, our focus on service, productivity and growth remains at the core of our strategy, and we're confident in our ability to grow our franchise and deliver value for our customers. On that note, I'd like to draw your attention to Slide 21, which highlights the strength of Norfolk Southern's network and our ability to drive growth both now and in the future. The ecosystem for electric vehicles has been steadily developing in recent years as demonstrated by last quarter's announcement of the new Scout Motors plant on Norfolk Southern. We are focused on all facets of this emerging EV supply chain, including the EV battery and battery components. Over the last 18 months, more than $70 billion in new investment has been announced for building out EV battery manufacturing plants across North America. Our commercial team has worked to help locate nearly 1/3 of that investment on our network, including most recently in the second quarter, a new $3 billion General Motors and Samsung battery manufacturing plant in Indiana, on a Norfolk Southern main line. Norfolk Southern's network is well positioned for future industrial development. We reached 60% of the U.S. population and cover 50% of our manufacturing base. We look forward to amplifying that strength through continued industrial development wins. Year-to-date, our industrial development team has reported $2.6 billion in industry investment that's been completed along Norfolk Southern lines, bringing 3,200 new jobs to the local communities that we serve. We continue to invest in site readiness for our highest potential industrial sites, and we're confident our diverse portfolio of shovel-ready sites combined with the strength of our network, we'll continue to land new opportunities across our network. With that, I'll turn it back over to Alan to bring us home. Yes. When we look at our volumes compared to the other Class 1s over the course of 2023, our volumes outperformed the industry average for nine of the first 10 weeks of the year and we were feeling good. And then as you know, the network slowed and congestion build up, our performance suffered, but as we started to speed up, our relative performance also has started to recover. And over the last 11 weeks, I think this is important. We've outperformed the industry average for nine of those weeks. And the outperformance that we've been experiencing is accelerating placing us in the top two of the Class 1 railroads for four of the five last weeks. And I will tell you, I spoke about it in the prepared remarks, there are a few bright spots out there where we're focused on delivering growth for our customers through better service. That includes in the automotive industry where we see clear line of sight on continued demand. And then you think about infrastructure spending that's going on all around the country, but particularly in our footprint as well as residential construction that's really tied to new home construction because people with low interest rates are just staying in those houses. So folks who need a home are going out and building a new one, we see some clear bright spots there. And the real key is, we're focused on those markets. We're present in those markets with our sales teams and our operating teams. And as the network continues to speed up, we're going to deliver more value for those customers. Yes. Yes. If you want to -- let's talk about RPU first, particularly within intermodal. Core pricing remains positive for Intermodal. And more importantly, I think I highlighted it during the prepared remarks, the mix within Intermodal has been pretty dynamic. And because of our success in those international markets and delivering value through more IPI business, that mix is negative for overall ARPU within intermodal. Sure. Again, when we think about supply chain congestion, I think it's pretty much gone. I'd say supply chains are really about as fluid now as they were prior to the pandemic. And in fact, there may be a little bit more capacity. We monitor warehouse activity pretty closely and the supply chains index -- or excuse me, the Logistics Managers Index, which we pay attention to noted that warehouse capacity has increased at the fastest rate since the start of the pandemic. It's a challenge, and we've seen those storage charges roll-off and essentially turn to really a pre-pandemic normal. Yes, that is what I was referring to with increased IPI shipments. The international markets are looking for ways to add value for their customers and the service we're providing in IPI is a clear way for them to do that. This is Ed. When we look at the second half of the year, on the RPU front, reduced storage and fuel surcharge revenues are going to persist. We've talked about that. I talked about that in our prepared remarks. Collectively, those current projections for us fuel storage and coal pricing is roughly $650 million. That's right. Sure, I'd be glad to. We know from talking to our customers, and we've done this over a long period of time and spent a lot of time with our customers. First and last mile is a critical component of the customer experience. And we know that there are a few key vectors of value that we're going to be -- that we have to focus on delivering. Service quality is one of those. And first and last mile is a portion of service quality. It's also customer experience, it's also commercial sophistication. In all three of those categories, first and last mile plays a significant and substantial role. And it's not just in the merchandise business. It's also in our TBT or bulk transfer facilities. It's also with our third grade directed product. It's also with Triple Crown. So we view it as a key component of our future success. I appreciate the question. I'm not sure, I think, in terms of algorithms for that stuff. The value of the product that we're delivering varies by the size of the project. And it could be months to manifest volume. It could be years depending on the size of the project. We're encouraged by the EV battery facilities that have located along our lines. But let me be also clear, we're encouraged by EV battery production or facilities that are not on our lines because being the largest producer we serve more auto plants than any other railroad. We're going to benefit from that off-line production as well. So I don't -- I think when we think through it, it is a multi-year manifestation of volume over time. I would say we haven't seen any real signs of it yet, but let's be clear. We have a network that's built for volume growth from the West as well as from the East, and we can benefit from freight that comes in either cost. This is Ed. I'll start. There's no doubt, we went through a tough stretch there with service that for some of our customers to find alternatives to keep their supply chains running. Those alternatives probably included additional inventory, truck substitution as well as other railroads. And I think Mark actually mentioned $175 million to $200 million in the quarter that we -- we wish we had back. I think that's a fair number. We work pretty closely on that. But we also know that our customers recognize the long-term benefit that we deliver. And I told you earlier that I'm already encouraged about the recent trajectory of our volumes. We're able to save our customers money, and they are looking forward for us doing that. We focused on two things during the quarter as we got service back. Number one, get it back as quickly as possible. And number two, make sure we stayed really close to our customers, so they knew that they could unwind those alternatives and come back to us. We think we're seeing that."

            "name": "Paul Duncan",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let's jump right into our safety update on Slide 12. Everything starts with safety. We continue to make progress this year enhancing safety. Our injury frequency ratio is trending down 12% year-to-date versus last year. Our accident rates for the first half of the year is also down from prior years and our mainline train accident rate is trending improved 40% year-to-date versus last year. I want to take a moment to thank our leaders and our craft colleagues for collectively enhancing safety and driving these outcomes for our team, the communities we serve and our customers. We'll transition to our progress in safely delivering a reliable and resilient service product on Slide 13. You will recall during our last earnings call that we expected service to improve in summer and we have delivered on that promise. We've successfully restored our double-track mainline through East Palestine in a safe and environmentally appropriate way and we wasted no time resetting network performance levels our customers expect in this quarter between the Midwest and the Northeast. We have significantly improved train velocity, dwell and service across our network to two-year best resulting from these improvements. With service improved, our focus now is driving further reliability, productivity and resiliency in our network aligned with our strategic vision outlined in December. Touching on Slide 14. Now, what we told you would be an important measure of our service recovery reduction in cars online. Following the first quarter service interruptions, we had an inventory buildup. We set in place a plan to work down to build up as quickly as possible while also restoring our mainline and overall network conditions. We successfully executed on that plan and railcars are now cycling throughout our network faster than they have since before 2022, achieving greater railcar fleet productivity. Turning to Slide 15 for an update on our hiring progress. Our efforts to right-size our team accrual based have continued the first half of this year. We are now at a point at which the training pipeline has crested and will begin to taper down over the back half of the year. We are committed to maintaining an appropriately-sized workforce to drive reliability and long-term resilience as part of our strategy. Our productivity metrics are shown on Slide 16. Our short-term service challenges described earlier contributed to productivity impacts as we work to restore service and velocity. Mark mentioned earlier that we return to serve as a portion of our road locomotive fleet to expedite our service recovery. With service and locomotive velocity much improved as we enter summer, we have now right-sized our road fleet and are now achieving velocity near 200 miles per day with our locomotives. As part of our strategy to become not only reliable, but more resilient we have allocated a portion of our road locomotive fleet to surge capacity to be hot and ready to run at key locations of our network when needed. We continue to have a solid outlook for our locomotive fleet. Our DC to AC program is ongoing, which will provide us with a capacity dividend not only in terms of AC traction but also improvements in fuel efficiency. Transitioning to the workforce. T&E productivity was challenged due to the effort we put in place to accelerate the network, coupled with the contraction in volumes. Moving forward, we expect to improve T&E productivity through a variety of initiatives improving velocity, absorbing volume on existing trains and normalizing our CT pipeline. Lastly, on fuel, we took a step back for the first time in seven quarters. This was largely due to lower velocity and fewer GTMs on the network as we are restoring service. We are very confident that our initiatives that have been paying regular dividends will continue driving us towards further fuel efficiency as we continue to see the benefits of an improving network. Moving forward on Slide 17. Our focus will be on safely and productively delivering reliable and resilient service. Every conversation will start with safety as we continue to enhance it through the initiatives that we discussed. With service improved, our goal now is to continue to build further reliability and resiliency in the network but to do so productively. Velocity and service improvements will provide us further opportunities to leverage and spin our assets while pushing to drive further process standardization into our scheduled network to drive productivity. This is the primary focus of our new performance excellence team, which was created this year. We will also continue to leverage the capital investments we have made to increase productivity, including recent siding projects between Chicago and Cincinnati that will allow us to increase train length and capacity in this quarter. Thank you and I will now hand it off to Ed Elkins. Yes. Thanks, Alan. So as you saw on the -- hunting chart on the stats, we continue to make progress on staffing. And really, at this point, we plan to reduce the CT pipeline to around 600 or less as we continue to focus on attrition and filling in some of those remaining locations. But at this point, with what we've been able to do from a hiring standpoint, we have further leveraged and gained velocity across the network and facilitate having those folks that are at healthy locations send to some of those hotspots. And again, that is a contributor to the velocity improvements and the service improvements that we've seen here over the past several weeks that we expect to continue through the latter half of the year. Correct. Correct."

            "name": "Mark George",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan, and good morning to everyone. Before we get into the operating results for the quarter, Slide 6 illustrates the financial impact from the Eastern Ohio derailment. There was another $416 million of costs recorded in Q2, primarily driven by environmental cleanup activities. Our estimates reflect the significant progress we've made remediating the site and the continued efforts we expect to undertake related to further restoration efforts. While our estimates reflect our expectation that activity at the site will meaningfully moderate in the fourth quarter, any changes in the nature, extent and duration of the remaining cleanup activities and government oversight activities may impact our current estimate. Additionally, developments with respect to the healthcare fund, which we are creating for affected residents as well as the potential fines, penalties or settlements and ongoing legal expenses will all likely impact our costs in future quarters. Of the $803 million recorded so far this year, only $287 million of the cash has been paid through June 30. We currently expect about half of our accrued balance to be paid over the remainder of the year with the rest in 2024 or later. Our 2023 results do not reflect potential recoveries from third parties or under our insurance coverage. Importantly, you will see in the quarter that we have started the process of pursuing recovery from third parties, a process we will continue to explore where appropriate in connection with our other lawsuits. As for our insurance coverage, we expect to begin filing insurance claims here in the third quarter. This will be the first of many claims that will be made over the coming quarters. To remind everyone, we can only make claims upon payments being made not based on accruals. As you can imagine, insurance reimbursements and third-party recoveries will take time to materialize. Turning to Slide 7. Here, we illustrate the accounting impacts of the incident and response on our key metrics for Q2. At the bottom, you see the adjusted results excluding those impacts. Revenues were down 8% to last year, while adjusted operating expense was flattish. It's important to understand that the incident meaningfully harmed revenues in the quarter because of the resulting service disruption, but that impact is not adjusted from our GAAP figures and mitigating those service impacts cost us money to fix and those costs are also not accounted for in the $416 million operating expense adjustment. Consequently, the adjusted operating ratio was 66.7%. Had we been able to move a couple of hundred million more of revenue with our Q2 cost structure, our margins would have been much stronger. On an adjusted basis, operating income was down 22%, net Income was down 18%, and EPS was down 14%. Moving to Slide 8. Adjusted operating expenses for the quarter were up slightly on a year-over-year basis. Compensation and benefits were up $79 million or 13% in the quarter due to wage inflation and ongoing hiring to primarily shore up the remaining challenged locations on our network and in support of our strategic plan to build long-term network resiliency. Materials and other expenses in the quarter were up $33 million or 19% driven primarily by a continuation of the locomotive related work we discussed during the first quarter call, bringing part of the stored fleet back into service to successfully accelerate the network, which you will hear more about from Paul. Additionally, in other, the quarter was impacted by lower gains on the sale of property. Purchased services and rents were up $25 million or 5% this quarter as the challenge network created more headwinds to the category in addition to our continued investments in technology. Depreciation was up $17 million in the quarter, in line with our guidance. Mitigating these increases were fuel expenses which were down $145 million or 36% in the quarter. Turning to Slide 9. Let's look at the adjusted P&L results below the line. Partially mitigating the $279 million reduction in adjusted operating income was a $71 million increase in other income, driven by favorable investment returns and compares from company-owned life insurance. Net income and EPS were down 18% and 14%, respectively, in the quarter. Moving to free cash flow and shareholder returns on Slide 10. Through the first six months, free cash flow was lower by $276 million due to combined pressure from the derailment-related expenditures as well as investments in roadway and equipment. Shareholder distributions during the first half were $918 million, thanks to our solid dividend and share repurchase activity. I'll now turn it over to Paul for a discussion on our operations. Yes, Ken, we were talking about intra-category price there. And then with regard to the real estate gains in the quarter, I think we said it was $19 million absolute in the quarter itself. Go ahead... Amit, let me go through a little bit of the first half, second half dynamic because there are some changes here for sure. We do expect some modestly higher volumes from the better service product we have here in the back half. So that's definitely going into the tailwind category. We will start to see a partial wind down of the service costs here in the second half as well. And fuel expense is going to be less of a headwind than it was in the first half. But we got some sizable headwinds here in the back half, principally on the ARPU side. The fuel surcharge really starts to diminish here and the lag benefit disappears on us. So this fuel will be a real negative in the back half, certainly to margins. And as Ed mentioned, intermodal storage is basically back at pre-pandemic levels now, which means we're going to continue to have quarter-over-quarter headwinds until we lap this probably in the second quarter of next year. And then, of course, if the futures hold, we're going to have international seaborne coal pricing headwind as well in the RPU side. So that's pretty much the headwind and tailwind equation. So if the volumes come in, like we think a little bit of back half tailwind, we should get some OR improvement from here and the more the better because we got a lot of capacity on the railroad right now. Yes. Volumes, we expect to really provide us a little bit of tailwind here. And I think it's all going to depend on how much volume we're able to bring on to the railroad. On coal pricing Year-over-year revenue contraction. So that's the headwind we're swimming against. Second half versus second half. And Chris, with regard to OpEx, I think we've obviously seen a step-up in our cost structure as we've been dealing with a lot of the service issues and trying to start to build some resiliency going forward. I think what you'll see now is emanation of those service-related costs as we go through the back half of the year. However, don't forget, we've got that 4% wage increase that took effect July 1. So, those kind of start to wash each other out. And with regard to some of the other P&L line items, in aggregate, probably flattish sequentially. We see those kind of holdings. So that's why the leverage is there now to take on to take on volume. We believe we've got the capacity to handle a lot of volume without much incremental cost and really gets down to facing these RPU headwinds that are going to provide pretty sizable headwind for us on the margin side, $650 million as we just touched on. I'm sorry, can you repeat that? Yes, correct. Yes. So, the way we look at it, and we've done some analysis here with Ed and his team, we think we left about $175 million to $200 million of revenue behind because of the service disruptions and the shutdown of the line there in East Palestine. So, that's kind of on the revenue side. And on the cost side, we were dealing with growing a lot of costs and trying to accelerate the network, and we've done that successfully. So, now we're going to probably use the next six months to really work those costs off and get back to more productive levels of service. So, I think you'll see that those costs will wind down here in the third quarter. And I think by the fourth quarter, most of those costs will be removed from our system. So, we talk about probably $40 million to $45 million here in the second quarter of kind of poor service related costs, and that will start to unwind here. Thanks, Brian. So I think I guided earlier in the year to about 35,000 and change each quarter, anticipating that we were going to have this 4% step-up in rates in the third quarter, but that would be neutralized by the wind-down of service-related costs. So that guidance pretty much holds. I would -- if I were you all, I'd be modeling around 35 and change average comp per employee each quarter. Sorry, the second part of that one question was what? Oh, yes. Sorry. Clearly, these things aren't free. So there's definitely a little bit of a headwind that we're swimming against with a lot of these work rule changes. I'm not going to put a fine number on it other than to say that, obviously, we're going to have to pay for that with some productivity initiatives in the future. And that's what Paul and his team are looking at now. But clearly, some short-term headwinds from a lot of what you've seen published. Well, I'll jump in and just say that you go back to our financial framework, our goal, the one we launched back in December, kind of -- we're aiming for mid-single-digit revenue growth on average in most years. And that would imply a few points at least of volume and a couple of points of pricing. So we think that, that is the right equation for us where we can then leverage it and drive productivity so that we have op income growth that's greater than the revenue growth. So, that's pretty much the model. And I would expect in '24 that to play out. Sure. I mean, this is going to take a little bit more time. The way to look at this, Ravi, is as we've entered Q2, we've got a lot more visibility now than we did in Q1. And our current estimates assume that the cleanup activity continues into October and then kind of moderates meaningfully during the fourth quarter. Future periods are going to be impacted by ongoing legal costs and may be impacted by other items as well such as fines and penalties, which are currently unknown. And frankly, we can't estimate. So what I would encourage is that maybe you look at the 10-Q disclosures later today related to the matter, we kind of go into a fair amount of detail of the types of things that could continue to impact us in the future. And we'll continue to monitor this and keep you all apprised as things change. But right now, the largest part of what we're accruing for has really been the environmental cleanup costs. And the visibility now is we think as we get into October, things really start to wind down, and that's the basis of these estimates. Now I'll take a moment and just say, we've started the process, like I said in my prepared remarks of seeking recovery from third parties, and we are going to start here in the third quarter, making claims against our insurance -- making claims against our insurance policies. So that's going to take some time to play out. And we're probably talking quarters, not months. Yes, thanks. We continue doing some share repurchasing in the second quarter similar levels to what we had done in the first. And again, we get back to what our model is and nothing changes. The first thing we do with our returns is reinvest back in the business to drive safety, resiliency, growth productivity. And this year, that is going to be $2.2 billion of CapEx spend. After that, we pay a dividend in that 35% to 40% payout ratio range. Sometimes it goes outside of that a little bit, but we'll grow back into it. And then with the remaining excess cash, we've been very mindful of our leverage, we return that cash to shareholders through the repurchase of shares. This year is a little unique in that we have signaled we're going to do that CSR purchase. The timing of that is also becoming clearer. That is likely toward the end of Q1 of next year of closing should the citizens vote affirmatively in Cincinnati to go forward. So we will be mindful of that because part of that purchase will be coming from internally generated cash flow. That doesn't mean we're stopping share repurchase, but it will definitely be at much lower levels than we've seen in the prior couple of years where we were doing $3 billion a year or more. We've got to do different things if we want to grow. Yes. So this is a great example. That's right. The single biggest lever we've got right now is to absorb volume growth into our current cost structure. So, that is really going to provide a bit of peel out from where we are today. And then I think at the same time, Paul and his team, in particular, are working hard on productivity initiatives because we've dug service out of the hole we were in, maybe not in the most productive way. We've been growing a lot of costs and resources to accelerate the network. So now there's a lot of opportunity to take the costs out and start driving productivity again. And that's what Paul and his team are heavily focused on. We're not going to give an OR projection here or the pace at which we're going to improve. There are a lot of levers. And you touched on most of them. RPU being a big piece. We'll see what happens here with coal pricing in the future. That's been a driver. The same thing with fuel. That's going to be -- it's been very supportive fuel to our OR in the first half, and it's going to be equally negative now here in the back half. So that dynamic could change going forward. So we're not in a position to project where the OR goes in the next 12 or 18 months. But I will tell you, we are coiled up with the investments we've made to start driving improvements by taking on volume. We are reading employees to take on volume. Yes. I mean we laid them out. There are some revenue RPU type of headwinds, but we do think that there is volume out there for the taking. And as long as we don't go into an economic downturn, which is we're feeling a little bit better about lately, we think there's some share recapture opportunity that's out there and other areas where we can take the volume on. But yes, we're going to have short-term headwinds. Jason, other income, remember, a big driver of other income is the Company owned -- the returns on company-owned life insurance investments. And here in the first half, we had some pretty good compares because last year, in Q1, Q2, we had losses on those company-owned life insurance policies. So now, we've swung to returns again, which is historically long term, been the more normal. And so the $64 million or so in Q2, which is year-over-year compare on company-owned life insurance will probably not be as big in the back half. So, I'd get back to more back half numbers like you've seen historically in that $20 million to $30 million a quarter range. Yes, Bascom, it's really because of the timing with EP and the uncertainties around. I had mentioned that the accrued balance that sits there today, $287 million of cash has gone out. We've got over $800 million that we had accrued for. So the remaining $500-or-so million, half of that is going to come out in the back half of this year, the other half probably next year, some may slip into 2025 even. Beyond that, we have no visibility to the timing on recoveries. It's unlikely that we'll see any recoveries actually here in 2023. It's a matter of when in 2024, they start to come in. And we'll get back to, again, the insurance process where you can't really ask for insurance coverage on costs you've incurred until you actually incur the expense, meaning the cash goes out. So we're only just now starting to make those claims. So it is going to take several quarters probably before you go through the process and get the free cash flow benefit on the proceeds. I don't want to get into that level of guidance right here."

I will begin with an update on East Palestine and our ongoing focus on safe operations. From the beginning, we have been guided by one principle. We are going to do whatever it takes to make it right for East Palestine and the surrounding areas. We are claiming the site safely, thoroughly and with urgency. We are assisting families supporting local businesses and non-profits and investing in long-term projects for the area's future prosperity. I went to East Palestine in the immediate aftermath of the derailment and have returned almost every week to meet with members of the community and monitor our work. I've been in churches, schools, meeting halls, businesses and living rooms, asking how Norfolk Southern can use our resources to help the community recover and thrive. I'm proud of our people and our progress. I'm also proud of the crew and the locomotive that night. According to the National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report, they were operating the train properly and took the right actions after receiving the alarm, the wayside detectors work, and there were no track defects. As the NTSB continues its work, we have already begun to take actions designed to further enhance safety, such as installing additional safety sensors, accelerating the deployment of advanced early detection technologies and increasing safety training for first responders. The firefighters and other emergency responders who ran to the scene that night in East Palestine have our deepest gratitude and respect. They are heroes. We also appreciate the leadership of local, state, and federal officials and agencies in response to these events. We share their goals of helping people affected by the derailment and finding evidence-based approaches to rail safety. We are a safe railroad. In 2022, Norfolk Southern had fewer derailments than any other year in the last two decades, and our rate of employee in injuries was the lowest in a decade. We strive to do better. While events of the last few months have focused national attention on rail safety, the remits at Norfolk Southern in the first quarter declined from the same period last year, continuing a trend of improvement. We are going to learn from this accident to become an even safer company. I have been personally engaged in Washington to support specific federal legislative provisions to enhance safety. As the initial learnings from East Palestine have made clear, meaningful enhancements will require the combined efforts of the entire industry, railcar owners, leasing companies, equipment manufacturers and the railroad companies. Norfolk Southern intends to be a leader in that effort, and we embrace that role. Turning to Slide 4. At our Investor Day last December, we chartered a new course for sustainable long-term value creation. We were the first railroad to launch a strategy that starts with safe, reliable, and resilience service for our customers. Balance with smart sustainable growth and productivity improvements. With everything we do, we will focus on long-term priorities and value rather than just the short-term. I'm reaffirming my commitment to that vision and building the team to drive that strategy. This new direction is even more important today, and we have been working to execute our industry-leading strategy. Our customer-centric operations-driven approach supports both service and safety and will enable us to grow with our customers sustainably for the long-term. Our powerful network, desirable geographic footprint, best-in-class channel partners and strong relationships with our valued customers, uniquely position Norfolk Southern to deliver on our strategy. When we spoke in January, service was the best in two years, customers were noticing and December volumes were at 52 weeks highs, define typical seasonality. Consistent with the long-term vision, after the East Palestine and Springfield derailments, we made two decisions. We knew would have a near-term impact on service, capacity, and revenue. First, we are pulling up the tracks at the derailment site in East Palestine and removing the impact of soil in response to feedback from the community and the EPA. Since March 3rd, we have had only one track at a time in service with trains running at restricted speed through this section of our busiest quarter. This mainline segment links Chicago to Eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York, and there's a strength of our franchise. We anticipate completing the remediation in having both tracks of service by early June. Second, out of an abundance of caution, in early March, we accelerated the analysis of train makeup rules as part of our broader efforts to improve safety, service, and productivity, which we began implementing soon thereafter. As a result of these purposeful actions on our part, train capacity was limited initially. Paul will address this in greater detail. We are restoring capacity as we dial in this new set of processes. We do not anticipate any meaningful long-term impacts on service, capacity or cost structure. These were the right things to do. They were also the best decisions to enhance our ability to deliver on our long-term strategy of delivering resilient service. It will take some time to build resiliency, and we're making progress. We continue to invest to ensure we have the right team and resources where they are needed to provide our customers with safe best-in-class service. As we shared when we announced our new strategy last December, we aren't focused on managing short-term OR with actions that will undermine our longer-term goals. We strive for more. Our longer-term commitment to competitive margins will be balanced with other important financial measures such as growth in revenue, EPS, and ROIC. Putting that plan into action, we are making strategic investments in the near-term that position us to deliver long-term value. One of those investments is to maintain the people and resources we need through economic downturns. This will allow us to respond more quickly and capture revenue growth when markets recover. Even more significant, resilient service enables our customers to confidently build rail into their supply chains and supports highway to rail conversions. We will use temporary downturns to invest in training, creating career opportunities for the craft railroaders who are the heart and soul of Norfolk Southern. I enjoy the time I spend in crew rooms and have made it my personal goal to listen to my craft colleagues about what they need. I won't stop working until our service and safety culture is the acknowledged model for the industry. Our strategy is a better way forward for the industry. It's a better way to deliver value to shareholders, and it's the right thing to do for our employees, our customers, and the communities we serve. Before I turn it over to Mark, I'd like to take a moment and recognize our customers who have shown a tremendous amount of support throughout the challenges of the first quarter. I've received countless calls, letters, and e-mails from customers recognizing Norfolk Southern's positive response and dedication to making it right. It's made me proud to be part of the Norfolk Southern team and truly demonstrates the deep partnerships we have forged with our customers. I'll now turn it over to Mark.\nMark George: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On Page 6, you will see our key financial results for the quarter. The top row represents the GAAP measures. On the second row are the current cost estimates and impacts related to the Eastern Ohio incident and response. On the third row, you see the adjusted results. The $387 million of expense that we recorded for the incident includes costs associated with the cleanup of the site, community support and restoration payments, legal and advisory expenses, and a preliminary estimate of claims and settlements. It is important to note that no insurance or other recoveries are assumed in these estimates and that credits associated with these recoveries will be determined and recorded in future periods. Similarly, as we learn more, one can expect future estimates of cost will result in revisions to the accruals in subsequent quarters. The two rows at the bottom reflect the variances versus Q1 of 2022. GAAP earnings were down year-over-year due to the Eastern Ohio cost that were recorded. The adjusted variances at the bottom reflects 7% revenue growth that Ed will detail shortly, along with adjusted net income growth of 8% and adjusted EPS growth of 13%. Adjusted operating expense were up 11% in the quarter, and Slide 7 details the drivers, which I will walk through now. Adjusted operating expenses were up $204 million or 11%, with the majority of the increase being driven by inflation and incremental service-related costs. Inflationary pressures are visible in pretty much all P&L categories, most notably in comp and bend from last year's wage settlements. In comp and bend, we also saw an increase in headcount as we continue to build our T&E resources to help us become more reliable and resilient in support of our long-term strategy for growth. Purchase service growth is also impacted by inflation, but is also driven in part by technology investments, including projects aimed at improving productivity, operational executability, and enhanced safety. The service disruptions triggered by the Eastern Ohio derailment, the associated shutdown of our main line in a critical corridor as well as the acceleration of our enhanced train makeup rules is having an incremental impact on costs, resulting in slower network speeds that inflates equipment rents, while also driving a meaningful increase in material costs, in part because we strategically work to bring locomotives into service from our stored fleet to help accelerate our network. Moving to depreciation, please recall that we gave guidance on depreciation headwind this year from a recently completed roadway depreciation study, and that contributed $8 million of headwind in the quarter, and that will continue as a headwind in subsequent quarters. We also drove fuel efficiency by another 1% improvement in the quarter versus last year. Moving to the P&L results below operating income on Slide 8, and I'll talk to the adjusted variances here in the right-hand columns. Operating income grew 1%. Other income was $56 million, aided by favorable returns on company-owned life insurance and that helped adjusted pretax income grow 7%. Net income grew 8% and EPS grew 13% in the quarter. Turning to free cash flow and shareholder distributions on Slide 9. Cash from operations was $179 million higher, in part from changes in working capital, while free cash flow was $140 million higher than last year, and we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders with a strong dividend, supplemented by share repurchases. Let me turn now to Paul for his review on operations.\nPaul Duncan: Thank you, Mark. I'll begin on Slide 11. On my first earnings call as Chief Operating Officer this January, I shared my intention to begin every update with safety. This reflects the priority we put on the topic. Everything we do starts with safety. At the time, my leadership team and I were in the middle of kickoff meetings with operations leaders across our network. Alan joined us for some of those meetings. Our marketing leadership team participated in others. We started every meeting with safety discussing that it is an enterprise priority. We are investing in our leadership this year with all of our ballast line supervisors in starting every conversation with safety. As leaders, we set the tone and tone influences culture. We are also investing in the development of community responders, including a new regional training facility in Bellevue, Ohio. We are a safe railroad and constantly challenge ourselves to do even better. We will continue to work with our employees and community partners on safety-related initiatives that further enhance our culture in these areas. I'll note specific steps we are taking to enhance safety after reviewing the NTSB's preliminary report on the East Palestine derailment, including adding 200 more hot bearing detectors onto our network, expanding our network of acoustic bearing detectors and accelerating the deployment of digital train inspection portals, our most advanced safety technology, which we described in greater detail during our Investor Day. On Slide 12, you will see our safety metrics. As Alan noted, in 2022, Norfolk Southern had the lowest rate of employee injuries in a decade with a 1.01 frequency ratio. We began 2023 with a 0.89 injury frequency ratio and continue to work so all of our colleagues go home to their families in the same condition they arrive. We are also making strides to reduce our FRA accident rate. We are showing one additional graph this quarter, reflecting the frequency of accidents that occur on mainline tracks. While we strive to reduce all accidents, mainline accidents tend to have greater impact to the communities that we serve. These have generally been flat with year-over-year improvement through Q1 compared to Q1 2022. Our investment in infrastructure is paying off, and we're confident our focus on equipment inspection technology will continue to drive our mainline accident rate lower. Turning to Slide 13, I'll provide an update on our overall service. In the first quarter, we accelerated the analysis of train makeup rules as part of our broader efforts to improve safety, service and productivity. We began implementing enhancements soon thereafter, resulting in a significant short-term impact on velocity and the performance of our railroad. However, these changes were the right thing to do and have increased the reliability of our network and also allowed us to become even more productive. For example, we are now operating 50% more Merchandise trains with distributed power than this same time last year. This was only possible things to our continuing commitment to locomotive modernization, another example of how we are investing in long-term value. As Alan explained, we also made the decision to pull up the two mainline tracks at the derailment site and remove all impacted soil. From March 3rd, until the remediation is complete, currently expected in early June, we are only operating one track at reduced speeds through that section of our busy Premier Corridor. We have everything we need to recover from this temporary setback to our momentum. Remember that prior to the derailment, our service was the best it had been in two years. As we dial in our train makeup enhancements, we are already seeing improvements to our network in recent weeks. We will continue to work through the backlog and do not expect any meaningful long-term impacts. We are eager to get back to the execution of our service-oriented strategy. Transitioning to Slide 14. As we invest in the people and resources we need to execute our strategy and become more resilient, we still have about one-third of our high-end locations below our minimum staffing target based on anticipated demand. We continue to hire at a strong pace and have a robust pipeline of trainees in place. We are employing incentives to attract candidates in targeted locations, and we are taking a series of steps to provide immediate support where it is needed. For example, we are leveraging our go teams and temporary transfers in critical areas as we continue to restore the network. Moving to Slide 15 for our productivity update. Starting with locomotives, we maintained progress in the quarter on keeping locomotive velocity well above last year's levels. The overall Train & Engine workforce productivity metric remains below last year due to the elevated pipeline of conductor trainees as well as maintaining capacity in support of service and future growth. As we have discussed, an essential aspect of our balanced strategy for service, productivity and growth is to provide resilient service through economic downturns and times of volume uncertainty. This represents a deliberate strategic investment to maintain capacity in support of service and future growth. Lastly, our modernized locomotive fleet and fuel efficiency initiatives produced another quarter of record fuel productivity. This is another area where we will continue to invest to drive benefits for our shareholders, customers, and the communities we serve. I'll now turn it over to Ed Elkins.\nClaude Elkins: Thanks, Paul, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'm starting on Slide 17, where our results for the quarter speak to the benefits of our diverse portfolio in that we were able to leverage strong market conditions in our Merchandise and Coal markets to offset weaker conditions in our Intermodal markets. This enabled year-over-year growth in revenue and revenue per unit in the first quarter. As you can see, overall volume was flat, but total revenue increased 7% to $3.1 billion due to higher fuel surcharges and positive mix, which more than offset lower volume in storage revenue in Intermodal. Volume and revenue were strongest in January when our service product was the best it has been in two years, and the truck market was showing signs of rebalancing. Volume and revenue decelerated throughout the quarter as service disruptions impacted our ability to meet customer demand in key markets and the truck market continued to deteriorate. Our performance in January demonstrates that a customer-centric operations-driven approach can yield significant value for our customers and our shareholders. Within Merchandise, volume growth of 5% was led by strength in sand, automotive, grain and aggregates markets. These gains were partially offset by weakness in demand for plastics and for pulp board. Volume improvement was the largest driver of double-digit revenue growth in Merchandise this quarter, followed by higher fuel prices and price gains. Intermodal markets were notably weaker this quarter, particularly within our domestic lines of business where a weak freight environment and a weakening truck sector combined to drive a 4% volume decline year-over-year. International Intermodal was a bright spot this quarter with volumes improving 9% year-over-year on higher demand for IPI services, even as overall imports fell, which helped to mitigate some of the domestic declines. Intermodal revenue benefited from higher fuel surcharges and price this quarter. However, not enough to overcome the negative impacts of lower storage revenue and lower domestic volume, which drove a 5% decline in revenue versus the prior period. Now I'd note that the combination of improving international IPI volumes and declining Intermodal storage revenue is a strong indication that supply chain congestion is rapidly unwinding in the U.S. Coal shipments in the first quarter were up 5% year-over-year, led by export, which is currently experiencing continued high levels of demand as well as greater Coal supply in our service territory to meet that demand. Volume growth was muted somewhat by year-over-year declines in utility Coal due to depressed natural gas prices and mild winter weather. Coal revenue was up 13% in the first quarter, driven by higher volumes, fuel surcharge, and price gains. Now moving to Slide 18. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2023, we expect near-term headwinds to pressure volume and revenue throughout the second quarter. However, we are optimistic that our service product will be much improved in the back half of the year, positioning us to return to growth when market conditions permit. Additionally, we are walking on to the field today with the best marketing team in the business. And this team is working hard to identify new avenues to growth in the form of new markets to serve and new products to deliver. Even in a decelerating economy, we know that we can offer exceptional value to customers seeking to reduce their overall spend on transportation and reduce their carbon footprint. As we look at the rest of the year, Merchandise growth will be led by automotive shipments, supported by the forecasted 5% growth in U.S. light vehicle production for the remaining quarters of 2023. Also contributing to growth in automotive shipments is a backlog of shippable ground counts that we will work through as our service improves. We also expect strong volume improvement in our metals market where improved equipment cycle times will enable us to serve unmet demand. Partially offsetting expected growth will be weakness in our chemicals markets where certain segments, like plastics, are experiencing weaker demand. Facility downtime and increased pipeline capacity will also drive year-over-year declines in shipments of crude oil and natural gas liquids. Within our Intermodal markets, volume in 2023 will be largely dependent on economic conditions, particularly the health of the American consumer. Currently, we see headwinds from excess truck capacity, replenished inventories, and a challenging consumer economy, and these headwinds are likely to persist throughout the second quarter, negatively impacting volume, particularly in our domestic lines of business. Looking at the back half of '23, clearly, the economic conditions remain uncertain. We see continued weakness in the housing market, which negatively impacts demand for furniture, home appliances, electronics, all those things that want to move in a container. That market has not rebalanced as we anticipated earlier this year with spot and contract truck rates continuing to fall throughout the first quarter. So the timing of the rebalancing will have a large impact on our volume outlook. Additionally, our domestic partners outlook for the second half of '23 has dimmed somewhat. International Intermodal shipments will be driven by demand for IPI, which is a function of import volumes, which is declining and supply chain fluidity, which is improving. Fluidity has returned to supply chains faster than we expected, which will be a tailwind to volumes, but will negatively impact Intermodal storage revenue for the remainder of this year. Taken together, we are optimistic for our Intermodal business to overcome these near-term challenges and to finish the year with momentum to realize the long-term potential of this market. We have the best Intermodal partners in the industry. and our team is working hard to ensure that we are positioned for success with them as the market turns. Lastly, volume in our Coal business for the remainder of '23 will be up versus '22 with growth in export Coal shipments more than offsetting expected declines in utility Coal. Strength in export Coal markets will be driven by new Coal production coming online at NS-served mines and sustained international demand for U.S. sourced Coal. However, the expected increase in volume will be more than offset by anticipated lower revenue per unit due to lower seaborne Coal prices and reduced fuel surcharge revenue. The utility outlook is highly dependent upon weather and natural gas pricing, which is currently expected to average less than $3 per million BTU in '23, a more than 50% decrease from last year. In addition, stockpiles are currently at increased levels, which further pressures demand for utility Coal shipments. Overall, we have a cautious outlook for the remainder of '23. Improving service levels will be a tailwind, but persistent market headwinds and a stubbornly loose truck market will temper our ability to grow in the near-term. Overall, growth in 2023 will be dependent on the macro environment. We continue to put our efforts on things that we can control to deliver on our customer-centric operations-driven strategy. We are making the investments required to deliver compelling logistics value for the long-term through a simple, reliable, and efficient customer experience. Lastly, on Slide 19, I'd like to highlight a recent industrial development success that demonstrates the long-term value of locating along Norfolk Southern lines. Scout Motors, an independent U.S. company backed by Volkswagen Group is locating a new manufacturing plant in Blythewood, South Carolina and a site served by Norfolk Southern. In Phase 1, this new plant will produce more than 200,000 new electric vehicles and create over 4,000 permanent jobs. The $2 billion investment by Scout will revive an iconic brand that last produced vehicles in 1980, and we couldn't be happier that Scout selected a site served by Norfolk Southern. We look forward to serving their business by the end of 2026. Before I close, I'd like to say thank you to our customers who have supported us through the challenges of this first quarter. We appreciate every opportunity that they give us to participate in their supply chains, and we look forward to successfully growing these partnerships. We are confident in our ability to realize long-term growth and we look forward to delivering results for our customers and for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Alan to bring us home.\nAlan Shaw: Thanks, Ed. This week marks the end of my first year as CEO. As I reflect on the year more broadly and especially the last few months, I appreciate that adversity reveals character. That's true for people, and it's true for organizations. I'm inspired by my colleagues at Norfolk Southern, who are rising to the challenge of doing the right thing. We are anchored by our values and driven by our responsibility to safely deliver the goods and materials that move the U.S. economy. Moving forward, Norfolk Southern will be known for safe operations and for delivering service, productivity, and growth through our pioneering new strategy. Our response in East Palestine will be a source of pride for years to come, and we will be a stronger company, setting the pace for our industry. Whether it's our commitment to the citizens of East Palestine, our employees, our customers, or to all the communities in which we operate every day. When we do the next right thing, we deliver long-term value creation for our shareholders. We will now open the call to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good morning. Thanks for the rundown there. Just maybe Alan or Ed, you talked about rebounding service levels, yet volumes are down 8% quarter-to-date, much worse than the flat in the first quarter. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the timing from when you get back to that normal seed through this quarter? And then you mentioned you're still about a third of the target levels or below the target level of your T&E targets in some regions. Third seems awfully big, given the focus you've had on hiring people. Maybe talk about the sustained cost impact and the ability to get there? Thanks.\nAlan Shaw: Hey, Ken, thanks for the question. Yes, we're in the process of recovering service. And I want to make it really clear. We had a great service product to the close last year and in January. And you saw the attendant impact on our volumes, right? It proves that our unique vision, our unique focus and our unique strategy works in this industry. And we remain committed to executing on that. In the aftermath of East Palestine, we had some tough decisions to make. And we made those decisions knowing full well that it would have a near-term impact on our service and our productivity and our growth, but they were the right decisions to make, because they align with our core values, and they are long aligned with our long-term focus as a customer-centric operations-driven service organization. The same operating team and the same marketing team that delivered that exceptional service product late last year and beginning of this year is in place now. And we're in much better shape with our resources. And so I don't think the climb out will be nearly as long. Certainly, we want to get the track back in place in East Palestine. And that, as Paul noted, will probably happen in the beginning of June. And so I think as we move into and through the third quarter, you're going to see us in a position to deliver that exceptional service product that customers have become accustomed to receiving from Norfolk Southern. Ed, do you want to talk about what you're hearing from customers on that?\nClaude Elkins: Sure. And I appreciate the question. really, it's a story of a couple of different markets. We've been very fortunate, frankly, that we've been able to preserve a large amount of fluidity in our Intermodal network. We think that's really important as we move forward here as we work off this excess inventory because bid season is happening right now, and we will see our customers come through this with some very strong performance later on the year. So we're banking on the come, so to speak, in terms of our customers' performance on the Intermodal side. The consumer market is clearly still deteriorating. And you've heard that elsewhere, you read it in the Wall Street Journal. On the industrial side, there's still lots of demand out there for us to meet with additional capacity as we improve our service. And we're bullish on that front.\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Amit, please check and see if your line is muted. Okay. We will come back to him. Our next question will be from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed.\nChris Wetherbee: Thanks good morning. There's two comments that you made in the prepared remarks that I wanted to just maybe see if we can get a little bit more color on. Alan, you talked about, I think, over the long run, no long-term impacts from the derailment on service capacity or cost structure. So really wanted to sort of explore that cost structure dynamic and maybe how you're thinking about that? And then Mark, you talked a little bit about the potential, I think, for future estimates of cost that could result in accruals. I think that's obviously a very important dynamic as we're thinking about the long-term impact as the derailment. So if we could just sort of think about the longer-term outlook and what it might mean from a cost perspective going forward, so we can get an idea of sort of what the run rate earnings power of this network is going forward? That would be very helpful.\nAlan Shaw: Yes. Chris, as I've talked about cost structure and service going forward. It was in the context of our new train marshaling rules, which did initially have an impact because we could frankly, we got really conservative on our trained marshaling rules based on the environment and recent events. As we are dialing that in and analyzing each train symbol on each line segment, we're adding capacity back into the network. And as Paul noted, we're using this as an opportunity to significantly increase our use of distributed power, which will frankly ultimately enhance our productivity and our train length. So I feel very confident that we did the right thing at that time, and it's going to generate long-term benefit for NS and our customers and our shareholders, and that's kind of what our strategic vision is all about. Mark?\nMark George: Yes. So on East Palestine, Chris, as of the first quarter point in time, we made an estimate of the various elements of costs that we'd be facing and came up with that $387 million. The preponderance of that really is related to the environmental cleanup efforts and future environmental remediation activities. And also, it's important to note that because of the EPA involvement in all of this, there is likely to be oversight costs that we have to reimburse the government for as well. So that's all part of the estimate. There are things that are -- we could not estimate and therefore, could not record in the quarter, stuff really related to legal, I'll give you just one example with the Ohio Attorney General and the three funds that are going to be established. There was no way to estimate that. So that would be an example of something in the future that would come. So as we learn of new things and are able and realize that they're probable and they're estimable, we will record those. But at the same time, I remind you that there are no insurance recovery estimates that have been recorded at this point. In fact, of that $387 million, cash out the door has really been $55 million, okay? So most of this is accrual based on estimates. Insurance filings will really be done as we incur the costs from a cash perspective. So down the road, we'll be assembling our filings for the insurance companies and seeking reimbursement, and we will record those in due course as a credit. And so with regard to predictability or estimating those, it's impossible if we could estimate and we probably would have booked them already. So we'll just have to keep reporting these out as we go in the subsequent quarters.\nAlan Shaw: Yes. And I'll add nor does our estimate include any potential recovery from other parties as well.\nMark George: Correct, correct. Yes.\nOperator: Our next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nScott Group: Thanks. Mark, the materials costs were really high. Any color on where that goes from here? Just any thoughts on the operating ratio from here? And then separately, Ed, the Merchandise yields actually fell a little bit from Q4 to Q1. I thought Q1 has a lot of repricing. I just would have thought Merchandise yields would have been better. Any color there? Thank you.\nMark George: Yes. So on materials, Scott, the impact from what we had early in the year had a pretty profound sudden impact on the network. We needed to get locomotives to help dig us out, so we basically took locomotives out of stored status. Some of them required a lot of work to get them rejuvenated so they could help take us out. I think there will be some incremental material costs that will linger here in the second quarter and should ease in the back half of the year as we see our network fluidity improve. Ed?\nClaude Elkins: Sure. Our core pricing remained very strong in the first quarter. As a matter of fact, we exceeded our expectations in several markets, including in Coal and Intermodal. I think what you're really seeing on the Merchandise side is a mix issue. We noted that plastics was weak and some of our other chemicals. A lot of it goes into housing and everybody knows what's happening to the housing markets right now. It's a challenge, but that's a mix issue. Our core pricing story remains very much intact and in fact, I'm very bullish for it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed.\nBrandon Oglenski: Yes, good morning. And thanks for taking the question. Paul, can you talk to the train makeup changes that you guys discussed and how that had a near-term impact, but what's going to change in the future that allows you to get back to your productivity targets?\nAlan Shaw: Hey Brandon, I'm going to cover that because that's something that Paul and I discussed at length. As I noted, we had some tough decisions to make in the first quarter. And the train makeup rules was -- decision was based on the ongoing environment of recent events. Paul and I had a discussion in early March, and we decided we were going to get really conservative on our train makeup rules until we had an opportunity to deeply and thoroughly analyze each train symbol over each line segment. That created some congestion on our network because it had an initial impact on reducing capacity on our network. Paul and his team are going through each train symbol, each line segment, doing the analysis, looking at the physics, figuring out the right configuration of the train and the right configuration for the locomotives. And as we do that, we're adding capacity back in. As Paul noted, that includes expanded use of distributed power, which is going to support our productivity initiatives going forward. And ultimately, we are convinced that it's not going to have an impact on service. It's not going to have an impact on capacity and in many cases, it's probably going to improve productivity.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you, Alan.\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Sorry about earlier. I'm clearly still learning how to use a telephone. So appreciate you calling in me again. Alan, I wanted to ask about how the remediation efforts are going. I think the EPA update the few pages that they put out a few weeks ago was pretty positive in terms of the progress that you guys are making. And just related to that, what do you think the volume impact has been? Because you were at this kind of 130,000 to 140,000 weekly carloads. Obviously, that's dipped down, just helpful to think -- do you think there's a snapback in early June? And then Mark, I'm also trying to understand the impact fuel has on yield and operating income. It's been volatile to the downside, and I'm just thinking that maybe it turns into a headwind on OI dollars as you progress through the year. Any thoughts around that in terms of what the headwind or tailwind or neutrality is from fuel on operating income as we progress through the year? Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Yes, Amit, I'll handle the first part of your three-part one question. Yes, when we -- when this happened, we said we're going to stay true to our core values, and we're going to do what's right. And that means we're going to do what's right for the long-term best interest of Norfolk Southern and East Palestine. And frankly, our response in East Palestine has reinforced my conviction that taking a long-term view, the best interest of your shareholders, your customers, your employees and the communities you serve, as a customer-centric operations-driven service organization is the right vision and the right strategy for Norfolk Southern. And so I met with the Head of the EPA, and I made my personal commitment that we were going to do more than less. And that's what you're seeing. We've got 300 people on the ground whether they are employees or contractors, seven days a week, and I sincerely appreciate their sacrifices and their willingness to do this, and frankly, the sacrifices of their families as well. And they're intently focused on the environmental remediation. They're intently focused on community assistance and they're intently focused on helping the community thrive. And we've reached a major milestone about week and half ago, where we finished the remediation under one track and have started on another track. And that was something that we did, didn't necessarily need to be done because we had an environmentally acceptable solution in place, but that was something that we did based on feedback that I received from the citizens of the community and from the EPA. Ed, do you want to talk about what you're seeing in the markets and the volume impact of the slower network but also the macro trends?\nClaude Elkins: Sure, absolutely. And it's kind of a -- I'll try to answer it in two parts. Let's go to the industrial side first. Clearly, as we accelerate our network, work off the backlog of inventory at our yards, we're going to be able to present our customers with more capacity. And we know that there are customers that are ready to load that additional capacity right now whether it's in the steel markets, whether it's in the scrap markets. It's certainly in the auto markets. And I would also mention our ag and our Coal networks, which also are going to benefit from increased fluidity and sustained demand, we believe going forward. On the Intermodal side, it's really a demand story. There's been what I would call a tremendous amount of demand destruction out there in the general economy, and we're seeing that manifest itself in our containerized volume opportunities. But look, we're not sitting on our hands here. We got, like I said, the best team in the industry working right now to figure out how to deliver more value for our customers in the form of additional lanes and additional products and services that we can successfully execute in the marketplace and we'll be ready when the market rotates here.\nAlan Shaw: And you and Paul are also resizing the Intermodal network based on current demand.\nClaude Elkins: That's right.\nMark George: Look, it's not a question of when the volume and the demand from the U.S. consumers are going to recover. It's when it happens, right? And so that's part of our strategy is to invest through the downturn so that we're there for the upside.\nClaude Elkins: Yes. And that's what makes it, frankly, so important that we've been able to insulate for the most part the Intermodal network from many of the disruptions that we've seen here today. And that's very purposeful on our part because we want our customers to have confidence as they go to their customers and sell Norfolk Southern's value.\nAlan Shaw: Mark, I think there was a.\nMark George: Yes. So just real quick on fuel. We did have a lag benefit. While fuel prices are coming down, we had a lag benefit on the surcharge that provided some tailwind to us in this quarter, but that is going to quickly diminish and turn into headwinds as we go through the back of the year if the fuel curves hold true.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nJordan Alliger: Hi, I think you addressed this in some ways, but I'm just curious, the derailment and the impact on the various service metrics. Has it had an impact on the marketing side of the equation as you go out and try to sell business? And then sort of similarly, in terms of the operational stuff you guys were trying to do as you went into this year around TOP|SPG, et cetera, has had an impact on some of the initiatives away from the remediation efforts? Thanks.\nClaude Elkins: Speaking to our -- to the customer side of the business, there's -- we really have not had a more supportive group of constituents out there than our customers. They want us to get the network back up and running. They know that we're doing the right thing, not only for East Palestine but for them. And frankly, we are looking forward to delivering that additional capacity to them very quickly.\nAlan Shaw: Hey Jordan, both Ed and I referenced this in our prepared remarks. We certainly appreciate the support and the outreach from our customers through this. And they're proud of our response. They see what we're doing. They know what we're made of. They know that we do what we say we're going to do, and they're seeing us follow through with that. And so we're going to come out of this stronger and better as a result. Paul, do you want to talk about the interaction between our operating plan and current service?\nPaul Duncan: Oh, absolutely. We're seeing improvements over the last few weeks. And I want to go back to the point that was made around TOP|SPG. TOP|SPG was implemented as a simpler, more executable plan that will provide us a quicker path to improving service, especially when we have major service interruptions. We've seen strong improvements in our Intermodal franchise as of late, building on the momentum out of the TOP|SPG implementation last year that I referenced. Again, right now, this is all about pent-up demand and inventory across the network in our Merchandise space, we're going to continue to work after it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to follow-up with Ed first. You mentioned you had some stronger-than-expected results both in Coal and Intermodal ARPU. Wondering if you could give some thoughts on that as both of those because we have some pretty distinct factors and tailwinds that have been affected them more recently in terms of the export market and the storage fees. And then, Alan, maybe you can just give us a sense of the timing for some of these other public hearings or maybe mile markers that we should be keeping in mind for the NTSB and their investigation, the public hearing of East Palestine, takes your view, things that are pretty much unprecedented. But I think it will still be helpful to hear if there's any sort of time line we should keep on our calendars in terms of when the next updates for these investigations are expected or at least what we should consider the next sort of update when it comes to those things, not just the numbers that you're recording, but the more public-facing side of it? Thank you.\nClaude Elkins: I think that might be a record for nesting questions. All right, Brian. Let's talk about Coal first. We're still seeing strength in pricing, but all the indices have come off the recent highs. And as you know, a lot of our performance is predicated off those forward curves. Low-volatile at 250-ish and API is about 140, U.S. met coal forward curves still have the price above 200 throughout at least the third quarter. So we're feeling pretty good there. I think the real story is on the demand and supply side. We know that China is reopening the Australian coal that's going to revert some trade flows. [indiscernible], which will mean stronger Australian supply will come back, but U.S. met production is increasing 5.4 metric tons. That's new mines and incremental production. And I think most of those tons are going to move export. On the demand side, we're still seeing limited spot demand, but European production has increased about 14% month-over-month in February, and that's due to blast furnaces cranking back up again. And the met coal exports from the U.S. are forecast to increase about 7.5%. Now we can be bullish or we could be bearish about China. I prefer to be bullish. The Chinese Manufacturing PMI Index came in above 52%. That's the highest reading in two years. So I believe that there is some demand there. We know that there's healthy demand from the auto sector. So we feel good about Coal going forward. On the Intermodal side, there's no doubt there's a headwind from the storage piece and as I noted in the prepared remarks, we're seeing those markets -- excuse me, those congestion charges unwind even faster than we expected. Even though we predicted a year ago that they were going to unwind faster, so as those normalize, that's good for volume, as I noted on the IPI side. And think about it this way, for our international volume to grow 9%, that was freight that was moving on the highway last year. And we talked a lot last year about how it was going to revert to the mean when markets normalize, and that's what we're seeing right now.\nAlan Shaw: And Brian, with respect to hearings, the NTSB has announced it may conduct a field here in the summer, as you noted. That date has not yet been finalized. We don't really have anything else scheduled at this point, but that doesn't mean others won't pop up. I met with the Chair of the NTSB just last week and committed our full cooperation with their investigation. And you saw as soon as the NTSB released its preliminary results, we initiated a six-point safety plan. And I'll also note that I've been in D.C. multiple occasions with our elected officials and with our regulators, offering my full-throated support for many of the provisions in the rail safety bills that are out there. We are going to take and we have taken an industry-leading role in advancing these safety initiatives, and we embrace that role.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed. Tom, please check and see if this is muted. Okay. We will come back to him. And our next question will be from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.\nJeffrey Kauffman: Thank you very much. And congratulations in a challenging quarter. I've only got one question. Everyone is trying to figure out, is this a recession? Is this not a recession? Are we heading into a recession? There's a lot of anomalies in your data because of the single track that you're running in a key part of your line and the effect that's having on traffic. But I'd love to hear your view in terms of what's the macro? Where do you believe we're headed? And then kind of how do we back out the effect of your remediation efforts on your own traffic volumes here?\nAlan Shaw: Ed, you're about as tight with our customers as can be. Why don't you talk about what you're hearing?\nClaude Elkins: Sure. I think the one word that describes it best is murkiness, and quite frankly, it doesn't matter whether you're on the consumer side of the coin or on the industrial side, there is a clear line of sight, I think on the industrial markets for a quarter or two of demand. We see that clearly. We also see clearly that there is further deterioration in the truckload markets right now. The real question is the second half of the year. And you have heard from other calls and other entities that probably their outlook has changed somewhat, particularly on the consumer side. But we know that there's still pent-up demand in many of these industrial markets. So I am with you in terms of there's a lot of cross currents out there and a tremendous amount of, again murkiness, but I think the one thing I want to reassure you of is we are positioning ourselves to be ready when these markets do turn and they will turn.\nOperator: And we will come back to Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed.\nThomas Wadewitz: Yes, good morning. Sorry about that. Mark, I wanted to ask you if you could help us think about operating ratio. You've got a lot of moving parts right now. It seems pretty clear when you look at second half maybe or beyond June, you could see some help from the network being more fluid. But how do we think about maybe seasonal pattern in OR relative to what's normal if you think about 2Q versus 1Q? Or if you assume stability in volume or some pickup in volume, how do you think about it in the second half, given that you've got storage charges revenue per car maybe in export? Just a lot of moving parts, but any thoughts on OR would be helpful. Thank you.\nMark George: Yes, thanks for the question, Tom. So look I think inflation is going to be a consistent pressure point for our operating ratio throughout the year. So if we think about that as probably a primary headwind. I'd say that's probably fairly consistent throughout the year. Service has kind of emerged in the first quarter as kind of a bigger headwind, and we were expecting that really to start unwinding here. And the reality is, it may continue to be a headwind for another quarter before that starts to flip and become a tailwind in the second half, assuming service does get back to where we know it should be kind of where we were in that January time frame. Let's not forget, we really did have a very good January and the pain we're seeing here in the quarter is really a result of just February and March. I do believe that we get some volume in the back half of the year, that will represent some tailwind and then I think the third component to bear in mind is fuel, as touched upon earlier, there's been a tailwind here in the first quarter. It might be a modest tailwind in the second quarter. And again, if the fuel curves hold constant, it will become more of a headwind in the back half.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nRavi Shanker: Great, thanks everyone. So just a couple of follow-ups here. Just on the settlement itself, is the message from you that the accrual that you made in 1Q is like the high watermark for how much it's going to cost you and could potentially come down as you get the insurance claims? Or kind of do you think that as the settlements are kind of further legal action or something takes place over the next several years kind of that number could go up. Just trying to mention what you see the number does over time. And also, I think you guys have been the kind of biggest proponents of using mixed freight trends of probably any of the U.S. class 1 railroads. Do you think your ability to run that is going to be slightly diminished kind of post this afternoon? Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Ravi, I think Mark was pretty clear that there are some moving parts in our estimate. There are some things that we know that are going to hit that have not been estimated. That includes additional charges. It also includes the potential for insurance claims and also recoveries from other third parties. What we've given you now is what we're able to accrue. With respect to our mix freight, our new train marshaling rules, which have really enhanced the use of DP are going to allow us to leverage that and drive productivity into that network.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Good morning gentlemen. How should we think about headcount sequentially sort of as we move throughout the year? And you mentioned your below minimum staffing levels in a good part of your network. And then I think before you mentioned this time around, even in the downturn, you're going to think about furloughs a lot differently than you have in the past. I would just like to get a little bit of color on that.\nAlan Shaw: Well, Jason, as we talked about, as we articulated our unique vision for the industry, we are going to invest throughout a downturn because we want to make sure we're there for the upturn. It's not a question of -- if demand returns, it's only a question of when. And we're taking a long-term approach. That's the right thing to do for our shareholders and our customers and our employees and the communities we serve. You want to add a little bit more color on headcount, Mark?\nMark George: Well, yes, I think you see that we've got some trajectory in Paul's slide on our T&E count. We still have over 900 of conductor trainees. And as Paul mentioned, we've got a fair amount of our key locations that are still below our targeted levels. And we want to get to resilient levels in our locations here because we're feeling the pain of not being resilient. We made a promise to be resilient in our new strategy, and we're committed to get there. Unfortunately, we're not there yet, and that's part of why you're seeing us deal with the service challenge here again here in the second quarter. So there's more hiring to do. I think you'll start to see once we get to the levels we determine are appropriate at all of our locations will bring our train e-counts down probably by more than half of where they are today, and that will help us just handle normal attrition. But remember, the targeted numbers for headcount really is a dynamic number. And it does depend on the volume outlook and the demand outlook by area, by commodity type, by lane. So there's really a lot more sophisticated modeling than ever we put into trying to determine what our appropriate levels are. So I think you will continue to see it go up throughout the course of the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Justin Long with Stephens Inc. Please proceed.\nJustin Long: Thanks. I wanted to circle back to Intermodal. If I look at your domestic Intermodal volumes, they've declined sequentially for three consecutive quarters. And obviously, there's weakness in demand that you've talked about, and that's well known. But what's your confidence that first quarter is the bottom in terms of domestic Intermodal volumes? Or is there a potential we see sequential pressure continue into 2Q?\nClaude Elkins: I think it's really going to be predicated by what happens in the overall economy, particularly that consumer sector. We continue to get very strong reports from our customers regarding their ability to win bids going forward. So we're bullish on that part. I think you've heard in other places, though, that many times those bids, the volumes are not manifest themselves at the rate that they were advertised so to speak, because the demand is not there. We're keeping a very close eye on the inventory sales ratio, which is about normal now, there's still maybe a little bit of replenishment to do in certain sectors, but we're close to normal on that front. So we're watching very closely what's happening in the macro economy, I firmly believe that as the market rotates, we will be very well positioned to take advantage of that first growth that comes out of the gate.\nAlan Shaw: Yes, we're aligned with the best channel partners in the industry. And they're investing for growth right now through the soft patch. So we're going to grow with them. And Ed, you were able to take share from truck and the international market.\nClaude Elkins: No, that's exactly right. I would also say we're putting a lot of emphasis on the quality of our Intermodal product at the terminal level. And we are also focused on first and final mile markets and how we can deliver additional value there. So we're very well positioned, we believe to come out of this as the market rotates.\nOperator: Our next question is from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nJames McGarragle: Hey this is James McGarragle on for Walter this morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question though related to the new Scout Motors EV plant in our South Carolina. Are you able to discuss -- any other opportunities like this that you have in the pipeline? And now looking a little longer term, what's the team strategy to bring more of this type of business to the railroad. Is it utilizing excess real estate or selling and eventually improved service product? Or anything else you can speak to? Thanks.\nClaudeElkins: Sure. Absolutely. We have over 600 active projects in our pipeline. And while we can't talk about really any of those, many of them under NDA, what I can tell you is that we are really well positioned to serve the EV and battery ecosystems including support for additional battery manufacturing and as they search for plant sites for manufacturing. The recent Scout Motors assembly plant and proposed reopening of a lithium mine nearby, present some more unique opportunities for us. There's three opportunities really for us to participate in the EV space. One is moving raw materials, one is moving components and one is moving the finished vehicles. We're actively working on all three of those segments.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed.\nDavid Vernon: Hey guys, thanks for fitting me in here. So Mark, can you talk a little bit about the trajectory for cost per employees to kind of go throughout the year, the $140 million level, is that a good number to be modeling off of and then, Ed, if you wouldn't mind, maybe -- I want to take a run at asking you to mention how much the accessorial and surcharge revenue headwind could be inside of the Intermodal ARPU. I just want to make sure we're not confusing the minus 1 in ARPU ex-fuel with core price as opposed to accessorial. And if you could help us to mention that, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nMark George: Yes. David, real quick, on the comp and ben per employee. First quarter was pretty much like I had guided last quarter that $35,000 range. And I do expect it to kind of go sideways from here throughout the course of the year. We will have a step up in the third quarter just from the wage increase that happens for the agreement folks, another 4% here in the third quarter, but that should be mitigated by a wind-down and in some of these service-related costs. So I'd say it's going to be in that $35,000 and change territory throughout the year -- per quarter.\nClaude Elkins: Yes. And on the road side, we made a I think we expect year-over-year declines in accessorial revenue. It really be a significant headwind to revenue or ARPU less fuel for the remainder of '23 and that's going to be offset by some positive impacts from price and volume, our plan. And then beginning in '24, the revenue from accessorial charges is likely to be much more in line with what we've experienced pre-pandemic. First quarter, we took a significant step towards normalization, as I noted.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nJonathan Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Mark, on your Slide 7, when you lay out the OpEx components, I understand there's a lot of inflation associated with that. But is there any way to talk about some of the costs associated with just running the one line at a reduced speed from the beginning of March. What we should think about that cost component to be in the second quarter as you go through June? And do you think that those will really be ring-fenced then into the second quarter with kind of normalization starting in early 3Q?\nMark George: Yes, Jon, I'd say the cost related to the service disruption we've had, they show up a little bit in the comp and ben with regard to recrews and overtime -- they show up in the purchase services as well. Part of that is related to drayage costs that we have to incur, taxis and we've even had to enter into some short-term land leases just to relieve some congestion in the terminal. So that's kind of where you see that play out. And I think that will persist into the second quarter and diminish in the second half. And similarly, in materials is kind of where I'd say the bigger impact was, and that's related to the locomotive restorations that we've had to do here, just to try to provide some immediate relief to the yards and to our line of road to deal with this disruption. So that, again will probably, we'll probably still have some incremental cost of materials in that second quarter and start to diminish in the third and fourth quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nAriel Rosa: Great, good morning. So Alan, you mentioned that the crew is operating properly and there were no track defects in the East Palestine incident. Just curious to hear what do you think could have been done differently to avoid that incident? And then with the six-point plan that you guys have proposed, just wanted to get a sense for what you think the costs are associated with that and kind of what the steps are moving forward. Is that included in the $387 million? Or is that a separate cost? Thanks.\nAlan Shaw: Yes. Obviously, as CEO, I think about that every day. What could we have done better? What could we have done differently? And I asked my team in the immediate aftermath to come up with some solutions. As soon as we got the preliminary results of the NTSB report, you saw the six-point safety plan, which included adding 200 hot box detectors across our network. And I'll note that the spacing of our hot box detectors was already amongst the lowest in the industry. But you know what, we can do better. We're augmenting that. And so we're adding about 25% more hot box detectors. We're partnering with the Georgia Tech Research Institute on next-generation machine visioning, inspection portals. And the first one is going to go up outside of East Palestine. So there are a couple of things that we're doing there. They're all to enhance safety because we're going to continue to focus on doing better. That's our goal.\nMark George: And Ari, the cost related to that six-point plan, it's really largely the capital associated with those incremental hot box detectors, which we said would be in that $50 million neighborhood over the next couple of years. So not a meaningful impact to our overall CapEx budget.\nAriel Rosa: Got it. Okay, thank you for the thoughts.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Alan Shaw for closing comments.\nAlan Shaw: Yes. Thank you for your interest in Norfolk Southern and your time this morning. Have a good morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alan Shaw",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. I will begin with an update on East Palestine and our ongoing focus on safe operations. From the beginning, we have been guided by one principle. We are going to do whatever it takes to make it right for East Palestine and the surrounding areas. We are claiming the site safely, thoroughly and with urgency. We are assisting families supporting local businesses and non-profits and investing in long-term projects for the area's future prosperity. I went to East Palestine in the immediate aftermath of the derailment and have returned almost every week to meet with members of the community and monitor our work. I've been in churches, schools, meeting halls, businesses and living rooms, asking how Norfolk Southern can use our resources to help the community recover and thrive. I'm proud of our people and our progress. I'm also proud of the crew and the locomotive that night. According to the National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report, they were operating the train properly and took the right actions after receiving the alarm, the wayside detectors work, and there were no track defects. As the NTSB continues its work, we have already begun to take actions designed to further enhance safety, such as installing additional safety sensors, accelerating the deployment of advanced early detection technologies and increasing safety training for first responders. The firefighters and other emergency responders who ran to the scene that night in East Palestine have our deepest gratitude and respect. They are heroes. We also appreciate the leadership of local, state, and federal officials and agencies in response to these events. We share their goals of helping people affected by the derailment and finding evidence-based approaches to rail safety. We are a safe railroad. In 2022, Norfolk Southern had fewer derailments than any other year in the last two decades, and our rate of employee in injuries was the lowest in a decade. We strive to do better. While events of the last few months have focused national attention on rail safety, the remits at Norfolk Southern in the first quarter declined from the same period last year, continuing a trend of improvement. We are going to learn from this accident to become an even safer company. I have been personally engaged in Washington to support specific federal legislative provisions to enhance safety. As the initial learnings from East Palestine have made clear, meaningful enhancements will require the combined efforts of the entire industry, railcar owners, leasing companies, equipment manufacturers and the railroad companies. Norfolk Southern intends to be a leader in that effort, and we embrace that role. Turning to Slide 4. At our Investor Day last December, we chartered a new course for sustainable long-term value creation. We were the first railroad to launch a strategy that starts with safe, reliable, and resilience service for our customers. Balance with smart sustainable growth and productivity improvements. With everything we do, we will focus on long-term priorities and value rather than just the short-term. I'm reaffirming my commitment to that vision and building the team to drive that strategy. This new direction is even more important today, and we have been working to execute our industry-leading strategy. Our customer-centric operations-driven approach supports both service and safety and will enable us to grow with our customers sustainably for the long-term. Our powerful network, desirable geographic footprint, best-in-class channel partners and strong relationships with our valued customers, uniquely position Norfolk Southern to deliver on our strategy. When we spoke in January, service was the best in two years, customers were noticing and December volumes were at 52 weeks highs, define typical seasonality. Consistent with the long-term vision, after the East Palestine and Springfield derailments, we made two decisions. We knew would have a near-term impact on service, capacity, and revenue. First, we are pulling up the tracks at the derailment site in East Palestine and removing the impact of soil in response to feedback from the community and the EPA. Since March 3rd, we have had only one track at a time in service with trains running at restricted speed through this section of our busiest quarter. This mainline segment links Chicago to Eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York, and there's a strength of our franchise. We anticipate completing the remediation in having both tracks of service by early June. Second, out of an abundance of caution, in early March, we accelerated the analysis of train makeup rules as part of our broader efforts to improve safety, service, and productivity, which we began implementing soon thereafter. As a result of these purposeful actions on our part, train capacity was limited initially. Paul will address this in greater detail. We are restoring capacity as we dial in this new set of processes. We do not anticipate any meaningful long-term impacts on service, capacity or cost structure. These were the right things to do. They were also the best decisions to enhance our ability to deliver on our long-term strategy of delivering resilient service. It will take some time to build resiliency, and we're making progress. We continue to invest to ensure we have the right team and resources where they are needed to provide our customers with safe best-in-class service. As we shared when we announced our new strategy last December, we aren't focused on managing short-term OR with actions that will undermine our longer-term goals. We strive for more. Our longer-term commitment to competitive margins will be balanced with other important financial measures such as growth in revenue, EPS, and ROIC. Putting that plan into action, we are making strategic investments in the near-term that position us to deliver long-term value. One of those investments is to maintain the people and resources we need through economic downturns. This will allow us to respond more quickly and capture revenue growth when markets recover. Even more significant, resilient service enables our customers to confidently build rail into their supply chains and supports highway to rail conversions. We will use temporary downturns to invest in training, creating career opportunities for the craft railroaders who are the heart and soul of Norfolk Southern. I enjoy the time I spend in crew rooms and have made it my personal goal to listen to my craft colleagues about what they need. I won't stop working until our service and safety culture is the acknowledged model for the industry. Our strategy is a better way forward for the industry. It's a better way to deliver value to shareholders, and it's the right thing to do for our employees, our customers, and the communities we serve. Before I turn it over to Mark, I'd like to take a moment and recognize our customers who have shown a tremendous amount of support throughout the challenges of the first quarter. I've received countless calls, letters, and e-mails from customers recognizing Norfolk Southern's positive response and dedication to making it right. It's made me proud to be part of the Norfolk Southern team and truly demonstrates the deep partnerships we have forged with our customers. I'll now turn it over to Mark. Thanks, Ed. This week marks the end of my first year as CEO. As I reflect on the year more broadly and especially the last few months, I appreciate that adversity reveals character. That's true for people, and it's true for organizations. I'm inspired by my colleagues at Norfolk Southern, who are rising to the challenge of doing the right thing. We are anchored by our values and driven by our responsibility to safely deliver the goods and materials that move the U.S. economy. Moving forward, Norfolk Southern will be known for safe operations and for delivering service, productivity, and growth through our pioneering new strategy. Our response in East Palestine will be a source of pride for years to come, and we will be a stronger company, setting the pace for our industry. Whether it's our commitment to the citizens of East Palestine, our employees, our customers, or to all the communities in which we operate every day. When we do the next right thing, we deliver long-term value creation for our shareholders. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Hey, Ken, thanks for the question. Yes, we're in the process of recovering service. And I want to make it really clear. We had a great service product to the close last year and in January. And you saw the attendant impact on our volumes, right? It proves that our unique vision, our unique focus and our unique strategy works in this industry. And we remain committed to executing on that. In the aftermath of East Palestine, we had some tough decisions to make. And we made those decisions knowing full well that it would have a near-term impact on our service and our productivity and our growth, but they were the right decisions to make, because they align with our core values, and they are long aligned with our long-term focus as a customer-centric operations-driven service organization. The same operating team and the same marketing team that delivered that exceptional service product late last year and beginning of this year is in place now. And we're in much better shape with our resources. And so I don't think the climb out will be nearly as long. Certainly, we want to get the track back in place in East Palestine. And that, as Paul noted, will probably happen in the beginning of June. And so I think as we move into and through the third quarter, you're going to see us in a position to deliver that exceptional service product that customers have become accustomed to receiving from Norfolk Southern. Ed, do you want to talk about what you're hearing from customers on that? Yes. Chris, as I've talked about cost structure and service going forward. It was in the context of our new train marshaling rules, which did initially have an impact because we could frankly, we got really conservative on our trained marshaling rules based on the environment and recent events. As we are dialing that in and analyzing each train symbol on each line segment, we're adding capacity back into the network. And as Paul noted, we're using this as an opportunity to significantly increase our use of distributed power, which will frankly ultimately enhance our productivity and our train length. So I feel very confident that we did the right thing at that time, and it's going to generate long-term benefit for NS and our customers and our shareholders, and that's kind of what our strategic vision is all about. Mark? Yes. And I'll add nor does our estimate include any potential recovery from other parties as well. Hey Brandon, I'm going to cover that because that's something that Paul and I discussed at length. As I noted, we had some tough decisions to make in the first quarter. And the train makeup rules was -- decision was based on the ongoing environment of recent events. Paul and I had a discussion in early March, and we decided we were going to get really conservative on our train makeup rules until we had an opportunity to deeply and thoroughly analyze each train symbol over each line segment. That created some congestion on our network because it had an initial impact on reducing capacity on our network. Paul and his team are going through each train symbol, each line segment, doing the analysis, looking at the physics, figuring out the right configuration of the train and the right configuration for the locomotives. And as we do that, we're adding capacity back in. As Paul noted, that includes expanded use of distributed power, which is going to support our productivity initiatives going forward. And ultimately, we are convinced that it's not going to have an impact on service. It's not going to have an impact on capacity and in many cases, it's probably going to improve productivity. Yes, Amit, I'll handle the first part of your three-part one question. Yes, when we -- when this happened, we said we're going to stay true to our core values, and we're going to do what's right. And that means we're going to do what's right for the long-term best interest of Norfolk Southern and East Palestine. And frankly, our response in East Palestine has reinforced my conviction that taking a long-term view, the best interest of your shareholders, your customers, your employees and the communities you serve, as a customer-centric operations-driven service organization is the right vision and the right strategy for Norfolk Southern. And so I met with the Head of the EPA, and I made my personal commitment that we were going to do more than less. And that's what you're seeing. We've got 300 people on the ground whether they are employees or contractors, seven days a week, and I sincerely appreciate their sacrifices and their willingness to do this, and frankly, the sacrifices of their families as well. And they're intently focused on the environmental remediation. They're intently focused on community assistance and they're intently focused on helping the community thrive. And we've reached a major milestone about week and half ago, where we finished the remediation under one track and have started on another track. And that was something that we did, didn't necessarily need to be done because we had an environmentally acceptable solution in place, but that was something that we did based on feedback that I received from the citizens of the community and from the EPA. Ed, do you want to talk about what you're seeing in the markets and the volume impact of the slower network but also the macro trends? And you and Paul are also resizing the Intermodal network based on current demand. Mark, I think there was a. Hey Jordan, both Ed and I referenced this in our prepared remarks. We certainly appreciate the support and the outreach from our customers through this. And they're proud of our response. They see what we're doing. They know what we're made of. They know that we do what we say we're going to do, and they're seeing us follow through with that. And so we're going to come out of this stronger and better as a result. Paul, do you want to talk about the interaction between our operating plan and current service? And Brian, with respect to hearings, the NTSB has announced it may conduct a field here in the summer, as you noted. That date has not yet been finalized. We don't really have anything else scheduled at this point, but that doesn't mean others won't pop up. I met with the Chair of the NTSB just last week and committed our full cooperation with their investigation. And you saw as soon as the NTSB released its preliminary results, we initiated a six-point safety plan. And I'll also note that I've been in D.C. multiple occasions with our elected officials and with our regulators, offering my full-throated support for many of the provisions in the rail safety bills that are out there. We are going to take and we have taken an industry-leading role in advancing these safety initiatives, and we embrace that role. Ed, you're about as tight with our customers as can be. Why don't you talk about what you're hearing? Ravi, I think Mark was pretty clear that there are some moving parts in our estimate. There are some things that we know that are going to hit that have not been estimated. That includes additional charges. It also includes the potential for insurance claims and also recoveries from other third parties. What we've given you now is what we're able to accrue. With respect to our mix freight, our new train marshaling rules, which have really enhanced the use of DP are going to allow us to leverage that and drive productivity into that network. Well, Jason, as we talked about, as we articulated our unique vision for the industry, we are going to invest throughout a downturn because we want to make sure we're there for the upturn. It's not a question of -- if demand returns, it's only a question of when. And we're taking a long-term approach. That's the right thing to do for our shareholders and our customers and our employees and the communities we serve. You want to add a little bit more color on headcount, Mark? Yes, we're aligned with the best channel partners in the industry. And they're investing for growth right now through the soft patch. So we're going to grow with them. And Ed, you were able to take share from truck and the international market. Yes. Obviously, as CEO, I think about that every day. What could we have done better? What could we have done differently? And I asked my team in the immediate aftermath to come up with some solutions. As soon as we got the preliminary results of the NTSB report, you saw the six-point safety plan, which included adding 200 hot box detectors across our network. And I'll note that the spacing of our hot box detectors was already amongst the lowest in the industry. But you know what, we can do better. We're augmenting that. And so we're adding about 25% more hot box detectors. We're partnering with the Georgia Tech Research Institute on next-generation machine visioning, inspection portals. And the first one is going to go up outside of East Palestine. So there are a couple of things that we're doing there. They're all to enhance safety because we're going to continue to focus on doing better. That's our goal. Yes. Thank you for your interest in Norfolk Southern and your time this morning. Have a good morning."

            "name": "Claude Elkins",
            "content": "Thanks, Paul, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'm starting on Slide 17, where our results for the quarter speak to the benefits of our diverse portfolio in that we were able to leverage strong market conditions in our Merchandise and Coal markets to offset weaker conditions in our Intermodal markets. This enabled year-over-year growth in revenue and revenue per unit in the first quarter. As you can see, overall volume was flat, but total revenue increased 7% to $3.1 billion due to higher fuel surcharges and positive mix, which more than offset lower volume in storage revenue in Intermodal. Volume and revenue were strongest in January when our service product was the best it has been in two years, and the truck market was showing signs of rebalancing. Volume and revenue decelerated throughout the quarter as service disruptions impacted our ability to meet customer demand in key markets and the truck market continued to deteriorate. Our performance in January demonstrates that a customer-centric operations-driven approach can yield significant value for our customers and our shareholders. Within Merchandise, volume growth of 5% was led by strength in sand, automotive, grain and aggregates markets. These gains were partially offset by weakness in demand for plastics and for pulp board. Volume improvement was the largest driver of double-digit revenue growth in Merchandise this quarter, followed by higher fuel prices and price gains. Intermodal markets were notably weaker this quarter, particularly within our domestic lines of business where a weak freight environment and a weakening truck sector combined to drive a 4% volume decline year-over-year. International Intermodal was a bright spot this quarter with volumes improving 9% year-over-year on higher demand for IPI services, even as overall imports fell, which helped to mitigate some of the domestic declines. Intermodal revenue benefited from higher fuel surcharges and price this quarter. However, not enough to overcome the negative impacts of lower storage revenue and lower domestic volume, which drove a 5% decline in revenue versus the prior period. Now I'd note that the combination of improving international IPI volumes and declining Intermodal storage revenue is a strong indication that supply chain congestion is rapidly unwinding in the U.S. Coal shipments in the first quarter were up 5% year-over-year, led by export, which is currently experiencing continued high levels of demand as well as greater Coal supply in our service territory to meet that demand. Volume growth was muted somewhat by year-over-year declines in utility Coal due to depressed natural gas prices and mild winter weather. Coal revenue was up 13% in the first quarter, driven by higher volumes, fuel surcharge, and price gains. Now moving to Slide 18. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2023, we expect near-term headwinds to pressure volume and revenue throughout the second quarter. However, we are optimistic that our service product will be much improved in the back half of the year, positioning us to return to growth when market conditions permit. Additionally, we are walking on to the field today with the best marketing team in the business. And this team is working hard to identify new avenues to growth in the form of new markets to serve and new products to deliver. Even in a decelerating economy, we know that we can offer exceptional value to customers seeking to reduce their overall spend on transportation and reduce their carbon footprint. As we look at the rest of the year, Merchandise growth will be led by automotive shipments, supported by the forecasted 5% growth in U.S. light vehicle production for the remaining quarters of 2023. Also contributing to growth in automotive shipments is a backlog of shippable ground counts that we will work through as our service improves. We also expect strong volume improvement in our metals market where improved equipment cycle times will enable us to serve unmet demand. Partially offsetting expected growth will be weakness in our chemicals markets where certain segments, like plastics, are experiencing weaker demand. Facility downtime and increased pipeline capacity will also drive year-over-year declines in shipments of crude oil and natural gas liquids. Within our Intermodal markets, volume in 2023 will be largely dependent on economic conditions, particularly the health of the American consumer. Currently, we see headwinds from excess truck capacity, replenished inventories, and a challenging consumer economy, and these headwinds are likely to persist throughout the second quarter, negatively impacting volume, particularly in our domestic lines of business. Looking at the back half of '23, clearly, the economic conditions remain uncertain. We see continued weakness in the housing market, which negatively impacts demand for furniture, home appliances, electronics, all those things that want to move in a container. That market has not rebalanced as we anticipated earlier this year with spot and contract truck rates continuing to fall throughout the first quarter. So the timing of the rebalancing will have a large impact on our volume outlook. Additionally, our domestic partners outlook for the second half of '23 has dimmed somewhat. International Intermodal shipments will be driven by demand for IPI, which is a function of import volumes, which is declining and supply chain fluidity, which is improving. Fluidity has returned to supply chains faster than we expected, which will be a tailwind to volumes, but will negatively impact Intermodal storage revenue for the remainder of this year. Taken together, we are optimistic for our Intermodal business to overcome these near-term challenges and to finish the year with momentum to realize the long-term potential of this market. We have the best Intermodal partners in the industry. and our team is working hard to ensure that we are positioned for success with them as the market turns. Lastly, volume in our Coal business for the remainder of '23 will be up versus '22 with growth in export Coal shipments more than offsetting expected declines in utility Coal. Strength in export Coal markets will be driven by new Coal production coming online at NS-served mines and sustained international demand for U.S. sourced Coal. However, the expected increase in volume will be more than offset by anticipated lower revenue per unit due to lower seaborne Coal prices and reduced fuel surcharge revenue. The utility outlook is highly dependent upon weather and natural gas pricing, which is currently expected to average less than $3 per million BTU in '23, a more than 50% decrease from last year. In addition, stockpiles are currently at increased levels, which further pressures demand for utility Coal shipments. Overall, we have a cautious outlook for the remainder of '23. Improving service levels will be a tailwind, but persistent market headwinds and a stubbornly loose truck market will temper our ability to grow in the near-term. Overall, growth in 2023 will be dependent on the macro environment. We continue to put our efforts on things that we can control to deliver on our customer-centric operations-driven strategy. We are making the investments required to deliver compelling logistics value for the long-term through a simple, reliable, and efficient customer experience. Lastly, on Slide 19, I'd like to highlight a recent industrial development success that demonstrates the long-term value of locating along Norfolk Southern lines. Scout Motors, an independent U.S. company backed by Volkswagen Group is locating a new manufacturing plant in Blythewood, South Carolina and a site served by Norfolk Southern. In Phase 1, this new plant will produce more than 200,000 new electric vehicles and create over 4,000 permanent jobs. The $2 billion investment by Scout will revive an iconic brand that last produced vehicles in 1980, and we couldn't be happier that Scout selected a site served by Norfolk Southern. We look forward to serving their business by the end of 2026. Before I close, I'd like to say thank you to our customers who have supported us through the challenges of this first quarter. We appreciate every opportunity that they give us to participate in their supply chains, and we look forward to successfully growing these partnerships. We are confident in our ability to realize long-term growth and we look forward to delivering results for our customers and for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Alan to bring us home. Sure. And I appreciate the question. really, it's a story of a couple of different markets. We've been very fortunate, frankly, that we've been able to preserve a large amount of fluidity in our Intermodal network. We think that's really important as we move forward here as we work off this excess inventory because bid season is happening right now, and we will see our customers come through this with some very strong performance later on the year. So we're banking on the come, so to speak, in terms of our customers' performance on the Intermodal side. The consumer market is clearly still deteriorating. And you've heard that elsewhere, you read it in the Wall Street Journal. On the industrial side, there's still lots of demand out there for us to meet with additional capacity as we improve our service. And we're bullish on that front. Sure. Our core pricing remained very strong in the first quarter. As a matter of fact, we exceeded our expectations in several markets, including in Coal and Intermodal. I think what you're really seeing on the Merchandise side is a mix issue. We noted that plastics was weak and some of our other chemicals. A lot of it goes into housing and everybody knows what's happening to the housing markets right now. It's a challenge, but that's a mix issue. Our core pricing story remains very much intact and in fact, I'm very bullish for it. Sure, absolutely. And it's kind of a -- I'll try to answer it in two parts. Let's go to the industrial side first. Clearly, as we accelerate our network, work off the backlog of inventory at our yards, we're going to be able to present our customers with more capacity. And we know that there are customers that are ready to load that additional capacity right now whether it's in the steel markets, whether it's in the scrap markets. It's certainly in the auto markets. And I would also mention our ag and our Coal networks, which also are going to benefit from increased fluidity and sustained demand, we believe going forward. On the Intermodal side, it's really a demand story. There's been what I would call a tremendous amount of demand destruction out there in the general economy, and we're seeing that manifest itself in our containerized volume opportunities. But look, we're not sitting on our hands here. We got, like I said, the best team in the industry working right now to figure out how to deliver more value for our customers in the form of additional lanes and additional products and services that we can successfully execute in the marketplace and we'll be ready when the market rotates here. That's right. Yes. And that's what makes it, frankly, so important that we've been able to insulate for the most part the Intermodal network from many of the disruptions that we've seen here today. And that's very purposeful on our part because we want our customers to have confidence as they go to their customers and sell Norfolk Southern's value. Speaking to our -- to the customer side of the business, there's -- we really have not had a more supportive group of constituents out there than our customers. They want us to get the network back up and running. They know that we're doing the right thing, not only for East Palestine but for them. And frankly, we are looking forward to delivering that additional capacity to them very quickly. I think that might be a record for nesting questions. All right, Brian. Let's talk about Coal first. We're still seeing strength in pricing, but all the indices have come off the recent highs. And as you know, a lot of our performance is predicated off those forward curves. Low-volatile at 250-ish and API is about 140, U.S. met coal forward curves still have the price above 200 throughout at least the third quarter. So we're feeling pretty good there. I think the real story is on the demand and supply side. We know that China is reopening the Australian coal that's going to revert some trade flows. [indiscernible], which will mean stronger Australian supply will come back, but U.S. met production is increasing 5.4 metric tons. That's new mines and incremental production. And I think most of those tons are going to move export. On the demand side, we're still seeing limited spot demand, but European production has increased about 14% month-over-month in February, and that's due to blast furnaces cranking back up again. And the met coal exports from the U.S. are forecast to increase about 7.5%. Now we can be bullish or we could be bearish about China. I prefer to be bullish. The Chinese Manufacturing PMI Index came in above 52%. That's the highest reading in two years. So I believe that there is some demand there. We know that there's healthy demand from the auto sector. So we feel good about Coal going forward. On the Intermodal side, there's no doubt there's a headwind from the storage piece and as I noted in the prepared remarks, we're seeing those markets -- excuse me, those congestion charges unwind even faster than we expected. Even though we predicted a year ago that they were going to unwind faster, so as those normalize, that's good for volume, as I noted on the IPI side. And think about it this way, for our international volume to grow 9%, that was freight that was moving on the highway last year. And we talked a lot last year about how it was going to revert to the mean when markets normalize, and that's what we're seeing right now. Sure. I think the one word that describes it best is murkiness, and quite frankly, it doesn't matter whether you're on the consumer side of the coin or on the industrial side, there is a clear line of sight, I think on the industrial markets for a quarter or two of demand. We see that clearly. We also see clearly that there is further deterioration in the truckload markets right now. The real question is the second half of the year. And you have heard from other calls and other entities that probably their outlook has changed somewhat, particularly on the consumer side. But we know that there's still pent-up demand in many of these industrial markets. So I am with you in terms of there's a lot of cross currents out there and a tremendous amount of, again murkiness, but I think the one thing I want to reassure you of is we are positioning ourselves to be ready when these markets do turn and they will turn. I think it's really going to be predicated by what happens in the overall economy, particularly that consumer sector. We continue to get very strong reports from our customers regarding their ability to win bids going forward. So we're bullish on that part. I think you've heard in other places, though, that many times those bids, the volumes are not manifest themselves at the rate that they were advertised so to speak, because the demand is not there. We're keeping a very close eye on the inventory sales ratio, which is about normal now, there's still maybe a little bit of replenishment to do in certain sectors, but we're close to normal on that front. So we're watching very closely what's happening in the macro economy, I firmly believe that as the market rotates, we will be very well positioned to take advantage of that first growth that comes out of the gate. No, that's exactly right. I would also say we're putting a lot of emphasis on the quality of our Intermodal product at the terminal level. And we are also focused on first and final mile markets and how we can deliver additional value there. So we're very well positioned, we believe to come out of this as the market rotates. Sure. Absolutely. We have over 600 active projects in our pipeline. And while we can't talk about really any of those, many of them under NDA, what I can tell you is that we are really well positioned to serve the EV and battery ecosystems including support for additional battery manufacturing and as they search for plant sites for manufacturing. The recent Scout Motors assembly plant and proposed reopening of a lithium mine nearby, present some more unique opportunities for us. There's three opportunities really for us to participate in the EV space. One is moving raw materials, one is moving components and one is moving the finished vehicles. We're actively working on all three of those segments. Yes. And on the road side, we made a I think we expect year-over-year declines in accessorial revenue. It really be a significant headwind to revenue or ARPU less fuel for the remainder of '23 and that's going to be offset by some positive impacts from price and volume, our plan. And then beginning in '24, the revenue from accessorial charges is likely to be much more in line with what we've experienced pre-pandemic. First quarter, we took a significant step towards normalization, as I noted."

            "name": "Paul Duncan",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. I'll begin on Slide 11. On my first earnings call as Chief Operating Officer this January, I shared my intention to begin every update with safety. This reflects the priority we put on the topic. Everything we do starts with safety. At the time, my leadership team and I were in the middle of kickoff meetings with operations leaders across our network. Alan joined us for some of those meetings. Our marketing leadership team participated in others. We started every meeting with safety discussing that it is an enterprise priority. We are investing in our leadership this year with all of our ballast line supervisors in starting every conversation with safety. As leaders, we set the tone and tone influences culture. We are also investing in the development of community responders, including a new regional training facility in Bellevue, Ohio. We are a safe railroad and constantly challenge ourselves to do even better. We will continue to work with our employees and community partners on safety-related initiatives that further enhance our culture in these areas. I'll note specific steps we are taking to enhance safety after reviewing the NTSB's preliminary report on the East Palestine derailment, including adding 200 more hot bearing detectors onto our network, expanding our network of acoustic bearing detectors and accelerating the deployment of digital train inspection portals, our most advanced safety technology, which we described in greater detail during our Investor Day. On Slide 12, you will see our safety metrics. As Alan noted, in 2022, Norfolk Southern had the lowest rate of employee injuries in a decade with a 1.01 frequency ratio. We began 2023 with a 0.89 injury frequency ratio and continue to work so all of our colleagues go home to their families in the same condition they arrive. We are also making strides to reduce our FRA accident rate. We are showing one additional graph this quarter, reflecting the frequency of accidents that occur on mainline tracks. While we strive to reduce all accidents, mainline accidents tend to have greater impact to the communities that we serve. These have generally been flat with year-over-year improvement through Q1 compared to Q1 2022. Our investment in infrastructure is paying off, and we're confident our focus on equipment inspection technology will continue to drive our mainline accident rate lower. Turning to Slide 13, I'll provide an update on our overall service. In the first quarter, we accelerated the analysis of train makeup rules as part of our broader efforts to improve safety, service and productivity. We began implementing enhancements soon thereafter, resulting in a significant short-term impact on velocity and the performance of our railroad. However, these changes were the right thing to do and have increased the reliability of our network and also allowed us to become even more productive. For example, we are now operating 50% more Merchandise trains with distributed power than this same time last year. This was only possible things to our continuing commitment to locomotive modernization, another example of how we are investing in long-term value. As Alan explained, we also made the decision to pull up the two mainline tracks at the derailment site and remove all impacted soil. From March 3rd, until the remediation is complete, currently expected in early June, we are only operating one track at reduced speeds through that section of our busy Premier Corridor. We have everything we need to recover from this temporary setback to our momentum. Remember that prior to the derailment, our service was the best it had been in two years. As we dial in our train makeup enhancements, we are already seeing improvements to our network in recent weeks. We will continue to work through the backlog and do not expect any meaningful long-term impacts. We are eager to get back to the execution of our service-oriented strategy. Transitioning to Slide 14. As we invest in the people and resources we need to execute our strategy and become more resilient, we still have about one-third of our high-end locations below our minimum staffing target based on anticipated demand. We continue to hire at a strong pace and have a robust pipeline of trainees in place. We are employing incentives to attract candidates in targeted locations, and we are taking a series of steps to provide immediate support where it is needed. For example, we are leveraging our go teams and temporary transfers in critical areas as we continue to restore the network. Moving to Slide 15 for our productivity update. Starting with locomotives, we maintained progress in the quarter on keeping locomotive velocity well above last year's levels. The overall Train & Engine workforce productivity metric remains below last year due to the elevated pipeline of conductor trainees as well as maintaining capacity in support of service and future growth. As we have discussed, an essential aspect of our balanced strategy for service, productivity and growth is to provide resilient service through economic downturns and times of volume uncertainty. This represents a deliberate strategic investment to maintain capacity in support of service and future growth. Lastly, our modernized locomotive fleet and fuel efficiency initiatives produced another quarter of record fuel productivity. This is another area where we will continue to invest to drive benefits for our shareholders, customers, and the communities we serve. I'll now turn it over to Ed Elkins. Oh, absolutely. We're seeing improvements over the last few weeks. And I want to go back to the point that was made around TOP|SPG. TOP|SPG was implemented as a simpler, more executable plan that will provide us a quicker path to improving service, especially when we have major service interruptions. We've seen strong improvements in our Intermodal franchise as of late, building on the momentum out of the TOP|SPG implementation last year that I referenced. Again, right now, this is all about pent-up demand and inventory across the network in our Merchandise space, we're going to continue to work after it."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Mark George",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On Page 6, you will see our key financial results for the quarter. The top row represents the GAAP measures. On the second row are the current cost estimates and impacts related to the Eastern Ohio incident and response. On the third row, you see the adjusted results. The $387 million of expense that we recorded for the incident includes costs associated with the cleanup of the site, community support and restoration payments, legal and advisory expenses, and a preliminary estimate of claims and settlements. It is important to note that no insurance or other recoveries are assumed in these estimates and that credits associated with these recoveries will be determined and recorded in future periods. Similarly, as we learn more, one can expect future estimates of cost will result in revisions to the accruals in subsequent quarters. The two rows at the bottom reflect the variances versus Q1 of 2022. GAAP earnings were down year-over-year due to the Eastern Ohio cost that were recorded. The adjusted variances at the bottom reflects 7% revenue growth that Ed will detail shortly, along with adjusted net income growth of 8% and adjusted EPS growth of 13%. Adjusted operating expense were up 11% in the quarter, and Slide 7 details the drivers, which I will walk through now. Adjusted operating expenses were up $204 million or 11%, with the majority of the increase being driven by inflation and incremental service-related costs. Inflationary pressures are visible in pretty much all P&L categories, most notably in comp and bend from last year's wage settlements. In comp and bend, we also saw an increase in headcount as we continue to build our T&E resources to help us become more reliable and resilient in support of our long-term strategy for growth. Purchase service growth is also impacted by inflation, but is also driven in part by technology investments, including projects aimed at improving productivity, operational executability, and enhanced safety. The service disruptions triggered by the Eastern Ohio derailment, the associated shutdown of our main line in a critical corridor as well as the acceleration of our enhanced train makeup rules is having an incremental impact on costs, resulting in slower network speeds that inflates equipment rents, while also driving a meaningful increase in material costs, in part because we strategically work to bring locomotives into service from our stored fleet to help accelerate our network. Moving to depreciation, please recall that we gave guidance on depreciation headwind this year from a recently completed roadway depreciation study, and that contributed $8 million of headwind in the quarter, and that will continue as a headwind in subsequent quarters. We also drove fuel efficiency by another 1% improvement in the quarter versus last year. Moving to the P&L results below operating income on Slide 8, and I'll talk to the adjusted variances here in the right-hand columns. Operating income grew 1%. Other income was $56 million, aided by favorable returns on company-owned life insurance and that helped adjusted pretax income grow 7%. Net income grew 8% and EPS grew 13% in the quarter. Turning to free cash flow and shareholder distributions on Slide 9. Cash from operations was $179 million higher, in part from changes in working capital, while free cash flow was $140 million higher than last year, and we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders with a strong dividend, supplemented by share repurchases. Let me turn now to Paul for his review on operations. Yes. So on East Palestine, Chris, as of the first quarter point in time, we made an estimate of the various elements of costs that we'd be facing and came up with that $387 million. The preponderance of that really is related to the environmental cleanup efforts and future environmental remediation activities. And also, it's important to note that because of the EPA involvement in all of this, there is likely to be oversight costs that we have to reimburse the government for as well. So that's all part of the estimate. There are things that are -- we could not estimate and therefore, could not record in the quarter, stuff really related to legal, I'll give you just one example with the Ohio Attorney General and the three funds that are going to be established. There was no way to estimate that. So that would be an example of something in the future that would come. So as we learn of new things and are able and realize that they're probable and they're estimable, we will record those. But at the same time, I remind you that there are no insurance recovery estimates that have been recorded at this point. In fact, of that $387 million, cash out the door has really been $55 million, okay? So most of this is accrual based on estimates. Insurance filings will really be done as we incur the costs from a cash perspective. So down the road, we'll be assembling our filings for the insurance companies and seeking reimbursement, and we will record those in due course as a credit. And so with regard to predictability or estimating those, it's impossible if we could estimate and we probably would have booked them already. So we'll just have to keep reporting these out as we go in the subsequent quarters. Correct, correct. Yes. Yes. So on materials, Scott, the impact from what we had early in the year had a pretty profound sudden impact on the network. We needed to get locomotives to help dig us out, so we basically took locomotives out of stored status. Some of them required a lot of work to get them rejuvenated so they could help take us out. I think there will be some incremental material costs that will linger here in the second quarter and should ease in the back half of the year as we see our network fluidity improve. Ed? Look, it's not a question of when the volume and the demand from the U.S. consumers are going to recover. It's when it happens, right? And so that's part of our strategy is to invest through the downturn so that we're there for the upside. Yes. So just real quick on fuel. We did have a lag benefit. While fuel prices are coming down, we had a lag benefit on the surcharge that provided some tailwind to us in this quarter, but that is going to quickly diminish and turn into headwinds as we go through the back of the year if the fuel curves hold true. Yes, thanks for the question, Tom. So look I think inflation is going to be a consistent pressure point for our operating ratio throughout the year. So if we think about that as probably a primary headwind. I'd say that's probably fairly consistent throughout the year. Service has kind of emerged in the first quarter as kind of a bigger headwind, and we were expecting that really to start unwinding here. And the reality is, it may continue to be a headwind for another quarter before that starts to flip and become a tailwind in the second half, assuming service does get back to where we know it should be kind of where we were in that January time frame. Let's not forget, we really did have a very good January and the pain we're seeing here in the quarter is really a result of just February and March. I do believe that we get some volume in the back half of the year, that will represent some tailwind and then I think the third component to bear in mind is fuel, as touched upon earlier, there's been a tailwind here in the first quarter. It might be a modest tailwind in the second quarter. And again, if the fuel curves hold constant, it will become more of a headwind in the back half. Well, yes, I think you see that we've got some trajectory in Paul's slide on our T&E count. We still have over 900 of conductor trainees. And as Paul mentioned, we've got a fair amount of our key locations that are still below our targeted levels. And we want to get to resilient levels in our locations here because we're feeling the pain of not being resilient. We made a promise to be resilient in our new strategy, and we're committed to get there. Unfortunately, we're not there yet, and that's part of why you're seeing us deal with the service challenge here again here in the second quarter. So there's more hiring to do. I think you'll start to see once we get to the levels we determine are appropriate at all of our locations will bring our train e-counts down probably by more than half of where they are today, and that will help us just handle normal attrition. But remember, the targeted numbers for headcount really is a dynamic number. And it does depend on the volume outlook and the demand outlook by area, by commodity type, by lane. So there's really a lot more sophisticated modeling than ever we put into trying to determine what our appropriate levels are. So I think you will continue to see it go up throughout the course of the year. Yes. David, real quick, on the comp and ben per employee. First quarter was pretty much like I had guided last quarter that $35,000 range. And I do expect it to kind of go sideways from here throughout the course of the year. We will have a step up in the third quarter just from the wage increase that happens for the agreement folks, another 4% here in the third quarter, but that should be mitigated by a wind-down and in some of these service-related costs. So I'd say it's going to be in that $35,000 and change territory throughout the year -- per quarter. Yes, Jon, I'd say the cost related to the service disruption we've had, they show up a little bit in the comp and ben with regard to recrews and overtime -- they show up in the purchase services as well. Part of that is related to drayage costs that we have to incur, taxis and we've even had to enter into some short-term land leases just to relieve some congestion in the terminal. So that's kind of where you see that play out. And I think that will persist into the second quarter and diminish in the second half. And similarly, in materials is kind of where I'd say the bigger impact was, and that's related to the locomotive restorations that we've had to do here, just to try to provide some immediate relief to the yards and to our line of road to deal with this disruption. So that, again will probably, we'll probably still have some incremental cost of materials in that second quarter and start to diminish in the third and fourth quarter. And Ari, the cost related to that six-point plan, it's really largely the capital associated with those incremental hot box detectors, which we said would be in that $50 million neighborhood over the next couple of years. So not a meaningful impact to our overall CapEx budget."

Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Tuesday, October 22, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Luke Nichols. Please go ahead.\nLuke Nichols : Good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we'll make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results.

Please note that all references to our prospective operating ratio during today's call are being provided on an adjusted basis. Turning to Slide 3, it's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mark George.\nMark George : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Here with me today are John Orr, our Chief Operating Officer, Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer, and Jason Zampi, our recently appointed Chief Financial Officer. I've had the privilege of working closely with Jason during my five-year tenure at Norfolk Southern, and he brings incredible talent, experience, and leadership to our executive team. Over the last few weeks, it's been energizing to connect with labor leaders, regulators, customers, and my fellow railroaders across the Norfolk Southern network. We have a strong franchise with diversified markets, high-quality customers and partners, as well as skilled employees who are committed to successfully executing on our strategy and delivering for our shareholders, customers, colleagues, and communities. Speaking of colleagues and communities, I want to thank our amazing team of railroaders who planned for and responded valiantly to the devastation that Hurricane Helene caused across our network. It was their fast and effective actions that resulted in us being able to recover and serve our communities within days. There's a lot more work to do, but we've made enormous progress. It's the tremendous skill and dedication of our railroaders that have enabled us to deliver third-quarter results that are among the best in the company history. Together, we drove productivity, grew volumes, and delivered notable sequential and year-over-year margin improvement while overcoming a challenging landscape. We achieved 3% higher revenue compared to the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share was 23% higher than the third quarter last year. Importantly, we delivered 570 basis points of adjusted OR improvement, bringing that ratio down to 63.4%, continuing to close the margin gap with peers. You'll hear today from John about the incredible work of the operations team that is driving significant and sustainable improvements, as well as resilience in overcoming multiple weather challenges and an East Coast port disruption. Their commitment to excellence is helping us build a stronger, more efficient network. We also accelerated volumes in the quarter. Ed will provide greater detail on the components, the drivers, and outlook for our markets. And finally, Jason will provide color to a number of notable achievements in terms of productivity, as well as line sales and project rationalization. I'll turn it over now to John to start with an overview of our operational progress. John?\nJohn Orr: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In Q3, our team drove system-wide improvements that are demonstrating how our focus on safety is protecting our people and our organization, while serving as the foundation for sustainable service and productivity improvements. I am delighted to share our transformation agenda proof points. Our guiding value is safety. Overall, I'm very encouraged with our progress on safety. While our FRA personal injury rate has increased, serious injuries and total accidents have declined significantly, 40% and 20% respectively. Our blueprint for commitment starts with our people. They are value creators. Through our new Thoroughbred Academy, we are investing in the work environment and core railway skills. In the quarter, over 300 top-level operations leaders completed the first of a multi-year curriculum that builds organizational trust and drives business performance. And over the next three months, 2,300 frontline and operating officers will participate in safety curriculums. Turning to service, with safety as our guiding value. Service performance is our North Star. The team is designing out handlings and extending train schedules, which is producing gains in speed and consistency. Q3 car velocity was 13% higher year-over-year, driven by a 9% increase in train speed and progressive reductions in terminal dwell. The productivity improvements driving service are also allowing us to accelerate cost reduction and create a more competitive platform for growth. Our flywheel of cost takeout initiatives has been robust. Year-to-date, we've reduced over 130 crew starts per day, with an 8% reduction in cost per start, including a 20% reduction in overtime and the elimination of attendance and other unproductive incentives. On the intermodal front, the new intermodal reservation system is helping us develop a unique value proposition in the industry by adding terminal visibility, accountability, and rigor. Locomotive productivity in the quarter improved 18% year-over-year, allowing us to reduce our fleet and capital requirements for both rolling stock and engines. We've stored over 500 locomotives and have moved 8,000 plus cars offline since March. This has allowed us to challenge previous capital spending assumptions. Through our new precision energy management program, we've optimized HPT standards, extended train schedules, and are relaying more power from train to train, keeping assets in productive revenue service longer. As a result, fuel efficiencies are at record levels. Our strategy is both targeted and broad, tactical and strategic, ranging across structural improvements in consumption, procurement, materials management, purchase service optimization, crew cost efficiencies, and productive enhancements. And we've just scratched the surface in extolling a few of the initiatives that are within our pipeline that are helping us close the competitive gap and track confidently to our cost reduction commitments. As we move to the next slide, I want to take a moment to state how proud I am of our response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, especially to our engineering teams. They proactively protected our employees, communities, and assets. Our recovery demonstrates the breadth and capability of our team. Responders cleared over 15,000 trees, managed over 1,000 locations with power outages, repaired multiple washouts and scour locations, and supported local responders, including two instances where they led life-saving civilian rescues. This resilience highlights our preparedness and ability to recover swiftly from natural disasters. None of this is possible without an inspired and committed team. We are enriching a strong culture by blending external talent with legacy leaders in a field first management team that is accelerating solutions and deepening ownership and accountability. Our new labor agreements enable us to innovate across our entire workforce. So, what you see is that we have established a new baseline and standards heading into Q4. These are providing next-level perspectives of our assets, their utilization, and the service quality they unlock. Working as a field-centric team, we are building a safer, more efficient, and more resilient operation. Success breeds success. Thank you, and I'll turn it to Ed.\nEd Elkins: Well, thank you, John, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll start on Slide 10 with a review of our commercial results for the third quarter, where you'll see that the work we're putting into creating a fluid network and dependable service delivered year-over-year revenue and volume growth. Overall revenue of $3.05 billion was 3% higher than the third quarter in the prior year, and volume moved up 7% year-over-year, with all three segments contributing gains for the quarter, while RPU fell 4% as our price gains were outpaced by lower fuel surcharge revenue, lower coal prices, and unfavorable impacts from intermodal mix. You've heard me discuss all these factors in previous quarters. The merchandise segment produced year-over-year volume growth led by our grain markets and segments of our chemicals business. NS was able to deliver this growth backed by a service product that our customers can count on every day, and you've heard me talk all year long about our focus on our merchandise business and the increased value to our customers is evident, as this marks the 37th out of the prior 38 quarters where merchandise RPU less fuel grew year-over-year. Now, Hurricane Helene impacted certain segments of our merchandise business in the southeast, but we expect volumes to gradually recover as our affected customers operations normalize over time. Intermodal revenue grew 4% year-over-year this quarter, as volume growth of 9% was offset by a 5% decline in RPU. Stagnant truck prices continue to pressure domestic intermodal rates, and unfavorable mix trends continue with strong gains in international and domestic, outpacing our premium market volumes in intermodal. The ILA strike negatively impacted our international volumes, but we expect the majority of this volume will be recovered in the months ahead. Finishing up here with coal, revenue declined 2% for the third quarter. Our year-over-year volumes finished up 11% with declining export prices, an unfavorable mix within the portfolio pushed down RPU by 11%. The coal business saw headwinds from easing export prices and challenged utility segment factors to include low natural gas prices, high stockpiles, and reduced demand in coal-burning regions. Turning to the next slide, let's talk through our outlook for the remainder of the year. Overall, we expect our markets to experience tempered growth, albeit with some discrete headwinds from market trajectory and mixed impacts on certain sectors. It's very important to note that the impact of fuel price normalization from the 2022 historic highs will remain the single largest revenue headwind that we face, and this has been true all year long. We expect our merchandise business to see continued but sedate growth supported by easing interest rates and ongoing infrastructure projects, although sector-specific headwinds in various sectors in our automotive and metals markets will pose challenges. Intermodal will see strong demand driven by our dependable service product, by new bid awards, and import-export demand despite the interruptions caused by the ILA strike that ended on October 3. We're prepared to handle international shipments that were delayed during that interruption. Our outlook for coal is really a mixed bag, as seaborne pricing for met coal is trending downward. On the other hand, we're seeing positive momentum in the thermal export markets. And finally, in the wake of the destruction caused by Hurricane Helene, we stand ready to support our customers and handle the goods and products needed to help the affected regions rebuild. And as always, I will end with a word of thanks to our customers for their partnership and their support. With that, I'll welcome Jason Zampi to the call to talk about our financial results. Thank you.\nJason Zampi: Thanks, Ed. I'll start with a reconciliation of our gap results on Slide 13, and I wanted to call out three items here in the quarter. First, the impacts from the Eastern Ohio incident are itemized as they have been for the last several quarters. I highlight that our insurance recoveries outpaced the incremental costs of the incident for the second quarter in a row. That brings the total cumulative amount of insurance recoveries to over $650 million. The other two items are the result of specific actions we executed to further our strategic objectives, including an unrelenting focus on productivity and asset utilization. As we previewed last quarter, we completed two significant line sales, an example of us continuing to simplify the network and generate cash flows. These two sales resulted in $380 million of gains and generated almost $400 million of cash. Additionally, under the leadership of our new CIO, Anil Bhatt, who has a relentless focus on technology delivery and ROI generation, we rationalized certain IT projects that were not generating the desired benefits. That, coupled with the discontinuance of our Triple Crown Road Railer assets, combined a total of $60 million in restructuring costs. Adjusting for these items, OR for the quarter was $63.4 and EPS totaled $3.25. That's a 650 basis point improvement in our adjusted OR since the first quarter, all while providing a safe, reliable, resilient service product, generating productivity, and growing the business. Looking at these adjusted results compared to last year and last quarter on Slide 14, you'll note that the year-over-year revenue was up $80 million due to strong volume growth, partially offset by RPU pressures. Operating expenses were down $118 million due primarily to fuel prices and productivity. All combined, these drove 570 basis points of OR improvement. From a sequential perspective, revenue is relatively flat. However, we have continued to build off the strong momentum from our productivity and cost reduction initiatives with expenses down $47 million and a 170 basis point improvement in OR. Drilling into these sequential variances starting with revenue on Slide 15. You'll note that the strength in coal and intermodal volumes drove an overall 3% volume increase over last quarter. Unfavorable mix, pricing pressures, particularly within the export coal market and lower fuel surcharge revenues drove RPU lower, leading to overall revenue that was essentially flat with the second quarter. Slide 16 breaks down the $47 million sequential improvement in expenses. The transformative actions delivered by John and his team are benefiting our P&L. And you'll see that through record fuel efficiency, strong labor productivity with T&E count down 3% on 3% more volume and decreases in rents due to better network fluidity. While the results of our initiatives to drive down purchase services are also taking hold, all more than offsetting the wage inflation headwind that we called out last quarter. These strong third quarter results and our operational momentum position us well to achieve our second half and full year targets. We do expect a sequential uptick in OR as we move into the fourth quarter from normal seasonality, including headwinds that we are expecting on the top line, but also due to additional cleanup costs from Hurricane Helene's aftermath. Going forward, we are confident in our ability to continue to improve margins that will generate shareholder value. And the $400 million in cash generated from the line sales along with our goal of reducing CapEx as we move into 2025 will help with much needed balance sheet repair. Mark, I'll hand it back to you.\nMark George : Thanks, Jason. We are proud of our results in the quarter. Let me summarize some of what you just heard. First, we drove improvements in safety in the quarter despite volume increases and the significant weather events. Second, we leveraged attrition in the quarter while handling robust volume growth resulting in productivity gains while not compromising service. Third, we delivered strong operational resiliency recovering service quickly following numerous disruptive weather events with Helene being the most severe. Fourth, we executed upon major line sales that we signaled last quarter providing meaningful cash proceeds that will help us accelerate balance sheet repair. Finally, we delivered strong financial results in the third quarter, even with the volume pressures in the last eight days of September and we are on track for our second half and full year OR commitments, even if the full year revenue falls a little short of our guidance, which is to be up roughly 1%. So with that, let's open it up to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Chris Wetherbee from Wells Fargo, please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee : Yeah, thanks, good morning. Maybe we could start with the sort of the short term where you left off. Just wanted to get a sense of maybe how you think about the progress that you've made and how you can carry that into the fourth quarter? I know you talked about the second half guide specifically around the operating ratio. I want to give them maybe a little bit -- drill down a little bit deeper on maybe how that impacts in the fourth quarter.\nMark George : Thanks, Chris. This is Mark. Yeah, we've got really great momentum right now on the cost side. John can talk about that in a second. I think right now, we feel really good about those things that we can control. Yeah, as we talked about in Laguna, we were getting a little bit concerned about the auto and steel markets and that's starting to really play out the way we previewed. So that's definitely going to be something we keep our eye on. But generally speaking, intermodal is we expect to peak season. Intermodal should be good. Obviously, the port disruptions we don't know exactly when and how the volumes will manifest here in the fourth quarter. But generally, we feel really, really good about the way we go in the fourth quarter. John, why don't you talk a little bit about the momentum we've got on the cost side and then add a little bit more on the revenue.\nJohn Orr : Yeah. Chris, great question. And I would say, I'm really pleased the way we exited Q3 on safety. We finished Q3 at 2.05 and we're into the quarter at $1.5 million. And as you know, in a precision railway environment when things are working in the rhythm they're supposed to. And first and foremost, from a safety perspective, you get a lot of momentum. And we're seeing that in the terminals. And our terminal dwell is continuing to improve. And that's being achieved not only through the terminal itself, but how we're looking at reduction in handlings and accelerating cars through terminals by extending schedules of trains. So the work complexity is coming down while the capability is increasing. And that's playing out in fuel, that's playing out in a lot of purchase and services that taxi reductions, et cetera. And now we're able to negotiate and structurally change some of our vendor agreements that put more discipline around those things as a result of how we're improving. So I would say those are some of the cost and then the puts are also as we use our resources better we're able to create more opportunities for Ed to sell into spot markets and increase even our permits. So Ed, any color on that?\nEd Elkins : Sure. Yeah. In the fourth quarter, we certainly expect to see continued growth in the intermodal product, both on the international side, but also on the domestic side. We see strong demand out there, and we've confirmed that with some of our key partners that we talk to every single day that they're seeing the same thing. So we're looking for a robust fourth quarter. From intermodal, the only headwind there is going to be premium and those are pretty well-known headwinds in terms of the challenges that, that particular market is facing. On the coal side, we see a lot of demand on export thermal. But let's be clear, seaborne prices for met are continuing to be a drag. And there's a lot of stockpile build on the domestic side. So there'll be some headwinds, some puts and takes. Mark's already talked about -- or excuse me, automotive and steel. We're keeping an eye on those. But we feel very good about our ability to capture every single opportunity that we're able to get in front of.\nChris Wetherbee : Thank you. Do you think that gets you into the 64%, 65% range for the fourth quarter, though, when you think about the operating ratio?\nMark George : Jason?\nJason Zampi: Yeah. So we really had a great quarter. We're confident in meeting the 64% to 65% operating guidance for the second half of the year that we talked about earlier. As we move into the fourth quarter, we are expecting a sequential uptick in the OR and just a couple of things to remember. First, we called out the fuel recoveries this quarter. We don't expect that to recur in the fourth to that same magnitude. But that's -- those recovery is really a great outcome of running a tight railroad in the disciplined processes that John has put into place. So that's a great outcome there. Second, I'd say we're expecting a more normal seasonality. Historically, that's been around 100 basis points of headwind as you move from third to fourth quarter, and a lot of that is due to the revenue headwinds that Ed talked about. I'd also call out, we're able to close on about $20 million of land sales in both the second and third quarters. And as we've talked about, those are difficult to predict. So that could provide some sequential headwind. And then finally, as we called out, we're also going to have to deal with the additional costs from some hurricane cleanup. So that -- just on the expense side, that's around $20 million. But offsetting all that, just on the good side, we've got a lot of operational momentum and really doing a great job here on the productivity front. So that's what gives us confidence to reaffirm that second half guidance.\nChris Wetherbee : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe for Mark and Jason, can you just talk about the capital intensity of the business going forward? If locomotives off-line cars going offline at an increasing rate as well into storage? How do you see that going forward, you're rationalize with some other IT projects as well? So are you able to see a little bit lower capital intensity over the next couple of years? And how does that tie into your expectation to be back in the market buying back shares? Thank you.\nMark George : Yeah. Great question, Brian. You really nailed the strategy here. I think with John taking more than 500 locomotives off-line, that allows us to really start to deploy capital elsewhere and actually constrain our capital to a large degree. And we brought in a nil to run the IT organization. And we've been reprioritizing and really reevaluating all the projects we have in the pipeline. And we're going to focus on a more concentrated portfolio of projects that are going to yield high returns, the fastest possible projects that we can work on to generate high returns. So we fully expect that CapEx next year will come down. And obviously, with the line sales we have this year and the cash buildup that we expect to have toward the end of the year, we fully expect to be back in the market repurchasing shares to some modest level next year. Thanks for the question.\nJason Zampi: Yeah, Mark, if I could just add. As far as locomotives are concerned, we're looking at pushing back as far as we can our capital commitments to locomotives. And you're right, converting that resilience railroading and the disciplined approach to resources allows us to redo all of those things and really look for capital investments that create value either in a niche area like our B3 for the warrior coal that we've got or other things that Ed might bring online and help us really achieve a faster, more precise service delivery against new business call. But we're taking a really hard look at the IT projects that we've got working closely with Anil, Meena and her team looking at the resource consumption are really driving that ability. So it's just -- it's most -- it's both OpEx and capital that we're attacking here.\nMark George : Thank you, Brian, next question?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Hoexter, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter : Hey, great. Good morning. And Mark and Jason, congrats on the new jobs. I guess -- thanks guys. So Ed, volumes are starting off, it looks like down about 1.5% in carloads. I think you said you can rebound. Are you talking about getting to positive growth? Is there a level you would think we should throw out there in terms of catching up? And then in terms of pricing with coal benchmark pricing down and I guess looking at where we are today at just over 200 , could we see or would you expect pricing to be down double digits or not quite that level again?\nEd Elkins : Hi, Ken. I'll start with the last question first. I think we're going to see coal prices continue to drift lower. I don't think double digit, but we'll see. We're taking a very conservative approach to it here. And then on the question of overall volumes in the fourth quarter, we've seen a really nice catch up after the disruption from the port strike and from Helene and the areas that have recovered already. And we feel very confident. And I think this is one thing that it's hard to get across on a call, but we feel very confident in our ability to recapture volume no matter where it comes from, whether it's continued West Coast imports or more East Coast flowing through in the wake of the strike. So you put that together with what I would call some opportunistic spot moves that we've been able to pick up in the third quarter that may continue in the fourth. On the merchandise side, what the Norfolk is really doing right now, and John and his team are working really closely with us is we're really manufacturing a lot of capacity that we can deploy to be very agile. So you think about the rapid increase run-up in West Coast imports before the strike. And now we're much more fluid on the East Coast coming through. So I fully expect that whatever the market presents, we're going to be able to handle.\nMark George : Thank you, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Group, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning. So John, some strong labor productivity with volume up 7%, headcount down 3 what's the runway here? Is this an incremental opportunity as we look out to next year? Or at some point, does this get tougher?\nJohn Orr : Well, Scott, I'm glad you recognize the work that our -- all of our team is doing, including our craft labor. They are really embracing our management and leadership style. And that's reflected in some of the CBAs there that we've got TAs against. I would say that labor productivity, we're just getting started on having a disciplined approach to our operations where we're looking at not just the head count, but how we -- how people are deployed and our train structures designing out handlings, designing out train stops and the elongating schedules allows us to increase the productivity of not only our people but also the resources like locomotives. And so I think these gains they're starting to really get traction and they'll continue to get traction. I really think that you can't underestimate the power of leadership and the power of the team. And you see our engagement with labor as being very collaborative and they're a major stakeholder in our PSR 2.0 application. Last month, we had over 65 labor leaders, including presidents of national governing bodies coming to Atlanta and talking about issues and really understanding what we're doing and embracing our philosophy on railroading. And look, they had some really challenging questions. They had some different points of view. But we were able to work through those things and come out with a really cohesive perspective on what we need to go forward. So I would say that I don't want to put the burden on any particular group shoulders to bear. I think as a team, we're bearing a lot of discipline of change and the commitment to change and that's reflected in the women and men who work for us. And as I've said, railroading is a tough business. It's a 365, 24/7. And when we're creating the environment where people feel that they're contributing and they feel fulfilled and what they do and who could be more fulfilled than contributing to the U.S. economy the way we do. So I think the story is just starting to be written.\nMark George : Thanks a lot. Next question?\nOperator: Next question comes from Tom Wadewitz, UBS.\nTom Wadewitz : Jason, I also wanted to say congratulations on the new roles. And John, really looks like you're having a great effect on the railroad. So congratulations on that as well. I wanted to see if I could ask you a bit about 2025. I know that's kind of probably tough given lack of visibility in markets and everything and pricing. But how do you think about the frame for '25 if you don't see improvement in some of the markets, right? It seems like industrial markets aren't getting better, maybe getting a little worse and you highlight automotive and metals. So is there enough productivity that you improve the margin in 2025? So obviously, high level -- is that reasonable, given John's commentary and momentum? Or if you don't see volume growth and some pickup in markets, is that kind of tough to do. Just wanted to see if you could offer any kind of high-level thoughts on how that -- those two kind of markets versus idiosyncratic network improvement, how to think about those two together? Thank you.\nMark George : Hey, thank you, Tom. Great question. Let's bifurcate and just say that for the things we can control, which is cost. We've got a path. You will recall that we had committed to $250 million of cost reduction this year. We are on track to hit that number. We committed to another $150 million next year. So regardless of the economic environment, we committed to another $150 million next year in 2025. We're going to beat that. And John and I have spent a lot of time talking about this. I think there's a real opportunity to fast forward some cost reduction from 2026 into 2025. So we feel really, really confident there. We can't control the top line and the economic environment, except to say that there is share recapture opportunity out there. So even if you have a softer market, we still have some idiosyncratic opportunities to recapture some share to help mitigate any pressure that might be there. So obviously, there's a limit to how much you can get in any given year. But given the product that John and his team are putting out there for service, we feel really, really good about the traction and momentum we have with our customer base. John, do you want to talk any more about the confidence in our cost reduction next year?\nJohn Orr : I would say the confidence for me comes in the power of the team. And I look to my own experience through Hunter Camp back in the early 2000s and how Hunter encourage us to find the small wins and 1,000 small wins by an army of people who are believing in continuous improvement add up to a lot. And as we work through our investment in people and the almost 2,800 engagements that we're doing through the balance of the year, we're educating people on the specifics of PSR 2.01, how to really contribute to it. We're promoting the culture of change and really removing the mud as Hunter would say. And we're providing people the ability then to apply what we're teaching them on their jobs day to day. And that's really finding organic improvements. And then we've got our strategy where we're unlocking the value of the network. And that's the beauty of starting with two terminals like Chattanooga and Conway and really understanding how they work. And now we're able to force multiply those learnings and engage real asset utility. And now we're thinking -- rethinking how we use our assets. And we see that in some of our pool distributions and our asset management and the refinements. A great example is how we're moving the cars out of Detroit instead of stopping them in Toledo, and moving them over to Bellevue and then going to Elkhart we're able to repurpose a secondary yard and go right from Detroit right to Elkhart, removing assignments, removing car days, reducing our power locomotive fleet requirements. And those ideas are coming from the field up. And so it's really taking hold -- is a long answer to say the story is just unfolding here. And as we invest in people, as we engage in clearing out the organizational mud and the case for change is still there. There's a lot to be fixed here. And I think we're reflecting --\nMark George : Tom, when we put those targets out, they were targets. Now we're filling in that outline with real specific actions, and we're realizing that we were maybe a little modest in the targets that we saw in front of us because the actions now tallied a little bit more as we're putting together our 2025 number. So it feels good. Now Ed, do you have any thoughts on '25 outlook?\nEd Elkins : Absolutely. And we're still working on what '25 looks like there's clearly a lot of lot of moving parts out there. But let's be clear about this. We're not sitting on our hands. We're not just waiting around to see what's going to happen. My team as well as John's are working together right now to build a service product that does one thing and that's produced service that you can count on delivered by people that you can trust every single day. And on top of that, we're working to build what I would consider to be a unique value proposition because of the technology that we're deploying at the customer level to make it very easy to do business with. That's a process change as well as some technology augmentation, but I think it's going to be a real differentiator in 2025. We look forward to the response from our customers on both counts.\nMark George : Thanks, Tom. Next question?\nOperator: Next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski : Hey good morning. And thanks for taking the question. So Mark, congrats on the top seat here. But I guess a two-part question for me. First, structurally at Norfolk, is there any way you're looking at this organizationally that you'd like to see different at the company? And then maybe following up from that discussion on 2025 OR, there was a lot of back and forth on guidance earlier this year with the proxy contest. So I think you guys had committed to 100 to 150 basis points of annual improvement for the next few years, but then also said maybe a sub-60 and three to four years of volume contributed. Is that still the right framework, especially within the context of the answer to that last question?\nMark George : Yeah. I think starting with your second one, absolutely. We're still on track for that. And you remember the components, there were components of cost reduction there. And the 1 to 150 million was really based on kind of a more modest top line outlook of a middling 2% to 3% type of top line growth. But then if we had a more traditional top line recovery, that would get us to the sub-60% in by the three to four-year time window. So we stand by those guidance indicators. Now with regard to structurally anything different. I think what I would tell you is we are on track. We've got some great momentum. The strategy at its core is exactly what we're going to stick to. And this really gets to about execution right now. And we have a really sound operating team that is executing upon the strategy to create network fluidity that will allow for a really great service product. And as we always said, with that great service product, it will enable growth. You started to see that play out last quarter and now again this quarter. We've got some idiosyncratic opportunities to grow, and Ed and his team have been capturing on it. So that worked, and we told you that productivity is kind of the third leg of that strategy. And honestly, you also saw that play out in the third quarter. We had fallen out of balance with the strategy on productivity. We told you we were going to get back in balance, and we're well on our way to doing that with 570 basis points of OR improvement, thanks to a sprinkling of some volume here in this quarter, it was a real accelerant. But even the sequential improvement is very encouraging. So execution is what's key. And John and I talk about that a lot. And I kind of touched on it a little bit at Laguna I really embrace an operational excellence mindset coming from my background in industrial products. And I believe strongly that any good operation needs a quality type system, you can call it Six Sigma, you can call it ACE like we used to call it a mile company, which is achieving competitive excellence. Either way, you've got to have really solid standard processes that are based on best practices. You've got to get those systematized so that everybody follows it. And when you have breakdowns in the process, you do relentless root cause analysis to identify where the problems are and then fix the standard processes so you can mistake proof going forward. That's this virtuous cycle that we have to get ourselves into. And the beauty is, when an operator like John and John's team, what you hear about -- there's a real resemblance to what I'm describing. In fact, when John talks about the war rooms, what do you think the war rooms are? Those are relentless root cause analysis. Every time they have an issue, the war room gets to work on it. They figure out what the root cause is, they fix it. So we are in lockstep on driving that culture. And I'm really, really excited about that. And then I think the other thing is, obviously, culturally, I want to continue to advance first, our safety culture, but also a real two-way communication. John touched upon that a couple of minutes ago as well. But a two-way communication where information flows up, not just down. A lot of the best ideas that come inside this railroad are from the people who are on the ground, whether that's in the marketing organization, with what's happening with our customer base, whether that's in the operations team like John just described. We have to create that environment where people are comfortable to speak of. And it's not just process stuff. It's not just ideas for improvement, but it's also concerns that they might have. So we're going to be really working on creating and fostering a better culture for two-way communication. And then I would say, finally, Ed and I have been having a lot of conversations about really working a lot closer with our customer base to figure out exactly how we can serve them better to accelerate the share gains and the share recapture opportunities that are out there. So that's where I'd say the focus will be structurally going forward. And thanks a lot for the question, Brandon. Appreciate it. Next?\nOperator: The next question is from Jonathan Chappell, Evercore. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Chappell : Thank you. Ed, on your market outlook, there's a lot more red and yellow than there is green. And you've talked about some of the headwinds there and maybe some more incremental -- you've also mentioned in some of these prior answers, spot market wins. So can you just maybe put a little bit more quantitative where you're winning, how much that is? If we look at a macro that's to industrial production growth. What's the realistic volume growth on the Norfolk Southern network as you're winning more than maybe the economy is giving you? Kathleen Quirk Yeah. I would point -- it's pretty easy. I would point to our ag markets. We're -- in the third quarter, we were able to take advantage of some market dislocations as well as some, what I would call, true spot opportunities that frankly, in prior quarters, we could never have addressed because we couldn't generate the additional capacity to do that nor the operational agility to really respond in a way that the market take advantage of. But this last quarter, we have, I would say, very successfully executed a number of those moves, whether it's soybeans, whether it's corn, whether it's grain, that have helped offset some of the weakness that we've seen in some of the other industrial markets, where we're fulfilling all the capacity needs that our customers have, but they simply don't have that much need right now. And I would point toward the deceleration in some of our auto markets. And there's some idiosyncratic phenomenon going on there with regard to whether it's quality holds or specific plant outages. But you think about intermodal and look at the very solid growth, both on the domestic and international side and the ability that our network has had to not only absorb that growth but also produce those spot wins that I'm talking about here, which really are, again, opportunities that we would not have been able to take advantage of in prior quarters. I would attribute part of our ongoing agility improvement to our reservation system on the intermodal side. And we're in the early innings of that, but I really think that over time, and John may want to comment on it. But over time, the feedback we're getting from our customers is it's going to help them know that they've got a ride on a train on a specific day, which allows them to plan and their customers plan and allows us to make some very important operational decisions that help us be not only more efficient but more reliable for our customers.\nJason Zampi: Yeah. And I would agree. And while it's early days in the reservation system, I'm really confident that as we work through this, our customers are going to enjoy the discipline that brings to our terminals. Because they've been a part of its development. And what I'm excited about is the opportunity to add 100, 200, 300, 500, 1,000 feet to our intermodal trains or existing trains as we create the discipline smoothing out our network through the rest of the year and into next year. And then being able to really project what our true capacity is as far as that growth because I think we're just on the cusp of really hitting our stroke on long trains and bringing on new business at very low incremental costs.\nMark George : Thanks, John. Next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeff Kauffman, Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeff Kauffman : Good morning, everybody. And thank you for squeezing me in. Congratulations also to Mark and Jason. I just want to go a different direction. I know there's some things you probably can't talk about with the labor agreements. But John, can you talk about what is going to make a difference for what you're trying to achieve in these labor agreements that were reached fairly run out for ratification, so you may not want to discuss some things. But just kind of talk about what's important for you to hit your targets with these new labor deals?\nJason Zampi: Yeah, thank you for that question. And it is a really good question. And coming from both the craft and from organized labor in the early days of my career, I really appreciate having clarity on the future as far as the payment structures and the discipline around what my CBA looks like. So I think first, that extending that confidence to our workforce and predictability and how they can budget their own households and their own work schedules is really important. And that cascades then into our being able to model from the pricing and from the predictability with our customers. And third, I think it's very complementary to what we're trying to achieve in PSR 2.0. And that's a really disciplined service safety and really delivering value for our customers. And that discretionary effort that we're getting from our rent trade crews and our operating employees is really allowing us to optimize the value of our network, build a team, a team that's inclusive of every one of the 20,000 people who work here and contribute to the value that we're creating. And that leadership and developing skills and capabilities is just going to help us to enhance a great product already. And I think as well, then that allows us to really create a new blueprint and unlock the bigger rocks, that we need to, so that we move the network further along. So it's a win-win. And I know from my experience, there's nothing you can put a price tag on that discretionary effort.\nMark George : Thanks a lot, Jeff. Next question?\nOperator: Your next question is from Jordan Alliger, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah, good morning. I just want to talk about network resiliency, if I could. You had some pretty strong volumes in the third quarter. So I'm just sort of curious what's working well on resiliency, what still needs to improve really just to get a sense what needs to be done to ensure the network can run fluidly for the foreseeable future, so you could do the things you're talking about like taking share off the highway, et cetera. Thank you.\nJason Zampi: Well, I would say, again, I would get back to we're trying to do things better in every area of the business. And in order to do that, we have to bring up our efforts and our capabilities to a completely another level. But I would say the six things that we focus on, the network health our asset efficiencies and our customer-facing metrics are the guiding metrics that we're going to use to drive that. And as we continue to improve those things under the hood, there are going to be a lot of ability to put more discipline, engineer out inefficiencies and engineer in optimization, things like the reservation system that are just going to unlock so much discipline around our terminals and intermodal as our growth and to have better discipline around that just gives us such an advantage as the market comes roaring back in the U.S. economy and as trucks tighten up, we'll be able to really leverage from a pricing perspective. And I think Ed's talked about that numerous times.\nMark George : Jordan, I think what John has done decongesting the terminals and networks, it goes a long way to improving resiliency. I mean laying down 500 locomotives over 8,000 cars since Q1. And you create a lot more fluidity in the network. And when you add little bumps in the road, you have less congestion to hold you back from recovery. So that, I think, key and critical. And you saw it play out here in the third quarter following these storms. I would tell you a year ago, some of the events that we saw in the quarter probably would have set us back three months, okay? But we were back within a week and now we're actually at record network speeds and load wells. So it's really remarkable. And I do actually just want to refute the notion that resiliency is about retaining costs. In fact, we've achieved resiliency this quarter while lowering costs. So it's a good news story. We seem to have a good model in place here. Thanks for the question, Jordan. Next?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker : Thanks, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the color on \u201825 on the productivity actions. But with that to drop through to the bottom line, how much pricing do you need to counter general inflation for next year?\nEd Elkins : Thank you, Ravi, by the way. We've had a very successful year so far in terms of being able to price to the value of our service and that value is increasing as the year goes on. And we're very confident that we're going to finish up the year in a strong position. Going in \u201925 we continue to believe that we're going to outpace inflation in all of our major markets. Now commodity prices like seaborne coal probably be a headwind. We'll see how that evolves in '25. But when you think about our core product and the value of the service that we're offering, it's increasing and our customers are saving money at the same time. So it's a powerful combination.\nMark George : You have to think of it, Ravi, in the elements when you talk about pricing, you can't talk about it as one topic, right? Merchandise, as I just said, we feel really good, really strong service helps as a good backdrop there as those inflation. So the model is intact. I think intermodal is going to be somewhat dependent on what happens with spot truck pricing. Clearly, we seem to have found the bottom. The question is when does it start coming off the floor here? And yeah, we have other commodity groups that follow indices that we don't control, obviously, in seaborne met being a big one. So -- but I think for those areas, like particularly merchandise in 2025, models intact. We feel really good. Thank you. Appreciate the question. Let's try to get another couple in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Vernon, Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon : Good morning, guys. And congrats to the new roles. So maybe just kind of building off that question around the seaborne met market in 2025. Ed, you've been around this business a long time. What do you think about the U.S.'s role in terms of the export markets if we see a lower price correction? Are you worried just -- could you kind of maybe shape the price headwind that might manifest on a slightly weaker market for Norfolk into next year? And then kind of help us understand whether you're worried about also sort of like overall aggregate volume demand on the export markets for 2025?\nEd Elkins : I'm a little bit readier than to get a lot into '25 because we're still building our view of that particular dimension. But I will tell you -- the U.S. has remained remarkably competitive over time. I think we're going to continue to do that, particularly when I think about export thermals, we're in a very good spot in terms of demand. I expect that to generally continue. And China is going to determine a lot about what happens with export met demand. There's a tremendous amount of geopolitical uncertainty that's driving a lot of commodity prices, driving a lot of energy prices. But we've got our weather eye on it, and we are fully prepared and capable of delivering the tonnage of our customers around the globe on need.\nDavid Vernon : Thank you.\nMark George : Next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ben Nolan, Stifel.\nBen Nolan : I appreciate you guys. I was just going to ask, you talked a little bit on the intermodal side that it feels like maybe it's bottoming. And specifically around -- and appreciating that the trucking market is still really challenged. Are you starting to see any green shoots on the premium intermodal at all? Or is that not yet the place where we are?\nEd Elkins : On the premium side, there's still a lot of headwinds out there emanating from the highway generally. We are seeing -- I mean, you got to look at it from a fairly substantial distance, but we are seeing truck utilization head up. And I think we're close to the 10-year average now, and I think we're going to trend above it. You look at the total number of motor carriers that are out there, it's declining slowly. But both those things, along with feedback that we're getting from our key partners like J.B. Hunt and Hub Group are telling us that we're reaching a point where I fully expect that pricing is going to eventually inflect. I do think we're around the bottom now, and I have Phil at least somewhat confident knocking on the table here that that's true. Premium is a different story. We'll see how that evolves. What we are focused on is making sure that we're delivering exactly the product that, that particular segment needs.\nBen Nolan : Okay, thank you.\nMark George : That brings us to the end. Look, I want to thank everyone for your questions, and we look forward to talking to you all throughout the quarter. Have a great day. Thank you.",

            "name": "Jason Zampi",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed. I'll start with a reconciliation of our gap results on Slide 13, and I wanted to call out three items here in the quarter. First, the impacts from the Eastern Ohio incident are itemized as they have been for the last several quarters. I highlight that our insurance recoveries outpaced the incremental costs of the incident for the second quarter in a row. That brings the total cumulative amount of insurance recoveries to over $650 million. The other two items are the result of specific actions we executed to further our strategic objectives, including an unrelenting focus on productivity and asset utilization. As we previewed last quarter, we completed two significant line sales, an example of us continuing to simplify the network and generate cash flows. These two sales resulted in $380 million of gains and generated almost $400 million of cash. Additionally, under the leadership of our new CIO, Anil Bhatt, who has a relentless focus on technology delivery and ROI generation, we rationalized certain IT projects that were not generating the desired benefits. That, coupled with the discontinuance of our Triple Crown Road Railer assets, combined a total of $60 million in restructuring costs. Adjusting for these items, OR for the quarter was $63.4 and EPS totaled $3.25. That's a 650 basis point improvement in our adjusted OR since the first quarter, all while providing a safe, reliable, resilient service product, generating productivity, and growing the business. Looking at these adjusted results compared to last year and last quarter on Slide 14, you'll note that the year-over-year revenue was up $80 million due to strong volume growth, partially offset by RPU pressures. Operating expenses were down $118 million due primarily to fuel prices and productivity. All combined, these drove 570 basis points of OR improvement. From a sequential perspective, revenue is relatively flat. However, we have continued to build off the strong momentum from our productivity and cost reduction initiatives with expenses down $47 million and a 170 basis point improvement in OR. Drilling into these sequential variances starting with revenue on Slide 15. You'll note that the strength in coal and intermodal volumes drove an overall 3% volume increase over last quarter. Unfavorable mix, pricing pressures, particularly within the export coal market and lower fuel surcharge revenues drove RPU lower, leading to overall revenue that was essentially flat with the second quarter. Slide 16 breaks down the $47 million sequential improvement in expenses. The transformative actions delivered by John and his team are benefiting our P&L. And you'll see that through record fuel efficiency, strong labor productivity with T&E count down 3% on 3% more volume and decreases in rents due to better network fluidity. While the results of our initiatives to drive down purchase services are also taking hold, all more than offsetting the wage inflation headwind that we called out last quarter. These strong third quarter results and our operational momentum position us well to achieve our second half and full year targets. We do expect a sequential uptick in OR as we move into the fourth quarter from normal seasonality, including headwinds that we are expecting on the top line, but also due to additional cleanup costs from Hurricane Helene's aftermath. Going forward, we are confident in our ability to continue to improve margins that will generate shareholder value. And the $400 million in cash generated from the line sales along with our goal of reducing CapEx as we move into 2025 will help with much needed balance sheet repair. Mark, I'll hand it back to you. Yeah. So we really had a great quarter. We're confident in meeting the 64% to 65% operating guidance for the second half of the year that we talked about earlier. As we move into the fourth quarter, we are expecting a sequential uptick in the OR and just a couple of things to remember. First, we called out the fuel recoveries this quarter. We don't expect that to recur in the fourth to that same magnitude. But that's -- those recovery is really a great outcome of running a tight railroad in the disciplined processes that John has put into place. So that's a great outcome there. Second, I'd say we're expecting a more normal seasonality. Historically, that's been around 100 basis points of headwind as you move from third to fourth quarter, and a lot of that is due to the revenue headwinds that Ed talked about. I'd also call out, we're able to close on about $20 million of land sales in both the second and third quarters. And as we've talked about, those are difficult to predict. So that could provide some sequential headwind. And then finally, as we called out, we're also going to have to deal with the additional costs from some hurricane cleanup. So that -- just on the expense side, that's around $20 million. But offsetting all that, just on the good side, we've got a lot of operational momentum and really doing a great job here on the productivity front. So that's what gives us confidence to reaffirm that second half guidance. Yeah, Mark, if I could just add. As far as locomotives are concerned, we're looking at pushing back as far as we can our capital commitments to locomotives. And you're right, converting that resilience railroading and the disciplined approach to resources allows us to redo all of those things and really look for capital investments that create value either in a niche area like our B3 for the warrior coal that we've got or other things that Ed might bring online and help us really achieve a faster, more precise service delivery against new business call. But we're taking a really hard look at the IT projects that we've got working closely with Anil, Meena and her team looking at the resource consumption are really driving that ability. So it's just -- it's most -- it's both OpEx and capital that we're attacking here. Yeah. And I would agree. And while it's early days in the reservation system, I'm really confident that as we work through this, our customers are going to enjoy the discipline that brings to our terminals. Because they've been a part of its development. And what I'm excited about is the opportunity to add 100, 200, 300, 500, 1,000 feet to our intermodal trains or existing trains as we create the discipline smoothing out our network through the rest of the year and into next year. And then being able to really project what our true capacity is as far as that growth because I think we're just on the cusp of really hitting our stroke on long trains and bringing on new business at very low incremental costs.

            "name": "Ed Elkins",
            "content": "Well, thank you, John, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll start on Slide 10 with a review of our commercial results for the third quarter, where you'll see that the work we're putting into creating a fluid network and dependable service delivered year-over-year revenue and volume growth. Overall revenue of $3.05 billion was 3% higher than the third quarter in the prior year, and volume moved up 7% year-over-year, with all three segments contributing gains for the quarter, while RPU fell 4% as our price gains were outpaced by lower fuel surcharge revenue, lower coal prices, and unfavorable impacts from intermodal mix. You've heard me discuss all these factors in previous quarters. The merchandise segment produced year-over-year volume growth led by our grain markets and segments of our chemicals business. NS was able to deliver this growth backed by a service product that our customers can count on every day, and you've heard me talk all year long about our focus on our merchandise business and the increased value to our customers is evident, as this marks the 37th out of the prior 38 quarters where merchandise RPU less fuel grew year-over-year. Now, Hurricane Helene impacted certain segments of our merchandise business in the southeast, but we expect volumes to gradually recover as our affected customers operations normalize over time. Intermodal revenue grew 4% year-over-year this quarter, as volume growth of 9% was offset by a 5% decline in RPU. Stagnant truck prices continue to pressure domestic intermodal rates, and unfavorable mix trends continue with strong gains in international and domestic, outpacing our premium market volumes in intermodal. The ILA strike negatively impacted our international volumes, but we expect the majority of this volume will be recovered in the months ahead. Finishing up here with coal, revenue declined 2% for the third quarter. Our year-over-year volumes finished up 11% with declining export prices, an unfavorable mix within the portfolio pushed down RPU by 11%. The coal business saw headwinds from easing export prices and challenged utility segment factors to include low natural gas prices, high stockpiles, and reduced demand in coal-burning regions. Turning to the next slide, let's talk through our outlook for the remainder of the year. Overall, we expect our markets to experience tempered growth, albeit with some discrete headwinds from market trajectory and mixed impacts on certain sectors. It's very important to note that the impact of fuel price normalization from the 2022 historic highs will remain the single largest revenue headwind that we face, and this has been true all year long. We expect our merchandise business to see continued but sedate growth supported by easing interest rates and ongoing infrastructure projects, although sector-specific headwinds in various sectors in our automotive and metals markets will pose challenges. Intermodal will see strong demand driven by our dependable service product, by new bid awards, and import-export demand despite the interruptions caused by the ILA strike that ended on October 3. We're prepared to handle international shipments that were delayed during that interruption. Our outlook for coal is really a mixed bag, as seaborne pricing for met coal is trending downward. On the other hand, we're seeing positive momentum in the thermal export markets. And finally, in the wake of the destruction caused by Hurricane Helene, we stand ready to support our customers and handle the goods and products needed to help the affected regions rebuild. And as always, I will end with a word of thanks to our customers for their partnership and their support. With that, I'll welcome Jason Zampi to the call to talk about our financial results. Thank you. Sure. Yeah. In the fourth quarter, we certainly expect to see continued growth in the intermodal product, both on the international side, but also on the domestic side. We see strong demand out there, and we've confirmed that with some of our key partners that we talk to every single day that they're seeing the same thing. So we're looking for a robust fourth quarter. From intermodal, the only headwind there is going to be premium and those are pretty well-known headwinds in terms of the challenges that, that particular market is facing. On the coal side, we see a lot of demand on export thermal. But let's be clear, seaborne prices for met are continuing to be a drag. And there's a lot of stockpile build on the domestic side. So there'll be some headwinds, some puts and takes. Mark's already talked about -- or excuse me, automotive and steel. We're keeping an eye on those. But we feel very good about our ability to capture every single opportunity that we're able to get in front of. Hi, Ken. I'll start with the last question first. I think we're going to see coal prices continue to drift lower. I don't think double digit, but we'll see. We're taking a very conservative approach to it here. And then on the question of overall volumes in the fourth quarter, we've seen a really nice catch up after the disruption from the port strike and from Helene and the areas that have recovered already. And we feel very confident. And I think this is one thing that it's hard to get across on a call, but we feel very confident in our ability to recapture volume no matter where it comes from, whether it's continued West Coast imports or more East Coast flowing through in the wake of the strike. So you put that together with what I would call some opportunistic spot moves that we've been able to pick up in the third quarter that may continue in the fourth. On the merchandise side, what the Norfolk is really doing right now, and John and his team are working really closely with us is we're really manufacturing a lot of capacity that we can deploy to be very agile. So you think about the rapid increase run-up in West Coast imports before the strike. And now we're much more fluid on the East Coast coming through. So I fully expect that whatever the market presents, we're going to be able to handle. Absolutely. And we're still working on what '25 looks like there's clearly a lot of lot of moving parts out there. But let's be clear about this. We're not sitting on our hands. We're not just waiting around to see what's going to happen. My team as well as John's are working together right now to build a service product that does one thing and that's produced service that you can count on delivered by people that you can trust every single day. And on top of that, we're working to build what I would consider to be a unique value proposition because of the technology that we're deploying at the customer level to make it very easy to do business with. That's a process change as well as some technology augmentation, but I think it's going to be a real differentiator in 2025. We look forward to the response from our customers on both counts. Thank you, Ravi, by the way. We've had a very successful year so far in terms of being able to price to the value of our service and that value is increasing as the year goes on. And we're very confident that we're going to finish up the year in a strong position. Going in '25 we continue to believe that we're going to outpace inflation in all of our major markets. Now commodity prices like seaborne coal probably be a headwind. We'll see how that evolves in '25. But when you think about our core product and the value of the service that we're offering, it's increasing and our customers are saving money at the same time. So it's a powerful combination. I'm a little bit readier than to get a lot into '25 because we're still building our view of that particular dimension. But I will tell you -- the U.S. has remained remarkably competitive over time. I think we're going to continue to do that, particularly when I think about export thermals, we're in a very good spot in terms of demand. I expect that to generally continue. And China is going to determine a lot about what happens with export met demand. There's a tremendous amount of geopolitical uncertainty that's driving a lot of commodity prices, driving a lot of energy prices. But we've got our weather eye on it, and we are fully prepared and capable of delivering the tonnage of our customers around the globe on need. On the premium side, there's still a lot of headwinds out there emanating from the highway generally. We are seeing -- I mean, you got to look at it from a fairly substantial distance, but we are seeing truck utilization head up. And I think we're close to the 10-year average now, and I think we're going to trend above it. You look at the total number of motor carriers that are out there, it's declining slowly. But both those things, along with feedback that we're getting from our key partners like J.B. Hunt and Hub Group are telling us that we're reaching a point where I fully expect that pricing is going to eventually inflect. I do think we're around the bottom now, and I have Phil at least somewhat confident knocking on the table here that that's true. Premium is a different story. We'll see how that evolves. What we are focused on is making sure that we're delivering exactly the product that, that particular segment needs."

            "name": "John Orr",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In Q3, our team drove system-wide improvements that are demonstrating how our focus on safety is protecting our people and our organization, while serving as the foundation for sustainable service and productivity improvements. I am delighted to share our transformation agenda proof points. Our guiding value is safety. Overall, I'm very encouraged with our progress on safety. While our FRA personal injury rate has increased, serious injuries and total accidents have declined significantly, 40% and 20% respectively. Our blueprint for commitment starts with our people. They are value creators. Through our new Thoroughbred Academy, we are investing in the work environment and core railway skills. In the quarter, over 300 top-level operations leaders completed the first of a multi-year curriculum that builds organizational trust and drives business performance. And over the next three months, 2,300 frontline and operating officers will participate in safety curriculums. Turning to service, with safety as our guiding value. Service performance is our North Star. The team is designing out handlings and extending train schedules, which is producing gains in speed and consistency. Q3 car velocity was 13% higher year-over-year, driven by a 9% increase in train speed and progressive reductions in terminal dwell. The productivity improvements driving service are also allowing us to accelerate cost reduction and create a more competitive platform for growth. Our flywheel of cost takeout initiatives has been robust. Year-to-date, we've reduced over 130 crew starts per day, with an 8% reduction in cost per start, including a 20% reduction in overtime and the elimination of attendance and other unproductive incentives. On the intermodal front, the new intermodal reservation system is helping us develop a unique value proposition in the industry by adding terminal visibility, accountability, and rigor. Locomotive productivity in the quarter improved 18% year-over-year, allowing us to reduce our fleet and capital requirements for both rolling stock and engines. We've stored over 500 locomotives and have moved 8,000 plus cars offline since March. This has allowed us to challenge previous capital spending assumptions. Through our new precision energy management program, we've optimized HPT standards, extended train schedules, and are relaying more power from train to train, keeping assets in productive revenue service longer. As a result, fuel efficiencies are at record levels. Our strategy is both targeted and broad, tactical and strategic, ranging across structural improvements in consumption, procurement, materials management, purchase service optimization, crew cost efficiencies, and productive enhancements. And we've just scratched the surface in extolling a few of the initiatives that are within our pipeline that are helping us close the competitive gap and track confidently to our cost reduction commitments. As we move to the next slide, I want to take a moment to state how proud I am of our response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, especially to our engineering teams. They proactively protected our employees, communities, and assets. Our recovery demonstrates the breadth and capability of our team. Responders cleared over 15,000 trees, managed over 1,000 locations with power outages, repaired multiple washouts and scour locations, and supported local responders, including two instances where they led life-saving civilian rescues. This resilience highlights our preparedness and ability to recover swiftly from natural disasters. None of this is possible without an inspired and committed team. We are enriching a strong culture by blending external talent with legacy leaders in a field first management team that is accelerating solutions and deepening ownership and accountability. Our new labor agreements enable us to innovate across our entire workforce. So, what you see is that we have established a new baseline and standards heading into Q4. These are providing next-level perspectives of our assets, their utilization, and the service quality they unlock. Working as a field-centric team, we are building a safer, more efficient, and more resilient operation. Success breeds success. Thank you, and I'll turn it to Ed. Yeah. Chris, great question. And I would say, I'm really pleased the way we exited Q3 on safety. We finished Q3 at 2.05 and we're into the quarter at $1.5 million. And as you know, in a precision railway environment when things are working in the rhythm they're supposed to. And first and foremost, from a safety perspective, you get a lot of momentum. And we're seeing that in the terminals. And our terminal dwell is continuing to improve. And that's being achieved not only through the terminal itself, but how we're looking at reduction in handlings and accelerating cars through terminals by extending schedules of trains. So the work complexity is coming down while the capability is increasing. And that's playing out in fuel, that's playing out in a lot of purchase and services that taxi reductions, et cetera. And now we're able to negotiate and structurally change some of our vendor agreements that put more discipline around those things as a result of how we're improving. So I would say those are some of the cost and then the puts are also as we use our resources better we're able to create more opportunities for Ed to sell into spot markets and increase even our permits. So Ed, any color on that? Well, Scott, I'm glad you recognize the work that our -- all of our team is doing, including our craft labor. They are really embracing our management and leadership style. And that's reflected in some of the CBAs there that we've got TAs against. I would say that labor productivity, we're just getting started on having a disciplined approach to our operations where we're looking at not just the head count, but how we -- how people are deployed and our train structures designing out handlings, designing out train stops and the elongating schedules allows us to increase the productivity of not only our people but also the resources like locomotives. And so I think these gains they're starting to really get traction and they'll continue to get traction. I really think that you can't underestimate the power of leadership and the power of the team. And you see our engagement with labor as being very collaborative and they're a major stakeholder in our PSR 2.0 application. Last month, we had over 65 labor leaders, including presidents of national governing bodies coming to Atlanta and talking about issues and really understanding what we're doing and embracing our philosophy on railroading. And look, they had some really challenging questions. They had some different points of view. But we were able to work through those things and come out with a really cohesive perspective on what we need to go forward. So I would say that I don't want to put the burden on any particular group shoulders to bear. I think as a team, we're bearing a lot of discipline of change and the commitment to change and that's reflected in the women and men who work for us. And as I've said, railroading is a tough business. It's a 365, 24/7. And when we're creating the environment where people feel that they're contributing and they feel fulfilled and what they do and who could be more fulfilled than contributing to the U.S. economy the way we do. So I think the story is just starting to be written. I would say the confidence for me comes in the power of the team. And I look to my own experience through Hunter Camp back in the early 2000s and how Hunter encourage us to find the small wins and 1,000 small wins by an army of people who are believing in continuous improvement add up to a lot. And as we work through our investment in people and the almost 2,800 engagements that we're doing through the balance of the year, we're educating people on the specifics of PSR 2.01, how to really contribute to it. We're promoting the culture of change and really removing the mud as Hunter would say. And we're providing people the ability then to apply what we're teaching them on their jobs day to day. And that's really finding organic improvements. And then we've got our strategy where we're unlocking the value of the network. And that's the beauty of starting with two terminals like Chattanooga and Conway and really understanding how they work. And now we're able to force multiply those learnings and engage real asset utility. And now we're thinking -- rethinking how we use our assets. And we see that in some of our pool distributions and our asset management and the refinements. A great example is how we're moving the cars out of Detroit instead of stopping them in Toledo, and moving them over to Bellevue and then going to Elkhart we're able to repurpose a secondary yard and go right from Detroit right to Elkhart, removing assignments, removing car days, reducing our power locomotive fleet requirements. And those ideas are coming from the field up. And so it's really taking hold -- is a long answer to say the story is just unfolding here. And as we invest in people, as we engage in clearing out the organizational mud and the case for change is still there. There's a lot to be fixed here. And I think we're reflecting --"

            "name": "Mark George",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Here with me today are John Orr, our Chief Operating Officer, Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer, and Jason Zampi, our recently appointed Chief Financial Officer. I've had the privilege of working closely with Jason during my five-year tenure at Norfolk Southern, and he brings incredible talent, experience, and leadership to our executive team. Over the last few weeks, it's been energizing to connect with labor leaders, regulators, customers, and my fellow railroaders across the Norfolk Southern network. We have a strong franchise with diversified markets, high-quality customers and partners, as well as skilled employees who are committed to successfully executing on our strategy and delivering for our shareholders, customers, colleagues, and communities. Speaking of colleagues and communities, I want to thank our amazing team of railroaders who planned for and responded valiantly to the devastation that Hurricane Helene caused across our network. It was their fast and effective actions that resulted in us being able to recover and serve our communities within days. There's a lot more work to do, but we've made enormous progress. It's the tremendous skill and dedication of our railroaders that have enabled us to deliver third-quarter results that are among the best in the company history. Together, we drove productivity, grew volumes, and delivered notable sequential and year-over-year margin improvement while overcoming a challenging landscape. We achieved 3% higher revenue compared to the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share was 23% higher than the third quarter last year. Importantly, we delivered 570 basis points of adjusted OR improvement, bringing that ratio down to 63.4%, continuing to close the margin gap with peers. You'll hear today from John about the incredible work of the operations team that is driving significant and sustainable improvements, as well as resilience in overcoming multiple weather challenges and an East Coast port disruption. Their commitment to excellence is helping us build a stronger, more efficient network. We also accelerated volumes in the quarter. Ed will provide greater detail on the components, the drivers, and outlook for our markets. And finally, Jason will provide color to a number of notable achievements in terms of productivity, as well as line sales and project rationalization. I'll turn it over now to John to start with an overview of our operational progress. John? Thanks, Jason. We are proud of our results in the quarter. Let me summarize some of what you just heard. First, we drove improvements in safety in the quarter despite volume increases and the significant weather events. Second, we leveraged attrition in the quarter while handling robust volume growth resulting in productivity gains while not compromising service. Third, we delivered strong operational resiliency recovering service quickly following numerous disruptive weather events with Helene being the most severe. Fourth, we executed upon major line sales that we signaled last quarter providing meaningful cash proceeds that will help us accelerate balance sheet repair. Finally, we delivered strong financial results in the third quarter, even with the volume pressures in the last eight days of September and we are on track for our second half and full year OR commitments, even if the full year revenue falls a little short of our guidance, which is to be up roughly 1%. So with that, let's open it up to questions. Thanks, Chris. This is Mark. Yeah, we've got really great momentum right now on the cost side. John can talk about that in a second. I think right now, we feel really good about those things that we can control. Yeah, as we talked about in Laguna, we were getting a little bit concerned about the auto and steel markets and that's starting to really play out the way we previewed. So that's definitely going to be something we keep our eye on. But generally speaking, intermodal is we expect to peak season. Intermodal should be good. Obviously, the port disruptions we don't know exactly when and how the volumes will manifest here in the fourth quarter. But generally, we feel really, really good about the way we go in the fourth quarter. John, why don't you talk a little bit about the momentum we've got on the cost side and then add a little bit more on the revenue. Jason? Yeah. Great question, Brian. You really nailed the strategy here. I think with John taking more than 500 locomotives off-line, that allows us to really start to deploy capital elsewhere and actually constrain our capital to a large degree. And we brought in a nil to run the IT organization. And we've been reprioritizing and really reevaluating all the projects we have in the pipeline. And we're going to focus on a more concentrated portfolio of projects that are going to yield high returns, the fastest possible projects that we can work on to generate high returns. So we fully expect that CapEx next year will come down. And obviously, with the line sales we have this year and the cash buildup that we expect to have toward the end of the year, we fully expect to be back in the market repurchasing shares to some modest level next year. Thanks for the question. Thank you, Brian, next question? Thank you, next question please. Thanks a lot. Next question? Hey, thank you, Tom. Great question. Let's bifurcate and just say that for the things we can control, which is cost. We've got a path. You will recall that we had committed to $250 million of cost reduction this year. We are on track to hit that number. We committed to another $150 million next year. So regardless of the economic environment, we committed to another $150 million next year in 2025. We're going to beat that. And John and I have spent a lot of time talking about this. I think there's a real opportunity to fast forward some cost reduction from 2026 into 2025. So we feel really, really confident there. We can't control the top line and the economic environment, except to say that there is share recapture opportunity out there. So even if you have a softer market, we still have some idiosyncratic opportunities to recapture some share to help mitigate any pressure that might be there. So obviously, there's a limit to how much you can get in any given year. But given the product that John and his team are putting out there for service, we feel really, really good about the traction and momentum we have with our customer base. John, do you want to talk any more about the confidence in our cost reduction next year? Tom, when we put those targets out, they were targets. Now we're filling in that outline with real specific actions, and we're realizing that we were maybe a little modest in the targets that we saw in front of us because the actions now tallied a little bit more as we're putting together our 2025 number. So it feels good. Now Ed, do you have any thoughts on '25 outlook? Thanks, Tom. Next question? Yeah. I think starting with your second one, absolutely. We're still on track for that. And you remember the components, there were components of cost reduction there. And the 1 to 150 million was really based on kind of a more modest top line outlook of a middling 2% to 3% type of top line growth. But then if we had a more traditional top line recovery, that would get us to the sub-60% in by the three to four-year time window. So we stand by those guidance indicators. Now with regard to structurally anything different. I think what I would tell you is we are on track. We've got some great momentum. The strategy at its core is exactly what we're going to stick to. And this really gets to about execution right now. And we have a really sound operating team that is executing upon the strategy to create network fluidity that will allow for a really great service product. And as we always said, with that great service product, it will enable growth. You started to see that play out last quarter and now again this quarter. We've got some idiosyncratic opportunities to grow, and Ed and his team have been capturing on it. So that worked, and we told you that productivity is kind of the third leg of that strategy. And honestly, you also saw that play out in the third quarter. We had fallen out of balance with the strategy on productivity. We told you we were going to get back in balance, and we're well on our way to doing that with 570 basis points of OR improvement, thanks to a sprinkling of some volume here in this quarter, it was a real accelerant. But even the sequential improvement is very encouraging. So execution is what's key. And John and I talk about that a lot. And I kind of touched on it a little bit at Laguna I really embrace an operational excellence mindset coming from my background in industrial products. And I believe strongly that any good operation needs a quality type system, you can call it Six Sigma, you can call it ACE like we used to call it a mile company, which is achieving competitive excellence. Either way, you've got to have really solid standard processes that are based on best practices. You've got to get those systematized so that everybody follows it. And when you have breakdowns in the process, you do relentless root cause analysis to identify where the problems are and then fix the standard processes so you can mistake proof going forward. That's this virtuous cycle that we have to get ourselves into. And the beauty is, when an operator like John and John's team, what you hear about -- there's a real resemblance to what I'm describing. In fact, when John talks about the war rooms, what do you think the war rooms are? Those are relentless root cause analysis. Every time they have an issue, the war room gets to work on it. They figure out what the root cause is, they fix it. So we are in lockstep on driving that culture. And I'm really, really excited about that. And then I think the other thing is, obviously, culturally, I want to continue to advance first, our safety culture, but also a real two-way communication. John touched upon that a couple of minutes ago as well. But a two-way communication where information flows up, not just down. A lot of the best ideas that come inside this railroad are from the people who are on the ground, whether that's in the marketing organization, with what's happening with our customer base, whether that's in the operations team like John just described. We have to create that environment where people are comfortable to speak of. And it's not just process stuff. It's not just ideas for improvement, but it's also concerns that they might have. So we're going to be really working on creating and fostering a better culture for two-way communication. And then I would say, finally, Ed and I have been having a lot of conversations about really working a lot closer with our customer base to figure out exactly how we can serve them better to accelerate the share gains and the share recapture opportunities that are out there. So that's where I'd say the focus will be structurally going forward. And thanks a lot for the question, Brandon. Appreciate it. Next? Thanks, John. Next question, please? Thanks a lot, Jeff. Next question? Jordan, I think what John has done decongesting the terminals and networks, it goes a long way to improving resiliency. I mean laying down 500 locomotives over 8,000 cars since Q1. And you create a lot more fluidity in the network. And when you add little bumps in the road, you have less congestion to hold you back from recovery. So that, I think, key and critical. And you saw it play out here in the third quarter following these storms. I would tell you a year ago, some of the events that we saw in the quarter probably would have set us back three months, okay? But we were back within a week and now we're actually at record network speeds and load wells. So it's really remarkable. And I do actually just want to refute the notion that resiliency is about retaining costs. In fact, we've achieved resiliency this quarter while lowering costs. So it's a good news story. We seem to have a good model in place here. Thanks for the question, Jordan. Next? You have to think of it, Ravi, in the elements when you talk about pricing, you can't talk about it as one topic, right? Merchandise, as I just said, we feel really good, really strong service helps as a good backdrop there as those inflation. So the model is intact. I think intermodal is going to be somewhat dependent on what happens with spot truck pricing. Clearly, we seem to have found the bottom. The question is when does it start coming off the floor here? And yeah, we have other commodity groups that follow indices that we don't control, obviously, in seaborne met being a big one. So -- but I think for those areas, like particularly merchandise in 2025, models intact. We feel really good. Thank you. Appreciate the question. Let's try to get another couple in. Next question, please? That brings us to the end. Look, I want to thank everyone for your questions, and we look forward to talking to you all throughout the quarter. Have a great day. Thank you."

Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Thursday, July 25, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Luke, please go ahead.\nLuke Nichols: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the of the safe harbor provision Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events for future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for full disclosure of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with our reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures, including adjusted or non-GAAP operating ratio. Please note that all references to our prospective operating ratio during today's call are being provided on an adjusted basis as referenced in our earnings release. Turning to Slide 3, it's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you, Luke, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Here with me today are John Orr, our Chief Operating Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier, we reported our second quarter financial results, including adjusted quarter adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion, net income of $694 million, and diluted earnings per share of $3.06. Notably, we delivered 480 basis points of sequential margin improvement on our adjusted operating ratio. OR was 65.1% in the second quarter, with a first half OR of 67.5%, making good on our commitment to our shareholders to a first half operating ratio in the range of 67% to 68%. Our strong progress over this quarter demonstrates our ability to close the gap to our peers by executing our balanced strategy of service, productivity, and growth with safety at its core. The Thoroughbred team delivered significant margin improvement in the quarter despite revenue headwinds, by accelerating productivity initiatives. As you will hear from John, Ed, and Mark, we were able to overcome market weakness through increasingly strong progress on our six key operational metrics by responding to market opportunities and growing volume and remaining laser focused on controlling costs. We also take seriously our commitment to being the gold standard of safety in the industry and continue to make progress on improving our safety culture and metrics. This is the strength of our strategy, driving operable excellence and discipline that will deliver and will continue to deliver productivity gains and create the foundation to onboard significant growth when the market returns. This is the flywheel effect that is delivering tangible benefits for customers and shareholders. Efficient operations with a compelling service product allowed our teams to gain share in service-sensitive markets such as auto and intermodal, while participating in spot opportunities in coal and agriculture. As a result, we posted record performance in several key merchandise measures. While our work continues, our second quarter results represent an encouraging inflection point in our operating performance. We have plenty of runway in front of us. I'm excited for Norfolk Southern's opportunities ahead. We're committed to our strategy and delivering the results with pace and urgency that demonstrate the power of a better way for our employees, customers, communities and shareholders. I'll now turn it over John to further discuss our operational progress.\nJohn Orr: Thank you, Alan. It's a pleasure to provide an update on our progress. Turning to Slide 5. At NS, safety enables performance and our commitment to safety is unwavering. During the quarter, we leveraged our NS leadership framework to strengthen our field safety. We continued our efforts to focus on mainline accident reductions and we commissioned three additional inspection portals and added field sensors. These have contributed to our best-in-class mainline accident rate. We also conducted two cross-functional leadership safety summits, strengthening our capabilities and reinforcing safety from the ballast to the boardroom. Turning to Slide 6. Our metrics improved across all of our core network performance indices. Our balanced approach proved safety, service and cost improvements work best together. Year-to-date, we have reduced our active online motor power fleet by 320 locomotives and have targeted an additional 100 reductions in the second half. As we store locomotives, we use reliability metrics to remove the worst performers, driving up overall fleet reliability and driving down maintenance, materials and fuel expense. Quarter-over-quarter, we increased our GTMs for available horsepower by 6% and our car velocity by 6%. Both improvements are the result of design processes that drive out time and cost, both in terminals and over the road. Our strategy includes structural improvements in fuel procurement, materials management, purchase service optimization, crew cost efficiency and productivity enhancements. So let's take a look at a few of the initiatives in the pipeline that are closing the gap as we track for the $250 million cost takeout commitment. Turning to Slide 7. We have delivered a 6% improvement in car velocity by reducing handlings, extending train schedules and improving connection performance. Car velocity is something I monitor closely. It captures improvements in our operating plan, terminal execution and over-the-road performance. For example, during the quarter, we eliminated over 700 unnecessary car handlings per day. Driving car velocity in response to overall train speed improvements includes working with our customers to rightsize the inventory in their pipelines as train speed and car velocity improve, fewer cars are required to service the current volume. In the quarter, we delivered a reduction of 3% of cars online. We are improving safety, train speed and service reliability by addressing unscheduled train stops and dispatching practices. For example, our mechanical war rooms root cause analysis of every unscheduled train stop has resulted in an 18% reduction of fees and scheduled stops in Q2. We have a new network operations watchdog team, bringing extreme discipline to planned adherence. They challenged the root cause for every extra train. This has instilled network-wide visibility and accountability to execution and planning. I'm really encouraged that this has increased connections and train yield and has driven out extra train starts from 200 in March to just 50 in June. These improvements to our operating plan and terminal discipline have resulted in a 4% reduction in crew starts. The combination of crew and overtime reductions has dropped our crew expense per kGTM by 8% compared to Q1. As operational effectiveness grows, we are recalibrating our standards and sweating the network resources even further. This is the path to at least 7% to 10% improvement in car velocity. Yard and local redesigns are underway. We driving out waste and rework in the first mile and last mile operations. We are unlocking the capacity to take on additional work within the same footprint. Efficiency in this space is really important to me since we allocate approximately 50% of crew starts here. Over the next 24 months, we will continue to improve fuel productivity. We will continue to push locomotives, leverage trip optimizer to assertively manage horsepower per ton, turn power more quickly, improve fuel distribution and vendor accountability and increased train size. We are targeting locomotive productivity improvements of an additional 8%. One of my personal objectives is to develop the next generation of skilled PSR railroaders and to build the bench strength to sustain the improvements that I'm leading. We are structuring the organization to drive the daily and strategic outcomes, and I am proud and encouraged by the engagement of people in every department and across the entire organization. The team is working collaboratively and with confidence. Our team is energized and motivated to build upon the strength of the quarter and deliver the next wave of initiatives that will yield savings in all P&L categories beyond just comp and bang, but in materials, rents and purchased services, success breeds success. I want to close out my remarks on Slide 8 and 9 with two flywheel examples of balancing service and cost. In automotive, our car velocity increased by 16%, creating the platform for growth as our carloads increased by 7%. Within intermodal, shipments and service performance simultaneously increased by 8%. This following the 15% lane rationalization we discussed earlier this quarter. And what's really important to me is that we are launching our NS intermodal reservation system in September. This smooth strain demand reduces rents and expenses and creates service certainty. Our customers are enjoying some of the best sustained service ever. At the same time, we have consolidated train starts, streamlined our service plan, reduced handling complexity and have driven out cost. We are unlocking tremendous value within our franchise, adding new capability, urgently eliminating waste and driving to a sub-60 OR. Now, I'll turn it over to Ed.\nEd Elkins: Hey, thank you, John, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Let's go to Slide 11, and I'll review our commercial results for the second quarter. Overall results were driven by a notably more fluid network that delivered a better service product to our customers. Revenues came in just above $3 billion, a 2% increase versus last year. Volumes rose 5%, led by an 8% increase in intermodal, while RPU fell 3%, driven by unfavorable impacts from intermodal mix. Merchandise revenue improved 4% while volumes increased 2% and RPU rose 3%. RPU less fuel increased 4% versus last year, which once again set an all-time record alongside a new all-time record for revenue less fuel. This marks the 36th out of the prior 37 quarters, where merchandise RPU less fuel grew year-over-year. In Intermodal, revenue was flat. Volume increased 8%, and RPU declined 8%. And in coal, revenue declined 3% on a 2% volume decrease. Now these were impacted by the outage of the Francis Scott Bridge in Baltimore. I do want to take a second here to reflect on Kohl's performance in the face of extraordinary challenges around the unprecedented closure of the Baltimore port complex in April. We and our customers demonstrated extraordinary operational agility and creativity to keep global supply chains intact via Lamberts Point, Virginia until service was restored in Baltimore. I'll note that propelling our record merchandise less fuel in the quarter was our automotive book, which set a record for total revenue and RPU less fuel. Metals, achieved an all-time quarterly record an all-time revenue less fuel and chemicals, which marked an all-time record for RPU less fuel. Intermodal revenue was flat in the quarter. However, if we exclude pressure from fuel and storage charges, revenues grew by 2% despite the mix and price headwinds. All of these superlatives are supported the strong service product that John and his team are delivering. Let's turn to Slide 12 and review our outlook for the rest for the rest of 2024. We're lowering our expectations for full year revenue growth to around 1% based on continuing market cost currents, and we expect overall adverse mix headwinds to continue. In merchandise, new industrial activity may be constrained by higher interest rates and borrowing costs, but we expect to see continued benefits from ongoing infrastructure and manufacturing projects underway. Our improved network fluidity will also deliver growth and unlock shareholder value. Intermodal volumes remain a driver of overall volume growth as international shipments rise through import and export demand while excess capacity and weak truck prices are expected to remain headwinds to domestic volumes. And finally, in coal, we foresee a challenged environment within the utility space continuing, while export markets see some momentum from the reopening of the Baltimore channel and new production. All right. Let's finish up on Slide 13. I'm going to take a minute to highlight a recent win-win with a large met coal producer in producer in the US. Set to be developed 2025, our rail lines will link this new coal production facility with the global market. This mine will produce will produce nearly 5 million short tons of premium grade in met-coal annually when it reaches full production. This new partnership is a concrete example of our strategy to grow high-quality carload revenue, close the gap to peers in key markets and significantly enhance our met coal portfolio for years and years to come. This win also demonstrates our customers' confidence in Norfolk Southern in our service and our commitment to our strategy. We're grateful to be chosen for this project, and we're excited for the future of this opportunity. Investing strategic capital to support regions of our network with economic growth is also in motion. The State of Alabama is an example where our investments include terminal and mainline infrastructure projects that support customers as they invest and expand their businesses. These investments are a key part of our balanced approach to deliver top-tier revenue growth over the long term. And finally, I just want to thank our customers for their business. I'll now turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results.\nMark George: Thanks, Ed and good afternoon everyone. Let's start on Slide 15 with a quick reconciliation of GAAP results on the left and the adjusted results on the right. You'll see that the Eastern Ohio incident Eastern Ohio incident column is actually income in the quarter of $65 column as our $156 million of insurance recoveries exceeded the additional costs that were accrued. In the restructuring column, you will also see income as we booked a favorable true-up to our Q1 separation cost accruals, but also realized an associated favorable postretirement curtailment adjustment within our other income line item. We also highlight under the advisory cost column, expenses incurred in Q2 associated with a proxy context. Adjusted results, including a 65.1% OR was in line with our guidance range. EPS of $3.06 was aided by $0.05 below the line from a favorable state income tax adjustment. On the next chart, Slide 16, I'll go through the year-over-year and sequential variances compared to the adjusted results. Our second quarter performance was a function of dose of revenue lift combined with the team making excellent progress on network performance and providing strong service that enabled us to remove cost from our structure. Year-over-year revenue was up $64 million or 2%, with volumes up 5%, but RPU was down 3%. As Ed discussed, adverse mix remained a headwind to RPU in the quarter. Operating expenses were down $7 million year-over-year despite inflation headwinds, reflecting strong momentum on cost takeout, which drove 160 basis points of OR improvement. The cost reduction momentum is especially evident when looking at the sequential decline of $119 or 6% on $40 million more revenue combining to drive up a large 480 basis point sequential reduction in our operating ratio and will most certainly result in a sharp narrowing of the OR gap with the industry. Drilling into the revenue change on Slide 17, focusing here on the sequential increase in revenue from Q1 of $40 million. That was driven by merchandise volume growth. Yet despite what appears as a favorable mix shift at the high level, with a 2% rise in merchandise volume, RPU to Q1 was only flat, and that's because mix within each business line was adverse, as you'll see illustrated in the gray box where volume growth of below average RPU business lines exceed volume growth in the above average business lines. Shifting to a sequential look at operating expense on Slide 18. I'll start by saying it's nice to see all green on this chart. OpEx is down $119 million versus the first quarter. The dramatic acceleration in our network velocity has allowed us to drive out the remaining service mitigation costs in the quarter, which shows up in several categories, including comp and ben, most notably over time, but also in equipment rents, purchase services as well as other. The ops team did a terrific job speeding up the network and improving service to deliver on these cost savings, as well as fuel efficiency improvements. You'll also see savings in the comp and ben from lower employee levels, largely driven from the previously announced downsizing actions that we took in our management ranks, but also sequential attrition of nearly 2% of our T&E workforce. Property gains in the second quarter totaled $25 million compared to zero in Q1, so the first half is pretty much on a normal annual run rate. Real estate transactions are lumpy, and some of you may say that the $25 million in the quarter was 2x a theoretically smoothed amount, but either way you choose to evaluate our results, our OR performance in the quarter was in line with our commitment. So we are very encouraged at what is clearly an inflection point in our cost structure, allowing us to meet the commitment we made on OR despite a weaker volume environment than we had been planning for, demonstrating organizational agility. As we look to the second half, there are various headwinds and tailwinds to consider. Ed noted that the revenue will be softer than we previously expected, with some sequential volume improvement, but adverse mix. And the industry's next contractual wage increase that took effect on July 1 creates a $25 million step up in comp and ben here in the third quarter. However, John talked about our actions and momentum on productivity side within operations, and that will help neutralize the wage impact. All that said, the key message I want to leave you with today is that despite softer macro conditions, we are reaffirming our guidance for the second half operating ratio in the 64% to 65% range. Before I hand to Alan, I'll make a comment on capital. Many of you have seen that with PSR, there is often a liberation of excess capital assets. That boosts efficiency and creates incremental cash flow streams, adding to shareholder returns. We've had some of those in the past several years with some larger asset sales, and we continue to evaluate opportunities and have a robust list of properties for which we are pursuing sales that will simplify our network and generate cash over the next several quarters. Alan?\nAlan Shaw: Thanks Mark. Let's turn to Slide 20. As you heard from Ed, we lowered our full-year revenue guidance from approximately 3% to approximately 1% growth. And you heard from John and Mark that we're overcoming the revenue drop with a focus on the significant productivity opportunities in front of us, which gives us the confidence in reaffirming our full year OR guidance, despite the lower revenue outlook. The momentum demonstrated in the second quarter is a testament to the strength of our strategy. I want to thank all 20,000 of my Norfolk Southern teammates for all they have done and are doing every single day to deliver on our shareholder commitments and accelerate our operational improvements. John, Ed, and Mark have identified specific actions and outcomes to deliver improved results in workforce, T&E, fuel, mechanical, purchase services and rents capital productivity as well as smart growth in merchandise, intermodal and coal. We have a clear line of sight on multiple initiatives and a road map for margin gains in several key areas over the next 18 months as we close the OR gap. I'm proud of our progress in the second quarter, encouraged by our trajectory and confident in our team's ability to execute and deliver results in the quarters ahead. We will now open the call to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First call we have is Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Tom, go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Good afternoon. Ed, you highlighted a number of the yield ex-fuel records and the performance in merchandise. So I wanted to ask you about intermodal yield. Are we seeing intermodal yields at a bottom? Or are there potential drivers that they go down further? And how do you think about the opportunity and the timing to see stronger pricing and revenue per unit in the Intermodal business?\nEd Elkins: Thanks, man. Let me walk you through the -- really the price and mix story in intermodal. Mix and price make up around 6 and 7 points in weakness that you saw there. And that mix is really driven in the premium segment where lower part counts or are really pressuring our carriers to keep their unionized road fleets employed. The other mix piece is we're seeing a lot of empty shipments. On the Intermodal side, we're seeing them and have seen them really all year long in the Intermodal segment -- or excuse me, in the International segment where carriers are really trying to push empties back offshore. We're also starting to see a lot more domestic empty repositioning moves back to the West Coast. We think that's in anticipation of possible ILA action on the East Coast ports there. And then the second part of your question is when does it really -- when does the highway rates get better and when we start to see some of the capacity drop out from the highway carriers that are putting a lot of pressure on rates. I think we're around the bottom. I really do, from what I've seen, from what read and from what I hear from our customers, we're kind of bouncing right along the bottom. And I think we're getting closer and closer to an inflection point. Talking to one of our biggest customers today, they noted that they're expecting a real peak season this year for the first time in a few years. And I think that bodes well both for our international customers as well as for our domestic customers.\nTom Wadewitz: So, it sounds like maybe stability in second half looked to 25% for maybe some growth in revenue per unit. Is that a reasonable way to think about it?\nEd Elkins: Yes. I think RPU on the domestic side is moving sideways.\nAlan Shaw: Thanks, Tom\nTom Wadewitz: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will be coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Scott?\nScott Group: Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. So Mark, maybe just some help on the cost side, $25 million we get from the wage increase in Q3, but obviously, there were some good sequential cost progress. So any way to just help us think about the overall ex fuel trend and OR in Q3? And then maybe just separately, the mix chart the last couple of quarters is really helpful. Do you think this is a -- is this a cyclical phenomenon of negative mix? Or is there something that's maybe more structural about where the growth is coming from?\nMark George: Thanks, Scott, for the question. I'll ask Ed to help tag team on that second part of the question on the mix. But do you want to go first with that?\nEd Elkins: Sure. I can do that. I've already talked about some of the mix challenges that we're seeing in intermodal. And I will tell you, we see the same story that's been playing out in the second quarter going forward into the really third and fourth. We're seeing significant volume growth in some of our lower-rated merchandise commodities like aggregates and finished vehicles, and both of those move at kind of the lower end of that RPU spectrum. We are focused a lot on earning back merchandise share and the additional volume that we are seeing is really attributable to the better velocity and car supply that we're seeing out there. I mean think about what happened in the automotive market where we actually use less equipment to handle a record amount of revenue. It's a real sea change from where we've been in...\nAlan Shaw: Yes, Ed you got something going on in intermodal. We're leveraging most powerful intermodal franchise in the East, we rationalized 15% of our lanes. John is providing the best service product we provide in years and volumes up 8%.\nScott Group: And it gets right down to the basics, right? We sweat the asset efficiencies, moving the most miles per day that we can, driving the efficiencies of our locomotives and creating resiliency at a really low cost by eliminating waste, creating more capacity so we can onboard more customers and lengthen our trains and really drive out the service reliability through our war rooms and our drill down.\nMark George: And that transitions into the first part of the question. We're going to see more incremental volume growth here in the third quarter. That's one of the tailwinds for sure. Even though we'll probably have some mix erode benefit from that adverse mix, I guess. But I'd say another tailwind is, as you touched on, Scott, we've got really good momentum here on the productivity side. So I expect we're going to see continued reductions in crew starts and over time despite higher volumes. I think fuel efficiency should continue to improve and look, we're attacking -- we're in the very, very early innings of attacking purchase services. So we've got some broad-based initiatives there. So we're going to see some really good tailwinds here, I think, in the third quarter. But as you touched upon, headwinds are there. We've got that 4.5% agreement wage increase that takes effect in July 1. So on day one of the third quarter, $25 million step-up in Comp and Ben comes from that, and that's 80 basis points of sequential OR headwind. And on top of that, fuels the way we're modeling it, it seems like fuel is going to be probably 50, 60 basis points of sequential OR headwind as well. So we'll see how it all shakes out here. But ultimately, we're really happy with our position going into the third quarter.\nAlan Shaw: Yes. Look, we're really confident in our guidance for an OR in the second half of the year is 64% to 65%, despite revenue headwinds. And it's because of this flywheel effect that we're seeing and productivity, where a faster network is generating a lot of opportunities for John and his team to unlock savings.\nScott Group: Got it.\nOperator: The next question will be coming from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Ken, go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Hey great. Good afternoon. I know that was recorded, but that seemed like you were on super speed. It was pretty good. Just talking -- I guess, following on Scott's question there with the sequential performance, it seems like the five-year would suggest it doesn't move much in OR. But you're looking at 64%, 65% from a 65% or 65.9% if you exclude the real estate? And I get what you just ran over with, Scott. But it seems like given that the steps you're taking, Alan you kind of said you're really confident in those savings. Shouldn't we be taking, I guess, bigger steps down with some of the things you're doing. Maybe just talk then what is the upside downside to that that target, right? If you're confident in 64%, 65%, what do you need to happen on John's side to maybe get you a little bigger step-up versus the counter cost you have.\nMark George: Well, look, Ken, again, you're right that sequentially, Q2 to Q3, when we look historically, you have some years where you have improvement in the OR. You have other years where you have some level of degradation. I think on average, it's probably slight degradation in this year, which is somewhat of a unique period of time. And this is if you exclude 2020. But in this year, if you look at this period of time, we're expecting sequential volume improvement. So that's really going to help us. And the gravy on top of that is continued momentum in what John is doing, in face of all the headwinds that I laid out. So that's where the confidence is coming from. I don't know John do you want to add?\nJohn Orr: I would say, Ken, my confidence comes from the power of the people and the engagement that we're delivering in the field. In the early days of my onboarding, I would go into major terminals and see opportunities, engage the team, inspire them to lead change, and now as we build the team and reframe how our management structure is in the field, really focused on the day-to-day as well as strategic intent, we're doing that to scale, more people seeing more things. We're creating the flywheel the finders and increased capability. Just today, I signed off on a service design that eliminates 42 starts a week. And that's the result of 4 or 5 people just being out in the field, doing safety Blitz is seeing other things happening and finding ways to improve safety, synthesize train starts elongate trains and create more capability in the field. This is the power of the flywheel. And we're doing it based on safety and service sustainability. And I'm very confident as we build people and structure. We're going to keep delivering.\nMark George: So just getting also to the essence of your question on why not better, I'm just going to repeat what I said to Scott, there is some headwind here in the third quarter from the second quarter related to the wage increase of 80 basis points. And also the way we see the fuel curve playing out, there's probably another 60 basis points of headwind. So we're talking about overcoming that. And those are big hurdles. Maybe fuel is not -- doesn't end up being as bad. That could be some upside. But honestly, we got to see where volume shakes out too.\nKen Hoexter: I think there's going to be a lot of hard work to overcome what we're doing meet our guidance, and it's going to be sweat equity all the way.\nEd Elkins: Agree. And we're targeting more revenue. I mean we know the macro environment is challenged but look, let me give you 2 examples of recent wins that are only possible because of higher velocity and better car supply. We converted a coil line from the highway with our largest middle customer between Indiana and Ohio and that's in a challenged metals market. So we grew inorganically off the highway. We also converted the large highway lane to rail in the state of Georgia with our largest aggregate shipper, all because we're able to handle more tonnage with less equipment.\nOperator: The next question will be coming from Jeff Kauffman from Vertical Research Partners. Jeff, go ahead.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much and congratulations in a tough environment. I just kind of want to get your big-picture view on some of the changes with the STB and the hearings that they're having and how that may or may not impact the rail.\nAlan Shaw: The STB has got a hearing coming up about growth. And that's part of our balanced strategy. The STB is focused on service, so are we? And we're delivering, right? We are improving service, we're reducing costs, we're growing revenue and we're enhancing safety. So we've got a good story to tell here, and we're aligned.\nJohn Orr: And just to add, Alan, when we were in Washington a few weeks ago meeting with the STB commissioners, they were really reinforcing our business plan and resiliency as being an enabler of service and driving the US economy, and they were right in lockstep with our vision. So I think it will -- it's always going to challenge the sector when the commercial regulator wants to talk to the sector. But when we're leading front of all of that, I think it serves us well to continue what we're doing.\nOperator: The next question will come from Chris Wetherbee from Wells Fargo. Chris, go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Thanks. Good afternoon guys. I guess as we're thinking about the progress that you're making John, in particular, as we move through in the back half of the year. I guess, how do we think about headcount? What resources are sort of required given the progress that you're making here? I guess, in other words, should we be able to see further reductions in heads as we move sequentially through the rest of the year?\nJohn Orr: Well, I can tell you this, while it's true, there are fewer T&E head counts, this is not a head count reduction exercise. This is rightsizing the service and aligning the asset efficiencies with the customer and the customer requirements. So sequentially, we did show a 2% improvement on T&E. We've frozen hiring except where there's a really substantial reason or an acute skill that we need to bring on. But it really is working with labor to address outliers, rightsize the organization and where we're long on people, getting the flexibility to move them where they need to be. And I really watch our expense and the cost for T&A -- or sorry, T&E head count in our KGTM. And I made that clear in my opening remarks that despite the fact that we're improving service providing some of the best operating efficiencies in the network, we're doing it at a lower cost overall. And that's what I really focus on eliminating the waste associated with overtime, taxis, hotels, those sorts of things that don't give you any value. So that's where I think you can look forward to seeing more of.\nMark George: And Chris, I would tell you, we are on track to be down 2%, like we had guided previously by the time we get to the end of the year versus the end of last year. And that's on carrying a little bit more volume, right?\nChris Wetherbee: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. Brian, go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking questions. So Mark, just to maybe come back to the sequential headwind of about 140 basis points into 3Q from 2Q, certainly implied that it's more of a fourth quarter weighted impact to get to the target? Or are there some other sort of big ticket items you're counting on coming through the next quarter. And I guess to that point, Ed gave us a couple of examples, but volume environment has been tough to call. It's been a little softer than expected. So what gives you the confidence that some of that's going to come through sequentially to help you hit that target in 3Q?\nMark George: Yes. I think that actually, the profile in the back half, you have a typical challenge in the fourth quarter being a lighter one where you see the OR float up. I actually think because of the momentum we're making there'll be continuous productivity that we get throughout the year. So, while we might get a little bit more volume in the third quarter and a little bit less as you typically would expect in the fourth quarter, the productivity is going to help us sail through. And I would I would imagine that both third and fourth quarter are going to look somewhat similar here.\nOperator: The next question will be coming from Jon Chappell of Evercore ISI. Jon, go ahead.\nJohn Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon. Ed, past and future. First, in the past, is there any way to quantify, if there was any, any potential volume impact from the distraction, if you will, of the last several months, any customers who maybe had some negative muscle memory from cutting to bone and putting in contingency plans ahead of final certainty. And then the second part of it would be for the future. You mentioned some of the wins that you've had from these new service metrics that you're putting up. Do you feel that you have a long list customers who have been resistant to moving to the rail given past service who are now a little bit more open to switching back to the rail network given some of these vast improvements you've made?\nEd Elkins: Yes. I'm trying to remember the first part of your question.\nAlan Shaw: I -- any volume.\nEd Elkins: Yes. look, our customers -- I think you guys know this. Our customers were one of the most supportive groups of our strategy out there as we move through this whole first half of the year and they were rooting for us and they are and they are behind us, helping us unlock additional value for the supply chain right now. And moving forward, look, we had a lot of confidence in growing our volumes across the board. But really, we're focused on one area in particular where we know that we have lost share -- that's in our merchandise markets. And I would say it is not customers that are resistant to coming back to us is customers that we have to earn back because they had to find a different supply chain solution, which probably cost them more money. So we're working really hard every single day earn those customers back, and that's what we're focused on.\nAlan Shaw: Look, our service product sales in this market, right? The two most service-sensitive markets, Automotive and Intermodal grew 7% and 8% on respectively, because of the great product that John Orr and his team are putting together. And because of the alignment between marketing and operations, they're looking for every opportunity to secure additional revenue and additional margin we were able pick up spot opportunities in weak coal markets and weak agriculture markets because of the great product we're delivering and the capacity dividend that John has created.\nEd Elkins: And the relationships that we've built over a long period of time with our customers, who like I said, supported this whole thing.\nAlan Shaw: Great point.\nOperator: The next question will be coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Brandon, go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good afternoon. And thanks for taking my question. And maybe just on a very quick point of clarification. Are you still expecting coal yields to decline in the back half, especially on export because I think that was the prior expectation. And then, Mark, I think in your recorded remarks, you ended your statement talking about, hey, look, we had prior big land sale transactions. We think we've identified a few more. I think that's what I heard. So should we be contemplating that in the forward OR outlook? I think that's maybe where you were going. And you also made a comment that I think you should expect about $12.5 million a quarter. So should we be thinking annualized $50 million gains? Or are you saying there's potentially bigger sales coming. Thank you.\nMark George: Ed, I'll answer that second part first. So the large land gains that I was referring to would be things that we would typically call out and referred to as kind of probably more on the non-GAAP side. And that's really in terms of trying to augment our balance sheet. So no, they are not in any way part of the path on the OR going forward. It was really more of a conversation on capital and restoring our balance sheet. Typically, we guide to $30 million to $40 million a year on real estate gains in the normal course that we absorb within the OR. And there are years where that's $20 million, there are years where that's $50 million, but it's kind of in that 30/40 range. So I was making a more general smoothing commentary talking about, call it, $50 million, but it could be in that neighborhood $40 million, $50 million range this year.\nEd Elkins: Okay. And then you'd asked about coal price as well. There were a few global supply chain disruptions during the quarter caused the slight lift prices, but those gains have mostly eroded away. And the expectation is that rates are going to continue to drift slightly lower the experts that we talk to, and there are several of them are really expecting those seaborne prices to stay north of $200. But we'll see. We'll see what happens.\nOperator: The next question will come from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Ravi, go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you. Good evening, everyone. I think you said earlier that there was something around the East Coast port actions and some customer behavior there. Can you unpack that a little bit more and give us a little more detail there? What are you seeing already, what's some of the time line for this? And kind of where can it go before that settles down?\nEd Elkins: Sure. I'll take that one. I think everyone knows the ILA has done a lot on September 30 to reach agreement with the port operators. We are talking to all of our steamship line customers as well as our domestic intermodal partners. And shippers are starting to hedge their bets a little bit. We see a lot of West Coast activity on the rise for a number of reasons. That includes what's going on in the Red Sea. But as that happens, customers, the BCOs have to get their freight to market. So they're deploying freight to the West Coast as well as the east. And I really believe, and this is just me observing the market. I think with the shortage of containers, seaborne containers that they are out there because of the elongated supply chains. What you're going to see is steamship lines will not want their boxes come in inland off the West Coast. And so there's going to be a lot of demand for domestic intermodal out the West Coast. That's the way I think this thing evolves.\nOperator: The next question will be coming from Elliot Alper for TD Cowen. Elliot, go ahead.\nElliot Alper: Thank you. This is Elliot on for Jason Seidl. You brought up the next lever for margin will be some of the broad-based initiatives in purchased services. Hoping you could elaborate on that. You talked about some of the OpEx items that will be headwinds through the back half of the year. Maybe how should we think about the cadence of purchased services as we progress through the year?\nMark George: Hey, thanks for the question, Elliot. Yes, I mean it's -- obviously, it's a big spend amount that's gone up a lot from technology in the past handful of years, largely subscription-based, cloud-based services. So you see a lot more software costs showing up now and purchase services as opposed to in capital. But at the same time, about -- probably about one-third is related to the volume variable costs associated with intermodal activity. So, Intermodal grew 8% year-over-year, but we actually limited the purchase services increase to around 3%. And actually, sequentially, it was down slightly. So this is an area that we've spent a lot of time, John and I in the past couple of months talking about and we're going to be focused pretty aggressively on trying to find opportunities to bring this down. And certainly, a lot of the other areas of purchased services outside of the volume variable pieces. John, do you want to jump in?\nJohn Orr: Yes. We look -- just take fuel, for example. We're really driving hard to pull locomotives out, reduce our exposure there. But at the same time, looking at our fuel distribution process. We've been able to streamline that, reduce some DTL trucks and reliance on that, similar to how we're pruning the intermodal franchise, we're pruning some of the more expensive fuel and fuel distribution and at the same time then looking at how do we create more vendor accountability and visibility. So we've got some really short-term, midterm and long-term views on fuel. And that even putting locomotives down cascades into our materials and the services associated with maintaining locomotives that we're able to put down.\nMark George: Yes. And one other point on purchase services because you did ask about how it will look at the balance of the year. I would tell you, it is going to be no worse than what you see in the first half. I would expect it to be down year-over-year in the back half.\nAlan Shaw: We've got broad-based focus on productivity, right, purchase service is a big part of that. But we've got a clear line of sight on the road map, drive productivity and workforce and then fuel and purchase services and equipment rents. And at the same time, really focused on leveraging this great service product to drive more merchandise revenue and then leveraging our powerful intermodal franchise as the truck market response to drive more revenue there as well.\nElliot Alper: What do you think about one of the biggest crew costs, recrews?\nAlan Shaw: And how much of that drives services and job you've done on reducing that over time.\nElliot Alper: So we're not increase recrews out, reducing our exposure to -- over time reducing our exposure to taxi cabs, hotels, all the associated costs with that. And that is just a winning proposition because as you reduce recrews, creating service stability, that flies in the real house of Ed and being able to sell, that's the power of the resiliency that we're creating at the lowest cost possible and the flywheel of mobility.\nOperator: The next question will be coming from Daniel Imbro from Stephens Incorporated. Daniel go ahead.\nDaniel Imbro: Yes. Thanks. Good evening, guys. I wanted to circle back to winning some of that merchandise business back from the disruption earlier this year. It sounds like service is in a good place. The flywheel is turning and you have the ability to absorb that volume. So I guess, what do you think it takes to catalyze and start winning back some more of that more profitable merchandise volume? And then on the guide, does it include some pace of market share win back or volume win back that's embedded in that volume outlook for the back half? Thanks.\nAlan Shaw: Yes. A lot it is just leveraging that improved service product and also the capacity that we have to bear. As we increase the utilization of our equipment and our customers' equipment, we can put more capacity up against the market. Frankly, even in this freight environment, customers want to save money. And rail has a cost advantage relative to truck.\nEd Elkins: Exactly. And look, let's be clear, the erosion in our merchandise volume didn't happen in the first half of this year. It's happened over a fairly extended period of time, right, as we've worked really hard to get to where we are right now. So, there are varying levers we're going to pull with various customers. But the first one that we're going to pull with every customer is giving them exactly what they want, which is a conveyor belt that runs at the same speed all the time, that's fundamentally what our customers need, first of all, and we're out there right now, demonstrating it and improving it to them.\nAlan Shaw: And I think that's why our approach customer service facing is better, and we're still getting productivity, reducing resources, reducing capacity -- creating capacity without impacting service.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Jordan, go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Hi. Afternoon. Just sort of a question, sort of from an operational standpoint, a whole bunch of operational initiatives that you talked about to close the margin gap, I'm just sort of curious, as we think about all of them, how much of the plan this year and as we flow into next year is what you would consider for lack of a better word, basic blocking and tackling, fine-tuning versus major sea changes. Just trying to assess the difficulty of execution as we go along from here? Thanks.\nEd Elkins: Well, there is no secret. I mean, it's hard work, and it's running an efficient, effective railroad every single day. And that stability lends itself to opportunity, whether it's in asset utilization, crew utilization, fuel efficiency, all of those things. I've made a solid commitment on the path to taking out -- overall our $450 million in the -- to make this happen. And I -- that's a series of small wins, bigger wins. But there -- we've got line of sight to a big pipeline of opportunities that we're just growing through and they'll come at different points. Today is what we would consider an inflection point. And as we move through that, create stability and drive forward, it will always be there. So I would say it's a blend of those things and we're going to drive hard.\nAlan Shaw: Look, it's leadership, it's plan, it's discipline of execution. And what John and his team are producing is the acceleration of our operational improvements allows us to have the confidence to reaffirm our guidance and overcome the market weakness for the second half of year.\nOperator: The next question will come from Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. Walter, go ahead.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes. Thanks very much, operator. Good afternoon everyone. I'd like to turn that market opportunity focus to one that hasn't been in your wheelhouse before and that's Mexico Union Pacific having mentioned it on their call several times, obviously, a big focus for CPKC near-shoring and onshoring being a big trend. I know when you gave access to CPKC gave emerging access to the CPKC, it may have been a little bit contingent at the time during the debate. But I think -- correct me if I'm wrong, I mean, what they're saying is that this now opens up a route or a new destination for Mexico product into the Southeast via CPKC and into your network and CSX's network and that the opportunity presented has never been there before. Do you -- is that true? Do you see that as an opportunity? Could this be a new source of business for you getting Mexico product into the Southeast via your roots as described? Or would you put more of a challenge on that?\nEd Elkins: Well, look, here's what I would say. We know that near assuring or onshoring how everyone described that is occurring. There's two kinds of manufacturing that I think is going to come back to North America. Advanced manufacturing, which is high value add and probably is very automated. I think that's going to come back to the U.S. But basic manufacturing is probably going to a place in North America, that is Mexico. So we're talking really every week with Grupo Mexico as well as the CPKC on opportunities. One of those opportunities is connecting Mexico to the Southeast via the Meridian Speedway. That's for sure. There are other opportunities that will emerge in the near future that I think will be very exciting opportunities and products various segments of U.S. manufacturing.\nWalter Spracklin: Ed, we said General Motors in the office yesterday talking about some of the supply chains, and it wasn't lost on me that Mexico was part of that conversation. It's going to be a part of the conversation, and I've just spent the last three years that part of the world and really understand where the connection opportunities are. And you're right, we've got a great opportunity for both major railways in Mexico as well as the short sea. So I think that's a real opportunity in the immediate and near term?\nEd Elkins: Yes, I would say standby for future developments.\nOperator: The last question from this call will come from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Stephanie, go ahead.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to touch on with just the increased productivity that you're seeing this year, does this kind of load the spring so to speak, going forward for even spring so to speak, going forward for even better OR improvements in the years ahead, 8-K kind of maintaining the guide this year, even the lower revenues. So, if we roll that forward to 2025 and 2026, hopefully, more constructive OR improvements in the, years ahead 8-K kind of maintaining the guide this year even the lower revenues. So if we roll that forward to 2025 and 2026, hopefully, more constructive freight background or a backdrop, does that mean kind of the freight background or a backdrop, does that mean kind of the accelerating OR expansion in the accelerating OR expansion in the years ahead? I'd years ahead? I'd love to get your thoughts. Thanks.\nAlan Shaw: Hi Stephanie, at the beginning of this year, we set out a pretty aggressive long-term OR targets. And we are doing everything we said we would do. And we are delivering despite a weak freight environment. We are in the first year of a multiyear plan to reduce OR to a sub-60 rate, and then we'll keep going. But Stephanie, at the beginning of this year, we set out a pretty aggressive long-term OR targets. And we are doing everything we said we would do.

We're growing revenue in a tough freight environment, and we're enhancing our safety. We've laid out a road map, and we're delivering on it.\nMark George: And I think if you see outsized top line opportunities that on the horizon, I think you know in this industry, it usually generates outsized if you see outsized top line opportunities that -- on the horizon, I think you know in this industry, it usually generates outsized through opportunities and through opportunities and maybe end up getting there faster. So thank you very much everyone.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Alan Shaw, President and CEO for the final comments.\nAlan Shaw: Thanks for your interest in Norfolk Southern. And we look forward to continuing conversations over next couple of months.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thank you, Luke, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Here with me today are John Orr, our Chief Operating Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier, we reported our second quarter financial results, including adjusted quarter adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion, net income of $694 million, and diluted earnings per share of $3.06. Notably, we delivered 480 basis points of sequential margin improvement on our adjusted operating ratio. OR was 65.1% in the second quarter, with a first half OR of 67.5%, making good on our commitment to our shareholders to a first half operating ratio in the range of 67% to 68%. Our strong progress over this quarter demonstrates our ability to close the gap to our peers by executing our balanced strategy of service, productivity, and growth with safety at its core. The Thoroughbred team delivered significant margin improvement in the quarter despite revenue headwinds, by accelerating productivity initiatives. As you will hear from John, Ed, and Mark, we were able to overcome market weakness through increasingly strong progress on our six key operational metrics by responding to market opportunities and growing volume and remaining laser focused on controlling costs. We also take seriously our commitment to being the gold standard of safety in the industry and continue to make progress on improving our safety culture and metrics. This is the strength of our strategy, driving operable excellence and discipline that will deliver and will continue to deliver productivity gains and create the foundation to onboard significant growth when the market returns. This is the flywheel effect that is delivering tangible benefits for customers and shareholders. Efficient operations with a compelling service product allowed our teams to gain share in service-sensitive markets such as auto and intermodal, while participating in spot opportunities in coal and agriculture. As a result, we posted record performance in several key merchandise measures. While our work continues, our second quarter results represent an encouraging inflection point in our operating performance. We have plenty of runway in front of us. I'm excited for Norfolk Southern's opportunities ahead. We're committed to our strategy and delivering the results with pace and urgency that demonstrate the power of a better way for our employees, customers, communities and shareholders. I'll now turn it over John to further discuss our operational progress. Thanks Mark. Let's turn to Slide 20. As you heard from Ed, we lowered our full-year revenue guidance from approximately 3% to approximately 1% growth. And you heard from John and Mark that we're overcoming the revenue drop with a focus on the significant productivity opportunities in front of us, which gives us the confidence in reaffirming our full year OR guidance, despite the lower revenue outlook. The momentum demonstrated in the second quarter is a testament to the strength of our strategy. I want to thank all 20,000 of my Norfolk Southern teammates for all they have done and are doing every single day to deliver on our shareholder commitments and accelerate our operational improvements. John, Ed, and Mark have identified specific actions and outcomes to deliver improved results in workforce, T&E, fuel, mechanical, purchase services and rents capital productivity as well as smart growth in merchandise, intermodal and coal. We have a clear line of sight on multiple initiatives and a road map for margin gains in several key areas over the next 18 months as we close the OR gap. I'm proud of our progress in the second quarter, encouraged by our trajectory and confident in our team's ability to execute and deliver results in the quarters ahead. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Thanks, Tom Yes, Ed you got something going on in intermodal. We're leveraging most powerful intermodal franchise in the East, we rationalized 15% of our lanes. John is providing the best service product we provide in years and volumes up 8%. Yes. Look, we're really confident in our guidance for an OR in the second half of the year is 64% to 65%, despite revenue headwinds. And it's because of this flywheel effect that we're seeing and productivity, where a faster network is generating a lot of opportunities for John and his team to unlock savings. The STB has got a hearing coming up about growth. And that's part of our balanced strategy. The STB is focused on service, so are we? And we're delivering, right? We are improving service, we're reducing costs, we're growing revenue and we're enhancing safety. So we've got a good story to tell here, and we're aligned. I -- any volume. Look, our service product sales in this market, right? The two most service-sensitive markets, Automotive and Intermodal grew 7% and 8% on respectively, because of the great product that John Orr and his team are putting together. And because of the alignment between marketing and operations, they're looking for every opportunity to secure additional revenue and additional margin we were able pick up spot opportunities in weak coal markets and weak agriculture markets because of the great product we're delivering and the capacity dividend that John has created. Great point. We've got broad-based focus on productivity, right, purchase service is a big part of that. But we've got a clear line of sight on the road map, drive productivity and workforce and then fuel and purchase services and equipment rents. And at the same time, really focused on leveraging this great service product to drive more merchandise revenue and then leveraging our powerful intermodal franchise as the truck market response to drive more revenue there as well. And how much of that drives services and job you've done on reducing that over time. Yes. A lot it is just leveraging that improved service product and also the capacity that we have to bear. As we increase the utilization of our equipment and our customers' equipment, we can put more capacity up against the market. Frankly, even in this freight environment, customers want to save money. And rail has a cost advantage relative to truck. And I think that's why our approach customer service facing is better, and we're still getting productivity, reducing resources, reducing capacity -- creating capacity without impacting service. Look, it's leadership, it's plan, it's discipline of execution. And what John and his team are producing is the acceleration of our operational improvements allows us to have the confidence to reaffirm our guidance and overcome the market weakness for the second half of year.

            "name": "Ed Elkins",
            "content": "Hey, thank you, John, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Let's go to Slide 11, and I'll review our commercial results for the second quarter. Overall results were driven by a notably more fluid network that delivered a better service product to our customers. Revenues came in just above $3 billion, a 2% increase versus last year. Volumes rose 5%, led by an 8% increase in intermodal, while RPU fell 3%, driven by unfavorable impacts from intermodal mix. Merchandise revenue improved 4% while volumes increased 2% and RPU rose 3%. RPU less fuel increased 4% versus last year, which once again set an all-time record alongside a new all-time record for revenue less fuel. This marks the 36th out of the prior 37 quarters, where merchandise RPU less fuel grew year-over-year. In Intermodal, revenue was flat. Volume increased 8%, and RPU declined 8%. And in coal, revenue declined 3% on a 2% volume decrease. Now these were impacted by the outage of the Francis Scott Bridge in Baltimore. I do want to take a second here to reflect on Kohl's performance in the face of extraordinary challenges around the unprecedented closure of the Baltimore port complex in April. We and our customers demonstrated extraordinary operational agility and creativity to keep global supply chains intact via Lamberts Point, Virginia until service was restored in Baltimore. I'll note that propelling our record merchandise less fuel in the quarter was our automotive book, which set a record for total revenue and RPU less fuel. Metals, achieved an all-time quarterly record an all-time revenue less fuel and chemicals, which marked an all-time record for RPU less fuel. Intermodal revenue was flat in the quarter. However, if we exclude pressure from fuel and storage charges, revenues grew by 2% despite the mix and price headwinds. All of these superlatives are supported the strong service product that John and his team are delivering. Let's turn to Slide 12 and review our outlook for the rest for the rest of 2024. We're lowering our expectations for full year revenue growth to around 1% based on continuing market cost currents, and we expect overall adverse mix headwinds to continue. In merchandise, new industrial activity may be constrained by higher interest rates and borrowing costs, but we expect to see continued benefits from ongoing infrastructure and manufacturing projects underway. Our improved network fluidity will also deliver growth and unlock shareholder value. Intermodal volumes remain a driver of overall volume growth as international shipments rise through import and export demand while excess capacity and weak truck prices are expected to remain headwinds to domestic volumes. And finally, in coal, we foresee a challenged environment within the utility space continuing, while export markets see some momentum from the reopening of the Baltimore channel and new production. All right. Let's finish up on Slide 13. I'm going to take a minute to highlight a recent win-win with a large met coal producer in producer in the US. Set to be developed 2025, our rail lines will link this new coal production facility with the global market. This mine will produce will produce nearly 5 million short tons of premium grade in met-coal annually when it reaches full production. This new partnership is a concrete example of our strategy to grow high-quality carload revenue, close the gap to peers in key markets and significantly enhance our met coal portfolio for years and years to come. This win also demonstrates our customers' confidence in Norfolk Southern in our service and our commitment to our strategy. We're grateful to be chosen for this project, and we're excited for the future of this opportunity. Investing strategic capital to support regions of our network with economic growth is also in motion. The State of Alabama is an example where our investments include terminal and mainline infrastructure projects that support customers as they invest and expand their businesses. These investments are a key part of our balanced approach to deliver top-tier revenue growth over the long term. And finally, I just want to thank our customers for their business. I'll now turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results. Thanks, man. Let me walk you through the -- really the price and mix story in intermodal. Mix and price make up around 6 and 7 points in weakness that you saw there. And that mix is really driven in the premium segment where lower part counts or are really pressuring our carriers to keep their unionized road fleets employed. The other mix piece is we're seeing a lot of empty shipments. On the Intermodal side, we're seeing them and have seen them really all year long in the Intermodal segment -- or excuse me, in the International segment where carriers are really trying to push empties back offshore. We're also starting to see a lot more domestic empty repositioning moves back to the West Coast. We think that's in anticipation of possible ILA action on the East Coast ports there. And then the second part of your question is when does it really -- when does the highway rates get better and when we start to see some of the capacity drop out from the highway carriers that are putting a lot of pressure on rates. I think we're around the bottom. I really do, from what I've seen, from what read and from what I hear from our customers, we're kind of bouncing right along the bottom. And I think we're getting closer and closer to an inflection point. Talking to one of our biggest customers today, they noted that they're expecting a real peak season this year for the first time in a few years. And I think that bodes well both for our international customers as well as for our domestic customers. Yes. I think RPU on the domestic side is moving sideways. Sure. I can do that. I've already talked about some of the mix challenges that we're seeing in intermodal. And I will tell you, we see the same story that's been playing out in the second quarter going forward into the really third and fourth. We're seeing significant volume growth in some of our lower-rated merchandise commodities like aggregates and finished vehicles, and both of those move at kind of the lower end of that RPU spectrum. We are focused a lot on earning back merchandise share and the additional volume that we are seeing is really attributable to the better velocity and car supply that we're seeing out there. I mean think about what happened in the automotive market where we actually use less equipment to handle a record amount of revenue. It's a real sea change from where we've been in... Agree. And we're targeting more revenue. I mean we know the macro environment is challenged but look, let me give you 2 examples of recent wins that are only possible because of higher velocity and better car supply. We converted a coil line from the highway with our largest middle customer between Indiana and Ohio and that's in a challenged metals market. So we grew inorganically off the highway. We also converted the large highway lane to rail in the state of Georgia with our largest aggregate shipper, all because we're able to handle more tonnage with less equipment. Yes. I'm trying to remember the first part of your question. Yes. look, our customers -- I think you guys know this. Our customers were one of the most supportive groups of our strategy out there as we move through this whole first half of the year and they were rooting for us and they are and they are behind us, helping us unlock additional value for the supply chain right now. And moving forward, look, we had a lot of confidence in growing our volumes across the board. But really, we're focused on one area in particular where we know that we have lost share -- that's in our merchandise markets. And I would say it is not customers that are resistant to coming back to us is customers that we have to earn back because they had to find a different supply chain solution, which probably cost them more money. So we're working really hard every single day earn those customers back, and that's what we're focused on. And the relationships that we've built over a long period of time with our customers, who like I said, supported this whole thing. Okay. And then you'd asked about coal price as well. There were a few global supply chain disruptions during the quarter caused the slight lift prices, but those gains have mostly eroded away. And the expectation is that rates are going to continue to drift slightly lower the experts that we talk to, and there are several of them are really expecting those seaborne prices to stay north of $200. But we'll see. We'll see what happens. Sure. I'll take that one. I think everyone knows the ILA has done a lot on September 30 to reach agreement with the port operators. We are talking to all of our steamship line customers as well as our domestic intermodal partners. And shippers are starting to hedge their bets a little bit. We see a lot of West Coast activity on the rise for a number of reasons. That includes what's going on in the Red Sea. But as that happens, customers, the BCOs have to get their freight to market. So they're deploying freight to the West Coast as well as the east. And I really believe, and this is just me observing the market. I think with the shortage of containers, seaborne containers that they are out there because of the elongated supply chains. What you're going to see is steamship lines will not want their boxes come in inland off the West Coast. And so there's going to be a lot of demand for domestic intermodal out the West Coast. That's the way I think this thing evolves. Exactly. And look, let's be clear, the erosion in our merchandise volume didn't happen in the first half of this year. It's happened over a fairly extended period of time, right, as we've worked really hard to get to where we are right now. So, there are varying levers we're going to pull with various customers. But the first one that we're going to pull with every customer is giving them exactly what they want, which is a conveyor belt that runs at the same speed all the time, that's fundamentally what our customers need, first of all, and we're out there right now, demonstrating it and improving it to them. Well, there is no secret. I mean, it's hard work, and it's running an efficient, effective railroad every single day. And that stability lends itself to opportunity, whether it's in asset utilization, crew utilization, fuel efficiency, all of those things. I've made a solid commitment on the path to taking out -- overall our $450 million in the -- to make this happen. And I -- that's a series of small wins, bigger wins.

And as we move through that, create stability and drive forward, it will always be there. So I would say it's a blend of those things and we're going to drive hard. Well, look, here's what I would say. We know that near assuring or onshoring how everyone described that is occurring.

            "content": "Thank you, Alan. It's a pleasure to provide an update on our progress. Turning to Slide 5. At NS, safety enables performance and our commitment to safety is unwavering. During the quarter, we leveraged our NS leadership framework to strengthen our field safety. We continued our efforts to focus on mainline accident reductions and we commissioned three additional inspection portals and added field sensors. These have contributed to our best-in-class mainline accident rate. We also conducted two cross-functional leadership safety summits, strengthening our capabilities and reinforcing safety from the ballast to the boardroom. Turning to Slide 6. Our metrics improved across all of our core network performance indices. Our balanced approach proved safety, service and cost improvements work best together. Year-to-date, we have reduced our active online motor power fleet by 320 locomotives and have targeted an additional 100 reductions in the second half. As we store locomotives, we use reliability metrics to remove the worst performers, driving up overall fleet reliability and driving down maintenance, materials and fuel expense. Quarter-over-quarter, we increased our GTMs for available horsepower by 6% and our car velocity by 6%. Both improvements are the result of design processes that drive out time and cost, both in terminals and over the road. Our strategy includes structural improvements in fuel procurement, materials management, purchase service optimization, crew cost efficiency and productivity enhancements. So let's take a look at a few of the initiatives in the pipeline that are closing the gap as we track for the $250 million cost takeout commitment. Turning to Slide 7. We have delivered a 6% improvement in car velocity by reducing handlings, extending train schedules and improving connection performance. Car velocity is something I monitor closely. It captures improvements in our operating plan, terminal execution and over-the-road performance. For example, during the quarter, we eliminated over 700 unnecessary car handlings per day. Driving car velocity in response to overall train speed improvements includes working with our customers to rightsize the inventory in their pipelines as train speed and car velocity improve, fewer cars are required to service the current volume. In the quarter, we delivered a reduction of 3% of cars online. We are improving safety, train speed and service reliability by addressing unscheduled train stops and dispatching practices. For example, our mechanical war rooms root cause analysis of every unscheduled train stop has resulted in an 18% reduction of fees and scheduled stops in Q2. We have a new network operations watchdog team, bringing extreme discipline to planned adherence. They challenged the root cause for every extra train. This has instilled network-wide visibility and accountability to execution and planning. I'm really encouraged that this has increased connections and train yield and has driven out extra train starts from 200 in March to just 50 in June. These improvements to our operating plan and terminal discipline have resulted in a 4% reduction in crew starts. The combination of crew and overtime reductions has dropped our crew expense per kGTM by 8% compared to Q1. As operational effectiveness grows, we are recalibrating our standards and sweating the network resources even further. This is the path to at least 7% to 10% improvement in car velocity. Yard and local redesigns are underway. We driving out waste and rework in the first mile and last mile operations. We are unlocking the capacity to take on additional work within the same footprint. Efficiency in this space is really important to me since we allocate approximately 50% of crew starts here. Over the next 24 months, we will continue to improve fuel productivity. We will continue to push locomotives, leverage trip optimizer to assertively manage horsepower per ton, turn power more quickly, improve fuel distribution and vendor accountability and increased train size. We are targeting locomotive productivity improvements of an additional 8%. One of my personal objectives is to develop the next generation of skilled PSR railroaders and to build the bench strength to sustain the improvements that I'm leading. We are structuring the organization to drive the daily and strategic outcomes, and I am proud and encouraged by the engagement of people in every department and across the entire organization. The team is working collaboratively and with confidence. Our team is energized and motivated to build upon the strength of the quarter and deliver the next wave of initiatives that will yield savings in all P&L categories beyond just comp and bang, but in materials, rents and purchased services, success breeds success. I want to close out my remarks on Slide 8 and 9 with two flywheel examples of balancing service and cost. In automotive, our car velocity increased by 16%, creating the platform for growth as our carloads increased by 7%. Within intermodal, shipments and service performance simultaneously increased by 8%. This following the 15% lane rationalization we discussed earlier this quarter. And what's really important to me is that we are launching our NS intermodal reservation system in September. This smooth strain demand reduces rents and expenses and creates service certainty. Our customers are enjoying some of the best sustained service ever. At the same time, we have consolidated train starts, streamlined our service plan, reduced handling complexity and have driven out cost. We are unlocking tremendous value within our franchise, adding new capability, urgently eliminating waste and driving to a sub-60 OR. Now, I'll turn it over to Ed. I would say, Ken, my confidence comes from the power of the people and the engagement that we're delivering in the field. In the early days of my onboarding, I would go into major terminals and see opportunities, engage the team, inspire them to lead change, and now as we build the team and reframe how our management structure is in the field, really focused on the day-to-day as well as strategic intent, we're doing that to scale, more people seeing more things. We're creating the flywheel the finders and increased capability. Just today, I signed off on a service design that eliminates 42 starts a week. And that's the result of 4 or 5 people just being out in the field, doing safety Blitz is seeing other things happening and finding ways to improve safety, synthesize train starts elongate trains and create more capability in the field. This is the power of the flywheel. And we're doing it based on safety and service sustainability. And I'm very confident as we build people and structure. We're going to keep delivering. And just to add, Alan, when we were in Washington a few weeks ago meeting with the STB commissioners, they were really reinforcing our business plan and resiliency as being an enabler of service and driving the US economy, and they were right in lockstep with our vision. So I think it will -- it's always going to challenge the sector when the commercial regulator wants to talk to the sector. But when we're leading front of all of that, I think it serves us well to continue what we're doing. Well, I can tell you this, while it's true, there are fewer T&E head counts, this is not a head count reduction exercise. This is rightsizing the service and aligning the asset efficiencies with the customer and the customer requirements. So sequentially, we did show a 2% improvement on T&E. We've frozen hiring except where there's a really substantial reason or an acute skill that we need to bring on. But it really is working with labor to address outliers, rightsize the organization and where we're long on people, getting the flexibility to move them where they need to be. And I really watch our expense and the cost for T&A -- or sorry, T&E head count in our KGTM. And I made that clear in my opening remarks that despite the fact that we're improving service providing some of the best operating efficiencies in the network, we're doing it at a lower cost overall. And that's what I really focus on eliminating the waste associated with overtime, taxis, hotels, those sorts of things that don't give you any value. So that's where I think you can look forward to seeing more of. Yes. We look -- just take fuel, for example. We're really driving hard to pull locomotives out, reduce our exposure there. But at the same time, looking at our fuel distribution process. We've been able to streamline that, reduce some DTL trucks and reliance on that, similar to how we're pruning the intermodal franchise, we're pruning some of the more expensive fuel and fuel distribution and at the same time then looking at how do we create more vendor accountability and visibility. So we've got some really short-term, midterm and long-term views on fuel. And that even putting locomotives down cascades into our materials and the services associated with maintaining locomotives that we're able to put down."

            "name": "Mark George",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed and good afternoon everyone. Let's start on Slide 15 with a quick reconciliation of GAAP results on the left and the adjusted results on the right. You'll see that the Eastern Ohio incident Eastern Ohio incident column is actually income in the quarter of $65 column as our $156 million of insurance recoveries exceeded the additional costs that were accrued. In the restructuring column, you will also see income as we booked a favorable true-up to our Q1 separation cost accruals, but also realized an associated favorable postretirement curtailment adjustment within our other income line item. We also highlight under the advisory cost column, expenses incurred in Q2 associated with a proxy context. Adjusted results, including a 65.1% OR was in line with our guidance range. EPS of $3.06 was aided by $0.05 below the line from a favorable state income tax adjustment. On the next chart, Slide 16, I'll go through the year-over-year and sequential variances compared to the adjusted results. Our second quarter performance was a function of dose of revenue lift combined with the team making excellent progress on network performance and providing strong service that enabled us to remove cost from our structure. Year-over-year revenue was up $64 million or 2%, with volumes up 5%, but RPU was down 3%. As Ed discussed, adverse mix remained a headwind to RPU in the quarter. Operating expenses were down $7 million year-over-year despite inflation headwinds, reflecting strong momentum on cost takeout, which drove 160 basis points of OR improvement. The cost reduction momentum is especially evident when looking at the sequential decline of $119 or 6% on $40 million more revenue combining to drive up a large 480 basis point sequential reduction in our operating ratio and will most certainly result in a sharp narrowing of the OR gap with the industry. Drilling into the revenue change on Slide 17, focusing here on the sequential increase in revenue from Q1 of $40 million. That was driven by merchandise volume growth. Yet despite what appears as a favorable mix shift at the high level, with a 2% rise in merchandise volume, RPU to Q1 was only flat, and that's because mix within each business line was adverse, as you'll see illustrated in the gray box where volume growth of below average RPU business lines exceed volume growth in the above average business lines. Shifting to a sequential look at operating expense on Slide 18. I'll start by saying it's nice to see all green on this chart. OpEx is down $119 million versus the first quarter. The dramatic acceleration in our network velocity has allowed us to drive out the remaining service mitigation costs in the quarter, which shows up in several categories, including comp and ben, most notably over time, but also in equipment rents, purchase services as well as other. The ops team did a terrific job speeding up the network and improving service to deliver on these cost savings, as well as fuel efficiency improvements. You'll also see savings in the comp and ben from lower employee levels, largely driven from the previously announced downsizing actions that we took in our management ranks, but also sequential attrition of nearly 2% of our T&E workforce. Property gains in the second quarter totaled $25 million compared to zero in Q1, so the first half is pretty much on a normal annual run rate. Real estate transactions are lumpy, and some of you may say that the $25 million in the quarter was 2x a theoretically smoothed amount, but either way you choose to evaluate our results, our OR performance in the quarter was in line with our commitment. So we are very encouraged at what is clearly an inflection point in our cost structure, allowing us to meet the commitment we made on OR despite a weaker volume environment than we had been planning for, demonstrating organizational agility. As we look to the second half, there are various headwinds and tailwinds to consider. Ed noted that the revenue will be softer than we previously expected, with some sequential volume improvement, but adverse mix. And the industry's next contractual wage increase that took effect on July 1 creates a $25 million step up in comp and ben here in the third quarter. However, John talked about our actions and momentum on productivity side within operations, and that will help neutralize the wage impact. All that said, the key message I want to leave you with today is that despite softer macro conditions, we are reaffirming our guidance for the second half operating ratio in the 64% to 65% range. Before I hand to Alan, I'll make a comment on capital. Many of you have seen that with PSR, there is often a liberation of excess capital assets. That boosts efficiency and creates incremental cash flow streams, adding to shareholder returns. We've had some of those in the past several years with some larger asset sales, and we continue to evaluate opportunities and have a robust list of properties for which we are pursuing sales that will simplify our network and generate cash over the next several quarters. Alan? Thanks, Scott, for the question. I'll ask Ed to help tag team on that second part of the question on the mix. But do you want to go first with that? And that transitions into the first part of the question. We're going to see more incremental volume growth here in the third quarter. That's one of the tailwinds for sure. Even though we'll probably have some mix erode benefit from that adverse mix, I guess. But I'd say another tailwind is, as you touched on, Scott, we've got really good momentum here on the productivity side. So I expect we're going to see continued reductions in crew starts and over time despite higher volumes. I think fuel efficiency should continue to improve and look, we're attacking -- we're in the very, very early innings of attacking purchase services. So we've got some broad-based initiatives there. So we're going to see some really good tailwinds here, I think, in the third quarter. But as you touched upon, headwinds are there. We've got that 4.5% agreement wage increase that takes effect in July 1. So on day one of the third quarter, $25 million step-up in Comp and Ben comes from that, and that's 80 basis points of sequential OR headwind. And on top of that, fuels the way we're modeling it, it seems like fuel is going to be probably 50, 60 basis points of sequential OR headwind as well. So we'll see how it all shakes out here. But ultimately, we're really happy with our position going into the third quarter. Well, look, Ken, again, you're right that sequentially, Q2 to Q3, when we look historically, you have some years where you have improvement in the OR. You have other years where you have some level of degradation. I think on average, it's probably slight degradation in this year, which is somewhat of a unique period of time. And this is if you exclude 2020. But in this year, if you look at this period of time, we're expecting sequential volume improvement. So that's really going to help us. And the gravy on top of that is continued momentum in what John is doing, in face of all the headwinds that I laid out. So that's where the confidence is coming from. I don't know John do you want to add? So just getting also to the essence of your question on why not better, I'm just going to repeat what I said to Scott, there is some headwind here in the third quarter from the second quarter related to the wage increase of 80 basis points. And also the way we see the fuel curve playing out, there's probably another 60 basis points of headwind. So we're talking about overcoming that. And those are big hurdles. Maybe fuel is not -- doesn't end up being as bad. That could be some upside. But honestly, we got to see where volume shakes out too. And Chris, I would tell you, we are on track to be down 2%, like we had guided previously by the time we get to the end of the year versus the end of last year. And that's on carrying a little bit more volume, right? Yes. I think that actually, the profile in the back half, you have a typical challenge in the fourth quarter being a lighter one where you see the OR float up. I actually think because of the momentum we're making there'll be continuous productivity that we get throughout the year. So, while we might get a little bit more volume in the third quarter and a little bit less as you typically would expect in the fourth quarter, the productivity is going to help us sail through. And I would I would imagine that both third and fourth quarter are going to look somewhat similar here. Ed, I'll answer that second part first. So the large land gains that I was referring to would be things that we would typically call out and referred to as kind of probably more on the non-GAAP side. And that's really in terms of trying to augment our balance sheet. So no, they are not in any way part of the path on the OR going forward. It was really more of a conversation on capital and restoring our balance sheet. Typically, we guide to $30 million to $40 million a year on real estate gains in the normal course that we absorb within the OR. And there are years where that's $20 million, there are years where that's $50 million, but it's kind of in that 30/40 range. So I was making a more general smoothing commentary talking about, call it, $50 million, but it could be in that neighborhood $40 million, $50 million range this year. Hey, thanks for the question, Elliot. Yes, I mean it's -- obviously, it's a big spend amount that's gone up a lot from technology in the past handful of years, largely subscription-based, cloud-based services. So you see a lot more software costs showing up now and purchase services as opposed to in capital. But at the same time, about -- probably about one-third is related to the volume variable costs associated with intermodal activity. So, Intermodal grew 8% year-over-year, but we actually limited the purchase services increase to around 3%. And actually, sequentially, it was down slightly. So this is an area that we've spent a lot of time, John and I in the past couple of months talking about and we're going to be focused pretty aggressively on trying to find opportunities to bring this down. And certainly, a lot of the other areas of purchased services outside of the volume variable pieces. John, do you want to jump in? Yes. And one other point on purchase services because you did ask about how it will look at the balance of the year. I would tell you, it is going to be no worse than what you see in the first half. I would expect it to be down year-over-year in the back half. And I think if you see outsized top line opportunities that on the horizon, I think you know in this industry, it usually generates outsized if you see outsized top line opportunities that -- on the horizon, I think you know in this industry, it usually generates outsized through opportunities and through opportunities and maybe end up getting there faster. So thank you very much everyone."

It is now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Nichols, you may now begin. \nLuke Nichols: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. \n Our presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with our reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures, including adjusted or non-GAAP operating ratio. Please note that all references to our prospective operating ratio during today's call are being provided on an adjusted basis as referenced in our earnings release. Turning to Slide 3. It's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw. \nAlan Shaw: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Norfolk Southern's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Here with me today are Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer; Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer; and our new Chief Operating Officer, John Orr. I am excited to have John on the Norfolk Southern team. John is a 40-year railroad industry veteran and a proven PSR expert who has worked with Hunter Harrison, Claude Mongeau and Keith Creel to implement PSR railroads across 3 countries. \n I promised you that we would focus on productivity in 2024, and we're taking action to do just that. Bringing in someone of John's caliber was another step to accelerate our operational improvement. John is going to share the progress in our operating metrics that he and his team are already driving and his plans for furthering productivity in our merchandise network to deliver immediate margin enhancement. Our strategy is about balancing service, productivity and growth with safety at its core. \n This strategy is anchored on a PSR-driven operating plan and designed to deliver top-tier earnings and revenue growth with industry competitive margins. When we say industry competitive margins, it has to be within 100 to 200 basis points of the industry average. \n Let's recall where we've been and discuss our path forward. Last year, in response to East Palestine, we prioritized investments in safety and service to protect our franchise and our shareholders, and we delivered on both fronts. We are operating one of the safest networks in North America and are producing service levels better than anything we've seen since 2019. \n Despite that progress, more work remains to be done to get us back to industry competitive margins. We were not delivering the productivity, and we were not running fast enough or efficiently enough. I needed to make changes to accelerate our progress and to introduce greater operational discipline into our culture. To that end, we started making organizational and process changes last fall, culminating with the recent hiring of John Orr. \n Now we have safely built the foundation to drive substantial gains in productivity, and we've committed to a 400 to [ 450 ] basis point OR improvement in the second half of this year. We will close that margin gap with peers. We will deliver a sub-60 operating ratio in the next 3 to 4 years, and we will do it at a safe, sustainable manner that recognizes our current operating environment and brings key constituents, including our shareholders, customers, employees and regulators along with us on our mission. \n We will urgently deliver productivity through disciplined operational excellence that continues to safely serve our customers, positions us to grow by meeting markets as they evolve and allows us to generate outsized returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Mark to review our first quarter financial results. \nMark George: Thanks, Alan. As seen on Slide 5, our GAAP results in Q1 were impacted by 4 items that we've called out for you. Earlier in the month, we announced the $600 million agreement in principle to resolve a consolidated class action lawsuit relating to the East Palestine derailment. That addresses the most significant remaining legal exposures for our shareholders. \n Including other cleanup costs and insurance recoveries in the quarter, our operating income was adversely impacted by $592 million. You'll note at the bottom, another $108 million of insurance recoveries in the quarter. That brings our recoveries to date in excess of $200 million toward our $1.1 billion insurance coverage tower. \n Moving to the right. We told you last quarter about our initiative to drive a 7% reduction in non-agreement headcount, for which savings will begin to materialize in Q2. That initiative, along with our operations leadership change resulted in a $99 million charge. Next, our advisory costs associated with our now very public shareholder matter recorded in nonoperating. Finally, we also called out here a favorable deferred tax adjustment affecting our income tax expense. For the remaining slides, I'll speak to our adjusted results, excluding these items, as shown here on the far right. \n Moving to Slide 6, let's focus on the adjusted variances compared to Q1 of 2023 in the year-over-year columns. Those results were impacted by 4% lower revenues driven by meaningfully lower fuel surcharge as well as headwinds in Intermodal that Ed will detail later. Operating expenses were up 3% from inflation and the increased workforce. You'll see an OpEx year-over-year waterfall in the appendix that provides more detail. \n Not on this page is nonoperating income, which was down $17 million from lower gains on our company-owned life insurance. That decline, coupled with the lower operating income drove the net income and EPS reductions you see here on a year-over-year basis. \n Let's talk on the right side about the sequential variance from Q4 2023, where we guided to a 100 to 200 basis point deterioration in our OR, which is in line with normal seasonality. That's exactly where we landed right at the lower end of that range. On the next couple of charts, we'll detail the sequential revenue and OpEx walks from Q4. \n So revenue here on Slide 7 moved down sequentially driven by fuel surcharge headwinds and overall lower volumes driven by coal and Intermodal. Coal pricing was weaker and Intermodal faced difficult conditions with volumes down 3% and continued adverse mix from softness in our higher-yield premium business. \n Slide 8, turning to our operating expenses. They were down 1% as compared to Q4. We faced typical sequential headwinds associated with the reset of payroll taxes, and we had meaningful headwinds from returning to normal incentive compensation accrual levels as well as no property sales in the first quarter. We offset those headwinds by lower spend in purchased services, efficiency gains in comp embedded as well as favorable fuel prices. \n While fuel expense was down 6% sequentially, recall that surcharge revenue was down 17% sequentially, and that drives a 40 basis point OR headwind on a sequential basis. As we turn to the balance of the year, we will see our margins improve materially from here. We are finally starting to see excess service costs unwind and they will accelerate downward in Q2. That trajectory, along with the reduction in non-agreement headcount as well as other productivity initiatives leave us confident in a strong productivity story for Q2. \n We anticipate a modest seasonal volume lift sequentially, although there is some pressure to our Coal business from the Baltimore Bridge disruption. Despite the port closure, we still believe we will be within the first half 67% to 68% OR guidance range, assuming that the channel reopens at the beginning of June. The revenue impact from the channel closure is in the $25 million to $35 million per month range. More productivity momentum builds in the back half as well as stronger volumes, and that provides us with confidence in the 400 to 450 basis points of OR improvement. John will talk more about the productivity runway in front of us. But first, I'll hand over to Ed to discuss revenues. \nEd Elkins: Thank you, Mark, and good morning to everyone on the call. Starting on Slide 11, I'll go over our commercial results for the quarter. Overall, volume grew by 4% versus last year, driven by Intermodal. Revenue for the first quarter came in just above $3 billion, down 4% year-over-year as total RPU fell 8%.  \n Starting with merchandise, volume was flat versus last year, while revenue ticked down 1% driven by lower fuel surcharge revenue. RPU less fuel increased by 3% year-over-year setting an all-time quarterly record, which also led to a new all-time quarterly record for revenue less fuel. This marks the 35th out of the prior 36 quarters that merchandise RPU grew year-over-year, and once again, reaffirms our commitment to price and the increasing value of our service. \n Turning to Intermodal. Volume grew 8% year-over-year, primarily on strength in International. However, revenue decreased 8% as RPU excluding fuel and storage and fees declined by 6% overall. Revenue was also impacted by the lane rationalization across Intermodal that simplified our network. This decision demonstrates how marketing, operations and finance are aligned to increase productivity and drive smart and sustainable growth. \n Digging into coal, volumes for the quarter declined by 4% as weakness in the utility market was only partially offset by export strength driven by a historically strong export quarter as our cross-functional efforts to boost throughput at our Lamberts Point terminal yielded positive results. These results are a great example of NS pulling together to deliver strong value for our shareholders and for our customers. \n Let's move to Slide 12, where I'm introducing a new view of our results that helps frame the main first quarter drivers of revenue and revenue per unit. Overall, fuel surcharge revenue was the single largest headwind in the quarter, declining by $115 million.\n The first quarter was also the last one where Intermodal storage and fees are a substantial year-over-year headwind with revenues declining by $35 million. In Coal, we experienced positive mix from higher export volumes and higher utility shipments in the South. This positive mix was more than offset by lower realized price and export shipments as seaborne coal prices weakened significantly throughout the quarter.\n Merchandise revenue, excluding fuel, was driven higher by pricing gains across the entire book. Overall pricing and volume increases in our metals franchise were boosted by improved network fluidity from increased car velocity. That same velocity and fluidity helped volumes in automotive remained flat despite manufacturing headwinds at several of the plants that we serve.  \n Intermodal revenue, excluding fuel and storage and fees increased as higher volumes more than offset adverse mix and continued slight capacity in the domestic truck market created headwinds to RPU. Higher international shipments and lower domestic premium shipments were the main drivers of adverse mix. Additionally, RPU was impacted from higher international empty shipments as these grew 57% year-over-year in the quarter. We believe elongated ocean transit times are a driving factor pushing ocean carriers to deploy their capacity back on the water as soon as possible, which increases the need to reposition empty containers back to the ports.  \n Turning to Slide 13. Let's go over our market outlook for the remainder of '24. The macro landscape presents a mixed bag with uncertainty regarding inflation and future Fed rate actions overshadowing the recent recovery in manufacturing. However, our improving service product places us in an excellent position to capitalize on growth opportunities. \n Starting with our view on the widely varying merchandise markets, we generally see support from volume from the normalization of auto production and the continued strength in infrastructure projects across our network. A positive price environment will continue, which is supported by the increase in network fluidity. Improved cycle times, equipment availability and network velocity will be a broad positive tailwind across our portfolio and merchandise. And we also expect to drive incremental volumes through project development, such as our recently announced Great Lakes reload acquisition, the merger of TDIS into Triple Crown Services and continued industrial development wins. \n Intermodal volumes are increase as international trade remains robust. We expect continued mix impacts from higher international empty shipments as geopolitical tensions remain elevated, but a weak truck market continues to drive stubbornly low truck rates, which will dampen domestic nonpremium Intermodal pricing. Additionally, we expect volumes in our domestic premium business to fall as challenging LTL market forces reduced freight demand for parcel shipments. \n Finally, coal volumes will be challenged as high stockpiles and low natural gas prices reduce utility shipments. In addition, export shipments will be affected by the Baltimore port shutdown. We are diligently working with our customers to provide alternate supply chain solutions, and the increased network fluidity is providing the capacity necessary to execute on those solutions.  \n Finally, seaborne coal prices have weakened as supply has outstripped global demand and this headwind is expected to continue throughout the remainder of the year. Before I turn it over to John, I'd like to close by making our customers for trusting Norfolk Southern to move their freight. \nJohn Orr: Thank you, Ed. I arrived at NS in late March and immediately got to work immersing myself in the operations and connecting with our people. I've had boots on the ground assessing terminals and engaging craft colleagues and frontline supervisors. I've also met with our stakeholders from labor, regulatory and community leadership. What I've seen confirms that NS is a robust franchise with a talented team and the resources to deliver impressive results when properly executed. Our safety performance as shown on Slide 15, has trended favorably. I have observed a strong safety commitment, and we are building on that. My first action as COO was a system safety blitz to provide clarity around the value of safety.  \n Turning to Slide 16. It is imperative that we closed the profitability gap with our peers. We are now delivering encouraging trends in productivity. Our strategy is balanced. Our operating efficiency and service excellence are achieved in tandem. Our approach is a flywheel of value creation where people, processes and accountability intersect to drive performance, anchoring our service and profitability proposition. Accountability is key. We're providing our team with the metrics they need to track their performance.\n In my first 30 days, we have removed approximately 200 locomotives from the available fleet. Most of these have gone into stored status or driven off-line for [indiscernible]. Our availability count is now below 2,500 units. As shown on the slide, we will be able to increase locomotive drawdown over the next 6 months. Terminal 12 has improved by 8%. We are driving more waste by fine-tuning workload in our terminals through disciplined planned execution. Near term, we are targeting 20% improvement.  \n Car miles have improved by 8%. And this is another productivity measure, we target for double-digit improvement. Recrews are trending down 22% as network and terminal improvements are combining to improve fluidity across the main line. And lastly, we are reviewing the entire train service plan. This will drive core rationalization in the range of 4%, resulting from these initiatives. We are driving out excess cost as we close the gap to our peers. \n Referring to Slide 17, network update. To accelerate improvements and address network underperformance, I have established a network optimization team that identifies areas for immediate improvement. I have deployed 2 task force to drive field productivity and throughput at 2 major terminals.\n The outcomes from these efforts will rapidly go out to scale throughout the network. We are training our operations leaders to think differently to make faster decisions and to eliminate waste more vigorously. My commitment is to develop PSR railroaders to instill the discipline for continuous improvement and to streamline execution by relentlessly managing assets in context to our commercial obligations. The initial results across the entire network have been promising. Our people are driving PSR results.  \n To create accountability and to track progress, we're introducing a comprehensive set of metrics. I've laid out challenging and urgent near-term targets, and I'm taking an aggressive disciplined approach to achieve our long-term financial glide path. And I can tell you, now we have a significant runway on cost reduction. As our fleet becomes more efficient, we benefit in rents and materials by shedding assets and from improving the fleet composition and getting out more costly cars. \n Our locomotive fleet now has significant capacity. I believe we will be able to scale down discretionary capital spending on the fleet. And we have a robust terminal footprint, covering a rich array of industrial activity. And as we optimize our terminals, we are challenging the historic use to create value through consolidation and efficiencies. I am proud and excited to have the opportunity to lead the operations team at NS. I look forward to your questions, and I will turn the call back to Alan. \nAlan Shaw: Our strategy is designed to mirror the great success stories of the Canadian railroads who have recognized that PSR is about more than tearing a railroad down to its studs at slashing costs regardless of the fallout. As our Board member, Claude Mongeau, demonstrated when he was CEO of Canadian National, a PSR operating model, when part of a customer-focused balanced strategy, can deliver top-tier revenue growth and a sub-60 operating ratio. John Orr was an integral part of Claude's leadership team at CN and thus, a perfect fit from Norfolk Southern as we turbocharge productivity in pursuit of industry competitive margins and top-tier earnings growth.  \n Core to this are the men and women of Norfolk Southern. I'm incredibly proud of all they've done to progress the execution of our differentiated strategy. So my colleagues, thank you for everything you do for Norfolk Southern, our shareholders, our customers and your fellow team members. Together, we are on a transformational journey to a safer more profitable railroad, poised for growth with strong execution from an experienced leadership team. \n We will now open the call to questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n Our first question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. \nBrian Ossenbeck: Just wanted to understand, going back to the Meridian Speedway concession. Does that actually have an impact? Or does that cover anything related to traffic originating or terminating out of Mexico? And then secondarily, maybe something for John or the team. Can you just give us some sense behind the underlying assumptions as you're benchmarking these productivity savings going down to 60 OR in the next 2, 3 years? And why can't you go there faster? What's holding you back from that? Maybe you can help with walking through some of the assumptions under your numbers versus what else we see out there? \nAlan Shaw: Thanks for the question, Brian. Let me be really clear. The agreement related to the Meridian Speedway is by no means a consequential concession, and it does not impact Mexico. We said it impacts the Dallas business, which is largely defined by abundant truck capacity. John, do you want to handle the second part of his one question. \nJohn Orr: Sure. Brian, nice to talk to you. And I'll tell you, I've been out assessing the network, and I'm really confident with the plans that I've got underway today that we're on track for the 400 to 500 basis points by year-end. And I'll tell you, our operating costs are a direct reflection of our asset management. And speed and accuracy are really essential to that. And our ability to rapidly cycle assets reduces our need for them, which is why we're focused on accelerating all of our operations simultaneously while taking out costs. \n And I'm very confident with our dwell, our over-the-road performance, the discipline we put on our locomotive fleets and the crew productivity and some of the smart investments that we're making to unlock the value, we're well underway. \nOperator: Next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. \nScott Group: So Mark, you're guiding 400 to 500 basis points of sequential improvement into Q2. Just help us think about the drivers there? How much volume? How should we think about cost ex fuel? And there's a lot going on with the proxy. So I do want to ask also, Alan. A, what's -- any expectation in terms of timing for ISS and then there is a lot of focus on this Meridian Speedway thing. It looks like there was another a second amendment that you guys filed yesterday. Any color on what that second amendment is? \nMark George: Yes, I'll start. First, I think the amendment was just really formalizing with the SEB who had requested that things get filed, the whole exchange that we want -- that we had the 8-K and some of the other stuff. They just wanted to see it formally filed. So we did exactly that. That's all it is, nothing new than what's already been communicated. ISS, we don't control it. We would imagine that comes out likely at the end of this week, early next week, but we don't know.  \n And with regard to the Q1 to Q2 walk, Scott, really, what we would expect here is kind of the modest seasonal volume increase that you typically would see going into the second quarter, call it 1 point or 2 of increased costs. But then I think you're going to really start to see the cost lines start to show relief here, especially in comp and ben. We've started to actually experience the unwinding of service costs in March, and that's going to really accelerate into the second quarter. And I think most of those will be gone by the end of the second quarter going into the third quarter. So we've made tremendous progress there.  \n In addition, we've got restructuring benefits, the reduction of the 300-plus non-agreement workers. Most of those have already left here in middle of April and there's a few more that leave at the end of May, but we're going to start really harvesting those benefits. And fuel is another area where we're going to see some benefits with efficiency. \n John is very focused on that right now. And then, of course, we've got all of the other productivity stuff that's really starting to build. The productivity related to crew start savings, over time, car rents, things like that. So you're going to see it show up in a lot of the P&L lines, especially in com and ben. \nAlan Shaw: And Scott, recall in John's prepared remarks, you had a chart that said about $250 million in productivity over the next 6 months. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. \nThomas Wadewitz: Yes. Alan, I wanted to get your thoughts on, I guess, how -- you've had a pretty big change, obviously, the new COO, who is, John stated, been very aggressive. The team has been aggressive with taking locomotives out, changing the schedule. How do you think about the risks of that? Because I think your prior approach was something where you thought it would be better for customers to kind of have the resiliency approach. So I guess how do you think about the change in tack on operations and some of the risks of going that way and I guess also recognizing that before you kind of pointed to a lot of risks of being too aggressive on the -- I guess, on reducing people and assets? \nAlan Shaw: Tom, thanks for the question. Let me be really clear. We we're still focused on that same strategy that we laid out a couple of years ago. And that's that balance between service productivity and growth with safety at its core. And we made a lot of improvements last year in service. We made a safer road even safer, but we weren't delivering the productivity. We weren't running fast enough, and we weren't running efficiently enough. \n And so I needed to make some changes, and that's what a CEO does. And I needed to accelerate our operational improvements, and we made a number of process changes and personnel changes starting last fall. Most recently, we hired John Orr and what John is doing is he's driving productivity and continued service improvements. And so that -- that's the balance of our strategy. That's what customers want. They want service and they want us to be productive. John, you got some thoughts on that? \nJohn Orr: Yes. And as I've said in my prepared remarks, they're not mutually exclusive. In fact, they're complementary to each other. And my approach is, as I evaluate the network, and restructuring our yard and local plans, what are basically on-ramps to our corridor that touch our service, touch our customers and creating efficiencies, new standards and accelerating through our current dwell times, making improvements year-over-year, but also making improvements on the individual cars and the handoffs on those cars, it drives performance. \n And then the overall speed of the network picks up as there's more reliability. So that's why I talk to not only our craft employees and our frontline supervisors in my first few days, but also union leadership and the regulators to make sure they understood, we're going to go at a quick pace, give them a forecast of what we're doing. And I was very clear, even with our union leadership that I'm going to ask our people to do more, give them the resources, give them the training, give them the skills to do it. \n But they're going to be stretched in ways that they'll be proud of in the coming years, and we're going to do it sustainably. We're going to grow a team of capable PSR-driven leadership and do it in a way that produces amazing results. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. \nJonathan Chappell: John, I want to follow up on a couple of things that have been touched on already as it relates to the things that you've done in the last 30 days. The volumes so far this quarter have been relatively strong for Norfolk Southern, on a year-over-year basis, [indiscernible] easy comps. But as you go through the next 6 months and you deal with things like laying off 300 more locomotives or reducing merchandise families by 10%, is there a situation where you don't maybe chase volume recovery as quickly as you would otherwise? Or it's more about getting the network where it needs to be and worrying about volume and I guess, the top line beyond that next 6-month period? \nAlan Shaw: John, why don't you talk about that? And then, Ed, why don't you talk about the market? \nJohn Orr: Yes. I think that the most imperative thing we can do is to close the gap on performance, reliability and drive the value of the network. As far as the capacity, we're unlocking capacity in the existing terminals by being more efficient, more effective and driving those on-ramps to the network more effectively. What are in that pipeline? We have ample capacity to grow more trains or grow longer trains to get yield out of that even a single line capacity. \n So I don't see it as being one or the other. It's both. And whether or not the volume is there, depending on what the economy gives, we're going to drive performance, we're going to close the gap faster than anyone else. So Ed, I'll turn it to you. \nEd Elkins: Sure. And you're absolutely right, John. We've seen volume so far this month and we're encouraged by that. Our customers are encouraged by the level of service that we're delivering. And to be clear, in Intermodal, the level of service we're delivering is the best in a generation and it's sustainable and it's going to continue to be that way, and we're earning trust from our customers to do that. We're seeing very good response on the bid front for new volume converting from the highway, which we're very encouraged by in Intermodal. \n On the merchandise side, look, we spent the last 6 months building a sales conversion pipeline, which includes technology augmentation as well as institutional rigor and we are going to deliver growth from highway converting freight in the merchandise space that should be moving on Norfolk Southern. The capacity that John is unlocked and we're going to use to go out and get back the freight that should be ours. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. \nJustin Long: I guess to follow up on some of the commentary about Intermodal. You've talked about rationalizing some lanes. I wanted to get an update on where you are in that process? Is that now complete? Or is there more to come? And then similarly or along those lines, thinking about these multi-year OR targets, how do you envision the mix of the business changing? Do we need to see a shift to more general merchandise freight? Or is that not necessary to hit these OR objectives? \nEd Elkins: I'll talk about the Intermodal piece first. I think that was your first question. Look, we took a very, very disciplined view of our Intermodal network and did a couple of things. Looked at lanes that were very low density, looked at lanes that were not strategic in terms of their capability for our customers, and then thirdly, looked at lanes where we did not believe that there was going to be long-term growth potential that we have line of sight on. \n Once we pass all those filters, we talked to our partners that were engaged in those lanes that includes our port partners and some others, and we made some tough decisions. It's about 15% of the Intermodal lane portfolio, but only about of the Intermodal revenue portfolio, which should tell you something about the density there. \n Are we done? We're always looking at our network to make sure that we are applying our resources where the greatest growth potential is. And one thing that this exercise taught us is we can redeploy some of that capacity that we're freeing up toward our powerhouse lanes where we're delivering exceptional value for our customers. \nMark George: And I would say with regard to kind of the mix question. Intermodal is going to grow because that's where the growth is. We serve the consumers. But at the same time, merchandise has probably suffered more in the past couple of years from the service challenges we have. So just unlocking the network and doing everything that John is doing, should enable Merchandise to really return to better growth rates as we start to recover, and of course, that will help mix. \nEd Elkins: Absolutely. And the -- as I said, the sales pipeline approach that we're taking has a very disciplined view toward conversion from the high labels in the Merchandise as well as the Intermodal space. \nJohn Orr: And I would say as far as capacity is concerned, we're improving execution and plan compliance, and that facilitates blocking deeper into our network, which ultimately increases car velocity, train speed and really drives performance. That applies to Intermodal, Merchandise and [ Boat ]. And we're actively engaging and challenging every asset that we've got out there. Just in the last 30 days, I've approved the elimination of over 487 turnouts that were redundant. We're turning over every rock, big or small, to look for improvement and consistency. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. \nJason Seidl: John, I wanted to talk a little bit about the new PTO and sick leave regulations and how much of an impact that you've seen there and sort of what you expect going forward? And I guess a quick follow-up is when you look at sort of the whole network, how are you viewing some of the yards? And is there a chance that you look to close a yard or two down the road? \nJohn Orr: Yes. Obviously, the sick leave is a national issue. I think no different than any other regulated or introduced crew limitation, we all have to deal with it. What I'm really focused on is crew productivity and yard productivity and increasing the capabilities of each assignment to do more within the time frame they've got to work. And so delivering more, getting accountability to connections, getting yield on our trains, that's the most important piece, and we're balancing that. \n I'm on the team every day on crew availability to make sure that whatever we've committed to with our labor organizations or through the CBA process that we're living up to that. And on the flip side, making sure that the unions understand that they have an obligation to come to work within the time frames, dressed and ready to deliver for our customers each and every day. So it's both sides of that coin. \n As far as the terminals are concerned, the reason why I started with hump yards is because they can add a lot of value. They can drive a lot of mechanized performance. But as we all know, they're costly. I want to get the most yield I can get out of them. I've already challenged our yard plan from yard to yard, node to node. \n And we've started to eliminate power imbalances at a place like Chattanooga. We've reduced the bunching in the terminals by reestablishing a terminal clock at all of the major terminals. And we've even decreased a number of assignments that were moving cars and causing multiple handlings between the yards. So I would say everything is open. I'm challenging the historic reason for a yard so that whatever we do is going to meet the operational need of today and tomorrow. \n So everything is on the table. Everything is being scrutinized, and we will be rolling out a redefined yard operating plan and yard operating strategies in the next 30 days. And that will then drive or redesign of most of the operating plan over the next 60 to 90 days. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research. \nJeffrey Kauffman: John, just kind of a question on your impression coming in. As you were an outsider, you had a certain view of what Norfolk might not have been able to do. Now you're an insider, you've had a chance to see an operation. I guess my question is twofold. Number one, what's different about when you actually came on board and got a chance to get out there and see what's going on. And then my second aspect of that is, what do you think somebody on the outside might not appreciate about the Norfolk network and what can and can't be done? \nJohn Orr: Well, that's a great question. I'm glad you asked it. I'll tell you, in my first official act with boots on the ground was to go to East Palestine and really understand the scope of that issue. I'll tell you, I've been a railroader for over 40 years. I've been the incident commander at a number of derailments, some very consequential and some that I've had to make those same decisions that were made here to resolve imminent safety concerns. And understanding the scope and scale of the commitment that NS has made to that community, I've never experienced anything like that. \n And so I came in with a bias and really had to understand the magnitude of that event and how that could have had a more lasting impact across not only NS, but the sector. As I looked at our operations, I always have a bias for yards because I think yards, especially in a merchandise environment where cars and customers kind of coincide. So how we handle them, how do we accelerate or drag is really important to evaluate. \n And so I was pleasantly surprised at the richness of the terminals, but also quickly realized as I got under the hood that that was where a lot of the underperformance was happening. And that's why I set up a task force to kind of look at the data and drive performance through data, but also had a field component to check in a balance to make sure that we were driving was actually going to add performance and not undermined or burn something down that didn't need to be, either intentionally or unintentionally. \n So I think having a good perspective of what the network looks like, as an outsider, you have biases. As an insider, you start to get under the hood and realize, okay, here may be a big rock issue, but then you get to know the smaller rocks that need to be moved out of the way to create that momentum. I've made a career out of going across Canada and the United States and Mexico, unclogging drains and creating a lot of momentum and then leveraging that momentum to build very competent, capable service plans; very competent, capable operators of those service plans; and creating sustained improvements. And that's what I'm seeing right now. \n I think the architecture of NS is solid and it does come down to execution, and it's a very complex nonlinear network. That's what the east is all about. I've spent 35 of my 40 years in the east, either a craft employee or as a leader, as a senior leader in the United States, a senior leader in Eastern Canada. And I mean I know networks, I know the industrial complex that we're working in. It's very similar to the density that I just converted in Mexico. \n So I think we've got lots of work to do. But as I said in my prepared remarks, it's a robust franchise with a talented team and the resources to deliver impressive results. We just have to properly execute. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. \nStephanie Benjamin Moore: I appreciate the color, especially from you, John, on just the detailed plans in place around productivity initiatives and creating a PSR mindset across the organization. With this focus as a clear priority, what has been the customer response just given the changes underway. How does this translate into incremental volumes? Is there a natural lag from customers? Does they kind of get convinced of the changes happening? Any color there would be helpful. \nAlan Shaw: Ed, why don't you address that? \nEd Elkins: Sure. And thank you, Stephanie, for the question. As I said earlier, our customers are encouraged by a couple of things. Number one, the velocity of change that they see happening in terms of service improvement. And you think about our first quarter, we absorbed double-digit growth in our international book as well as low single-digit growth in our domestic book, held serve on our merchandise freight and improved service throughout that time and into April. So they're encouraged. \n On the Intermodal front, like I said, it's really the best service in a generation that we're delivering. And I have a lot of confidence that we're going to continue to deliver that same level of service, which is only going to deliver more value for our customers. On the merchandise side, in some cases, our customers are going to have to unwind alternatives that they've got in place. \n But you know what, have an exceptional service that is reliable and really just a conveyor belt, that's what they want. That's what allows them to unwind those alternatives and come back to where the natural value for them is, which is Norfolk Southern. \nAlan Shaw: You know, I've had a number of customers approach me, Stephanie, over the last month since John was announced, encouraged by our approach, encouraged by our direction and supporting our strategy. Our customers, as John noted, in the east are familiar with John in large part. And they've seen what he's done, wherever he's been to enhance service and enhance safety and enhance productivity, and that's what customers are looking for. \n Ed, I don't know if you know it, but just this morning, we got an e-mail from one of our largest customers, thanking us for another excellent week of service. \nEd Elkins: I was just about to close that. Thank you for another week of excellent service. You know who you are out there. \nJohn Orr: And we've had to make hard decisions. Ed and I have had to try to take very decisive decisions on car flows, even on how customers are interacting with some of our service facilities. It is -- but having the work on the front end, engaging with people, helping them understand what we're doing, helping them understand where they fit into that, whether it's union leaders, it's regulatory leaders or our customers, that really, Stephanie, helps them understand what we're doing, why we're doing it and how we're going to work together to create these standards. \nAlan Shaw: And Stephanie, that is our strategy, is making sure that we bring along our customers and our employees and our regulators and our shareholders with us as we transform Norfolk Southern into a more profitable organization with a safe and service product that is poised for growth. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. \nJordan Alliger: Yes, maybe, this is in some ways a follow-up, but I'm just sort of curious. You have a pretty extensive list of things to do over the next 6 months and then 12 to 24 months. As you sort of come in, knowing what Norfolk had done already per you getting there and the gap that's been talked about. How much of this would you say, as what you would call basic blocking and tackling versus real sea changes in operational scope? Basically trying to assess your degree of confidence level in achieving and kicking all these things off and being able to hit the margin expectations in the coming years. \nJohn Orr: Well, I'll tell you this, that all across Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, I've been a change agent and an architect of PSR. I haven't had the luxury of looking in the rearview mirror very often. And so I don't spend a lot of time looking at what could have been or what was rather than what the current situation is and how fast can we get to the desired state. Desired state is having -- closing the gap for sure, having an operation that is focused on asset management with speed and accuracy to reduce the cycle times, reduce the dwell times and drive out waste.\n So that's taking on an approach where it has a network overview. So there's a very strategic point of view on how do we create speed, accuracy by reducing dwell, increasing over-the-road performance, looking at long lead resources like locomotives and crews and how do we meet them as productive as we can and then create resiliency and elasticity for network response like we've seen in Baltimore. \n And then really look at our smart investments, how do we leverage those things like capitalizing locomotive renewals, refurbishing locomotives that can be pushed off into the future because we're creating our own locomotives by having them more productive. I think this is a natural evolution on some of the linear elements that were started in the past. Now taking a multidimensional point of view on it, not focusing on one particular thing, but elevating the entire suite of operating efficiencies at the same time in tandem with one another. Disciplined railroading, disciplined service, accurate handling of cars and reduction of waste and cost is really the plan. \n And that will show in the form of yard operating plans, disciplined operations and terminals, disciplined and progressive ways of moving the train service plan to the meet the commercial needs of today. I am highly confident, highly confident that we'll achieve the targets and we'll do it in a way that's sustainable and we'll do it in a way that fosters growth and we are on the path today. We're well underway. So that increased my confidence. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital. \nWalter Spracklin: I know you've put a lot of time under this, but I do need to come back to it and that is the -- trying to square up the changes that John is making here. They are substantial with the lack of any customer disruption. It used to be, and maybe I'm dating myself here, but it used to be when I ride, we saw PSR change. It didn't -- if customers weren't disrupted, then it wasn't happening, was kind of the view. \n And when you take out 200 locomotives, soon to be 500 locomotives, I mean that kind of has to have leave a mark. We know there's been lane reductions, I guess, feedback from those customers must have been quite negative. So I just -- just wondering, are you just refocusing on those other customers and you're getting good service to them, and they're coming back to you with some good feedback and perhaps some of the less or lower-margin customers are going to be shed a little bit? \n Just really surprised that we're not hearing more customer blowback from some of these significant and important changes that you're making. \nAlan Shaw: Walter, that's our strategy. That's what we're committed to doing. We're going to implement and we have been implementing PSR in a responsible and sustainable manner. We saw what happened in our peer in 2017. And we're not tearing this thing down to the studs. John knows how to do it without tearing it down to the studs as the activist COO has said he would have to do. \n Ed is close to our customers. Our customers appreciate and see the improved service. We're focused on safety, and we're focused on a sustainable plan for Norfolk Southern that drives long-term shareholder value. John, you want to talk about how you're doing this in the right way. \nJohn Orr: And I think Walter, by the way, it's nice to hear from you. I would say, it's what we said at the very onset, that we're taking a balanced approach. I've laid out really challenging and urgent near-term and midterm targets and I'm taking an aggressive disciplined approach to manage it. And I view as the George Foreman Grill example, you don't set and forget operations. You sweat it out and you can't drive this alone. \n So creating a team of capable railroaders focused on the big rocks and small rocks at the same time, delivering the fundamental of safety, creating stability across the network and then challenging every asset that we have, every standard that we have and building compliance and building momentum around those things is really important. So yes, it is sweat equity in a lot of respects, Walter. And it is really the key focus areas of yard time and dwell and you know what that does. \n When we drive our current dwell down from mid-'23s to '22, and we'll be taking that down even further. Not only are we handling the cars better in the terminals, but we're getting more cars on trains, getting to the customers sooner. And even the bad order count, taking it down by double digits -- by almost 50%, means those -- the discipline of handling those cars in the terminal and getting them back into the flow of our core service offerings, customers are seeing those cars faster than they would have otherwise seen them. \n So I would think that they see that as a value and rather than a negative disruption, a positive indication that we're building momentum and commitment to them while at the same time reducing handlings and costs. \nMark George: And just to close a loop, Walter, on say the locomotive specifically. Remember last year, we actually had to add locomotives back into service. We spent a fair amount of money in materials, trying to get locomotives that have been stored, back up and running so we could dig out of the top hole we were in following the East Palestine derailment. \n It's how we got service really back on the right trajectory. And now we're able to start attacking some of those resiliency costs we've added and remove locomotives and some of the other costs we had to throw at the system. So there's a lot of opportunity here to remove costs that will be nondisruptive to the customers. \nAlan Shaw: And to summarize, the service level improvements, the dramatic service level improvements and what the customers are reacting to, and that is across our markets and across our customer base. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. \nDavid Vernon: So John, you've been at the property a little over a month. I'd love to kind of get your perspective on kind of what the root cause is here that you see as far as kind of what drove the problems? Is it a question of kind of what Norfolk was trying to do or how they were doing it? And kind of any thoughts you have on that would be helpful. \n And then as you think about kind of taking 200 locomotives out, maybe another 300 locomotives. What is that for headcount? Because I would assume that the sequential headcount number was up a little over 500. Obviously, the non-craft trades -- the non-craft job action coming out, a couple of hundred heads will be down. But what are you thinking about the operating head count as you start to free up assets and run more fluidly? \nMark George: Actually, I'll handle the headcount question before John talks to you a little bit about his assessment of the challenges. You may recall, we guided last time where we said overall headcount would likely be flat over the course of the year. We were taking 300 non-agreement people out, but we would likely have to add some agreement folks that would offset it. We actually see now with John in the room here, a pathway for total headcount to be down around 2% by the time we end the year. So that's the path on headcount. John? \nJohn Orr: Yes. And just to add emphasis to that. As we get more productivity out of our yard and locos and more accuracy on our over-the-road transits and performance, we'll see more people virtually come alive, and we'll be able to have more availability and more crew flexibility. And I have frozen all hiring from operations. There may be 1 or 2 critical paths like C&S where -- signals and communications. That's a very specialized scale that we will need to continue to evolve as we bring our OT and IT and that kind of perspective into -- more into our safety plans. \n But I would also say that it gets back to the basics. I'm not going to really be too critical of what I inherited. Rather, I saw a lot of things in flight that I'm able to leverage very quickly on. And at the same time, the basics of railroading, the basics of giving a great service plan at the lowest cost in the safest way possible is the recipe and building out discipline around that, creating visibility, accountability and driving purpose so that we improve these things is part of the challenge that I've laid out. And that's how we're delivering short term and midterm, and that's what we're going to continue to do. \nOperator: At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Luke Nichols for closing comments. \nLuke Nichols: Thanks, Rob. Appreciate everyone's time and joining our call this morning. I recognize there's a few folks that didn't get a chance to ask your questions. I want to let you know Investor Relations is here through the rest of the day. Please feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to seeing everybody through the quarter. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

Here with me today are Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer; Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer; and our new Chief Operating Officer, John Orr. I am excited to have John on the Norfolk Southern team. John is a 40-year railroad industry veteran and a proven PSR expert who has worked with Hunter Harrison, Claude Mongeau and Keith Creel to implement PSR railroads across 3 countries. \n I promised you that we would focus on productivity in 2024, and we're taking action to do just that. Bringing in someone of John's caliber was another step to accelerate our operational improvement. John is going to share the progress in our operating metrics that he and his team are already driving and his plans for furthering productivity in our merchandise network to deliver immediate margin enhancement. Our strategy is about balancing service, productivity and growth with safety at its core. \n This strategy is anchored on a PSR-driven operating plan and designed to deliver top-tier earnings and revenue growth with industry competitive margins. When we say industry competitive margins, it has to be within 100 to 200 basis points of the industry average. \n Let's recall where we've been and discuss our path forward. Last year, in response to East Palestine, we prioritized investments in safety and service to protect our franchise and our shareholders, and we delivered on both fronts. We are operating one of the safest networks in North America and are producing service levels better than anything we've seen since 2019. \n Despite that progress, more work remains to be done to get us back to industry competitive margins. We were not delivering the productivity, and we were not running fast enough or efficiently enough. I needed to make changes to accelerate our progress and to introduce greater operational discipline into our culture. To that end, we started making organizational and process changes last fall, culminating with the recent hiring of John Orr. \n Now we have safely built the foundation to drive substantial gains in productivity, and we've committed to a 400 to [ 450 ] basis point OR improvement in the second half of this year. We will close that margin gap with peers. We will deliver a sub-60 operating ratio in the next 3 to 4 years, and we will do it at a safe, sustainable manner that recognizes our current operating environment and brings key constituents, including our shareholders, customers, employees and regulators along with us on our mission. \n We will urgently deliver productivity through disciplined operational excellence that continues to safely serve our customers, positions us to grow by meeting markets as they evolve and allows us to generate outsized returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Mark to review our first quarter financial results. Our strategy is designed to mirror the great success stories of the Canadian railroads who have recognized that PSR is about more than tearing a railroad down to its studs at slashing costs regardless of the fallout. As our Board member, Claude Mongeau, demonstrated when he was CEO of Canadian National, a PSR operating model, when part of a customer-focused balanced strategy, can deliver top-tier revenue growth and a sub-60 operating ratio. John Orr was an integral part of Claude's leadership team at CN and thus, a perfect fit from Norfolk Southern as we turbocharge productivity in pursuit of industry competitive margins and top-tier earnings growth.  \n Core to this are the men and women of Norfolk Southern. I'm incredibly proud of all they've done to progress the execution of our differentiated strategy. So my colleagues, thank you for everything you do for Norfolk Southern, our shareholders, our customers and your fellow team members. Together, we are on a transformational journey to a safer more profitable railroad, poised for growth with strong execution from an experienced leadership team. \n We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Thanks for the question, Brian. Let me be really clear. The agreement related to the Meridian Speedway is by no means a consequential concession, and it does not impact Mexico. We said it impacts the Dallas business, which is largely defined by abundant truck capacity. John, do you want to handle the second part of his one question. And Scott, recall in John's prepared remarks, you had a chart that said about $250 million in productivity over the next 6 months. Tom, thanks for the question. Let me be really clear. We we're still focused on that same strategy that we laid out a couple of years ago. And that's that balance between service productivity and growth with safety at its core. And we made a lot of improvements last year in service. We made a safer road even safer, but we weren't delivering the productivity. We weren't running fast enough, and we weren't running efficiently enough. \n And so I needed to make some changes, and that's what a CEO does. And I needed to accelerate our operational improvements, and we made a number of process changes and personnel changes starting last fall. Most recently, we hired John Orr and what John is doing is he's driving productivity and continued service improvements. And so that -- that's the balance of our strategy. That's what customers want. They want service and they want us to be productive. John, you got some thoughts on that? John, why don't you talk about that? And then, Ed, why don't you talk about the market? Ed, why don't you address that? You know, I've had a number of customers approach me, Stephanie, over the last month since John was announced, encouraged by our approach, encouraged by our direction and supporting our strategy. Our customers, as John noted, in the east are familiar with John in large part. And they've seen what he's done, wherever he's been to enhance service and enhance safety and enhance productivity, and that's what customers are looking for. \n Ed, I don't know if you know it, but just this morning, we got an e-mail from one of our largest customers, thanking us for another excellent week of service. And Stephanie, that is our strategy, is making sure that we bring along our customers and our employees and our regulators and our shareholders with us as we transform Norfolk Southern into a more profitable organization with a safe and service product that is poised for growth. Walter, that's our strategy. That's what we're committed to doing. We're going to implement and we have been implementing PSR in a responsible and sustainable manner. We saw what happened in our peer in 2017. And we're not tearing this thing down to the studs. John knows how to do it without tearing it down to the studs as the activist COO has said he would have to do. \n Ed is close to our customers. Our customers appreciate and see the improved service. We're focused on safety, and we're focused on a sustainable plan for Norfolk Southern that drives long-term shareholder value. John, you want to talk about how you're doing this in the right way. And to summarize, the service level improvements, the dramatic service level improvements and what the customers are reacting to, and that is across our markets and across our customer base."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and good morning to everyone on the call. Starting on Slide 11, I'll go over our commercial results for the quarter. Overall, volume grew by 4% versus last year, driven by Intermodal. Revenue for the first quarter came in just above $3 billion, down 4% year-over-year as total RPU fell 8%.  \n Starting with merchandise, volume was flat versus last year, while revenue ticked down 1% driven by lower fuel surcharge revenue. RPU less fuel increased by 3% year-over-year setting an all-time quarterly record, which also led to a new all-time quarterly record for revenue less fuel. This marks the 35th out of the prior 36 quarters that merchandise RPU grew year-over-year, and once again, reaffirms our commitment to price and the increasing value of our service. \n Turning to Intermodal. Volume grew 8% year-over-year, primarily on strength in International. However, revenue decreased 8% as RPU excluding fuel and storage and fees declined by 6% overall. Revenue was also impacted by the lane rationalization across Intermodal that simplified our network. This decision demonstrates how marketing, operations and finance are aligned to increase productivity and drive smart and sustainable growth. \n Digging into coal, volumes for the quarter declined by 4% as weakness in the utility market was only partially offset by export strength driven by a historically strong export quarter as our cross-functional efforts to boost throughput at our Lamberts Point terminal yielded positive results. These results are a great example of NS pulling together to deliver strong value for our shareholders and for our customers. \n Let's move to Slide 12, where I'm introducing a new view of our results that helps frame the main first quarter drivers of revenue and revenue per unit. Overall, fuel surcharge revenue was the single largest headwind in the quarter, declining by $115 million.\n The first quarter was also the last one where Intermodal storage and fees are a substantial year-over-year headwind with revenues declining by $35 million. In Coal, we experienced positive mix from higher export volumes and higher utility shipments in the South. This positive mix was more than offset by lower realized price and export shipments as seaborne coal prices weakened significantly throughout the quarter.\n Merchandise revenue, excluding fuel, was driven higher by pricing gains across the entire book. Overall pricing and volume increases in our metals franchise were boosted by improved network fluidity from increased car velocity. That same velocity and fluidity helped volumes in automotive remained flat despite manufacturing headwinds at several of the plants that we serve.  \n Intermodal revenue, excluding fuel and storage and fees increased as higher volumes more than offset adverse mix and continued slight capacity in the domestic truck market created headwinds to RPU. Higher international shipments and lower domestic premium shipments were the main drivers of adverse mix. Additionally, RPU was impacted from higher international empty shipments as these grew 57% year-over-year in the quarter. We believe elongated ocean transit times are a driving factor pushing ocean carriers to deploy their capacity back on the water as soon as possible, which increases the need to reposition empty containers back to the ports.  \n Turning to Slide 13. Let's go over our market outlook for the remainder of '24. The macro landscape presents a mixed bag with uncertainty regarding inflation and future Fed rate actions overshadowing the recent recovery in manufacturing. However, our improving service product places us in an excellent position to capitalize on growth opportunities. \n Starting with our view on the widely varying merchandise markets, we generally see support from volume from the normalization of auto production and the continued strength in infrastructure projects across our network. A positive price environment will continue, which is supported by the increase in network fluidity. Improved cycle times, equipment availability and network velocity will be a broad positive tailwind across our portfolio and merchandise. And we also expect to drive incremental volumes through project development, such as our recently announced Great Lakes reload acquisition, the merger of TDIS into Triple Crown Services and continued industrial development wins. \n Intermodal volumes are increase as international trade remains robust. We expect continued mix impacts from higher international empty shipments as geopolitical tensions remain elevated, but a weak truck market continues to drive stubbornly low truck rates, which will dampen domestic nonpremium Intermodal pricing. Additionally, we expect volumes in our domestic premium business to fall as challenging LTL market forces reduced freight demand for parcel shipments. \n Finally, coal volumes will be challenged as high stockpiles and low natural gas prices reduce utility shipments. In addition, export shipments will be affected by the Baltimore port shutdown. We are diligently working with our customers to provide alternate supply chain solutions, and the increased network fluidity is providing the capacity necessary to execute on those solutions.  \n Finally, seaborne coal prices have weakened as supply has outstripped global demand and this headwind is expected to continue throughout the remainder of the year. Before I turn it over to John, I'd like to close by making our customers for trusting Norfolk Southern to move their freight. Sure. And you're absolutely right, John. We've seen volume so far this month and we're encouraged by that. Our customers are encouraged by the level of service that we're delivering. And to be clear, in Intermodal, the level of service we're delivering is the best in a generation and it's sustainable and it's going to continue to be that way, and we're earning trust from our customers to do that. We're seeing very good response on the bid front for new volume converting from the highway, which we're very encouraged by in Intermodal. \n On the merchandise side, look, we spent the last 6 months building a sales conversion pipeline, which includes technology augmentation as well as institutional rigor and we are going to deliver growth from highway converting freight in the merchandise space that should be moving on Norfolk Southern. The capacity that John is unlocked and we're going to use to go out and get back the freight that should be ours. I'll talk about the Intermodal piece first. I think that was your first question. Look, we took a very, very disciplined view of our Intermodal network and did a couple of things. Looked at lanes that were very low density, looked at lanes that were not strategic in terms of their capability for our customers, and then thirdly, looked at lanes where we did not believe that there was going to be long-term growth potential that we have line of sight on. \n Once we pass all those filters, we talked to our partners that were engaged in those lanes that includes our port partners and some others, and we made some tough decisions. It's about 15% of the Intermodal lane portfolio, but only about of the Intermodal revenue portfolio, which should tell you something about the density there. \n Are we done? We're always looking at our network to make sure that we are applying our resources where the greatest growth potential is. And one thing that this exercise taught us is we can redeploy some of that capacity that we're freeing up toward our powerhouse lanes where we're delivering exceptional value for our customers. Absolutely. And the -- as I said, the sales pipeline approach that we're taking has a very disciplined view toward conversion from the high labels in the Merchandise as well as the Intermodal space. Sure. And thank you, Stephanie, for the question. As I said earlier, our customers are encouraged by a couple of things. Number one, the velocity of change that they see happening in terms of service improvement. And you think about our first quarter, we absorbed double-digit growth in our international book as well as low single-digit growth in our domestic book, held serve on our merchandise freight and improved service throughout that time and into April. So they're encouraged. \n On the Intermodal front, like I said, it's really the best service in a generation that we're delivering. And I have a lot of confidence that we're going to continue to deliver that same level of service, which is only going to deliver more value for our customers. On the merchandise side, in some cases, our customers are going to have to unwind alternatives that they've got in place. \n But you know what, have an exceptional service that is reliable and really just a conveyor belt, that's what they want. That's what allows them to unwind those alternatives and come back to where the natural value for them is, which is Norfolk Southern. I was just about to close that. Thank you for another week of excellent service. You know who you are out there."

            "name": "John Orr",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed. I arrived at NS in late March and immediately got to work immersing myself in the operations and connecting with our people. I've had boots on the ground assessing terminals and engaging craft colleagues and frontline supervisors. I've also met with our stakeholders from labor, regulatory and community leadership. What I've seen confirms that NS is a robust franchise with a talented team and the resources to deliver impressive results when properly executed. Our safety performance as shown on Slide 15, has trended favorably. I have observed a strong safety commitment, and we are building on that. My first action as COO was a system safety blitz to provide clarity around the value of safety.  \n Turning to Slide 16. It is imperative that we closed the profitability gap with our peers. We are now delivering encouraging trends in productivity. Our strategy is balanced. Our operating efficiency and service excellence are achieved in tandem. Our approach is a flywheel of value creation where people, processes and accountability intersect to drive performance, anchoring our service and profitability proposition. Accountability is key. We're providing our team with the metrics they need to track their performance.\n In my first 30 days, we have removed approximately 200 locomotives from the available fleet. Most of these have gone into stored status or driven off-line for [indiscernible]. Our availability count is now below 2,500 units. As shown on the slide, we will be able to increase locomotive drawdown over the next 6 months. Terminal 12 has improved by 8%. We are driving more waste by fine-tuning workload in our terminals through disciplined planned execution. Near term, we are targeting 20% improvement.  \n Car miles have improved by 8%. And this is another productivity measure, we target for double-digit improvement. Recrews are trending down 22% as network and terminal improvements are combining to improve fluidity across the main line. And lastly, we are reviewing the entire train service plan. This will drive core rationalization in the range of 4%, resulting from these initiatives. We are driving out excess cost as we close the gap to our peers. \n Referring to Slide 17, network update. To accelerate improvements and address network underperformance, I have established a network optimization team that identifies areas for immediate improvement. I have deployed 2 task force to drive field productivity and throughput at 2 major terminals.\n The outcomes from these efforts will rapidly go out to scale throughout the network. We are training our operations leaders to think differently to make faster decisions and to eliminate waste more vigorously. My commitment is to develop PSR railroaders to instill the discipline for continuous improvement and to streamline execution by relentlessly managing assets in context to our commercial obligations. The initial results across the entire network have been promising. Our people are driving PSR results.  \n To create accountability and to track progress, we're introducing a comprehensive set of metrics. I've laid out challenging and urgent near-term targets, and I'm taking an aggressive disciplined approach to achieve our long-term financial glide path. And I can tell you, now we have a significant runway on cost reduction. As our fleet becomes more efficient, we benefit in rents and materials by shedding assets and from improving the fleet composition and getting out more costly cars. \n Our locomotive fleet now has significant capacity. I believe we will be able to scale down discretionary capital spending on the fleet. And we have a robust terminal footprint, covering a rich array of industrial activity. And as we optimize our terminals, we are challenging the historic use to create value through consolidation and efficiencies. I am proud and excited to have the opportunity to lead the operations team at NS. I look forward to your questions, and I will turn the call back to Alan. Sure. Brian, nice to talk to you. And I'll tell you, I've been out assessing the network, and I'm really confident with the plans that I've got underway today that we're on track for the 400 to 500 basis points by year-end. And I'll tell you, our operating costs are a direct reflection of our asset management. And speed and accuracy are really essential to that. And our ability to rapidly cycle assets reduces our need for them, which is why we're focused on accelerating all of our operations simultaneously while taking out costs. \n And I'm very confident with our dwell, our over-the-road performance, the discipline we put on our locomotive fleets and the crew productivity and some of the smart investments that we're making to unlock the value, we're well underway. Yes. And as I've said in my prepared remarks, they're not mutually exclusive. In fact, they're complementary to each other. And my approach is, as I evaluate the network, and restructuring our yard and local plans, what are basically on-ramps to our corridor that touch our service, touch our customers and creating efficiencies, new standards and accelerating through our current dwell times, making improvements year-over-year, but also making improvements on the individual cars and the handoffs on those cars, it drives performance. \n And then the overall speed of the network picks up as there's more reliability. So that's why I talk to not only our craft employees and our frontline supervisors in my first few days, but also union leadership and the regulators to make sure they understood, we're going to go at a quick pace, give them a forecast of what we're doing. And I was very clear, even with our union leadership that I'm going to ask our people to do more, give them the resources, give them the training, give them the skills to do it. \n But they're going to be stretched in ways that they'll be proud of in the coming years, and we're going to do it sustainably. We're going to grow a team of capable PSR-driven leadership and do it in a way that produces amazing results. Yes. I think that the most imperative thing we can do is to close the gap on performance, reliability and drive the value of the network. As far as the capacity, we're unlocking capacity in the existing terminals by being more efficient, more effective and driving those on-ramps to the network more effectively. What are in that pipeline? We have ample capacity to grow more trains or grow longer trains to get yield out of that even a single line capacity. \n So I don't see it as being one or the other. It's both. And whether or not the volume is there, depending on what the economy gives, we're going to drive performance, we're going to close the gap faster than anyone else. So Ed, I'll turn it to you. And I would say as far as capacity is concerned, we're improving execution and plan compliance, and that facilitates blocking deeper into our network, which ultimately increases car velocity, train speed and really drives performance. That applies to Intermodal, Merchandise and [ Boat ]. And we're actively engaging and challenging every asset that we've got out there. Just in the last 30 days, I've approved the elimination of over 487 turnouts that were redundant. We're turning over every rock, big or small, to look for improvement and consistency. Yes. Obviously, the sick leave is a national issue. I think no different than any other regulated or introduced crew limitation, we all have to deal with it. What I'm really focused on is crew productivity and yard productivity and increasing the capabilities of each assignment to do more within the time frame they've got to work. And so delivering more, getting accountability to connections, getting yield on our trains, that's the most important piece, and we're balancing that. \n I'm on the team every day on crew availability to make sure that whatever we've committed to with our labor organizations or through the CBA process that we're living up to that. And on the flip side, making sure that the unions understand that they have an obligation to come to work within the time frames, dressed and ready to deliver for our customers each and every day. So it's both sides of that coin. \n As far as the terminals are concerned, the reason why I started with hump yards is because they can add a lot of value. They can drive a lot of mechanized performance. But as we all know, they're costly. I want to get the most yield I can get out of them. I've already challenged our yard plan from yard to yard, node to node. \n And we've started to eliminate power imbalances at a place like Chattanooga. We've reduced the bunching in the terminals by reestablishing a terminal clock at all of the major terminals. And we've even decreased a number of assignments that were moving cars and causing multiple handlings between the yards. So I would say everything is open. I'm challenging the historic reason for a yard so that whatever we do is going to meet the operational need of today and tomorrow. \n So everything is on the table. Everything is being scrutinized, and we will be rolling out a redefined yard operating plan and yard operating strategies in the next 30 days. And that will then drive or redesign of most of the operating plan over the next 60 to 90 days. Well, that's a great question. I'm glad you asked it. I'll tell you, in my first official act with boots on the ground was to go to East Palestine and really understand the scope of that issue. I'll tell you, I've been a railroader for over 40 years. I've been the incident commander at a number of derailments, some very consequential and some that I've had to make those same decisions that were made here to resolve imminent safety concerns. And understanding the scope and scale of the commitment that NS has made to that community, I've never experienced anything like that. \n And so I came in with a bias and really had to understand the magnitude of that event and how that could have had a more lasting impact across not only NS, but the sector. As I looked at our operations, I always have a bias for yards because I think yards, especially in a merchandise environment where cars and customers kind of coincide. So how we handle them, how do we accelerate or drag is really important to evaluate. \n And so I was pleasantly surprised at the richness of the terminals, but also quickly realized as I got under the hood that that was where a lot of the underperformance was happening. And that's why I set up a task force to kind of look at the data and drive performance through data, but also had a field component to check in a balance to make sure that we were driving was actually going to add performance and not undermined or burn something down that didn't need to be, either intentionally or unintentionally. \n So I think having a good perspective of what the network looks like, as an outsider, you have biases. As an insider, you start to get under the hood and realize, okay, here may be a big rock issue, but then you get to know the smaller rocks that need to be moved out of the way to create that momentum. I've made a career out of going across Canada and the United States and Mexico, unclogging drains and creating a lot of momentum and then leveraging that momentum to build very competent, capable service plans; very competent, capable operators of those service plans; and creating sustained improvements. And that's what I'm seeing right now. \n I think the architecture of NS is solid and it does come down to execution, and it's a very complex nonlinear network. That's what the east is all about. I've spent 35 of my 40 years in the east, either a craft employee or as a leader, as a senior leader in the United States, a senior leader in Eastern Canada. And I mean I know networks, I know the industrial complex that we're working in. It's very similar to the density that I just converted in Mexico. \n So I think we've got lots of work to do. But as I said in my prepared remarks, it's a robust franchise with a talented team and the resources to deliver impressive results. We just have to properly execute. And we've had to make hard decisions. Ed and I have had to try to take very decisive decisions on car flows, even on how customers are interacting with some of our service facilities. It is -- but having the work on the front end, engaging with people, helping them understand what we're doing, helping them understand where they fit into that, whether it's union leaders, it's regulatory leaders or our customers, that really, Stephanie, helps them understand what we're doing, why we're doing it and how we're going to work together to create these standards. Well, I'll tell you this, that all across Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, I've been a change agent and an architect of PSR. I haven't had the luxury of looking in the rearview mirror very often. And so I don't spend a lot of time looking at what could have been or what was rather than what the current situation is and how fast can we get to the desired state. Desired state is having -- closing the gap for sure, having an operation that is focused on asset management with speed and accuracy to reduce the cycle times, reduce the dwell times and drive out waste.\n So that's taking on an approach where it has a network overview. So there's a very strategic point of view on how do we create speed, accuracy by reducing dwell, increasing over-the-road performance, looking at long lead resources like locomotives and crews and how do we meet them as productive as we can and then create resiliency and elasticity for network response like we've seen in Baltimore. \n And then really look at our smart investments, how do we leverage those things like capitalizing locomotive renewals, refurbishing locomotives that can be pushed off into the future because we're creating our own locomotives by having them more productive. I think this is a natural evolution on some of the linear elements that were started in the past. Now taking a multidimensional point of view on it, not focusing on one particular thing, but elevating the entire suite of operating efficiencies at the same time in tandem with one another. Disciplined railroading, disciplined service, accurate handling of cars and reduction of waste and cost is really the plan. \n And that will show in the form of yard operating plans, disciplined operations and terminals, disciplined and progressive ways of moving the train service plan to the meet the commercial needs of today. I am highly confident, highly confident that we'll achieve the targets and we'll do it in a way that's sustainable and we'll do it in a way that fosters growth and we are on the path today. We're well underway. So that increased my confidence. And I think Walter, by the way, it's nice to hear from you. I would say, it's what we said at the very onset, that we're taking a balanced approach. I've laid out really challenging and urgent near-term and midterm targets and I'm taking an aggressive disciplined approach to manage it. And I view as the George Foreman Grill example, you don't set and forget operations. You sweat it out and you can't drive this alone. \n So creating a team of capable railroaders focused on the big rocks and small rocks at the same time, delivering the fundamental of safety, creating stability across the network and then challenging every asset that we have, every standard that we have and building compliance and building momentum around those things is really important. So yes, it is sweat equity in a lot of respects, Walter. And it is really the key focus areas of yard time and dwell and you know what that does. \n When we drive our current dwell down from mid-'23s to '22, and we'll be taking that down even further. Not only are we handling the cars better in the terminals, but we're getting more cars on trains, getting to the customers sooner. And even the bad order count, taking it down by double digits -- by almost 50%, means those -- the discipline of handling those cars in the terminal and getting them back into the flow of our core service offerings, customers are seeing those cars faster than they would have otherwise seen them. \n So I would think that they see that as a value and rather than a negative disruption, a positive indication that we're building momentum and commitment to them while at the same time reducing handlings and costs. Yes. And just to add emphasis to that. As we get more productivity out of our yard and locos and more accuracy on our over-the-road transits and performance, we'll see more people virtually come alive, and we'll be able to have more availability and more crew flexibility. And I have frozen all hiring from operations. There may be 1 or 2 critical paths like C&S where -- signals and communications. That's a very specialized scale that we will need to continue to evolve as we bring our OT and IT and that kind of perspective into -- more into our safety plans. \n But I would also say that it gets back to the basics. I'm not going to really be too critical of what I inherited. Rather, I saw a lot of things in flight that I'm able to leverage very quickly on. And at the same time, the basics of railroading, the basics of giving a great service plan at the lowest cost in the safest way possible is the recipe and building out discipline around that, creating visibility, accountability and driving purpose so that we improve these things is part of the challenge that I've laid out. And that's how we're delivering short term and midterm, and that's what we're going to continue to do."

            "name": "Mark George",
            "content": "Thanks, Alan. As seen on Slide 5, our GAAP results in Q1 were impacted by 4 items that we've called out for you. Earlier in the month, we announced the $600 million agreement in principle to resolve a consolidated class action lawsuit relating to the East Palestine derailment. That addresses the most significant remaining legal exposures for our shareholders. \n Including other cleanup costs and insurance recoveries in the quarter, our operating income was adversely impacted by $592 million. You'll note at the bottom, another $108 million of insurance recoveries in the quarter. That brings our recoveries to date in excess of $200 million toward our $1.1 billion insurance coverage tower. \n Moving to the right. We told you last quarter about our initiative to drive a 7% reduction in non-agreement headcount, for which savings will begin to materialize in Q2. That initiative, along with our operations leadership change resulted in a $99 million charge. Next, our advisory costs associated with our now very public shareholder matter recorded in nonoperating. Finally, we also called out here a favorable deferred tax adjustment affecting our income tax expense. For the remaining slides, I'll speak to our adjusted results, excluding these items, as shown here on the far right. \n Moving to Slide 6, let's focus on the adjusted variances compared to Q1 of 2023 in the year-over-year columns. Those results were impacted by 4% lower revenues driven by meaningfully lower fuel surcharge as well as headwinds in Intermodal that Ed will detail later. Operating expenses were up 3% from inflation and the increased workforce. You'll see an OpEx year-over-year waterfall in the appendix that provides more detail. \n Not on this page is nonoperating income, which was down $17 million from lower gains on our company-owned life insurance. That decline, coupled with the lower operating income drove the net income and EPS reductions you see here on a year-over-year basis. \n Let's talk on the right side about the sequential variance from Q4 2023, where we guided to a 100 to 200 basis point deterioration in our OR, which is in line with normal seasonality. That's exactly where we landed right at the lower end of that range. On the next couple of charts, we'll detail the sequential revenue and OpEx walks from Q4. \n So revenue here on Slide 7 moved down sequentially driven by fuel surcharge headwinds and overall lower volumes driven by coal and Intermodal. Coal pricing was weaker and Intermodal faced difficult conditions with volumes down 3% and continued adverse mix from softness in our higher-yield premium business. \n Slide 8, turning to our operating expenses. They were down 1% as compared to Q4. We faced typical sequential headwinds associated with the reset of payroll taxes, and we had meaningful headwinds from returning to normal incentive compensation accrual levels as well as no property sales in the first quarter. We offset those headwinds by lower spend in purchased services, efficiency gains in comp embedded as well as favorable fuel prices. \n While fuel expense was down 6% sequentially, recall that surcharge revenue was down 17% sequentially, and that drives a 40 basis point OR headwind on a sequential basis. As we turn to the balance of the year, we will see our margins improve materially from here. We are finally starting to see excess service costs unwind and they will accelerate downward in Q2. That trajectory, along with the reduction in non-agreement headcount as well as other productivity initiatives leave us confident in a strong productivity story for Q2. \n We anticipate a modest seasonal volume lift sequentially, although there is some pressure to our Coal business from the Baltimore Bridge disruption. Despite the port closure, we still believe we will be within the first half 67% to 68% OR guidance range, assuming that the channel reopens at the beginning of June. The revenue impact from the channel closure is in the $25 million to $35 million per month range. More productivity momentum builds in the back half as well as stronger volumes, and that provides us with confidence in the 400 to 450 basis points of OR improvement. John will talk more about the productivity runway in front of us. But first, I'll hand over to Ed to discuss revenues. Yes, I'll start. First, I think the amendment was just really formalizing with the SEB who had requested that things get filed, the whole exchange that we want -- that we had the 8-K and some of the other stuff. They just wanted to see it formally filed. So we did exactly that. That's all it is, nothing new than what's already been communicated. ISS, we don't control it. We would imagine that comes out likely at the end of this week, early next week, but we don't know.  \n And with regard to the Q1 to Q2 walk, Scott, really, what we would expect here is kind of the modest seasonal volume increase that you typically would see going into the second quarter, call it 1 point or 2 of increased costs. But then I think you're going to really start to see the cost lines start to show relief here, especially in comp and ben. We've started to actually experience the unwinding of service costs in March, and that's going to really accelerate into the second quarter. And I think most of those will be gone by the end of the second quarter going into the third quarter. So we've made tremendous progress there.  \n In addition, we've got restructuring benefits, the reduction of the 300-plus non-agreement workers. Most of those have already left here in middle of April and there's a few more that leave at the end of May, but we're going to start really harvesting those benefits. And fuel is another area where we're going to see some benefits with efficiency. \n John is very focused on that right now. And then, of course, we've got all of the other productivity stuff that's really starting to build. The productivity related to crew start savings, over time, car rents, things like that. So you're going to see it show up in a lot of the P&L lines, especially in com and ben. And I would say with regard to kind of the mix question. Intermodal is going to grow because that's where the growth is. We serve the consumers. But at the same time, merchandise has probably suffered more in the past couple of years from the service challenges we have. So just unlocking the network and doing everything that John is doing, should enable Merchandise to really return to better growth rates as we start to recover, and of course, that will help mix. And just to close a loop, Walter, on say the locomotive specifically. Remember last year, we actually had to add locomotives back into service. We spent a fair amount of money in materials, trying to get locomotives that have been stored, back up and running so we could dig out of the top hole we were in following the East Palestine derailment. \n It's how we got service really back on the right trajectory. And now we're able to start attacking some of those resiliency costs we've added and remove locomotives and some of the other costs we had to throw at the system. So there's a lot of opportunity here to remove costs that will be nondisruptive to the customers. Actually, I'll handle the headcount question before John talks to you a little bit about his assessment of the challenges. You may recall, we guided last time where we said overall headcount would likely be flat over the course of the year. We were taking 300 non-agreement people out, but we would likely have to add some agreement folks that would offset it. We actually see now with John in the room here, a pathway for total headcount to be down around 2% by the time we end the year. So that's the path on headcount. John?"
