At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Zillow Group Fourth Quarter 2020 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Berning, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrad Berning: Thank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, and welcome to Zillow Group\u2019s fourth quarter 2020 conference call. Joining me today to discuss our Q4 results are Zillow Group\u2019s Co-Founder and CEO, Rich Barton; and CFO, Allen Parker. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements about our future performance and operating plans based on our current expectations and assumptions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and we encourage you to consider the risk factors described in our SEC filings for additional information. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events, except as required by law. This call is being broadcast on the Internet and is accessible on our Investor Relations website. A recording of the call will be available later today. During the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, which we refer to as EBITDA. We encourage you to read our shareholder letter and our earnings release, which can be found on our Investor Relations website, as they contain important information about our GAAP and non-GAAP results, including reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, please note, we will refer to our Internet, Media & Technology segment as our IMT segment. We will now open the call with brief remarks followed by live Q&A. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rich.\nRich Barton: You\u2019re on mute, Rich. That\u2019s now in the dictionary. Sorry about that. Thanks, Brad. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining our first call of the New Year. February marks a big milestone for Zillow, our 15-year anniversary. We were motivated at the beginning by the same dream that motivates us now, reinventing a disjointed and friction-filled process to make it easier for people to move. While we have made tremendous progress and our position is strong, we are in many ways just getting started. A year ago on this same call, I deemed 2019 a tumultuously remarkable year. In hindsight, I clearly had no idea what tumultuous meant. There\u2019ll be plenty of studies on COVID\u2019s impact on society, business, politics and real estate in the years ahead. But today, I\u2019ll focus on Zillow\u2019s impressive results in 2020 and some of our key accomplishments. First and foremost, we saw engagement across our mobile apps and websites in 2020 at levels we would not previously have thought possible. Zillow surfing has broken through to a whole new level of pop culture given that Saturday Night Live did a funny and racy sketch about it this past weekend with guest host Dan Levy in the lead. Fantasizing about real estate is not new. Our survey results and traffic has always indicated that people love looking at real estate and want to move. What has changed is that more of those people now have the freedom to move. Many Americans untethered from their commutes and offices have begun to reevaluate how and where they want to live. This cultural trend, which we have been calling the great reshuffling, along with our continued technology improvements, resulted in 9.6 billion visits to our mobile apps and websites over the course of 2020. That is 1.5 billion more visits than in 2019. We took advantage of this rush of top of funnel engagement and executed well across Zillow\u2019s suite of products and services. We accelerated the growth of our flagship buy-side business, Zillow Premier Agent, partnering with real estate agents across the country to produce the strongest results we\u2019ve ever seen, reporting a 35% revenue growth year-over-year in Q4. Our burgeoning sell-side business, Zillow Offers, proved durable through some bad weather. We paused home buying to manage risk during the early days of the pandemic, but exited 2020 with our quarterly acquisitions pace returning to Q4 2019 levels. We augmented these buy and sell-side businesses with excellent execution in our adjacent services. Our financing arm, Zillow Home Loans, nearly tripled its originations revenue in 2020 compared to 2019. We expanded Zillow Closing Services to 25 markets in less than 12 months, and a vast majority of our customers are now choosing to close with us when purchasing a home from Zillow Offers. This execution resulted in total revenue growth of 22%, which when combined with a disciplined approach to managing costs, resulted in more than $300 million in incremental EBITDA profit generation across the company as compared to 2019. Our team drove these business results in 2020, while quickly adjusting to a new way of working with 90% of our workforce doing their jobs remotely. While many companies across the country are evaluating their go-forward policies about remote work, Zillow is onto the next play as legendary Duke basketball coach, Mike Krzyzewski likes to say. Having internalized, we are already successfully operating as a cloud headquartered company. This location flexible work model has a myriad of benefits. Our employees, like so many others across the country who are participating in the great reshuffling, now have the flexibility to wrap their work around their lives rather than vice versa. And it allows us to recruit from almost anywhere and increase diversity in our workforce. We believe this will be a significant competitive advantage as we grow and it is already yielding exciting results. Of course, there are challenges to not being in the office together, but that is temporal. In a post-COVID world, our workplace design goal is to maximize flexibility for our high demand talent. We will have awesome offices for those who want or need to come in. At the same time, we must ensure a level playing field for all team members, regardless of their physical location. There cannot be a two-class system, those in the room being first class and those on the phone being second class. We are entering the most interesting and innovative period for workplace design in our lifetimes, and our people and facilities teams at Zillow are out in front. To wrap this year in review, I must say how proud I am of what our whole team has accomplished on the scariest of rollercoaster rides that was 2020. And I would like to thank them here for their commitment and resilience. As we look ahead, I\u2019ll start with the housing market. Our Zillow economists have made bold predictions for an even stronger housing market this year. They\u2019re projecting a near record of 6.8 million home sales for 21% growth, plus double-digit home price appreciation. We, of course, do not have a crystal ball, and our mission does not depend on the cyclical vagaries of the housing market due to the mega shift from offline to online. But we believe that residential real estate will continue its risk trajectory. The millennial generation is entering prime home buying years and mortgage rates are historically low. On top of those macro factors, the past year has members of all generations rethinking, where they live with a new lens of flexibility and possibility as the great reshuffling continues to take hold. Some of you are concerned about low inventory persisting, despite historically low inventory, 2020 closed with 5.6 million existing home sales, the highest level since 2006. Low inventory and high volume of sales seem at odds until you consider how quickly homes are selling. Average time on market was 17 days in December, a full 25 fewer days than in December of 2019. In addition to being a hot market, agents and customers adopted technology and tools for safety, convenience, and simply to compete, and higher prices pull more inventory onto the market, of course. So, like a warehouse using lean operations to transition to just-in-time inventory management, the housing market became more streamlined. Current home inventory levels therefore can be addressed with something like the safety refrain from a flight attendant. The oxygen will flow even if the bag does not appear to be to fully inflate. Amid what we believe will be a very healthy housing market backdrop, we expect 2021 will be a pivotal year for Zillow. I\u2019ve spent some breadth here in the past two years, talking about our transition from Zillow 1.0, a media-focused business, into Zillow 2.0, a transaction-focused business. Today, I believe that we have the pieces in place, the vision, the team, the technology solutions and customer products and services to execute on Zillow 2.0 now. We will undoubtedly keep innovating and adding products and services on the long road to customer one-click trade in Nirvana, but our entire company is now relentlessly focused on transactions and ready to scale from here. To do that, we are investing aggressively in technologies and services that make it easier for our customers to make that transition. As part of our quest to make our customers\u2019 experiences better today, we announced our intent to acquire ShowingTime, an industry-leading real estate showing software provider that facilitated over 50 million in-person home tours in 2020 for $500 million. ShowingTime technology already expands into the broader real estate industry and we intend to grow its adoption across the industry moving forward to the benefit of all industry participants and customers. The additional ShowingTime to our suite of real estate technology solutions allows us to accelerate a widely-adopted solution for scheduling home tours. We see this as similar to the work we did to build our connections platform a few years ago and wider acceptance of this technology has the added benefit of improving the experience for the broader industry as well as for our Premier Agent partners as our platform grows. We envision a future experience that begins on our mobile app, where a customer can immerse herself in a home via our 3D home technology, looking in-person tour through ShowingTime with an agent, get pre-qualified through Zillow home loans, work with a Premier Agent to buy the home and close the transaction with Zillow Closing Services. We have spent the last year bringing out Zillow Offers, bringing our Zillow Offers and Premier Agent businesses closer together to orient around customer success and customer choice. While I know you all think of these businesses as distinct, our customers arrive at Zillow, simply trying to move. It is our job to deliver for them in any way that we can, be it through our own services or with our best-in-class partners. Our customers are hungry for the seamless experience that we can now provide. In programs we\u2019ve begun to run across the country, we see evidence that a suite of Zillow services appeals to people. Take retired elementary school teacher, Terry Lee, after 44 years in her Atlanta home, she felt intimidated by the prospect of making repairs and selling, especially with the health risks posed by COVID-19. Her son, an avid user of Zillow suggested she call us. She accepted the Zillow Offers, used the Premier Agent to help her shop, then financed and closed using Zillow services. Now, she at the townhouse and convenient walkable neighborhood, having integrated Zillow experience made them move convenient. They were all part of the same team she said, I didn\u2019t have to remember to remind someone did you let so-and-so know everybody knew. We dropped the link to a short video of Terry\u2019s firsthand story in the shareholder letter. It\u2019s not nearly as alluring as the SNL bit, but it\u2019s really a fantastic encapsulation of where we are headed. Testimonials like Terry\u2019s are what get us so excited about the opportunity in front of us. So, long as we are able to deliver delightful customer experiences, it\u2019s a win for everyone involved. Terry sold her previous home, is living in our new home. Our Premier Agent partner completed a successful transaction and we participated in economics across our multiple services without spending incrementally to find Terry as a customer for the additional services. Our low customer acquisition cost advantage is integral to our Zillow 2.0 strategy. For example, this year, many customers in Zillow Offers markets will see that there\u2019s estimate is alive initial offer from Zillow Offers. This will begin to realize the big hairy audacious goal we set 15 years ago when we launched the Zillow of putting an actual price on every rooftop. As this estimate begins to move from fantasy to reality, we are one small, but important step closer to delivering on that Beehag. Marketplaces are healthier and more liquid with transparency. Lastly, as I zoom out, and think about opportunity. We are in a unique position to build an iconic company and brand that transforms one of the country\u2019s largest most complex and most important industries. Our large audience, the breadth of our services across real estate transactions, our profit streams and profit potential, our strong balance sheet, our experienced leadership team and our long-term orientation, all combined to put us in pole position. The advantages we\u2019ve worked hard to build over the last 15 years will help drive us forward for the next 15. Our talented team here is making it happen. But I also want to thank you our investors, who have given us the space and support to move to the next exciting chapter in the story of Zillow. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Allen. You\u2019re on mute, Allen.\nAllen Parker: All right. Thank you, Rich. As rich discussed, Zillow Group delivered another strong quarter, which drove record full-year 2020 revenue and EBITDA on a consolidated basis. We reported Q4 consolidated revenue of $789 million and EBITDA of $170 million, both exceeding the high end of our outlook range. Our Q4 results contributed to the strong 2020 annual results with consolidated revenue growing 22% and EBITDA of $343 million expanding from $39 million in 2019. Q4 IMT segment revenue of $424 million grew 33% year-over-year, as we continue to see accelerated growth across most of our IMT marketplaces. IMT segment EBITDA was $203 million in Q4 or a 48% of IMT segment revenue. Strong revenue growth combined with year-over-year declines in operating costs translated into 132% year-over-year EBITDA growth in Q4. Premier Agent revenue grew 35% year-over-year in Q4, driven by record Q4 customer satisfaction rates and record Q4 connections of higher intent customers to a growing number of high performing partners with continued strong agent retention rates. Excluding the impact of revenue timing changes we discussed in prior earnings calls, the Premier Agent revenue growth rate would have been 27% year-over-year in Q4, accelerating from 20% in Q3. During Q4, Zillow Offers benefited from operational improvements, stronger than expected home price appreciation across the country, a strong customer value proposition and faster sales philosophy. Homes segment revenue of $304 million exceeded the high end of our outlook with home purchases returning to Q4 2019 levels. Our Q4 Zillow Offers unit economics of 668 basis points before interest was above the plus or minus 200 basis point guardrails we set for ourselves while working to scale the business. The outsized unit economic results were impacted by the stronger and faster housing market recovery than we initially assumed in addition to the expected benefit of predominantly high mix of recently acquired homes following the first-half air gap. Q4 unit economics also showed meaningful operational progress in improving our cost per home sold. Combined, we saw all three operational cost line items improved nearly 250 basis points compared to Q3. We are continuing to target our underwriting goal of plus or minus 200 basis points going forward. Our Mortgages segment revenue increased 190% year-over-year in Q4 to $61 million, and Mortgages segment EBITDA was $14 million compared to the midpoint of our prior outlook of $2 million. The revenue and EBITDA outperformance was primarily volume driven with mortgage origination revenue growing nearly seven times year-over-year, and gain on sale \u2013 gain on sale margin staying stronger for longer than we assumed. Turning to our outlook. For the first quarter, at a consolidated level, we expect revenue to be $1.1 billion at the midpoint of our outlook and EBITDA to be between $114 million and $138 million. In our IMT segment, we are forecasting 27% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 at the midpoint of our outlook range. Within the IMT segment, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be between $314 million to $322 million, up 31% year-over-year at the midpoint of our outlook, given by strong top-of-funnel traffic and connections as we enter Q1. We expect Q1 IMT EBITDA margin to be 42% at the midpoint of our outlook. Q1 is also expected to benefit from the timing of certain seasonal advertising and marketing programs that are targeted to launch later this year. While we believe it remains prudent to continue to provide quarterly guidance, I would like to repeat what I said last quarter. We are focused on growing EBITDA dollars compared to the full-year 2020 levels. We do not expect to expand EBITDA margins from the high levels in the second-half of 2020, which benefited from cost controls, put in place during the uncertainty of the pandemic. However, we will continue to drive operational rigor across the business to deliver operating leverage over time while focusing \u2013 while also focusing on investing to drive sustainable growth. In Q1, we expect our Homes segment revenue to increase sequentially to $608 million at the midpoint of our outlook as we ramp up purchase and resell activity levels that are being driven by strong demand and our customer value proposition. We remain focused on applying learnings and operational rigor to drive growth. We expect our Mortgages segment revenue to be between $59 million to $64 million in Q1. We plan to continue to capture the strong refinance demand to invest in building the factory to scale our operations as the purchase business is built out over time. As a result, we expect Mortgages segment EBITDA to be between a loss of $3 million and a profit of $1 million. We are also excited about the future addition of ShowingTime\u2019s industry-leading technology to our suite of solutions to help innovate and simplify online tour scheduling for agents, buyers, and sellers. The outlook we provided today does not include any potential benefit from ShowingTime. We believe ShowingTime will deliver significant benefits to the industry, our customers, our partners, and Zillow overtime. We expect the impact on financial results to be relatively small in the near term. We ended the quarter with $3.9 billion in cash and investments, which puts us in a strong position to fund our vision for Zillow and make strategic long-term investments both organically and inorganically. As we look forward in the New Year, our priorities are focused on execution of our vision to help our customers unlock life\u2019s next chapter now that we have the core pieces in place. Moving past the necessities of 2020, the following 2021 priorities are focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners. We will grow our customer base and engagement through a compelling dream and shop experience. We will invest in sustainable top-line growth opportunities across the company. We will reduce cost structure and improve productivity and transaction services, and we\u2019ll drive profit growth through operational discipline. And with that, operator, we\u2019ll open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thank you so much. Rich, obviously, just really kind of curious in terms of how you think about sustainability in terms of the growth and margin expansion that you\u2019re seeing here, I mean, 600 basis points obviously puts you in areas that you haven\u2019t really seen in a while. Just really kind of interested now you and Allen and the team are thinking about the macroenvironment\u2019s contribution to this and how important that\u2019s going to be going forward, as well as the traction that you\u2019re getting with Premier Agent and just how much you can continue that from here?\nRich Barton: Hey, Heath. Hey, I look forward to being on your Goldman Zoom stage tomorrow.\nHeath Terry: We look forward to having you.\nRich Barton: It shouldn\u2019t \u2013 no travel required, Zoom Magic. I know Allen, you just did a whole bunch of talking, but maybe, you want to start out this answer. And I know\u2026\nAllen Parker: Yes. Why don\u2019t I start with PA growth and how we\u2019re thinking about it and IMT margins, and then I\u2019ll let you handle the more macro housing if that works. Thanks for the question. So, listen, in Premier Agent, we continue to focus on the customer and the input would yield a great result for both the customer and our partner agents. So, we\u2019re optimizing to connect high-intent customers with high-performing agents. And the output we\u2019re seeing is higher CSAT, higher connections volume, where we\u2019re linking high-intent customers with great partners, strong retention, and the business results that we see reflected in our Q4 results and our Q1 outlook. On an apples-to-apples basis, we\u2019ve seen accelerating sequential growth of 20% in Q3 to 27% in Q4, and now 31% at the midpoint of Q1 outlook. We like where we are, we feel it\u2019s still early days and we\u2019re not going to hesitate to invest the long-term growth in areas such as technology and marketing, but we feel really good about the current situation and the position we have with respect to PA. With respect to the margins, I\u2019ll just cover that real quickly. Our outlook implies a 42% margin at the midpoint, that\u2019s down from the second-half margins we saw in the second-half of 2020. Our Q1 guidance, I discussed, includes the benefit from the timing of certain investments that are going to occur later in 2021 as compared to prior years, but our focus is on profitable growth. So near-term, we do not expect margin expansion off the higher second-half 2020 levels. And again, those have benefited from some of the cost controls we put in place based on the uncertainty of the pandemic, but rather we expect EBITDA dollar growth of the full-year of 2020 levels. And again, we\u2019re very pleased with how the team is executing and we like where we are. Rich, I don\u2019t know if you want to cover more macro.\nRich Barton: Sure. Yes. Thank you for covering the hard stuff that has real numbers and comments in it, and leaving the hand-wavy stuff to me, Allen. Yes, I mean, on the housing market and sustainability Heath, I mean, there\u2019s certainly a lot we could talk about and say. But I guess, the first thing I\u2019d say is the big thing that\u2019s happening, that\u2019s driving our business and will do so in the long-term is not the cyclicality in the housing market itself, all right? It is the bigger trend, which is movement of all things offline to online. And real estate, while many thought, it might be an exception 20 years ago to the fundamental e-commerce rule clearly is not. And we are \u2013 customers are moving online, which is fantastic. And we as the leaders are the outsized beneficiary of that. I mean, we\u2019ve been there the longest time with the biggest brand. And so that\u2019s the biggest thing facing us. And one other thing, I guess, is that we have all this kind of potential energy and the top of funnel with all this shopping traffic we have that is not being monetized today. And so we\u2019ve got a lot of growth to happen just in increasing conversion and engagement within our phone. Okay. Now going down into the actual dynamics of the housing market. right now, we have \u2013 certainly have a lot to say. our Econ team has published a pretty aggressive forecast for 2021. But we \u2013 as I said, we don\u2019t have a crystal ball, obviously, that doesn\u2019t stop \u2013 hasn\u2019t stopped me in the past from prognosticating. So, let me take a \u2013 let me look at a few topics here. One, let\u2019s talk about the tailwinds. I guess the second is inventory velocity. And then the third is kind of pent-up listings demand. On the tailwinds one, there is the technology tailwind that I\u2019ve already talked about. This is the offline/online shift, and that is a big one. and that\u2019s just \u2013 that\u2019s blowing and that\u2019s sped up during COVID, but it\u2019s not going to stop blowing. We\u2019ve got a long way to go. The real estate tailwind that\u2019s kind of been catalyzed mainly by the pandemic, freeing people from their commutes and freeing them to move and rethink their homes, that\u2019s a real one. And I believe that that\u2019s going to play out over a long period of time, too. It takes a long time for people to decide to move, and it takes a long time for companies though they are catching up. It\u2019s going to take a long time for companies to grapple with the fact that in order to compete for the best talent, they have to give that talent flexibility. So, this is going to happen. I think this is going to play out over a long period of time, too. That\u2019s that kind of great reshuffling point. there\u2019s some really interesting demographic things that are setting up to drive sustainable growth as well around millennials buying \u2013 having babies and buying homes right now and low mortgage rates for the foreseeable future. We don\u2019t have a crystal ball there, but it\u2019s setting up pretty well. All of those things make us our econ team, but also me believe that this is a pretty durable macro growth set up for the housing industry. A quick note to talk about, I mean, I did it in my prepared remarks, but this inventory volume velocity point is a pretty important one. I think a lot \u2013 I find myself explaining to a lot of people at the company and outside the company, who read shocking headlines about galactically historically low inventory and they think it\u2019s over for the housing market. It\u2019s going to freeze. It\u2019s going to stop. We\u2019re not going to have any inventory. That, of course, only makes sense if you don\u2019t look at how quickly things are selling, right? So, having homes sit on the market for 25 fewer days than they did a year ago in December 17 days total is fairly shocking. That is the headline for this market right now is velocity. And so I have no doubt that Econ 101 comes into play with supply and demand. And as home prices appreciate as home prices rise, of course, more supply is going to come into the market. That\u2019s just the way markets work. I\u2019m highly confident in that one. I also think from a pent-up listings perspective, I think that we\u2019ve seen 15 years of people wanting to move and not moving since the global financial crisis for various reasons. I also believe there may be a little kind of COVID-related anxiety to list your house right now. That as we get post-vax, we may see some of that loosen up as well, but those are more minor. I\u2019m really sorry for taking up so much airtime, everybody, but it\u2019s important stuff.\nHeath Terry: No, thanks for that, Rich. Thanks, Allen. Really appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks, guys. I have two. first, just, can you talk about some of the drivers for the unit economics improvements in the homes segment? How much of that is the home price appreciation versus efficiency gains versus the benefit of the newer cohort and give us a sense for how we should think about this going forward, given just the magnitude of the improvement we saw. And then secondly, can you give us the update on some of your tests around partner leads, what you\u2019re seeing there and how much you think you may be scaling that this year versus continuing to be in experimental mode? Anything you can share there would be great.\nAllen Parker: Great. Thanks, Lloyd. All right. So, why don\u2019t I start with unit economics, as we reported Q4 unit economics were \u2013 approximately 670 basis points of profit for home before interest as compared to Q3 results that were a loss of 90 basis points, so that\u2019s an improvement at 760 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Swaying was not unexpected as Q3 reflected the impact of us selling off the tail of the pre-pandemic inventory, as opposed to Q4 reflecting the benefit of early sales of post-pause purchase cohorts. But there are two other factors that I\u2019d like to call out. And Rich has touched on some of those. So, the HPA trends and sales velocity performed a lot stronger than our underwriting assumptions and contributed to a pretty significant portion of the 500 basis points improvement that you see in our acquisition costs, where our acquisition costs as a percentage of the average sale price went from 91.1% to 85.9%. So that\u2019s mixed, but a lot of that is the macro trends. The other \u2013 the other three cost lines; renovations, holding costs and selling costs, which improved 250 basis points over Q3 include in these improvements, some real operational improvements that are durable. We\u2019re constantly learning and improving over time, which results in continual improvements in our customer value \u2013 proposition value of our offers. So, that\u2019s we\u2019re glad to be back up and running. And as we learn, we\u2019re able to provide more value proposition to our customers. We do expect some of the pricing spread to be temporal over time, but we will continue. We still see continue to see opportunities for improvement across all four of the cost components. I expect this metrics going to continue to be a little bumpy as we continue to come out of the air gap and the post-pause. but the direction I\u2019ll give is we\u2019re still maintaining the plus or minus 200 basis point guardrails. And we\u2019re going to continue to have those as guardrails as we grow and scale. And as we continue to learn, we\u2019ll be able to provide real cost improvements that will benefit our ability to provide value in our customer offers. I hope that helps. And then with the second question, I guess, I\u2019ll move to it on some of the bundled services, we\u2019re in early stages building out a suite of services, but we like the initial results we\u2019re seeing. We feel like we built out the core pieces and are moving deeper into the transaction. We\u2019ve expanded Zillow Closing Services to 25 markets during 2020 and as we called out, the vast majority of our customers are now choosing to use our Closing Services when they buy a home through Zillow Offers. But we\u2019re not just thinking about Zillow Closing Services. There\u2019s some programs that we\u2019ve begun to run across the country, still early stages. And when customers are exposed to our suite of services, there is a meaningful uptick in demand and there\u2019s increased value per transaction. This is not a surprise to us at still early stages, but we feel strongly that our thesis of Zillow 2.0 is correct. And I\u2019ll close with just saying, as we see this increased evidence that providing a seamless, integrated real estate experience to our customers is welcomed, we can use that, we can use our low cost of customer acquisition to compete, I guess, an industry that\u2019s still largely single point solution providers that have higher CAC.\nLloyd Walmsley: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nRich Barton: And again, like, there\u2019s an end of one on your \u2013 on that question that I think the video is two minutes. I do encourage you to click on that from the shareholder letter of that, that Terry Lee testimonial. Anyway, that\u2019s just \u2013 it kind of brings it to life.\nLloyd Walmsley: Cool. We\u2019ll check it out. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the call. And I guess, we answered a lot about 2.0, but maybe just a little bit more, Rich, just talking about all the different services that our offers out there between Offers, Premier Agent, Home Loans, Closing Services. Just can you talk about what we might expect for Offers going to more geographies or more locations? Same thing for Closing Services, do we expect that all 50 states as 2.0 becomes a reality? And then I\u2019d also love to understand a little bit more around just the progress in Flex as the Premier Agent business continues to just do so well. Thank you.\nRich Barton: Hey, Ron. Sorry, I was on mute. Well, a lot of the \u2013 Lloyd got in the big question and Allen got in the answer on a lot of the kind of that energy and evidence we\u2019re seeing around the beginnings around bundled, seamless transaction, being what customers want. So we get it, of course, it\u2019s our strong intuition. It makes a ton of sense. And now the world is going to one-click, why not real estate, like that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed. And so the fact that we have invested big in every one of these ancillary services, and now we can begin to stitch them together in a way that a lot of the folks that just provide point solutions can\u2019t or will struggle with is like a this is a big strategic bet we\u2019re making. It has the added benefit of having terrific kind of ecosystem economics from a customer acquisition cost perspective as well. So we\u2019re really running hard at that. On the Zillow Offers stuff, it\u2019s still really, really small. It\u2019s just beginning to look big, but it\u2019s still really, really small. We\u2019re way less than 1% of the market right now with this. But in Zillow Offers is the seeds of the future of a streamlined transaction, which is why you\u2019re seeing us do so much innovating and integrating and testing on that product right now. And that is spilling over into bringing a much more accountable transaction, partner quality, integrated mindset to our Premier Agent and IMT businesses as well. That is what led to Flex to your question, okay? And we really love the way Flex has lined up to be a win-win-win by focusing our compensation on customer success, which is getting into a new home, right? So we\u2019ve seen really good traction there and that\u2019s brought a whole new kind of quality assurance, transaction responsibility, responsibility for the customer itself. It\u2019s brought that mindset to that business and you can see it in the numbers, look what\u2019s happening and look at our guidance for next quarter. It\u2019s really coming together nicely.\nRon Josey: That\u2019s great. And maybe just one follow-up on offers. Any thoughts on buy box as its appreciation continues to go up on homes. Thanks again.\nRich Barton: Allen, you want to \u2013 Allen\u2019s on mute.\nAllen Parker: All right. Thanks, Ron. Yes, I guess what I\u2019d say is, we continue as we came out of the pause, we had a relatively conservative buy boxes. We brought our processes back. We continue to assess where we can add value to customers and at what ranges. So I think it\u2019s going to vary by market. And we\u2019ll continue to, as I said, iterate learn and adjust as appropriate. So we\u2019re excited about the acquisition pace that we have been able to achieve in Q4 and the momentum that we\u2019re bringing into 2021. Buy box is just one of those ways, but we continue to look at where we can provide value for our customers.\nRon Josey: Thanks, Allen. Thank you, Rich.\nRich Barton: Yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ryan McKeveny with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.\nRyan McKeveny: Hi, Rich and Allen. Congratulations on the great results. And Rich, I really enjoyed the commentary you gave around the inventory versus velocity and new listings and very much in agreement with you there and that\u2019ll tie into the second part of my question. So two-parter coming up. First question on iBuying, I guess there\u2019s some debate around whether just the overall strength and competitiveness of the housing market today is a headwind against the concept of iBuying just given kind of how quickly homes are able to be sold traditionally. And I think your results speak for themselves in terms of the purchase activity in the quarter, the rise in inventory. So clearly there\u2019s still plenty of interest from sellers. But I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re seeing any different consumer behavior, any difference in the demographic around those who are actually choosing the iBuyer offer today versus kind of pre-pandemic. And second piece of the question to the extent that sellers are preferring to list traditionally rather than take that iBuyer offer. Are you able to \u2013 kind of back to the comment around just the listing side of things, pent-up listings, are you able to look at that as a gauge of just overall pent-up listing demand and kind of perspective sellers coming to the market? And last point, sorry, maybe it\u2019s a three-pointer. Curious if you can just give an update on how you\u2019re doing around monetizing the seller leads or the partner leads that might be coming from those there, excuse me, declining the initial iBuyer bid. Thank you.\nRich Barton: Okay. That\u2019s testing my note-taking ability, Ryan. Thanks. The team has been working on analogies to get people to focus on this time on market and velocity concept. So they\u2019re going to love to hear that you appreciated those analogies and I know you guys write a lot about this, so steal away. So maybe I\u2019ll start Allen with the first question, which I\u2019ll basically restate as is ZO still attractive in such a hot market. Well, it\u2019s working. Look, our acquisitions were up year-over-year in Q4 for the first time since COVID started. So I mean, the answer to your question is unknowable. I\u2019m sure there are a bunch of puts and takes. Clearly, this is such a head slapping really obvious, better, easier, more convenient way to do things than the old way that I don\u2019t think the interest in the product is going to change a whole lot based on the hot or cold markets, I really don\u2019t, but it\u2019s unknowable. And then there may be some COVID-related hesitancy that makes ZO more attractive right now. But honestly we don\u2019t really know, but we\u2019re looking at the trends. We\u2019re looking at how we\u2019ve reopened these markets. We are excited by those line items on the cost side that Allen ticked through, showing some leverage so that we can offer even better pricing to sellers and thus increase the size of the market. So we like what we\u2019re seeing there. On your second question, I guess the thing I\u2019d point to as the best gauge to pent-up demand to sell or pent-up demand to move, I guess they\u2019re sort of one and the same, is engagement. I mean, what was the sparkler I threw out there? 9.6 billion visits we had in 2020, up 1.5 billion. I think was like 19% up year-over-year. That to me, I don\u2019t have a lot of more anecdotal or survey based stuff to give you color, but I don\u2019t think we really need it. We can look at the ferocity with which people are attacking their home, searching and dreaming and be pretty comfortable that we\u2019ve got ways to \u2013 we\u2019ve got some pent-up demand. On your third question, I just re-point to Allen\u2019s answer from one or two questions ago and say we\u2019re really excited by the early signals that we\u2019re seeing in an integrated bundled offering. It\u2019s just makes so much sense and we\u2019re seeing all kinds of early evidence too. That\u2019s kind of confirmatory to our somewhat audacious strategic bet that we\u2019re making here on integration.\nRyan McKeveny: Thanks, very helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nYgal Arounian: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess I have a couple of follow-ups from the questions that have been asked. But first on the last one, a hot market and how iBuying or Zillow Offers fits into that. It sounds like you haven\u2019t necessarily done anything with the fee that you ask on that. How do you think about moving \u2013 have you lowered it at all to drum-up some of the demand, or has it been there kind of naturally with kind of average fee that you\u2019ve been asking for historically there? And then on the kind of \u2013 on the end-to-end bundled service, I was listening to some of the executives from the traditional brokerages and players in the space at a conference a few weeks ago. And so maybe I\u2019ll ask it from the opposite point of view, they all kind of continue to view the world as being a platform that\u2019s giving options versus having everything in-house and having your own mortgage broker and selling your own products, but actually giving the consumer choice and you believing that the consumer wants choice across the way. Obviously, that\u2019s not your stance. And we\u2019d love to hear why you think that\u2019s not the right stance that giving people choice.\nRich Barton: Okay. Allen, you maybe want to take the first bit on the fee, and I\u2019ll try to address the no-choice question.\nAllen Parker: Sure, sure. Thanks for the question. This is Allen. Yes. I think, I just would point out in responding to that, that fee is just one of the components of the offer that we make to a customer, who\u2019s interested in possibly selling through Zillow Offers, selling to us. And the fee is dynamic. And so when I talk about our unit economics and the pricing spread, being a little more temporal and our guardrails being plus or minus 200. we\u2019re constantly adjusting dynamically all of the elements of the offer, and we\u2019re testing how we communicate those elements of the offer to any customer, who are to any potential seller. So, it\u2019s transparent and clear on what it costs and, Rich even calls out the dynamic estimate as an offer, eventually are starting. But so what I would say is that our business model and the way our model works with respect to the seller is extremely dynamic and takes into account these macro conditions. What did occur in Q4 somewhat was that the market out ran some of our initial assumptions and we\u2019re catching up. So, we\u2019re constantly learning that\u2019s we have a feedback loop as we have each one of these data points. And so I would expect that offer to be competitive, but constantly, informed by all of the factors that are out there with respect to velocity, HPA and so on and so forth. If that helps and then Rich, did you want to talk on as delivering the customer choice?\nRich Barton: Yes. I mean, it\u2019s a fun one. But I\u2019ve been sitting here trying to think how I would answer, what customers want \u2013 customers want convenience. It\u2019s pretty \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty bad bet to bet against convenience, speed, price, integration in any business. Okay? And especially, customers want simplicity in one click when it\u2019s something they don\u2019t care a ton about. They just need to get done. I\u2019ll use Amazon to buy most \u2013 everything, but there are a few things that I really care about that I know I need to go to a specialty e-commerce retailer to go find, because they\u2019re my particular areas of interest, I\u2019m deciding not to say what those are, because I don\u2019t want to be judged. But by and large, having it all behind one click and with Prime Delivery on Amazon works really well, and that same kind of idea certainly holds true, we think, in real estate. What people want us to do is get into their new house, everything else is an obstacle. Okay? Everything else is an obstacle. And I\u2019m not saying we need to bundle, so that we can somehow take advantage of them on pricing of the spot things that\u2019s not what we want to do. We want to bring price down as much as we possibly can. But the prime thing we want to do is integrate this, make it super easy and convenient and maybe, joyful at some point. So that people can just get to their better place. Anyway, that\u2019s from all the years that we\u2019ve spent with building consumer products, this feels intuitively correct. There will absolutely be the specialty point solutions for all kinds of stuff that people care about and want to shop for, and certain kinds of professionals that have specific expertise that people seek out. There\u2019s no question that\u2019s going to happen. Our bet is that for the middle of the bell curve of the market, integration is really important.\nYgal Arounian: Thanks. And if I can just ask one quick follow-up on, I guess, both of those points tied together and bringing the kind of in-house brokerage on Zillow Offers, anything you\u2019re learning there, that\u2019s helping drive the flywheel versus just saving costs, and thanks for the time.\nRich Barton: Tom, we\u2019re \u2013 with Zillow Offers and now, the brokerage that\u2019s associated with Zillow Offers, we\u2019re finally actually in the end user customer satisfaction customer service business. We used to be in the kind of media customer traffic business and not in the customer service business. And so that\u2019s \u2013 I talked about it a little more on previously on the call, the spillover effect from having an owned and operated operation, where we\u2019re actually buying and selling homes and we\u2019re actually closing these transactions. the spillover goodness to the core business is difficult to quantify how important it is and we see it\u2019ll drive a ton of opportunity in the core business on a go-forward basis. And as I said on the call, these businesses, ZO and PA are getting a lot closer together, because that\u2019s happening, because of all this learning, And because we\u2019re seeing common solutions that we\u2019re building for ZO to be applicable to the whole in the industry as a whole, just like with the ShowingTime acquisition today. That\u2019s one of those things that we see. And as they come closer together, they\u2019re actually opening up even larger swaps of kind of unknown grass, just like bigger chunks of opportunity that we see given all this traffic and engagement we have. So, we\u2019re excited.\nYgal Arounian: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line Tom Champion with Piper. Please go ahead.\nTom Champion: Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. Okay. so, your economists are saying 20% transactions growth this year, curious your sense of whether we\u2019ll return to kind of more normal seasonality with kick selling being in the summer months. And whether that line of thinking should be incorporated into our estimates, just as you gave us the 1Q guide, but as we think through the balance of the year, would be curious your thoughts on that. And then 35% PA growth that\u2019s really strong. What do you see as the pain points in that business today? What are kind of the product opportunities for PA going forward? And I think you said this Allen that maybe, an 8% boost from Flex in that business, if you could just confirm that. Thanks, guys.\nAllen Parker: So Rich, do you want me to kick through the PA real quick and then you can talk about the other projections that we are providing quarterly.\nRich Barton: Yes.\nAllen Parker: Thanks, Tom. Yes. So, with respect to Flex, when you think about the 35% Q4, if you exclude the impact of some of the revenue timing changes that we\u2019ve discussed in prior quarters, and they come on both sides, about 200 basis points of growth in Q4 came from leads that we delivered prior to Q3. So that\u2019s roughly 200 basis points of growth in Q4, and then the remaining amount to get you to the 27% growth apples-to-apples, came from the fact that we had a comp against 2019, where we did a flip to the entire Flex region for Phoenix and Atlanta. So, that is the 800 basis point that you were calling out. With respect to pain points and so I mean, I believe that team has been operating, really well on the inputs. Our goal is to obviously, leverage our traffic and to bring high intent customers together with agents. And some of those pain points is how do you get them connected? I think our connections investment that we\u2019ve made in the last two years, well, a little hockey to start has yielded a lot of benefits. I believe things like the ShowingTime investment and schedule a tour is another example of areas, where there\u2019s still friction of getting customers \u2013 high intent customers and agents together. So, I believe some of this, online \u2013 offline to online and leveraging tools that we have and can build, is going to reduce a lot of those friction points. So again, that\u2019s part of the excitement we have on helping the customer and benefiting not just the customer, but the partner agents, as well as Zillow as we link these get a customer into the house they want. So Rich, I don\u2019t know if you want to talk anything about seasonality.\nRich Barton: Yes. I mean, look, I\u2019m not going to be able to give you a better view Tom, than Dr. Svenja runs our econ team. I\u2019ve obviously looked at the forecast and looked at the drivers, and it\u2019s all right there on the econ website for you to dig into as well and be critical of, or agree with or not. I would say though that my kind of cheap seats for armchair economists\u2019 perspective is that these are title, these are tectonic shifts that are driving the market. And as I said, in my long-winded answer, I think they\u2019re going to play out over quite some time. And I think they\u2019ll probably swamp what we would consider normal seasonality in the industry this year. That\u2019s our best guess, a lot of the tail off for other forecasts has to do with kind of misery \u2013 some of the misery stuff, Brad, stop me if you want to muzzle me. But I would say that it\u2019s a sad thing to say, but even misery drives reshuffling and moving as well. And so I think we\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019re setting up pretty \u2013 in a pretty kind of volume bullish way across the whole of the industry for at least this year is my best guess. Is that okay, Brad?\nBrad Berning: Yes, you\u2019re good. I\u2019m already dropped.\nRich Barton: Okay. All right. Okay. I guess, thank you. Thanks, everybody today. That\u2019ll be it for this quarter 2020. we won\u2019t soon forget it. But it was a rollercoaster and \u2013 but it was a year of immense progress for our organization, both culturally, but really as we kind of ditch together on behalf of consumers a new and better way to buy and sell a home to move. Anyway, talk to everybody soon.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rich Barton",
            "content": "You're on mute, Rich. That's now in the dictionary. Sorry about that. Thanks, Brad. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining our first call of the New Year. February marks a big milestone for Zillow, our 15-year anniversary. We were motivated at the beginning by the same dream that motivates us now, reinventing a disjointed and friction-filled process to make it easier for people to move. While we have made tremendous progress and our position is strong, we are in many ways just getting started. A year ago on this same call, I deemed 2019 a tumultuously remarkable year. In hindsight, I clearly had no idea what tumultuous meant. There'll be plenty of studies on COVID's impact on society, business, politics and real estate in the years ahead. But today, I'll focus on Zillow's impressive results in 2020 and some of our key accomplishments. First and foremost, we saw engagement across our mobile apps and websites in 2020 at levels we would not previously have thought possible. Zillow surfing has broken through to a whole new level of pop culture given that Saturday Night Live did a funny and racy sketch about it this past weekend with guest host Dan Levy in the lead. Fantasizing about real estate is not new. Our survey results and traffic has always indicated that people love looking at real estate and want to move. What has changed is that more of those people now have the freedom to move. Many Americans untethered from their commutes and offices have begun to reevaluate how and where they want to live. This cultural trend, which we have been calling the great reshuffling, along with our continued technology improvements, resulted in 9.6 billion visits to our mobile apps and websites over the course of 2020. That is 1.5 billion more visits than in 2019. We took advantage of this rush of top of funnel engagement and executed well across Zillow's suite of products and services. We accelerated the growth of our flagship buy-side business, Zillow Premier Agent, partnering with real estate agents across the country to produce the strongest results we've ever seen, reporting a 35% revenue growth year-over-year in Q4. Our burgeoning sell-side business, Zillow Offers, proved durable through some bad weather. We paused home buying to manage risk during the early days of the pandemic, but exited 2020 with our quarterly acquisitions pace returning to Q4 2019 levels. We augmented these buy and sell-side businesses with excellent execution in our adjacent services. Our financing arm, Zillow Home Loans, nearly tripled its originations revenue in 2020 compared to 2019. We expanded Zillow Closing Services to 25 markets in less than 12 months, and a vast majority of our customers are now choosing to close with us when purchasing a home from Zillow Offers. This execution resulted in total revenue growth of 22%, which when combined with a disciplined approach to managing costs, resulted in more than $300 million in incremental EBITDA profit generation across the company as compared to 2019. Our team drove these business results in 2020, while quickly adjusting to a new way of working with 90% of our workforce doing their jobs remotely. While many companies across the country are evaluating their go-forward policies about remote work, Zillow is onto the next play as legendary Duke basketball coach, Mike Krzyzewski likes to say. Having internalized, we are already successfully operating as a cloud headquartered company. This location flexible work model has a myriad of benefits. Our employees, like so many others across the country who are participating in the great reshuffling, now have the flexibility to wrap their work around their lives rather than vice versa. And it allows us to recruit from almost anywhere and increase diversity in our workforce. We believe this will be a significant competitive advantage as we grow and it is already yielding exciting results. Of course, there are challenges to not being in the office together, but that is temporal. In a post-COVID world, our workplace design goal is to maximize flexibility for our high demand talent. We will have awesome offices for those who want or need to come in. At the same time, we must ensure a level playing field for all team members, regardless of their physical location. There cannot be a two-class system, those in the room being first class and those on the phone being second class. We are entering the most interesting and innovative period for workplace design in our lifetimes, and our people and facilities teams at Zillow are out in front. To wrap this year in review, I must say how proud I am of what our whole team has accomplished on the scariest of rollercoaster rides that was 2020. And I would like to thank them here for their commitment and resilience. As we look ahead, I'll start with the housing market. Our Zillow economists have made bold predictions for an even stronger housing market this year. They're projecting a near record of 6.8 million home sales for 21% growth, plus double-digit home price appreciation. We, of course, do not have a crystal ball, and our mission does not depend on the cyclical vagaries of the housing market due to the mega shift from offline to online. But we believe that residential real estate will continue its risk trajectory. The millennial generation is entering prime home buying years and mortgage rates are historically low. On top of those macro factors, the past year has members of all generations rethinking, where they live with a new lens of flexibility and possibility as the great reshuffling continues to take hold. Some of you are concerned about low inventory persisting, despite historically low inventory, 2020 closed with 5.6 million existing home sales, the highest level since 2006. Low inventory and high volume of sales seem at odds until you consider how quickly homes are selling. Average time on market was 17 days in December, a full 25 fewer days than in December of 2019. In addition to being a hot market, agents and customers adopted technology and tools for safety, convenience, and simply to compete, and higher prices pull more inventory onto the market, of course. So, like a warehouse using lean operations to transition to just-in-time inventory management, the housing market became more streamlined. Current home inventory levels therefore can be addressed with something like the safety refrain from a flight attendant. The oxygen will flow even if the bag does not appear to be to fully inflate. Amid what we believe will be a very healthy housing market backdrop, we expect 2021 will be a pivotal year for Zillow. I've spent some breadth here in the past two years, talking about our transition from Zillow 1.0, a media-focused business, into Zillow 2.0, a transaction-focused business. Today, I believe that we have the pieces in place, the vision, the team, the technology solutions and customer products and services to execute on Zillow 2.0 now. We will undoubtedly keep innovating and adding products and services on the long road to customer one-click trade in Nirvana, but our entire company is now relentlessly focused on transactions and ready to scale from here. To do that, we are investing aggressively in technologies and services that make it easier for our customers to make that transition. As part of our quest to make our customers' experiences better today, we announced our intent to acquire ShowingTime, an industry-leading real estate showing software provider that facilitated over 50 million in-person home tours in 2020 for $500 million. ShowingTime technology already expands into the broader real estate industry and we intend to grow its adoption across the industry moving forward to the benefit of all industry participants and customers. The additional ShowingTime to our suite of real estate technology solutions allows us to accelerate a widely-adopted solution for scheduling home tours. We see this as similar to the work we did to build our connections platform a few years ago and wider acceptance of this technology has the added benefit of improving the experience for the broader industry as well as for our Premier Agent partners as our platform grows. We envision a future experience that begins on our mobile app, where a customer can immerse herself in a home via our 3D home technology, looking in-person tour through ShowingTime with an agent, get pre-qualified through Zillow home loans, work with a Premier Agent to buy the home and close the transaction with Zillow Closing Services. We have spent the last year bringing out Zillow Offers, bringing our Zillow Offers and Premier Agent businesses closer together to orient around customer success and customer choice. While I know you all think of these businesses as distinct, our customers arrive at Zillow, simply trying to move. It is our job to deliver for them in any way that we can, be it through our own services or with our best-in-class partners. Our customers are hungry for the seamless experience that we can now provide. In programs we've begun to run across the country, we see evidence that a suite of Zillow services appeals to people. Take retired elementary school teacher, Terry Lee, after 44 years in her Atlanta home, she felt intimidated by the prospect of making repairs and selling, especially with the health risks posed by COVID-19. Her son, an avid user of Zillow suggested she call us. She accepted the Zillow Offers, used the Premier Agent to help her shop, then financed and closed using Zillow services. Now, she at the townhouse and convenient walkable neighborhood, having integrated Zillow experience made them move convenient. They were all part of the same team she said, I didn't have to remember to remind someone did you let so-and-so know everybody knew. We dropped the link to a short video of Terry's firsthand story in the shareholder letter. It's not nearly as alluring as the SNL bit, but it's really a fantastic encapsulation of where we are headed. Testimonials like Terry's are what get us so excited about the opportunity in front of us. So, long as we are able to deliver delightful customer experiences, it's a win for everyone involved. Terry sold her previous home, is living in our new home. Our Premier Agent partner completed a successful transaction and we participated in economics across our multiple services without spending incrementally to find Terry as a customer for the additional services. Our low customer acquisition cost advantage is integral to our Zillow 2.0 strategy. For example, this year, many customers in Zillow Offers markets will see that there's estimate is alive initial offer from Zillow Offers. This will begin to realize the big hairy audacious goal we set 15 years ago when we launched the Zillow of putting an actual price on every rooftop. As this estimate begins to move from fantasy to reality, we are one small, but important step closer to delivering on that Beehag. Marketplaces are healthier and more liquid with transparency. Lastly, as I zoom out, and think about opportunity. We are in a unique position to build an iconic company and brand that transforms one of the country's largest most complex and most important industries. Our large audience, the breadth of our services across real estate transactions, our profit streams and profit potential, our strong balance sheet, our experienced leadership team and our long-term orientation, all combined to put us in pole position. The advantages we've worked hard to build over the last 15 years will help drive us forward for the next 15. Our talented team here is making it happen. But I also want to thank you our investors, who have given us the space and support to move to the next exciting chapter in the story of Zillow. I'll now turn it over to Allen. You're on mute, Allen. Hey, Heath. Hey, I look forward to being on your Goldman Zoom stage tomorrow. It shouldn't \u2013 no travel required, Zoom Magic. I know Allen, you just did a whole bunch of talking, but maybe, you want to start out this answer. And I know... Sure. Yes. Thank you for covering the hard stuff that has real numbers and comments in it, and leaving the hand-wavy stuff to me, Allen. Yes, I mean, on the housing market and sustainability Heath, I mean, there's certainly a lot we could talk about and say. But I guess, the first thing I'd say is the big thing that's happening, that's driving our business and will do so in the long-term is not the cyclicality in the housing market itself, all right? It is the bigger trend, which is movement of all things offline to online. And real estate, while many thought, it might be an exception 20 years ago to the fundamental e-commerce rule clearly is not. And we are \u2013 customers are moving online, which is fantastic. And we as the leaders are the outsized beneficiary of that. I mean, we've been there the longest time with the biggest brand. And so that's the biggest thing facing us. And one other thing, I guess, is that we have all this kind of potential energy and the top of funnel with all this shopping traffic we have that is not being monetized today. And so we've got a lot of growth to happen just in increasing conversion and engagement within our phone. Okay. Now going down into the actual dynamics of the housing market. right now, we have \u2013 certainly have a lot to say. our Econ team has published a pretty aggressive forecast for 2021. But we \u2013 as I said, we don't have a crystal ball, obviously, that doesn't stop \u2013 hasn't stopped me in the past from prognosticating. So, let me take a \u2013 let me look at a few topics here. One, let's talk about the tailwinds. I guess the second is inventory velocity. And then the third is kind of pent-up listings demand. On the tailwinds one, there is the technology tailwind that I've already talked about. This is the offline/online shift, and that is a big one. and that's just \u2013 that's blowing and that's sped up during COVID, but it's not going to stop blowing. We've got a long way to go. The real estate tailwind that's kind of been catalyzed mainly by the pandemic, freeing people from their commutes and freeing them to move and rethink their homes, that's a real one. And I believe that that's going to play out over a long period of time, too. It takes a long time for people to decide to move, and it takes a long time for companies though they are catching up. It's going to take a long time for companies to grapple with the fact that in order to compete for the best talent, they have to give that talent flexibility. So, this is going to happen. I think this is going to play out over a long period of time, too. That's that kind of great reshuffling point. there's some really interesting demographic things that are setting up to drive sustainable growth as well around millennials buying \u2013 having babies and buying homes right now and low mortgage rates for the foreseeable future. We don't have a crystal ball there, but it's setting up pretty well. All of those things make us our econ team, but also me believe that this is a pretty durable macro growth set up for the housing industry. A quick note to talk about, I mean, I did it in my prepared remarks, but this inventory volume velocity point is a pretty important one. I think a lot \u2013 I find myself explaining to a lot of people at the company and outside the company, who read shocking headlines about galactically historically low inventory and they think it's over for the housing market. It's going to freeze. It's going to stop. We're not going to have any inventory. That, of course, only makes sense if you don't look at how quickly things are selling, right? So, having homes sit on the market for 25 fewer days than they did a year ago in December 17 days total is fairly shocking. That is the headline for this market right now is velocity. And so I have no doubt that Econ 101 comes into play with supply and demand. And as home prices appreciate as home prices rise, of course, more supply is going to come into the market. That's just the way markets work. I'm highly confident in that one. I also think from a pent-up listings perspective, I think that we've seen 15 years of people wanting to move and not moving since the global financial crisis for various reasons. I also believe there may be a little kind of COVID-related anxiety to list your house right now. That as we get post-vax, we may see some of that loosen up as well, but those are more minor. I'm really sorry for taking up so much airtime, everybody, but it's important stuff. And again, like, there's an end of one on your \u2013 on that question that I think the video is two minutes. I do encourage you to click on that from the shareholder letter of that, that Terry Lee testimonial. Anyway, that's just \u2013 it kind of brings it to life. Hey, Ron. Sorry, I was on mute. Well, a lot of the \u2013 Lloyd got in the big question and Allen got in the answer on a lot of the kind of that energy and evidence we're seeing around the beginnings around bundled, seamless transaction, being what customers want. So we get it, of course, it's our strong intuition. It makes a ton of sense. And now the world is going to one-click, why not real estate, like that's where we're headed. And so the fact that we have invested big in every one of these ancillary services, and now we can begin to stitch them together in a way that a lot of the folks that just provide point solutions can't or will struggle with is like a this is a big strategic bet we're making. It has the added benefit of having terrific kind of ecosystem economics from a customer acquisition cost perspective as well. So we're really running hard at that. On the Zillow Offers stuff, it's still really, really small. It's just beginning to look big, but it's still really, really small. We're way less than 1% of the market right now with this. But in Zillow Offers is the seeds of the future of a streamlined transaction, which is why you're seeing us do so much innovating and integrating and testing on that product right now. And that is spilling over into bringing a much more accountable transaction, partner quality, integrated mindset to our Premier Agent and IMT businesses as well. That is what led to Flex to your question, okay? And we really love the way Flex has lined up to be a win-win-win by focusing our compensation on customer success, which is getting into a new home, right? So we've seen really good traction there and that's brought a whole new kind of quality assurance, transaction responsibility, responsibility for the customer itself. It's brought that mindset to that business and you can see it in the numbers, look what's happening and look at our guidance for next quarter. It's really coming together nicely. Allen, you want to \u2013 Allen's on mute. Yes. Okay. That's testing my note-taking ability, Ryan. Thanks. The team has been working on analogies to get people to focus on this time on market and velocity concept. So they're going to love to hear that you appreciated those analogies and I know you guys write a lot about this, so steal away. So maybe I'll start Allen with the first question, which I'll basically restate as is ZO still attractive in such a hot market. Well, it's working. Look, our acquisitions were up year-over-year in Q4 for the first time since COVID started. So I mean, the answer to your question is unknowable. I'm sure there are a bunch of puts and takes. Clearly, this is such a head slapping really obvious, better, easier, more convenient way to do things than the old way that I don't think the interest in the product is going to change a whole lot based on the hot or cold markets, I really don't, but it's unknowable. And then there may be some COVID-related hesitancy that makes ZO more attractive right now. But honestly we don't really know, but we're looking at the trends. We're looking at how we've reopened these markets. We are excited by those line items on the cost side that Allen ticked through, showing some leverage so that we can offer even better pricing to sellers and thus increase the size of the market. So we like what we're seeing there. On your second question, I guess the thing I'd point to as the best gauge to pent-up demand to sell or pent-up demand to move, I guess they're sort of one and the same, is engagement. I mean, what was the sparkler I threw out there? 9.6 billion visits we had in 2020, up 1.5 billion. I think was like 19% up year-over-year. That to me, I don't have a lot of more anecdotal or survey based stuff to give you color, but I don't think we really need it. We can look at the ferocity with which people are attacking their home, searching and dreaming and be pretty comfortable that we've got ways to \u2013 we've got some pent-up demand. On your third question, I just re-point to Allen's answer from one or two questions ago and say we're really excited by the early signals that we're seeing in an integrated bundled offering. It's just makes so much sense and we're seeing all kinds of early evidence too. That's kind of confirmatory to our somewhat audacious strategic bet that we're making here on integration. Okay. Allen, you maybe want to take the first bit on the fee, and I'll try to address the no-choice question. Yes. I mean, it's a fun one. But I've been sitting here trying to think how I would answer, what customers want \u2013 customers want convenience. It's pretty \u2013 it's a pretty bad bet to bet against convenience, speed, price, integration in any business. Okay? And especially, customers want simplicity in one click when it's something they don't care a ton about. They just need to get done. I'll use Amazon to buy most \u2013 everything, but there are a few things that I really care about that I know I need to go to a specialty e-commerce retailer to go find, because they're my particular areas of interest, I'm deciding not to say what those are, because I don't want to be judged. But by and large, having it all behind one click and with Prime Delivery on Amazon works really well, and that same kind of idea certainly holds true, we think, in real estate. What people want us to do is get into their new house, everything else is an obstacle. Okay? Everything else is an obstacle. And I'm not saying we need to bundle, so that we can somehow take advantage of them on pricing of the spot things that's not what we want to do. We want to bring price down as much as we possibly can. But the prime thing we want to do is integrate this, make it super easy and convenient and maybe, joyful at some point. So that people can just get to their better place. Anyway, that's from all the years that we've spent with building consumer products, this feels intuitively correct. There will absolutely be the specialty point solutions for all kinds of stuff that people care about and want to shop for, and certain kinds of professionals that have specific expertise that people seek out. There's no question that's going to happen. Our bet is that for the middle of the bell curve of the market, integration is really important. Tom, we're \u2013 with Zillow Offers and now, the brokerage that's associated with Zillow Offers, we're finally actually in the end user customer satisfaction customer service business. We used to be in the kind of media customer traffic business and not in the customer service business. And so that's \u2013 I talked about it a little more on previously on the call, the spillover effect from having an owned and operated operation, where we're actually buying and selling homes and we're actually closing these transactions. the spillover goodness to the core business is difficult to quantify how important it is and we see it'll drive a ton of opportunity in the core business on a go-forward basis. And as I said on the call, these businesses, ZO and PA are getting a lot closer together, because that's happening, because of all this learning, And because we're seeing common solutions that we're building for ZO to be applicable to the whole in the industry as a whole, just like with the ShowingTime acquisition today. That's one of those things that we see. And as they come closer together, they're actually opening up even larger swaps of kind of unknown grass, just like bigger chunks of opportunity that we see given all this traffic and engagement we have. So, we're excited. Yes. Yes. I mean, look, I'm not going to be able to give you a better view Tom, than Dr. Svenja runs our econ team. I've obviously looked at the forecast and looked at the drivers, and it's all right there on the econ website for you to dig into as well and be critical of, or agree with or not. I would say though that my kind of cheap seats for armchair economists' perspective is that these are title, these are tectonic shifts that are driving the market. And as I said, in my long-winded answer, I think they're going to play out over quite some time. And I think they'll probably swamp what we would consider normal seasonality in the industry this year. That's our best guess, a lot of the tail off for other forecasts has to do with kind of misery \u2013 some of the misery stuff, Brad, stop me if you want to muzzle me. But I would say that it's a sad thing to say, but even misery drives reshuffling and moving as well. And so I think we're just \u2013 we're setting up pretty \u2013 in a pretty kind of volume bullish way across the whole of the industry for at least this year is my best guess. Is that okay, Brad? Okay. All right. Okay. I guess, thank you. Thanks, everybody today. That'll be it for this quarter 2020. we won't soon forget it. But it was a rollercoaster and \u2013 but it was a year of immense progress for our organization, both culturally, but really as we kind of ditch together on behalf of consumers a new and better way to buy and sell a home to move. Anyway, talk to everybody soon."

            "name": "Allen Parker",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Rich. As rich discussed, Zillow Group delivered another strong quarter, which drove record full-year 2020 revenue and EBITDA on a consolidated basis. We reported Q4 consolidated revenue of $789 million and EBITDA of $170 million, both exceeding the high end of our outlook range. Our Q4 results contributed to the strong 2020 annual results with consolidated revenue growing 22% and EBITDA of $343 million expanding from $39 million in 2019. Q4 IMT segment revenue of $424 million grew 33% year-over-year, as we continue to see accelerated growth across most of our IMT marketplaces. IMT segment EBITDA was $203 million in Q4 or a 48% of IMT segment revenue. Strong revenue growth combined with year-over-year declines in operating costs translated into 132% year-over-year EBITDA growth in Q4. Premier Agent revenue grew 35% year-over-year in Q4, driven by record Q4 customer satisfaction rates and record Q4 connections of higher intent customers to a growing number of high performing partners with continued strong agent retention rates. Excluding the impact of revenue timing changes we discussed in prior earnings calls, the Premier Agent revenue growth rate would have been 27% year-over-year in Q4, accelerating from 20% in Q3. During Q4, Zillow Offers benefited from operational improvements, stronger than expected home price appreciation across the country, a strong customer value proposition and faster sales philosophy. Homes segment revenue of $304 million exceeded the high end of our outlook with home purchases returning to Q4 2019 levels. Our Q4 Zillow Offers unit economics of 668 basis points before interest was above the plus or minus 200 basis point guardrails we set for ourselves while working to scale the business. The outsized unit economic results were impacted by the stronger and faster housing market recovery than we initially assumed in addition to the expected benefit of predominantly high mix of recently acquired homes following the first-half air gap. Q4 unit economics also showed meaningful operational progress in improving our cost per home sold. Combined, we saw all three operational cost line items improved nearly 250 basis points compared to Q3. We are continuing to target our underwriting goal of plus or minus 200 basis points going forward. Our Mortgages segment revenue increased 190% year-over-year in Q4 to $61 million, and Mortgages segment EBITDA was $14 million compared to the midpoint of our prior outlook of $2 million. The revenue and EBITDA outperformance was primarily volume driven with mortgage origination revenue growing nearly seven times year-over-year, and gain on sale \u2013 gain on sale margin staying stronger for longer than we assumed. Turning to our outlook. For the first quarter, at a consolidated level, we expect revenue to be $1.1 billion at the midpoint of our outlook and EBITDA to be between $114 million and $138 million. In our IMT segment, we are forecasting 27% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 at the midpoint of our outlook range. Within the IMT segment, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be between $314 million to $322 million, up 31% year-over-year at the midpoint of our outlook, given by strong top-of-funnel traffic and connections as we enter Q1. We expect Q1 IMT EBITDA margin to be 42% at the midpoint of our outlook. Q1 is also expected to benefit from the timing of certain seasonal advertising and marketing programs that are targeted to launch later this year. While we believe it remains prudent to continue to provide quarterly guidance, I would like to repeat what I said last quarter. We are focused on growing EBITDA dollars compared to the full-year 2020 levels. We do not expect to expand EBITDA margins from the high levels in the second-half of 2020, which benefited from cost controls, put in place during the uncertainty of the pandemic. However, we will continue to drive operational rigor across the business to deliver operating leverage over time while focusing \u2013 while also focusing on investing to drive sustainable growth. In Q1, we expect our Homes segment revenue to increase sequentially to $608 million at the midpoint of our outlook as we ramp up purchase and resell activity levels that are being driven by strong demand and our customer value proposition. We remain focused on applying learnings and operational rigor to drive growth. We expect our Mortgages segment revenue to be between $59 million to $64 million in Q1. We plan to continue to capture the strong refinance demand to invest in building the factory to scale our operations as the purchase business is built out over time. As a result, we expect Mortgages segment EBITDA to be between a loss of $3 million and a profit of $1 million. We are also excited about the future addition of ShowingTime's industry-leading technology to our suite of solutions to help innovate and simplify online tour scheduling for agents, buyers, and sellers. The outlook we provided today does not include any potential benefit from ShowingTime. We believe ShowingTime will deliver significant benefits to the industry, our customers, our partners, and Zillow overtime. We expect the impact on financial results to be relatively small in the near term. We ended the quarter with $3.9 billion in cash and investments, which puts us in a strong position to fund our vision for Zillow and make strategic long-term investments both organically and inorganically. As we look forward in the New Year, our priorities are focused on execution of our vision to help our customers unlock life's next chapter now that we have the core pieces in place. Moving past the necessities of 2020, the following 2021 priorities are focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners. We will grow our customer base and engagement through a compelling dream and shop experience. We will invest in sustainable top-line growth opportunities across the company. We will reduce cost structure and improve productivity and transaction services, and we'll drive profit growth through operational discipline. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. Yes. Why don't I start with PA growth and how we're thinking about it and IMT margins, and then I'll let you handle the more macro housing if that works. Thanks for the question. So, listen, in Premier Agent, we continue to focus on the customer and the input would yield a great result for both the customer and our partner agents. So, we're optimizing to connect high-intent customers with high-performing agents. And the output we're seeing is higher CSAT, higher connections volume, where we're linking high-intent customers with great partners, strong retention, and the business results that we see reflected in our Q4 results and our Q1 outlook. On an apples-to-apples basis, we've seen accelerating sequential growth of 20% in Q3 to 27% in Q4, and now 31% at the midpoint of Q1 outlook. We like where we are, we feel it's still early days and we're not going to hesitate to invest the long-term growth in areas such as technology and marketing, but we feel really good about the current situation and the position we have with respect to PA. With respect to the margins, I'll just cover that real quickly. Our outlook implies a 42% margin at the midpoint, that's down from the second-half margins we saw in the second-half of 2020. Our Q1 guidance, I discussed, includes the benefit from the timing of certain investments that are going to occur later in 2021 as compared to prior years, but our focus is on profitable growth. So near-term, we do not expect margin expansion off the higher second-half 2020 levels. And again, those have benefited from some of the cost controls we put in place based on the uncertainty of the pandemic, but rather we expect EBITDA dollar growth of the full-year of 2020 levels. And again, we're very pleased with how the team is executing and we like where we are. Rich, I don't know if you want to cover more macro. Great. Thanks, Lloyd. All right. So, why don't I start with unit economics, as we reported Q4 unit economics were \u2013 approximately 670 basis points of profit for home before interest as compared to Q3 results that were a loss of 90 basis points, so that's an improvement at 760 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Swaying was not unexpected as Q3 reflected the impact of us selling off the tail of the pre-pandemic inventory, as opposed to Q4 reflecting the benefit of early sales of post-pause purchase cohorts. But there are two other factors that I'd like to call out. And Rich has touched on some of those. So, the HPA trends and sales velocity performed a lot stronger than our underwriting assumptions and contributed to a pretty significant portion of the 500 basis points improvement that you see in our acquisition costs, where our acquisition costs as a percentage of the average sale price went from 91.1% to 85.9%. So that's mixed, but a lot of that is the macro trends. The other \u2013 the other three cost lines; renovations, holding costs and selling costs, which improved 250 basis points over Q3 include in these improvements, some real operational improvements that are durable. We're constantly learning and improving over time, which results in continual improvements in our customer value \u2013 proposition value of our offers. So, that's we're glad to be back up and running. And as we learn, we're able to provide more value proposition to our customers. We do expect some of the pricing spread to be temporal over time, but we will continue. We still see continue to see opportunities for improvement across all four of the cost components. I expect this metrics going to continue to be a little bumpy as we continue to come out of the air gap and the post-pause. but the direction I'll give is we're still maintaining the plus or minus 200 basis point guardrails. And we're going to continue to have those as guardrails as we grow and scale. And as we continue to learn, we'll be able to provide real cost improvements that will benefit our ability to provide value in our customer offers. I hope that helps. And then with the second question, I guess, I'll move to it on some of the bundled services, we're in early stages building out a suite of services, but we like the initial results we're seeing. We feel like we built out the core pieces and are moving deeper into the transaction. We've expanded Zillow Closing Services to 25 markets during 2020 and as we called out, the vast majority of our customers are now choosing to use our Closing Services when they buy a home through Zillow Offers. But we're not just thinking about Zillow Closing Services. There's some programs that we've begun to run across the country, still early stages. And when customers are exposed to our suite of services, there is a meaningful uptick in demand and there's increased value per transaction. This is not a surprise to us at still early stages, but we feel strongly that our thesis of Zillow 2.0 is correct. And I'll close with just saying, as we see this increased evidence that providing a seamless, integrated real estate experience to our customers is welcomed, we can use that, we can use our low cost of customer acquisition to compete, I guess, an industry that's still largely single point solution providers that have higher CAC. All right. Thanks, Ron. Yes, I guess what I'd say is, we continue as we came out of the pause, we had a relatively conservative buy boxes. We brought our processes back. We continue to assess where we can add value to customers and at what ranges. So I think it's going to vary by market. And we'll continue to, as I said, iterate learn and adjust as appropriate. So we're excited about the acquisition pace that we have been able to achieve in Q4 and the momentum that we're bringing into 2021. Buy box is just one of those ways, but we continue to look at where we can provide value for our customers. Sure, sure. Thanks for the question. This is Allen. Yes. I think, I just would point out in responding to that, that fee is just one of the components of the offer that we make to a customer, who's interested in possibly selling through Zillow Offers, selling to us. And the fee is dynamic. And so when I talk about our unit economics and the pricing spread, being a little more temporal and our guardrails being plus or minus 200. we're constantly adjusting dynamically all of the elements of the offer, and we're testing how we communicate those elements of the offer to any customer, who are to any potential seller. So, it's transparent and clear on what it costs and, Rich even calls out the dynamic estimate as an offer, eventually are starting. But so what I would say is that our business model and the way our model works with respect to the seller is extremely dynamic and takes into account these macro conditions. What did occur in Q4 somewhat was that the market out ran some of our initial assumptions and we're catching up. So, we're constantly learning that's we have a feedback loop as we have each one of these data points. And so I would expect that offer to be competitive, but constantly, informed by all of the factors that are out there with respect to velocity, HPA and so on and so forth. If that helps and then Rich, did you want to talk on as delivering the customer choice? So Rich, do you want me to kick through the PA real quick and then you can talk about the other projections that we are providing quarterly. Thanks, Tom. Yes. So, with respect to Flex, when you think about the 35% Q4, if you exclude the impact of some of the revenue timing changes that we've discussed in prior quarters, and they come on both sides, about 200 basis points of growth in Q4 came from leads that we delivered prior to Q3. So that's roughly 200 basis points of growth in Q4, and then the remaining amount to get you to the 27% growth apples-to-apples, came from the fact that we had a comp against 2019, where we did a flip to the entire Flex region for Phoenix and Atlanta. So, that is the 800 basis point that you were calling out. With respect to pain points and so I mean, I believe that team has been operating, really well on the inputs. Our goal is to obviously, leverage our traffic and to bring high intent customers together with agents. And some of those pain points is how do you get them connected? I think our connections investment that we've made in the last two years, well, a little hockey to start has yielded a lot of benefits. I believe things like the ShowingTime investment and schedule a tour is another example of areas, where there's still friction of getting customers \u2013 high intent customers and agents together. So, I believe some of this, online \u2013 offline to online and leveraging tools that we have and can build, is going to reduce a lot of those friction points. So again, that's part of the excitement we have on helping the customer and benefiting not just the customer, but the partner agents, as well as Zillow as we link these get a customer into the house they want. So Rich, I don't know if you want to talk anything about seasonality."

I hope you are all staying healthy and sane wherever you might be in this most challenging and interesting of years. I want to thank you for taking the time to dial in and join us today. I'm quite pleased that we are able to offer some counterprogramming to the election news drip torture. Zillow had another terrific quarter. The team is executing well, and we continue to drive great results. As we discussed in August, we believe Zillow is experiencing two powerful tailwinds, one in residential real estate and the second in technology. We believe these tailwinds will continue to blow for some time, and when paired with solid execution, should drive growth for years to come. I'd like to talk more about these macro trends, these tailwinds, especially in terms of their durability before I get into high-level results. First, let's talk about the residential real estate tailwind. Simply put, people want to move, and we see additional pent-up demand on the horizon, low mortgage rates are helping. And of course, there's been a major shift in the way we think about work, life and home. We have taken our usual calculus about where and how we live, and we've turned it on its head instead of stretching and wrapping our lives to fit around where we work, we've been forced to find a way to stretch and wrap our work to fit around our lives. Not for all, but for many, this has been a healthy and liberating inversion, one that prioritizes life above work. And now obvious byproduct of this inversion is that many are rethinking where they live. This is part of the great reshuffling I've been talking about. In September, we saw the pace of existing home sales climbed to the highest level since 2006, exceeding 6.5 million annualized units. Many are debating and doubting the longevity of this reshuffling trend. My intuition, everything I see in here externally and what is happening right here at Zillow with its 5,000-plus employees, is that a new distributed workforce culture has already been born. I sense this is happening across knowledge work at Corporate America broadly, though different companies are waking up at different paces. This doesn't feel temporal. It feels like it will take years to play out and could end up being the defining cultural trend of the decade. In addition, demographic realities lead us to believe that higher housing turnover is here to stay for some time, following the abnormally lower turnover since the global financial crisis. Going into the current decade, there were about 5 million more Americans in their prime homebuying years compared to 2010. As those millennials begin to move up, Gen Z, the even larger generation behind them, will be in a position to take the baton and begin buying homes. Additionally, the low rate environment feels like it's here to stay. These are additional factors supporting our expectation for continued home transaction growth, the residential real estate tailwind that I've been talking about. The second win, maybe even mightier than the first, the technology tailwind. Across every industry, there has been a COVID catalyzed and dramatic increase and reliance upon and adoption of technology. The concrete is setting on new digital habits for life and work, and it is highly unlikely that we go back to the old analog ways. We see the same technology acceleration in our residential real estate industry and Zillow as the digital leader is benefiting. There is increased shopping traffic at the top of the funnel and more adoption of the digital transaction at the bottom. Our customers are looking for more ways to reduce friction, and we have rallied quickly to bring to market products and services that have been in research and development. Virtual tour requests tripled when the stay-at-home orders began. Now nearly 2/3 of our Zillow Offers home purchases are closed digitally with a remote notary. We are investing our dollars in smarts into building these solutions on behalf of our customers. These new tools are immediately relevant today, and there is just no going back. They will change the expectations for new generations of buyers and sellers in the future. To be sure there is significant uncertainty in the economic environment in the near term and we do not have a crystal ball, this uncertainty and our long operating experience means that we maintain a posture that is balanced between offense and defense as we plan for the coming year. However, we believe these trends we're seeing in real estate and technology are strong in the near term and sustainable in the long term, underpinned by meaningful changes to consumer behavior and demographic trends. And whether it is today or tomorrow, no company is better positioned than Zillow to seize this opportunity. And now on to some results. In the third quarter, we continue to see momentum and great outcomes. We beat our outlook for revenue and EBITDA for each reporting segment. As a company, we are executing well to meet this moment. And we are pleased that our preparation and hard work are bearing fruit. Our Premier Agent business delivered its best sales and retention quarter on record in Q3, beating the high end of our outlook. We expect this momentum to continue in Q4. By focusing on the core inputs of this business, we've been able to reaccelerate our revenue growth. Our relationship with Premier Agent has grown far beyond advertising. Premier Agent continue to invest in Zillow because we are such an effective partner providing robust source of connections to new clients for them. As you've heard me say so many times before, regardless of how we monetize Premier Agent, we believe good news flows from partnering with high-performing agents and teams to deliver high satisfaction to our shared customers maximizing revenue and profit per customer for Zillow. In our Zillow Offers business, we are ramping back up across the country after pausing acquisitions back in March, and it will take time to rebuild our inventory levels. We added Jacksonville, Florida to our list of 25 markets where people can get a fair, hassle-free cash offer for their home. This option for home sellers to be able to move without showings, without open houses on their own time line is proving its appeal. As we build back, we are focused on improving our cost structure on every line item, while simultaneously delivering more ease and convenience for our customers. Last month, as part of that focus, we announced that we'll launch brokerage services for our Zillow Offers transactions early next year. Bringing those services in-house will allow us to deliver a more seamless experience for those buying homes from Zillow and reduce our selling costs over time. Additionally, Zillow Closing Services now -- is now operating in all of our Zillow Offers markets. For our Zillow Offers purchase transaction this quarter, we closed 98% with Zillow Closing Services. Our Mortgages segment revenue more than doubled year-over-year in Q3, buoyed by our originations revenue, which grew 4x compared to last year. We are taking advantage of the current refinance environment while we build our mortgage factory, and we are investing in technology solutions, building out our staff and integrating with our Premier Agent and Zillow Offers over time. I'm proud of the team's ability to drive all of this revenue growth in our segments, but I'm more proud that it has been coupled with operational rigor and cost discipline, which is translating into impressive profits. In Q3, we reported record EBITDA in our IMT segment and record consolidated EBITDA and net income in our overall business. We are benefiting from our leadership teams nearly 2 years focus on fiscal fitness and attention to the key inputs in our business. Allen will go into more detail about our outlook for the rest of the year, but we expect continued growth. Philosophically, we are focused on leveraged growth, but we remain ready to invest aggressively where we see opportunity to grow to amplify our competitive advantages coming out of COVID and to deliver better customer experiences. Speaking of longer term, I'd like to zoom out and say that we are just getting started on an immense opportunity to replatform and revolutionize our industry. The audience we built over the past 15 years is nearly double the size of our closest competitor and grew more than 30% in Q3. Our customers trust us with their shopping and dreaming, which positions us well to move down funnel with them and to be part of their homebuying and selling transactions. Even with this large and growing audience, our Premier Agents, who are responsible for our biggest business today, handle only a small fraction of all real estate transactions. There is potential for meaningfully more growth as we continue to improve our conversion rates and customer experience and make more connections between our high intent customers and our best-in-class high-performing agent partners. On the sell side, Zillow Offers makes up only a tiny fraction of all residential real estate transactions just 0.2%. Most sellers are also buyers. So as more people consider selling to us, we are able to build relationships that create additional opportunities when they go to buy their next home or are looking for other services. We're building adjacent services in both mortgages and title and escrow and will continue to drive market share and ecosystem economics as we spread our low customer acquisition cost across all of these services. This is our Zillow 2.0 vision for the future of real estate. Seamless customer experiences across our products and services, which will deliver additional economic benefits to Zillow, capitalizing on the customer trust we've spent so many years cultivating. Our mission is to help people unlock like this next chapter. In our shareholder letter, we included a link to a video testimonial from customers, Ken and Sharon Nichols. For 73 years, Ken, who has retired from a machine shop and where he would never leave his home state of Minnesota. Health issues for assumed to rethink that, and they decided to move closer to their family. They use Zillow Offers to get a fair cash offer and they moved on their time line. When the Nichols learned that they wouldn't have to deal with the stress of fixing up their house and putting it on the market in order to sell it, Ken captured it perfectly. He said, we're out of here. Across the country, more people are looking around their homes and saying those same three words. We're out of here. They are ready to turn the page and get to a better place, and we will be the partner and brand they trust to help get there. Okay. So let's now switch from PowerPoint mode to Excel mode and ask our CFO, Allen Parker, to take the cloud microphone. Allen?\nAllen Parker: Thanks, Rich. As Rich discussed, Zillow Group delivered strong third quarter results. The inputs across our businesses accelerated more than expected. This, combined with our ongoing operational rigor, delivered results that exceeded our outlook for revenue and EBITDA on a consolidated basis and for each of our segments. We reported consolidated revenue of $657 million for Q3, exceeding the midpoint of our outlook by nearly $100 million. Consolidated Q3 EBITDA was $152 million, double our outlook of $70.5 million at the midpoint of our range. IMT segment revenue of $415 million, grew 24% year-over-year as we saw acceleration in all of our IMT marketplaces. Our strong position, brand and planful approach enabled us to participate in the great reshuffling that we're seeing, benefiting all of our marketplaces. IMT segment EBITDA was $195 million or 47% of segment revenue. IMT segment EBITDA grew 114% versus this time last year, which translates into more than $100 million of incremental EBITDA profit. We were able to increase revenue growth across our IMT marketplaces, while decreasing our operating costs by 6% year-over-year. Operational rigor and cost controls resulted in year-over-year decline in nearly all of our expense lines. Premier Agent revenue grew 24% year-over-year. Our partners found increased value in the Zillow platform from strong growth in customer connections. Our connection growth continues to benefit from innovations in how we service customers, looking to work with our partner agents and the varied calls to actions that our customers can select on our sites. Our Premier Agent revenue was also positively impacted in Q3 by our postpaid Flex monetization model. In accordance with accounting guidance, now that we have sufficient historical data available, we now recognize Flex revenue as leads are delivered to our Premier Agent partners based on the expected fee to be collected when a transaction is closed. This methodology more closely aligns the timing of revenue recognition between our market-based pricing and Flex models. Excluding the revenue related to Flex leads delivered prior to Q3, the revenue growth for Premier Agent would have been 20% compared to the 24% reported growth rate. In Q3, Zillow Offers continued its efforts to increase purchase activity following the pause in the first half of 2020. The strong industry demand, low housing inventory and our resell execution resulted in faster-than-expected sales velocity. Home segment revenue of $187 million, exceeded the high end of our outlook. Our Q3 Zillow Offers unit economics of 90 basis points loss before interest expense remained well within our plus or minus 200 basis point guardrails we previously set for ourselves while growing this business. This was despite the temporary pause in homebuying activities in the first half of 2020 that caused a higher-than-normal mix of older aged inventory sold during Q3. Aged inventory typically has lower unit economics than homes that are sold more quickly. With that said, it is important to note that at the end of Q3, we only had 23 homes remaining in inventory that were purchased prior to the temporary pause in homebuying. We expect to sell a higher-than-normal mix of newer inventory in Q4 as a result. In Q3, our Mortgages segment revenue increased 114% year-over-year to $54 million, and Mortgages segment EBITDA was $16 million versus our outlook for a loss of $1.5 million at the midpoint of our range. The revenue and EBITDA outperformance was primarily due to better-than-normal margins on selling mortgages to the secondary market, operational regular on cost lines and refinance volume reflective of strong market demand due to low interest rates. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Many of our businesses historically have seen seasonally slower activity levels in Q4, but 2020 has been anything but typical. While we are seeing some seasonality as we enter the quarter, we are seeing stronger inputs than would normally be expected in many of our businesses. Across the entire company, we are seeing strong inputs on our growth drivers, coupled with continued focus on profitability, which is resulting in guidance that reflects growth with leverage. We expect consolidated EBITDA at the midpoint of our outlook to be $119 million, up from a loss of $3 million last year. In our IMT segment, we are forecasting 27% revenue growth in Q4 at the midpoint of our outlook. Within the IMT segment, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be $300 million to $310 million, up 31% year-over-year and up sequentially from Q3 at the midpoint of our outlook. Our Q4 outlook for Premier agent revenue includes approximately 200 basis points of impact from Flex revenue expected to be recorded in Q4 related to leads delivered prior to Q3. We expect Q4 IMT EBITDA margins to be 44% at the midpoint of our outlook. As I said previously, the levers are within our control and we are planning to accelerate investments in Q4 from Q3, given the opportunities we see for the IMT segment right now. In Q4, we expect our Homes segment revenues to improve sequentially as we continue to ramp up the purchase activity levels in each of our 25 markets. We are focused on applying our learnings in the last 2.5 years as we move forward on scaling the business. We are continuing to develop our mortgages technology platform to provide our customers and partners a more streamlined experience. While we expect Mortgages revenue to be between $49 million and $53 million in Q4, we are not assuming the stronger-than-normal industry sales margins will be maintained. We also expect to continue to invest in growth, which we expect to result in Mortgages segment EBITDA between breakeven and $4 million. As you can see, my priorities remain focused on scaling our new businesses, executing within our IMT segment in order to fund investments in our new segments along with additional growth opportunities and implementing focused cost discipline and operational rigor across the company as we scale. We are pleased with our results and believe they demonstrate how Zillow has built a strong platform for growth. Our balance sheet is strong, our demand indicators continue to reach record highs and our platform and partners are well positioned and ready to help our customers unlock life's next chapter. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP.\nRich Barton: You're on mute, Ron.\nRon Josey: Can you hear me now? Sorry, I was on mute.\nAllen Parker: Yes.\nRon Josey: Great, thanks. Sorry about that. So I mean so much to talk about here, Rich, now, and thank you very much for everything. And congrats on the quarter. But maybe I wanted to talk just bigger picture, given the growth in the IMT business and PA specifically. And then the guidance from that's accelerating growth in Homes, et cetera. Maybe, Allen, can you talk about how -- if there's a change or how you're thinking about balancing growth with investments. And I ask that just given with IMT growth accelerating in 3Q and for 4Q and margins getting to 47%, I think this quarter and 44% next quarter. Just how do you think about consistent profitability, just given the growth that we're seeing and the investments that are likely coming on? And obviously, we'll have tons of other questions, but I'll leave it there for now.\nAllen Parker: Yes, thanks for the question, Ron, I'll take that. Hey, listen, we're very focused on inputs. And as I talked about in my prepared comments, the inputs are trending very positively right now, and the teams are executing. When I think about margins, I think our Q3 margins of 47% that we reported in Q3 are reflective of what this business model can generate at a steady-state business. But we still believe that there's a lot of opportunity for growth. We think we're in early days in some of these -- this transition, as Rich talked about, and the growth opportunities exist in this segment. And we plan to invest into that opportunity as necessary. The levers are within our control, and we are cautious. But we are planning to accelerate investments while continuing to focus on operational rigor to drive sustainable, profitable growth. If it helps out, what I guess I would say is perhaps looking at the implied annual margin rate may be more representative of going forward as we think about what investments are required. But again, we're going to reserve the right to invest as necessary to lean into this opportunity at Zillow.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom White with D.A. Davidson.\nTom White: Yes, thanks for the counterprogramming here to my -- it's been on my cable TV all day. Two, if I may. Rich, I just wanted to -- I wanted to follow up on your comments around the sustainability of this really nice growth that you guys have been seeing. It sounds like you think the kind of broader underlying market strength can persist here. I was just hoping you could give us a little more color on what kind of gives you the confidence there? And then with regards to the technology transformation you referred to, you talked about a couple of things like digital closings and virtual tours. Curious if you think the pandemic will have a lasting structural change on how brokerages and agents operate. And I guess what I'm really trying to get to is, will this sort of long predicted, but never really materializing compression on agent commissions maybe become more of an issue as technology kind of disrupts that business? And maybe how does that impact you guys?\nRich Barton: Okay. Tom, thanks. So it's -- how sustainable is this stuff is the question of the day and we spend a lot of time thinking about it. And as you heard me use in my prepared remarks, like to me, it feels sustainable. We do not have a crystal ball. We do not know there's so much uncertainty that we're all trying to plan through right now and keep a steady hand on the tiller, that it makes us -- the uncertainty could give us a pessimistic outlook. But these trends that are driving our growth, they feel much -- they feel deep to me, not shallow, okay? Just take the technology one. The off-line to online trend preexisted, was well underway, has been accelerated, and it's pretty hard to believe that we're going to go back and backtrack much. I don't think that one is very debatable that trend. I think the great reshuffling, which I use pretty broadly, it's not just moving, it's kind of we're all reshuffling our lives and reshuffling -- the society is reshuffling right now and how we think about home is a part of that. And this one is more complicated. But I will tell you, and I don't have to tell you, but we all have a good intuition for this, that moving decisions are not made quickly, okay? These moving decisions take time. And despite record transaction levels that we're observing right now, 6.5 million-plus units September annualized, despite that, we're seeing all of this top-of-funnel traffic, I think we're up 40 million new user year-over-year. Brad nod if I have that one incorrect. Yes, Brad's nodding in my Zoom window here. 40 million new user growth year-over-year, I would have guessed might be not possible, if you'd ask me that a year ago. And that is a leading indicator of transactions, okay? That is what people do when they are thinking about moving as they start shopping. And I think companies are slowly awakening to what a cloud-based company is going to look like, what a distributed workforce is going to look like and are slowly beginning to let go of this antiquated or this kind of legacy office culture thing that we have, that kind of face time office culture-based thing. And as companies let go, people are going to make moving decisions. And so it's interesting and scary, but also quite exciting. So I see this one as playing out over likely a very long period of time. So that's why I'm confident that we see some subsidence, some sustainability in this. Of course, our position, I think the technology one is undeniable and that this is just a better way to shop and transact, and it can get better is undeniable as well. So regardless of what happens with these macro trends, I think Zillow is in a really good position to replatform this industry. We're so lightly penetrated on the transactions right now. We have plenty of upside. So we don't rely on these to grow, but we expect them to sustain. All right. That was long-winded. I'm sorry, Tom. And you asked the second one, which is, is the pandemic going to change the way brokerages operate? And you asked the question as operate, I think you meant commissions. But certainly, it's changing the way we all operate, okay? And the -- I guess the usage of software in this industry and technology in this industry is taking a great leap forward. And that, of course, is changing the way we operate with our agent partners and the way brokerages themselves and the whole industry operates. So absolutely, what we see as the effect on the business model, it's -- I would say this has been speculated -- compression here has been speculated about for a long time. We see agents adding real value as consultants to consumers. That is why we partner with them. That is what they tell us they want. And so we continue to see that. So we don't foresee a -- we don't predict a big change there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Champion with Piper Sandler.\nTom Champion: Rich, you've been an observer of the housing market for a lot of years now and you've already offered some comments on this. But I'm wondering if you could just say or offer some perspective on the current market conditions? And what are the 1 or 2 or 3 defining characteristics of this period, whether it'd be low inventory or higher transactions rate or high price? What is the 1 or 2 or 3 really defining characteristics of this time? And then separately, very impressive visitor growth at scale. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit about the visitor growth specific to the 25 Zillow Offers markets. And what growth looks like there and how that funnels down into the Premier Agent business?\nRich Barton: Okay. Tom, I'm not sure I quite got the second question, but let me answer the first and then we can get you to restate it. Yes, on all 3 of those variables that you mentioned, I think the headline variables for the market that are garnering the most attention seem to be shockingly low inventory, okay? That seems like a terrific headline. And then the next most shocking one, I think, is probably home price appreciation at record levels not seen since a while, okay? Those are the big ones. To me, the most important and interesting and actually significant one is days on market. It's a little bit harder to work for most people from a headline perspective, but this is the most important one. It's down to 12 days. In fact, I think new data just came out today that put 11-point something. Maybe Brad can chime in. But average of 12 days on the market is down from 29 or 30 days a year ago, okay? So that's just a huge factor, and of course, it's the multiplication of that times the inventory and some not so complicated way that leads to transactions, which are way up. So I think that demand is -- what this says to me is demand is extremely high, okay? Things are moving off the market quickly. Prices are moving up, therefore, and that, of course, will lure more supply into the market. That's just the way these things work. I guess that's my take on it. Now your second part was something about what we're seeing in Zillow Offers markets?\nTom Champion: Yes. Maybe I'll take a second crack at that. So broadly speaking, you're seeing incredibly strong visitor growth at scale. But I'm curious if you could zoom down into your Zillow Offers markets and look at the unique visitor trends in those markets and whether or not the Zillow Offers business is having a halo effect upon the core Internet segment, whether visitor trends are roughly the same? Or do growth rates look the same in those markets? Or are they better? Are they worse? I'm just curious if there's any mention there.\nRich Barton: Yes, I have not personally done that. Maybe we'll take in a look at it. I have not personally done that, so I don't know. But you know what, my guess is like awareness in most of the Zillow Offers markets, awareness of Zillow Offers is very low, okay? So the likelihood that it's having an impact on the top of the funnel is extremely low, I would guess. So we have a lot of work to do. And that's just because we're so lightly penetrated. We're just educating people on what it is right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.\nLloyd Walmsley: I was wondering if you can talk about how you're scaling up the partner leads [Technical difficulty] what you're seeing in terms of mix of buy-side and sell-side leads in that? Two years ago, you gave us some color around the Phoenix market. Any update on those tests on how many people are coming through that funnel as it looks at the market.\nRich Barton: Lloyd, we know it's you. We know it's you. But you're coming through like sile-on. Yes, we can't -- we really can't understand it. Maybe work on your connection, we'll come back to you. Let's take another question maybe, and then we'll come back to you, if you don't mind. Operator, David, can we go to the next one?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan McKeveny with Zelman & Associates.\nRyan McKeveny: Congratulations on the results really across the board. I wanted to dig in with 2 questions on the Mortgage business. So firstly, of course, great to see the big growth in originations, revenue, EBITDA. One of the industry dynamics going on this year is really strong volume across the board, but capacity constraints in terms of loan officers, processing staff, you name it. A lot of lenders saying I kind of can't hire as fast as I can or I can't find the talent that I want to hire. So my question is, as you embark on expanding Zillow Home Loans, how do you feel you are at this point in just the inroads you're making on kind of ramping up that headcount, ramping up your own internal capacity? And how that's kind of trending relative to the customer demand that you're seeing for mortgages? That's kind of the first piece. And then secondly, on the Mortgage segment. So I think that some investors tend to focus on this idea of kind of attachment to iBuying. But I tend to think that with your online audience, theoretically, the mortgage opportunity could be much more significant and more of a kind of direct-to-consumer fashion, which I'm sure you're kind of embarking on to some degree. You mentioned the refi side of things in your note. So just curious if you can talk about this year, what you're seeing in terms of, kind of, iBuying attachment on the mortgage side versus more of a direct-to-consumer type opportunity? And ultimately, how you think about those and kind of strategize on that for the years ahead?\nRich Barton: Thanks, Ryan. I was on mute. Allen, maybe you want to start out on that?\nAllen Parker: Sure, sure. So thanks, Ryan, for your question. This is Allen Parker. So on the capacity side, first, we feel good about the team's execution in growing the factory. We're still building out the platform, but we have been able to grow our capacity, both with the loan officers as well as the fulfillment team to close on the loans, and that's consistent with the ForEx growth that Rich called out on our originations business in Q3, and is reflected in our guidance in Q4, again, with us possibly not counting on some of the kind of extremely wide margins that were experienced in Q3 given some of the capacity constraints as well as a few other factors. So we feel good about the team's ability to continue to build the factory. With respect to your second question, we view this as an opportunity to serve our customers regardless where they come in. So Zillow Offers is one, working with our Premier Agents and their customers is another as well as direct-to-consumer. We also have a marketplace business. So we think that there's a lot of opportunity if we build a great product and an integrated transaction to make it seamless and less friction to continue to grow this business. We're just in the very early stages. We're really happy with the leadership team we brought in to build the originations business, and we're in very early innings, but we see a lot of opportunity there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Erickson with Needham & Company.\nBrad Erickson: Allen, I think you mentioned 200 basis points of help Flex may be getting in the Q4 PA guide, I guess, for leads delivered before Q4. So I guess just to clarify, can you quantify just how much help the Q4 PA guide is getting from Flex in total? And then more broadly, I guess, for Rich or Allen. Just talk about what you learned with Flex to date and wonder if you're able to talk about any updates to expanding the rollout of that program into more markets as we look out to next year?\nAllen Parker: Great. Thanks, Brad. I'll take the first part of that. So yes, just to be clear, we called out in my prepared comments the change impacting Q3 and it will have an impact on Q4 growth. And what that change is, just following accounting guidance now that we have more data and historical data to estimate what we believe the value of the leads we deliver to our Flex partner agents will be at the time of the transaction close. And the way that rolled out was that any leads we provided to our agents in Q3, we recorded the estimated value of those leads in Q3, and any leads we provide in Q4 will record the estimated value in Q4. But what you have is kind of this lag effect of leads we provided since we launched Flex that have not closed yet that are still going to be recorded on a cash basis as the transactions close. And we estimate that, that has an impact of about 400 basis points on revenue growth in Q3. And again, in Q4, it will be about 200 basis points, but it has to do with leads delivered prior to Q3. So from Q3 on, we're clean, and that number will become immaterial going forward. So going forward, our MBP-based revenue recognition and our postpaid Flex revenue recognition are going to be more closely aligned and consistent. And so I think we won't be having any puts and takes anymore, which is great. Does that -- hopefully, that helps answer your question. And to respond to your second part of the question, what are we learning in Flex. It's still early innings. We have over a year under our belt. We believe that we have a variety of monetization models that work well to deliver a great experience for our customer, working with our partner agents, either under MBP or under Flex. Both MBP and Flex reflected in the guide for Q4 show continued growth and accelerated growth. So we're happy with both. And we're continuing to test and iterate and figure out how to maximize customer satisfaction for our customers, improved conversion, and increased revenue per lead. That's what we're focused on, and we have a variety of monetization models to do that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. First one on Flex. Maybe just sort of a big picture one. Talk to us about what are the gating factors or the characteristics that you all are monitoring to sort of determine the pace at which you push Flex out to more markets? Then the second one on Homes and the iBuying. I think you started to sort of talk about some steps to remove external agents from the business in January '21. How do we think about the impact of the overall long-term profitability of Homes with those changes?\nRich Barton: Brian, maybe I'll take a crack at least at the first part, Allen, maybe I can do both. But Brian, we're not thinking about it in the way you're asking the question anymore because this accounting change kind of liberates us from what Allen just described as the puts and takes of Flex. We're really trying to optimize for a great customer experience, a great partner experience, getting the customer what they really want, which is the transaction. And then at the end of the day, getting more revenue and profit per customer. And that comes as a result of the prime business model. And then ultimately, because of these ecosystem economics that we get when we are able to integrate multiple aspects of the transaction in one customer. And so we really like having a menu of business models, and we will continue to innovate on business models, a menu of business models to use, to test and to basically optimize. We're now seeing this as an optimization problem. And so it will go where it goes, and it's going very well. On the -- and you can see that in the results, obviously. On the Homes side, we view our recent announcement to begin to bring some of the ZO-owned Homes transactions in-house simply as a customer streamline experience move. We are high volume, low uncertainty, so high certainty of close. It's a very cut and dry transaction that doesn't involve a lot of stuff. So we are a scale player here, and we're basically just trying to optimize for customer experience and cost. And that's what -- that is what that is about on this very relatively very small number of transactions. Am I missing anything there on that one, Allen?\nAllen Parker: No, no. I think that's right. I'd say improve the experience, reduce the friction and a byproduct will be improved cost productivity, but that's not the priority. It's an outcome of the transaction.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.\nLloyd Walmsley: All right. Can you hear me now?\nRich Barton: Yes.\nLloyd Walmsley: All right. Two questions. The first one was just, can you talk about the partner leads product a bit more in terms of how you're thinking about expanding the tests kind of from a timing perspective? What you're seeing maybe in terms of mix of buy-side and sell-side leads? And I don't know, 2 years ago, you gave us some color around the Phoenix market. Any update on those tests in terms of the scale you're seeing of the markets you're in? And then the second one was just on the Rental business. Big acceleration there. Is that product-driven? Is that market strength? And is that level of growth sustainable for the next few quarters until you kind of comp through it or more just a function of market activity that is going to be subject to the market?\nAllen Parker: Rich, do you want to hit Rentals and then I'll cover the other one.\nRich Barton: Yes. Why don't you start with the other one and then I will zip in, yes.\nAllen Parker: Okay. Lloyd, thanks for the question. This is Allen. So listen, on partner leads, as we've talked about, we believe that as we build this platform, we have opportunities for a variety of adjacent revenue incrementality. That includes our closing services, the HL and partner leads. We are still in very early days, but we're excited about the long-term opportunities. As Rich called out, DCS achieved 98% attach on purchase transactions on ZO-acquired Homes this quarter. Our Mortgages business is going really, really well as we build the factory. So we think there's opportunities to offer a streamlined service there. And on partner leads, we are continuing to make progress on understanding how to work with our customers throughout the funnel. So I don't have any specific update on stats. We're coming off pause and opening up into 25 markets and there's a lot of noise with the low end right now. But as we have more and more adjacent services, they positively -- they reinforce each other positively. And as we're getting the pieces together, we're getting better and better at linking the services. And that's why we feel like we're so well positioned with the current environment as well as our platform and our product offerings to do really well here. So we feel really good about where we are and the opportunity ahead of us.\nRich Barton: Okay. That was great, Allen. I mean, yes, I'll just hammer that point these kind of -- we're pretty focused on these ecosystem economics. As we think about all of these adjacent opportunities, and we really see our kind of P&L and business advantage as translating this low customer acquisition cost that we have with this huge traffic base in this big brand that we've built over all these years, and being able to, A, do more transactions, convert to more transactions; and then B, add more other transactions to that transaction and maximize the number of spin-off transactions from all those. So it is a really -- it's just a -- it's a really interesting long-term opportunity that we see lots of blue ocean. On the Rentals question, we're really excited by the results that the Rentals team has posted. We have a very big top of funnel. We have a lot of rental shopping demand and activity, and I'm really pleased with the way the team is translating that into results right now. There is some noise about migration out of cities, de-urbanization et cetera. And I think there is a little -- there is some relatively speaking more interest in non-city locations. However, the tide is so high that there is just more shopping demand everywhere and that includes Rentals. So the whole of the housing industry is atypical, but very healthy, and that includes the Rentals business.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Naved Khan with Truist Securities.\nRobert Zeller: This is Robert Zeller on for Naved. So just on the average fee for Zillow Offers, so how sustainable do you think the 7% average fee is? And has it come down at all recently? How should we think about this long term? And if the fee does come down, how much would you expect this to affect conversion rates for home sellers accepting offers? And then what is the plan for inventory levels on the balance sheet during this time of uncertainty? And when can we expect a resumption of going deep into existing markets as a part of Zillow 2.0? And then I just have a very quick one afterwards.\nAllen Parker: All right. I mean, I guess, I'll start by just saying when we think about the fee, there are multiple elements that are included in an offer and fee just one of them. So I would just caution focusing just on that price number. But there's a lot of different ways to deliver value and price the offer. We feel that we're extremely competitive in our pricing, and we're transparent to our customers on the various elements of the offer. What we're finding is total economics matter to the customers. So we feel we're competitive and well positioned to provide and be flexible in the fee and total offer we provide relative to the environment. Rich called out some of the things that happened in an environment -- real estate environment today in terms of short cycle times and a variety of other things about inventory. So I wouldn't base an average fee as anything that's static for us. We're constantly testing, iterating, we feel we're competitive and well positioned to provide a great offering to our customers, and that's what we're seeing as we ramp back up.\nRich Barton: And I guess, I'd just add, the team is really working. We believe it's elastic. It's definitely elastic. How to judge and characterize that probably has changed and it's difficult to characterize, but it definitely is an elastic transaction. So net dollars to the seller matter a bit. And we're -- therefore, we are focused on lowering every single one of the line items to make the unit economics better, including the customer acquisition cost, right, where we have a good advantage. Anyway, I just wanted to hop on there. The inventory levels, when can you expect us to go deep? We're charging as deep as we can as quickly as we can. There's nothing holding us back other than execution. So we're working on it.\nAllen Parker: Yes. I was going to call it, Rich, that we have -- we've used about $114 million of our $1.5 billion in capacity. With our warehouse facilities, we feel we're well positioned on the balance sheet on a cash basis. Right now, that's not the constraint. I mean we're obviously careful in our underwriting, but we're excited to be back buying homes again and innovating on behalf of our customers.\nRich Barton: I mean it's hard to hold on to them because there's so much demand out there. So...\nRobert Zeller : Okay. Okay. Appreciate the color. And then just really quickly on the revenue recognition for Flex. So I mean, basically, if I'm understanding this correctly, it's just effectively pushing up the revenue recognition to now versus in the future. And this will -- and then you'll no longer be lapping in after Q4. Is that correct?\nAllen Parker: Yes. The impact because we'll have most of the transactions related to leads we provided pre Q3 will have occurred by the end of Q4. The effect after Q4 will be minimal is what our expectation is.\nRobert Zeller : Got it.\nAllen Parker: It's exactly right. It's -- we now recognize for both MBP revenue related to leads we provide those agents -- partner agents in the quarter. And with this change, which is consistent with accounting guidance and what you're required to do, we are recognizing the estimated value of the leads we provide to our Flex partners, agents, at the time we provide the leads.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Jason Kreyer with Craig-Hallum.\nJason Kreyer: Two for me on Zillow Offers. With most of the pre-COVID inventory now out of the portfolio, just wondering if you can give us a sense of how we should think about or I guess, how you're thinking differently about buying and selling now versus how you were a year ago? And then piggybacking on that, you had mentioned, Rich, the low awareness of Zillow Offers. Just wondering if you can kind of walk through the game plan for building that up over time.\nRich Barton: Allen, you want to start and I'll finish?\nAllen Parker: Sure. Sure. Thanks for the question, Jason. Yes. So again, we went through this pause. There's an air gap. We are now back acquiring homes. We still feel like there are opportunities related to our cost structure for us to continue to go after, where we're rescaling. We learned a lot over the 2-plus years as we opened 25 markets, and we're able to apply that. I think the most obvious one or one that's easy to see is that our resell learnings allowed us to accelerate the resell velocity and that we started to see as early as Q4 of last year, which helped us get through this uncertainty in a relatively painless way. The team executed really well. So I think we'll continue to push on penetration. But what we're seeing is we think there's opportunities that we can go after both on the acquisition costs by being smarter and machine learning on renovations, on holding costs as we improve the velocity and on selling costs in a variety of areas.\nRich Barton: And on your second part, when you were asking about increasing awareness of Zillow. So we've worked really hard and really effectively for a very long time, 15 years, to be lucky. And that lucky position that we're in is to have a really big trusted brand with 236 million average monthly new use right now. And a lot of the reason to those new use, those users are coming to our sites and apps is to check those estimates, is to look at those estimates and to try to get a feel for what their home is worth, what a home they're shopping for is worth, and we are really like the Bloomberg of -- I don't know if that's a good analogy anymore -- we're the Bloomberg maybe of the real estate industry. And so our -- and so we're in a very lucky and advantaged position where when we have Zillow Offer for a particular home and someone comes and looks at there's estimate, we will be moron-ed if we can't merchandise that Zillow Offer service and get awareness in that way is the primary way we market. There will be other activities we undertake to gain awareness and it takes time for customers to transition how they think about Zillow and the Zillow brand from a kind of information-based service that they're using down to a transaction-oriented one, but it's a challenge we're excited to rise to, and we think it's a very logical one. Thank you guys very much. I guess now we can -- should I conclude, yes, we can return to our regularly scheduled program, pick whatever your favorite cable news channel isn't unmuted. So we can see what's happening back in the political race. I'll close by saying this inevitable shift from off-line to online really has been accelerated in this year. And our new home-based life and distributed work that's caused to rethinking of where and how we live. So these third quarter results confirm Zillow Group's ability to capitalize on these forces in the near term, but with a clear eye on the long-term opportunity, which is vast and nascent. So with our trusted brand, our technological capabilities and experienced team of operators we're on our way. We really appreciate your partnership on this journey to Zillow 2.0. We look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rich Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad. Greetings, everyone, once again from Zillow Group Cloud HQ. I hope you are all staying healthy and sane wherever you might be in this most challenging and interesting of years. I want to thank you for taking the time to dial in and join us today. I'm quite pleased that we are able to offer some counterprogramming to the election news drip torture. Zillow had another terrific quarter. The team is executing well, and we continue to drive great results. As we discussed in August, we believe Zillow is experiencing two powerful tailwinds, one in residential real estate and the second in technology. We believe these tailwinds will continue to blow for some time, and when paired with solid execution, should drive growth for years to come. I'd like to talk more about these macro trends, these tailwinds, especially in terms of their durability before I get into high-level results. First, let's talk about the residential real estate tailwind. Simply put, people want to move, and we see additional pent-up demand on the horizon, low mortgage rates are helping. And of course, there's been a major shift in the way we think about work, life and home. We have taken our usual calculus about where and how we live, and we've turned it on its head instead of stretching and wrapping our lives to fit around where we work, we've been forced to find a way to stretch and wrap our work to fit around our lives. Not for all, but for many, this has been a healthy and liberating inversion, one that prioritizes life above work. And now obvious byproduct of this inversion is that many are rethinking where they live. This is part of the great reshuffling I've been talking about. In September, we saw the pace of existing home sales climbed to the highest level since 2006, exceeding 6.5 million annualized units. Many are debating and doubting the longevity of this reshuffling trend. My intuition, everything I see in here externally and what is happening right here at Zillow with its 5,000-plus employees, is that a new distributed workforce culture has already been born. I sense this is happening across knowledge work at Corporate America broadly, though different companies are waking up at different paces. This doesn't feel temporal. It feels like it will take years to play out and could end up being the defining cultural trend of the decade. In addition, demographic realities lead us to believe that higher housing turnover is here to stay for some time, following the abnormally lower turnover since the global financial crisis. Going into the current decade, there were about 5 million more Americans in their prime homebuying years compared to 2010. As those millennials begin to move up, Gen Z, the even larger generation behind them, will be in a position to take the baton and begin buying homes. Additionally, the low rate environment feels like it's here to stay. These are additional factors supporting our expectation for continued home transaction growth, the residential real estate tailwind that I've been talking about. The second win, maybe even mightier than the first, the technology tailwind. Across every industry, there has been a COVID catalyzed and dramatic increase and reliance upon and adoption of technology. The concrete is setting on new digital habits for life and work, and it is highly unlikely that we go back to the old analog ways. We see the same technology acceleration in our residential real estate industry and Zillow as the digital leader is benefiting. There is increased shopping traffic at the top of the funnel and more adoption of the digital transaction at the bottom. Our customers are looking for more ways to reduce friction, and we have rallied quickly to bring to market products and services that have been in research and development. Virtual tour requests tripled when the stay-at-home orders began. Now nearly 2/3 of our Zillow Offers home purchases are closed digitally with a remote notary. We are investing our dollars in smarts into building these solutions on behalf of our customers. These new tools are immediately relevant today, and there is just no going back. They will change the expectations for new generations of buyers and sellers in the future. To be sure there is significant uncertainty in the economic environment in the near term and we do not have a crystal ball, this uncertainty and our long operating experience means that we maintain a posture that is balanced between offense and defense as we plan for the coming year. However, we believe these trends we're seeing in real estate and technology are strong in the near term and sustainable in the long term, underpinned by meaningful changes to consumer behavior and demographic trends. And whether it is today or tomorrow, no company is better positioned than Zillow to seize this opportunity. And now on to some results. In the third quarter, we continue to see momentum and great outcomes. We beat our outlook for revenue and EBITDA for each reporting segment. As a company, we are executing well to meet this moment. And we are pleased that our preparation and hard work are bearing fruit. Our Premier Agent business delivered its best sales and retention quarter on record in Q3, beating the high end of our outlook. We expect this momentum to continue in Q4. By focusing on the core inputs of this business, we've been able to reaccelerate our revenue growth. Our relationship with Premier Agent has grown far beyond advertising. Premier Agent continue to invest in Zillow because we are such an effective partner providing robust source of connections to new clients for them. As you've heard me say so many times before, regardless of how we monetize Premier Agent, we believe good news flows from partnering with high-performing agents and teams to deliver high satisfaction to our shared customers maximizing revenue and profit per customer for Zillow. In our Zillow Offers business, we are ramping back up across the country after pausing acquisitions back in March, and it will take time to rebuild our inventory levels. We added Jacksonville, Florida to our list of 25 markets where people can get a fair, hassle-free cash offer for their home. This option for home sellers to be able to move without showings, without open houses on their own time line is proving its appeal. As we build back, we are focused on improving our cost structure on every line item, while simultaneously delivering more ease and convenience for our customers. Last month, as part of that focus, we announced that we'll launch brokerage services for our Zillow Offers transactions early next year. Bringing those services in-house will allow us to deliver a more seamless experience for those buying homes from Zillow and reduce our selling costs over time. Additionally, Zillow Closing Services now -- is now operating in all of our Zillow Offers markets. For our Zillow Offers purchase transaction this quarter, we closed 98% with Zillow Closing Services. Our Mortgages segment revenue more than doubled year-over-year in Q3, buoyed by our originations revenue, which grew 4x compared to last year. We are taking advantage of the current refinance environment while we build our mortgage factory, and we are investing in technology solutions, building out our staff and integrating with our Premier Agent and Zillow Offers over time. I'm proud of the team's ability to drive all of this revenue growth in our segments, but I'm more proud that it has been coupled with operational rigor and cost discipline, which is translating into impressive profits. In Q3, we reported record EBITDA in our IMT segment and record consolidated EBITDA and net income in our overall business. We are benefiting from our leadership teams nearly 2 years focus on fiscal fitness and attention to the key inputs in our business. Allen will go into more detail about our outlook for the rest of the year, but we expect continued growth. Philosophically, we are focused on leveraged growth, but we remain ready to invest aggressively where we see opportunity to grow to amplify our competitive advantages coming out of COVID and to deliver better customer experiences. Speaking of longer term, I'd like to zoom out and say that we are just getting started on an immense opportunity to replatform and revolutionize our industry. The audience we built over the past 15 years is nearly double the size of our closest competitor and grew more than 30% in Q3. Our customers trust us with their shopping and dreaming, which positions us well to move down funnel with them and to be part of their homebuying and selling transactions. Even with this large and growing audience, our Premier Agents, who are responsible for our biggest business today, handle only a small fraction of all real estate transactions. There is potential for meaningfully more growth as we continue to improve our conversion rates and customer experience and make more connections between our high intent customers and our best-in-class high-performing agent partners. On the sell side, Zillow Offers makes up only a tiny fraction of all residential real estate transactions just 0.2%. Most sellers are also buyers. So as more people consider selling to us, we are able to build relationships that create additional opportunities when they go to buy their next home or are looking for other services. We're building adjacent services in both mortgages and title and escrow and will continue to drive market share and ecosystem economics as we spread our low customer acquisition cost across all of these services. This is our Zillow 2.0 vision for the future of real estate. Seamless customer experiences across our products and services, which will deliver additional economic benefits to Zillow, capitalizing on the customer trust we've spent so many years cultivating. Our mission is to help people unlock like this next chapter. In our shareholder letter, we included a link to a video testimonial from customers, Ken and Sharon Nichols. For 73 years, Ken, who has retired from a machine shop and where he would never leave his home state of Minnesota. Health issues for assumed to rethink that, and they decided to move closer to their family. They use Zillow Offers to get a fair cash offer and they moved on their time line. When the Nichols learned that they wouldn't have to deal with the stress of fixing up their house and putting it on the market in order to sell it, Ken captured it perfectly. He said, we're out of here. Across the country, more people are looking around their homes and saying those same three words. We're out of here. They are ready to turn the page and get to a better place, and we will be the partner and brand they trust to help get there. Okay. So let's now switch from PowerPoint mode to Excel mode and ask our CFO, Allen Parker, to take the cloud microphone. Allen? You're on mute, Ron. Okay. Tom, thanks. So it's -- how sustainable is this stuff is the question of the day and we spend a lot of time thinking about it. And as you heard me use in my prepared remarks, like to me, it feels sustainable. We do not have a crystal ball. We do not know there's so much uncertainty that we're all trying to plan through right now and keep a steady hand on the tiller, that it makes us -- the uncertainty could give us a pessimistic outlook. But these trends that are driving our growth, they feel much -- they feel deep to me, not shallow, okay? Just take the technology one. The off-line to online trend preexisted, was well underway, has been accelerated, and it's pretty hard to believe that we're going to go back and backtrack much. I don't think that one is very debatable that trend. I think the great reshuffling, which I use pretty broadly, it's not just moving, it's kind of we're all reshuffling our lives and reshuffling -- the society is reshuffling right now and how we think about home is a part of that. And this one is more complicated. But I will tell you, and I don't have to tell you, but we all have a good intuition for this, that moving decisions are not made quickly, okay? These moving decisions take time. And despite record transaction levels that we're observing right now, 6.5 million-plus units September annualized, despite that, we're seeing all of this top-of-funnel traffic, I think we're up 40 million new user year-over-year. Brad nod if I have that one incorrect. Yes, Brad's nodding in my Zoom window here. 40 million new user growth year-over-year, I would have guessed might be not possible, if you'd ask me that a year ago. And that is a leading indicator of transactions, okay? That is what people do when they are thinking about moving as they start shopping. And I think companies are slowly awakening to what a cloud-based company is going to look like, what a distributed workforce is going to look like and are slowly beginning to let go of this antiquated or this kind of legacy office culture thing that we have, that kind of face time office culture-based thing. And as companies let go, people are going to make moving decisions. And so it's interesting and scary, but also quite exciting. So I see this one as playing out over likely a very long period of time. So that's why I'm confident that we see some subsidence, some sustainability in this. Of course, our position, I think the technology one is undeniable and that this is just a better way to shop and transact, and it can get better is undeniable as well. So regardless of what happens with these macro trends, I think Zillow is in a really good position to replatform this industry. We're so lightly penetrated on the transactions right now. We have plenty of upside. So we don't rely on these to grow, but we expect them to sustain. All right. That was long-winded. I'm sorry, Tom. And you asked the second one, which is, is the pandemic going to change the way brokerages operate? And you asked the question as operate, I think you meant commissions. But certainly, it's changing the way we all operate, okay? And the -- I guess the usage of software in this industry and technology in this industry is taking a great leap forward. And that, of course, is changing the way we operate with our agent partners and the way brokerages themselves and the whole industry operates. So absolutely, what we see as the effect on the business model, it's -- I would say this has been speculated -- compression here has been speculated about for a long time. We see agents adding real value as consultants to consumers. That is why we partner with them. That is what they tell us they want. And so we continue to see that. So we don't foresee a -- we don't predict a big change there. Okay. Tom, I'm not sure I quite got the second question, but let me answer the first and then we can get you to restate it. Yes, on all 3 of those variables that you mentioned, I think the headline variables for the market that are garnering the most attention seem to be shockingly low inventory, okay? That seems like a terrific headline. And then the next most shocking one, I think, is probably home price appreciation at record levels not seen since a while, okay? Those are the big ones. To me, the most important and interesting and actually significant one is days on market. It's a little bit harder to work for most people from a headline perspective, but this is the most important one. It's down to 12 days. In fact, I think new data just came out today that put 11-point something. Maybe Brad can chime in. But average of 12 days on the market is down from 29 or 30 days a year ago, okay? So that's just a huge factor, and of course, it's the multiplication of that times the inventory and some not so complicated way that leads to transactions, which are way up. So I think that demand is -- what this says to me is demand is extremely high, okay? Things are moving off the market quickly. Prices are moving up, therefore, and that, of course, will lure more supply into the market. That's just the way these things work. I guess that's my take on it. Now your second part was something about what we're seeing in Zillow Offers markets? Yes, I have not personally done that. Maybe we'll take in a look at it. I have not personally done that, so I don't know. But you know what, my guess is like awareness in most of the Zillow Offers markets, awareness of Zillow Offers is very low, okay? So the likelihood that it's having an impact on the top of the funnel is extremely low, I would guess. So we have a lot of work to do. And that's just because we're so lightly penetrated. We're just educating people on what it is right now. Lloyd, we know it's you. We know it's you. But you're coming through like sile-on. Yes, we can't -- we really can't understand it. Maybe work on your connection, we'll come back to you. Let's take another question maybe, and then we'll come back to you, if you don't mind. Operator, David, can we go to the next one? Thanks, Ryan. I was on mute. Allen, maybe you want to start out on that? Brian, maybe I'll take a crack at least at the first part, Allen, maybe I can do both. But Brian, we're not thinking about it in the way you're asking the question anymore because this accounting change kind of liberates us from what Allen just described as the puts and takes of Flex. We're really trying to optimize for a great customer experience, a great partner experience, getting the customer what they really want, which is the transaction. And then at the end of the day, getting more revenue and profit per customer. And that comes as a result of the prime business model. And then ultimately, because of these ecosystem economics that we get when we are able to integrate multiple aspects of the transaction in one customer. And so we really like having a menu of business models, and we will continue to innovate on business models, a menu of business models to use, to test and to basically optimize. We're now seeing this as an optimization problem. And so it will go where it goes, and it's going very well. On the -- and you can see that in the results, obviously. On the Homes side, we view our recent announcement to begin to bring some of the ZO-owned Homes transactions in-house simply as a customer streamline experience move. We are high volume, low uncertainty, so high certainty of close. It's a very cut and dry transaction that doesn't involve a lot of stuff. So we are a scale player here, and we're basically just trying to optimize for customer experience and cost. And that's what -- that is what that is about on this very relatively very small number of transactions. Am I missing anything there on that one, Allen? Yes. Yes. Why don't you start with the other one and then I will zip in, yes. Okay. That was great, Allen. I mean, yes, I'll just hammer that point these kind of -- we're pretty focused on these ecosystem economics. As we think about all of these adjacent opportunities, and we really see our kind of P&L and business advantage as translating this low customer acquisition cost that we have with this huge traffic base in this big brand that we've built over all these years, and being able to, A, do more transactions, convert to more transactions; and then B, add more other transactions to that transaction and maximize the number of spin-off transactions from all those. So it is a really -- it's just a -- it's a really interesting long-term opportunity that we see lots of blue ocean. On the Rentals question, we're really excited by the results that the Rentals team has posted. We have a very big top of funnel. We have a lot of rental shopping demand and activity, and I'm really pleased with the way the team is translating that into results right now. There is some noise about migration out of cities, de-urbanization et cetera. And I think there is a little -- there is some relatively speaking more interest in non-city locations.

            "content": "Thanks, Rich. As Rich discussed, Zillow Group delivered strong third quarter results. The inputs across our businesses accelerated more than expected. This, combined with our ongoing operational rigor, delivered results that exceeded our outlook for revenue and EBITDA on a consolidated basis and for each of our segments. We reported consolidated revenue of $657 million for Q3, exceeding the midpoint of our outlook by nearly $100 million. Consolidated Q3 EBITDA was $152 million, double our outlook of $70.5 million at the midpoint of our range. IMT segment revenue of $415 million, grew 24% year-over-year as we saw acceleration in all of our IMT marketplaces. Our strong position, brand and planful approach enabled us to participate in the great reshuffling that we're seeing, benefiting all of our marketplaces. IMT segment EBITDA was $195 million or 47% of segment revenue. IMT segment EBITDA grew 114% versus this time last year, which translates into more than $100 million of incremental EBITDA profit. We were able to increase revenue growth across our IMT marketplaces, while decreasing our operating costs by 6% year-over-year. Operational rigor and cost controls resulted in year-over-year decline in nearly all of our expense lines. Premier Agent revenue grew 24% year-over-year. Our partners found increased value in the Zillow platform from strong growth in customer connections. Our connection growth continues to benefit from innovations in how we service customers, looking to work with our partner agents and the varied calls to actions that our customers can select on our sites. Our Premier Agent revenue was also positively impacted in Q3 by our postpaid Flex monetization model. In accordance with accounting guidance, now that we have sufficient historical data available, we now recognize Flex revenue as leads are delivered to our Premier Agent partners based on the expected fee to be collected when a transaction is closed. This methodology more closely aligns the timing of revenue recognition between our market-based pricing and Flex models. Excluding the revenue related to Flex leads delivered prior to Q3, the revenue growth for Premier Agent would have been 20% compared to the 24% reported growth rate. In Q3, Zillow Offers continued its efforts to increase purchase activity following the pause in the first half of 2020. The strong industry demand, low housing inventory and our resell execution resulted in faster-than-expected sales velocity. Home segment revenue of $187 million, exceeded the high end of our outlook. Our Q3 Zillow Offers unit economics of 90 basis points loss before interest expense remained well within our plus or minus 200 basis point guardrails we previously set for ourselves while growing this business. This was despite the temporary pause in homebuying activities in the first half of 2020 that caused a higher-than-normal mix of older aged inventory sold during Q3. Aged inventory typically has lower unit economics than homes that are sold more quickly. With that said, it is important to note that at the end of Q3, we only had 23 homes remaining in inventory that were purchased prior to the temporary pause in homebuying. We expect to sell a higher-than-normal mix of newer inventory in Q4 as a result. In Q3, our Mortgages segment revenue increased 114% year-over-year to $54 million, and Mortgages segment EBITDA was $16 million versus our outlook for a loss of $1.5 million at the midpoint of our range. The revenue and EBITDA outperformance was primarily due to better-than-normal margins on selling mortgages to the secondary market, operational regular on cost lines and refinance volume reflective of strong market demand due to low interest rates. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Many of our businesses historically have seen seasonally slower activity levels in Q4, but 2020 has been anything but typical. While we are seeing some seasonality as we enter the quarter, we are seeing stronger inputs than would normally be expected in many of our businesses. Across the entire company, we are seeing strong inputs on our growth drivers, coupled with continued focus on profitability, which is resulting in guidance that reflects growth with leverage. We expect consolidated EBITDA at the midpoint of our outlook to be $119 million, up from a loss of $3 million last year. In our IMT segment, we are forecasting 27% revenue growth in Q4 at the midpoint of our outlook. Within the IMT segment, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be $300 million to $310 million, up 31% year-over-year and up sequentially from Q3 at the midpoint of our outlook. Our Q4 outlook for Premier agent revenue includes approximately 200 basis points of impact from Flex revenue expected to be recorded in Q4 related to leads delivered prior to Q3. We expect Q4 IMT EBITDA margins to be 44% at the midpoint of our outlook. As I said previously, the levers are within our control and we are planning to accelerate investments in Q4 from Q3, given the opportunities we see for the IMT segment right now. In Q4, we expect our Homes segment revenues to improve sequentially as we continue to ramp up the purchase activity levels in each of our 25 markets. We are focused on applying our learnings in the last 2.5 years as we move forward on scaling the business. We are continuing to develop our mortgages technology platform to provide our customers and partners a more streamlined experience. While we expect Mortgages revenue to be between $49 million and $53 million in Q4, we are not assuming the stronger-than-normal industry sales margins will be maintained. We also expect to continue to invest in growth, which we expect to result in Mortgages segment EBITDA between breakeven and $4 million. As you can see, my priorities remain focused on scaling our new businesses, executing within our IMT segment in order to fund investments in our new segments along with additional growth opportunities and implementing focused cost discipline and operational rigor across the company as we scale. We are pleased with our results and believe they demonstrate how Zillow has built a strong platform for growth. Our balance sheet is strong, our demand indicators continue to reach record highs and our platform and partners are well positioned and ready to help our customers unlock life's next chapter. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. Yes. Yes, thanks for the question, Ron, I'll take that. Hey, listen, we're very focused on inputs. And as I talked about in my prepared comments, the inputs are trending very positively right now, and the teams are executing. When I think about margins, I think our Q3 margins of 47% that we reported in Q3 are reflective of what this business model can generate at a steady-state business. But we still believe that there's a lot of opportunity for growth. We think we're in early days in some of these -- this transition, as Rich talked about, and the growth opportunities exist in this segment. And we plan to invest into that opportunity as necessary. The levers are within our control, and we are cautious. But we are planning to accelerate investments while continuing to focus on operational rigor to drive sustainable, profitable growth. If it helps out, what I guess I would say is perhaps looking at the implied annual margin rate may be more representative of going forward as we think about what investments are required. But again, we're going to reserve the right to invest as necessary to lean into this opportunity at Zillow. Sure, sure. So thanks, Ryan, for your question. This is Allen Parker. So on the capacity side, first, we feel good about the team's execution in growing the factory. We're still building out the platform, but we have been able to grow our capacity, both with the loan officers as well as the fulfillment team to close on the loans, and that's consistent with the ForEx growth that Rich called out on our originations business in Q3, and is reflected in our guidance in Q4, again, with us possibly not counting on some of the kind of extremely wide margins that were experienced in Q3 given some of the capacity constraints as well as a few other factors. So we feel good about the team's ability to continue to build the factory. With respect to your second question, we view this as an opportunity to serve our customers regardless where they come in. So Zillow Offers is one, working with our Premier Agents and their customers is another as well as direct-to-consumer. We also have a marketplace business. So we think that there's a lot of opportunity if we build a great product and an integrated transaction to make it seamless and less friction to continue to grow this business. We're just in the very early stages. We're really happy with the leadership team we brought in to build the originations business, and we're in very early innings, but we see a lot of opportunity there. Great. Thanks, Brad. I'll take the first part of that. So yes, just to be clear, we called out in my prepared comments the change impacting Q3 and it will have an impact on Q4 growth. And what that change is, just following accounting guidance now that we have more data and historical data to estimate what we believe the value of the leads we deliver to our Flex partner agents will be at the time of the transaction close. And the way that rolled out was that any leads we provided to our agents in Q3, we recorded the estimated value of those leads in Q3, and any leads we provide in Q4 will record the estimated value in Q4. But what you have is kind of this lag effect of leads we provided since we launched Flex that have not closed yet that are still going to be recorded on a cash basis as the transactions close. And we estimate that, that has an impact of about 400 basis points on revenue growth in Q3. And again, in Q4, it will be about 200 basis points, but it has to do with leads delivered prior to Q3. So from Q3 on, we're clean, and that number will become immaterial going forward. So going forward, our MBP-based revenue recognition and our postpaid Flex revenue recognition are going to be more closely aligned and consistent. And so I think we won't be having any puts and takes anymore, which is great. Does that -- hopefully, that helps answer your question. And to respond to your second part of the question, what are we learning in Flex. It's still early innings. We have over a year under our belt. We believe that we have a variety of monetization models that work well to deliver a great experience for our customer, working with our partner agents, either under MBP or under Flex. Both MBP and Flex reflected in the guide for Q4 show continued growth and accelerated growth. So we're happy with both. And we're continuing to test and iterate and figure out how to maximize customer satisfaction for our customers, improved conversion, and increased revenue per lead. That's what we're focused on, and we have a variety of monetization models to do that. No, no. I think that's right. I'd say improve the experience, reduce the friction and a byproduct will be improved cost productivity, but that's not the priority. It's an outcome of the transaction. Rich, do you want to hit Rentals and then I'll cover the other one. Okay. Lloyd, thanks for the question. This is Allen. So listen, on partner leads, as we've talked about, we believe that as we build this platform, we have opportunities for a variety of adjacent revenue incrementality. That includes our closing services, the HL and partner leads. We are still in very early days, but we're excited about the long-term opportunities. As Rich called out, DCS achieved 98% attach on purchase transactions on ZO-acquired Homes this quarter. Our Mortgages business is going really, really well as we build the factory. So we think there's opportunities to offer a streamlined service there. And on partner leads, we are continuing to make progress on understanding how to work with our customers throughout the funnel. So I don't have any specific update on stats. We're coming off pause and opening up into 25 markets and there's a lot of noise with the low end right now. But as we have more and more adjacent services, they positively -- they reinforce each other positively. And as we're getting the pieces together, we're getting better and better at linking the services. And that's why we feel like we're so well positioned with the current environment as well as our platform and our product offerings to do really well here. So we feel really good about where we are and the opportunity ahead of us. All right. I mean, I guess, I'll start by just saying when we think about the fee, there are multiple elements that are included in an offer and fee just one of them. So I would just caution focusing just on that price number. But there's a lot of different ways to deliver value and price the offer. We feel that we're extremely competitive in our pricing, and we're transparent to our customers on the various elements of the offer. What we're finding is total economics matter to the customers. So we feel we're competitive and well positioned to provide and be flexible in the fee and total offer we provide relative to the environment. Rich called out some of the things that happened in an environment -- real estate environment today in terms of short cycle times and a variety of other things about inventory. So I wouldn't base an average fee as anything that's static for us. We're constantly testing, iterating, we feel we're competitive and well positioned to provide a great offering to our customers, and that's what we're seeing as we ramp back up. Yes. I was going to call it, Rich, that we have -- we've used about $114 million of our $1.5 billion in capacity. With our warehouse facilities, we feel we're well positioned on the balance sheet on a cash basis. Right now, that's not the constraint. I mean we're obviously careful in our underwriting, but we're excited to be back buying homes again and innovating on behalf of our customers. Yes. The impact because we'll have most of the transactions related to leads we provided pre Q3 will have occurred by the end of Q4. The effect after Q4 will be minimal is what our expectation is. It's exactly right. It's -- we now recognize for both MBP revenue related to leads we provide those agents -- partner agents in the quarter. And with this change, which is consistent with accounting guidance and what you're required to do, we are recognizing the estimated value of the leads we provide to our Flex partners, agents, at the time we provide the leads. Sure. Sure. Thanks for the question, Jason. Yes. So again, we went through this pause. There's an air gap. We are now back acquiring homes. We still feel like there are opportunities related to our cost structure for us to continue to go after, where we're rescaling. We learned a lot over the 2-plus years as we opened 25 markets, and we're able to apply that. I think the most obvious one or one that's easy to see is that our resell learnings allowed us to accelerate the resell velocity and that we started to see as early as Q4 of last year, which helped us get through this uncertainty in a relatively painless way. The team executed really well. So I think we'll continue to push on penetration. But what we're seeing is we think there's opportunities that we can go after both on the acquisition costs by being smarter and machine learning on renovations, on holding costs as we improve the velocity and on selling costs in a variety of areas."

In addition, please note, we will refer to our Internet, Media & Technology segment as our IMT segment. We will now open the call with brief remarks followed by live Q&A. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rich.\nRich Barton: Thanks, Brad. It's great to be on the line with you all from Zillow Cloud HQ to discuss our results. I hope you're getting some downtime in this summer and staying safe. Downtime matters now more than ever, so take care of yourselves and you get some. Okay. The second quarter was one for our history books. We faced down fear and uncertainty and took prudent action to control costs, stopping short of layoffs or furloughs and to extend the lifeline to our valued agent partners. We've refinanced to convert and raised nearly $1 billion of capital for defense and for offense. Since the curse in COVID commenced for us here in the U.S., you've heard me speak several times on quarterly earnings and pop-up conference calls striking what was perhaps a more optimistic tone than you thought was warranted. This quarter's numbers are even better than we had hoped and to firm up our belief that Zillow's business is experiencing powerful tailwinds in both real estate and technology. As I said before, I believe we are at the dawn of a great reshuffling. I'm sure I don't need to spell it out for you because we are all living it, spending an average of 9 hours more per day at home. Zoom meetings are changing the way families think about space and privacy. Home offices are in high demand. Backyards are more desirable than parks and gyms. Work-from-home policies are eliminating the commute for many. There's an endless list of considerations. Millions of people are currently considering upsizing, downsizing, getting closer to family, further from the office, et cetera. At Zillow last week, we announced our intent to be a flexible employer, offering most of our employees the option to work remotely at least part of the time indefinitely. It\u2019s some we never could have anticipated year ago. New habits and norms are forming rapidly right now, in many cases, as with working from home we have found better, more efficient, and more healthy ways to live and work. We\u2019re not going to just go back to the way things were. This is a tectonic shift that we expect to play out for years to come. Additionally, home turnover has been abnormally low since the global financial crisis, which means we entered the pandemic already carrying pent-up demand. These are the forces driving the real estate tailwind, supported by all signals we see and intuit. You see this reflected in our outperformance in Q2 almost every measure, which sets us up well going up well going into Q3, for which we have an outlook that now exceeds our pre-COVID estimates on most metrics. The great reshuffling is driving unusually high interest in home shopping. As the category leader, synonymous with real estate, we hit a record 218 million average monthly unique users this quarter. During the month of June, we grew users on Zillow Group sites and apps by more than 32 million year-over-year. Across every industry, we are all studying, we are seeing an acceleration in the preexisting o-to-o customer migration, navigating from offline to online. In the absence of being able to do much in the physical world, folks have turned to digital delivery systems, Amazon, Netflix, Zoom, et cetera. These are the forces powering tailwind number two, the technology tailwind. We believe we are the outsized beneficiary of this tailwind. No company in our industry is better positioned than Zillow to deliver on seismic shifts in technology adoption. Zillow recreated what it meant to search and find real estate, and we are now investing to recreate and digitize the transaction itself. Three out of four U.S. adults said they want to use video or virtual 3D tour technology to shop for a home right now. Sellers are creating three times as many Zillow 3D home tours as they were in March. Okay. These two tailwinds, real estate and technology, are rapidly converging with Zillow at the nexus. The o-to-o shift as it pertains to Zillow is, in part, what we've been talking about as real estate 2.0, and we're seeing years of adoption accelerate in the months. Real estate 2.0 will be an integrated transaction with virtual shopping, digital document routing, and one day, a trade-in button for your house. Zillow has the tech and R&D capabilities to enable this shift. And with the leading brand in real estate, we are best positioned to capture more transactions as more change the places they call home. These tailwinds paired with excellent execution this past quarter and set us up well for up well for the future. Let me recap a few highlights. In the haze of uncertainty, as the crisis began, we budgeted conservatively, but we planned aggressively to be ready to step on the gas when real estate bounced back. We avoided layoffs and other deep permanent cuts to our cost structure, and we've set ourselves up to press advantages, ending Q2 with $3.5 billion in cash. This positions us well now that the real estate market is snapping back more quickly than many expected. Our Premier Agent business delivered its best sales and retention month on record in June. We expect this momentum to continue and are forecasting 15% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3. Regardless of the monetization model, we believe goodness flows from partnering with high-performing agents and teams to deliver high customer satisfaction and maximization of revenue and profit per customer. Q2's higher-than-expected revenue in our IMT segment, coupled with COVID-driven expense prudence, drove year-over-year margin expansion of 584 basis points that far exceeded our expectations. We continue to see top line momentum in this segment, which informs a Q3 EBITDA margin outlook of close to 40%. Should we achieve this outlook, it will serve as a preview of profit leverage we can achieve in this business. However, we continue to see attractive growth opportunities in IMT and will invest appropriately. In Zillow Offers, we used enhanced selling strategies and differentiated data signals to manage our inventory. The fact that we were able to make it gracefully through the uncertainty of the past 5 months, continuing to sell inventory, is a testament to the team's agility. Our combination of machines and humans is getting smarter and more experienced. We have since reopened all 24 markets after our March pause, offering a certain, convenient and safe way to sell. And the digital shopping experience of the future for buyers, this includes Zillow app\u2019s 3D home tours from anywhere, virtual home tours with a Zillow Premier Agent by appointment and in-person self-tours where buyers can unlock Zillow-owned homes with their mobile phones. A recent study by researchers at Sanford, Northwestern and Colombia shared how Zillow Offers should increase liquidity and mobility by making it easier for people to move, especially people who are downsizing. Zillow Offers is likely helping grease the skids of the great reshuffling. Our Zillow Home Loans business is doing well, with June loan volume up 2.6 times versus a year ago, our best month ever. Zillow closing services is now up and running, and all Zillow Offers markets after less than 12 months. It's still early, but these adjacent businesses are gaining some traction, offering our customers value and convenience along the way. Real estate 2.0 is picking up steam, and we are leading the way. Going forward, we remain focused on driving more transactions across all business segments during this remarkable moment in time that we are all living through. People in all sorts of situations are rethinking their living space, and they're coming to Zillow for help to rent, buy, sell, finance and to close. We are continuing to invest heavily in technology and services that will allow more people to do more of their transactions with Zillow, whether that's through our Zillow branded transaction services or our best-in-class partners. The video we included in the shareholder letter of Seattle landlord, Rahul Tela [ph], and his new tenants demonstrates the technology tailwind in action. Rahul is a local doctor and a Colombian immigrant whose fledgling real estate investment business as a piece of his American dream. When public health orders made it difficult to show his townhouse to potential renters this summer, he turned to Zillow and discovered a suite of virtual tools that made it possible for renters to take a 3D tour online, go on a personalized virtual tour, sign their lease and pay their rent, all without ever meeting Tela in person. He went from nervous to relieved and surprised. He said, there's no other way I would have been able to do this without the Zillow platform. Before I pass the mic over to Allen, I want to take a moment to acknowledge that we, at Zillow recognize the tailwinds we are experiencing are an advantage of being in the shelter business, which is at the base of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, a good and lucky place to be in a pandemic. Our country is grappling with fear, loss, protest and anger through a health crisis and a social reckoning. I'm proud of how our team at Zillow has responded. Our employees helped raise over $1 million for COVID-19 relief efforts in our communities. And additionally, our company has since pledged at least $1 million to support equity and racial justice. Further, we have made a public comment that we can and will do more, starting at our own company and helping to lead progress in the real estate industry, which has a troubled legacy of discrimination that has impacted generations. Recently deceased U.S. representative, John Lewis, wrote that 'Nothing can stop the power of committed and determined people to make a difference in our society.' We at Zillow are committed and determined to help shape a more equitable world. We appreciate your partnership in this journey. Okay. Allen?\nAllen Parker: Thank you, Rich. I'll summarize a few key financial results from Q2, followed by a discussion of our outlook for Q3. As Rich discussed, Zillow Group delivered a strong second quarter. We reported consolidated revenue of $768 million, up 28% year-over-year. Our revenue outperformance was primarily due to a better-than-expected sales results in our Homes segment, when IMT and Mortgages also both outperforming our outlook. While our Zillow Offers home buying was paused temporarily at the beginning of Q2, our actions, improved housing market conditions and low mortgage rates helped drive better revenue than expected for all three of our segments. Stronger revenue, combined with continued focus on managing costs, delivered consolidated EBITDA of $16 million, significantly outperforming our expectations of a loss of $61 million at the midpoint of our outlook range. IMT segment revenue of $280 million and the underlying Premier Agent revenue of $192 million was impacted by the Better Together discounts provided to our partners during Q2. These discounts were effective in retaining our partners and put us in a strong position to benefit from the faster-than-expected housing market recovery. While our IMT segment revenue declined 13% year-over-year, the decline was better than the 25% decrease at the midpoint of our Q2 outlook. As Rich mentioned, in June, we experienced record new Premier Agent monthly recurring revenue, and at the end of June, experienced our highest level of total MRR and retention, since the inception of our Premier Agent MBP program. Given where the quarter started, this is a strong testament to our team's ability to manage through market volatility. IMT segment EBITDA margin was 25.6%, approximately 1,500 basis points above the midpoint of our Q2 outlook. This performance allowed us to grow EBITDA dollars 12% year-over-year, even with the declining revenue. While Homes segment revenue decreased sequentially due to the pause at home buying during the first half of the quarter, we did sell 1,437 homes, or 80% of the inventory we had at the beginning of Q2, exceeding our expectations. Housing transactions proved resilient as we, our partners and the broader industry participants found creative solutions to enable real estate transactions and customers to move forward safely. We restarted purchasing homes midway through the second quarter, and we are pleased with the initial inputs. We are seeing solid demand, while driving continued operational improvements and safety measures. Our Q2 Mortgages segment revenue of $34 million increased 25% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our outlook range. Increased loan officer productivity enabled us to participate in the refinance wave, driven by low mortgage rates. The Mortgages segment also delivered EBITDA of $5 million. As we stated on previous earnings calls, my focus as CFO continues to be establishing processes and mechanisms in support of three key priorities. Those priorities are: scaling our new businesses; executing within our IMT segment in order to fund investments in our new segments, along with additional growth opportunities; and implementing focused cost discipline and operational rigor across the company as we scale. Last quarter, I also discussed that during this uncertain time, the team and I have been focused on liquidity preservation to protect the enterprise and ensure we are well positioned to execute on opportunities to lead the industry to real estate 2.0. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash and investments, the highest balance in our history. In May, we completed nearly $1 billion in capital raises with a combined convertible debt and equity offering, effectively refinancing a portion of our convertible debt due next year. Turning to our outlook, we are providing a one quarter outlook for all segments. While we are pleased with the execution of our team coming out of Q2 and the strong current input trends have informed our Q3 outlook, we do note that given the pandemic, there remains a more -- there remains more of a macro uncertainty in our current environment than normal. Let me start with a few Q3 highlights. In Q3, we expect consolidated EBITDA at the midpoint of the guidance range to be $70.5 million, which is well above what we internally expected even pre-COVID. Accelerated revenue growth in our IMT and Mortgages segments are the primary factors driving top line contribution. EBITDA margins are expected to improve meaningfully as we leverage this revenue growth with continued focus on operating expense discipline. We will begin to increase marketing and advertising investments in Q3 as compared to Q2 as we press our leadership position and drive growth. However, we do expect to see continued year-over-year operating leverage in Q3 for marketing and advertising. We also expect operating leverage in our people costs, technology and development and other operating expenses. People costs are expected to be relatively flat year-over-year as we plan to cautiously manage headcount given the continued uncertain economic environment. Moving to each of our segments, within the IMT segment, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be $277 million, up 15% year-over-year at the midpoint of our outlook range. The sequential improvement from Q2 is driven by expected continued strong sales and partner retention in Q3, coupled with discontinuing our Better Together partner discounts. Other IMT segment revenue growth is also expected to improve in Q3, with further acceleration in rentals revenue growth and discontinued Better discount -- Better Together discounts. Partner hit marketplaces like New York City and display are expected to improve in Q3 from year-over-year declines in Q2 but still remained somewhat down year-over-year in Q3. In light of these factors, we expect IMT EBITDA margin to take a significant step upwards to 39% in Q3 at the midpoint of our outlook range, up nearly 1,200 basis points year-over-year from 27.2% in Q3 2019. In Q3, we expect our Homes segment revenue to be between $140 million and $160 million and an EBITDA loss to be between $80 million to $70 million. Revenue is expected to decline both sequentially and year-over-year due to the pause in purchasing homes that impacted Q2 and the resulting lower inventory balance coming into Q3. With regard to our Mortgages segment, our management team has successfully operationalized our move to conforming mortgages from FHA and VA loans, improved loan officer efficiency and has successfully navigated the dynamic environment. We are continuing to innovate our Mortgages technology platform to provide our customers and partners a more streamlined experience. We expect Q3 Mortgages revenue to be between $34 million and $37 million and EBITDA to be between a slight loss of $3 million and breakeven based upon capacity, current market conditions and additional investments in operations. As our results demonstrate, Zillow has a strong foundation despite the ongoing complex and rapidly changing environment around us. Our actions in Q2 to accelerate our virtual tools, provide partner discounts to support and retain partners and our reduced spending enabled us to extend our leadership position and deliver second quarter results above expectations. Our balance sheet is strong. Our demand indicators have reached record highs, and our platform and partners are well positioned and ready to help our customers move safely into the next chapter of their lives. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator:  [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Kreyer with Craig-Hallum. Sir line is now open.\nJason Kreyer: Thank you, gentlemen. Congrats on the execution this quarter. Rich, there's been a lot of moving parts in the real estate industry, and it even sounds like it's been stronger recently. But with a lot of macro uncertainty lingering, just wanted to see if you could give us some perspective on how you're thinking about real estate going forward.\nRich Barton: Yes. I mean it's not as hard to forecast as it was 4 months ago, but it's still pretty foggy. There's a ton of uncertainty, but here's what we're seeing, and I'm sure you're seeing it, too. Demand is high. Supply is relatively low, okay? And mortgage rates are low, okay? So all of that is supporting prices and increasing prices should or good prices should lead to increased inventory, but that's been a stubborn one. There are a couple of early leading indicators on inventory that are flashing yellow to green right now, though. So maybe that's changing right now. Rents are stable to up, and shopping is active. So I guess the question is why are we seeing this right now? I mean it really is those two big tailwinds I talked about that we are benefiting from here at Zillow. We're lucky to be benefiting from them. The more debatable tailwind is this great reshuffling that you heard me, waving on my arms about. But literally, it's almost math that we want -- that a lot of people want a new living space, whether they want to remodel it or move. And that is driving real estate demand for all, everywhere, not just in the suburbs, everywhere. The tailwind that is more powerful and advantage Zillow more is this technology-driven O-to-O tailwind, this retail to digital that's happening in every category, of course. But it's really happening in real estate now. And we're the digital leader, all the way from the top-of-funnel search and find right through 3D floor plans, deep down the shopping funnel. So, I guess, we're benefiting for this title shift up and down the funnel. And we're positioned really well going forward given our roots, really, our roots are as a tech company. Yesterday, I spoke to 106 Zillow interns in a cloud -- on a Zoom-based cloud meeting. It's pretty phenomenal. The large majority of these interns are engineering and data science interns. I'd say a few other companies are in our industry even have an intern program, much less such a diverse set of young, bright people from top schools, and we're running it all remotely. This is really quite amazing, and it's a great advantage for us. If it weren't for a pandemic and potential economic calamity, we could really get excited. Anyway, it's sort of exciting nonetheless. I hope that helps clarify things. But signals are looking pretty good.\nJason Kreyer: That does. A lot of good color in there. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brad Erickson with Needham. Your line is now open.\nBrad Erickson: Hi. Thanks. So, I guess, the IMT and Premier Agent business, in particular, the outlook you gave there for Q3 is I think ahead of what most of us were thinking. You talked about some of the factors that are driving that. Maybe, Rich, just talk about sustainability of those trends as we look out maybe a bit beyond Q3, how should we think about that?\nRich Barton: I mean it feels good, Brad. I mean it feels -- it's up and down the funnel. I mean at the top of the funnel, and it was driven by this O-to-O shift, I guess, and people wanting to find a new place, but just for instance, I think the stat I cited was that we increased new use in June by 32 million unique users. But the more interesting thing to sustain, we can't expect that kind of thing to continue. So we have to move down funnel to find the levers to drive the business in a sustainable way, right? And we have these levers all the way down the funnel, these kind of dials that we have all the way down the funnel that we are not yet maximizing or monetizing and we've begun to turn them, and we're beginning to see action. So our focus -- we began a year or a little over a year ago a focus -- this focus on transactions. And that focus on driving transactions is helping us drive more and better connections out of the same traffic flow. We got to increase traffic flow, but it's helping us drive more and better connections out of a similar traffic flow. We're getting them to better partners who are delivering better customer satisfaction and more transactions, so all of that results in more revenues and profit per customer for Zillow. So you're seeing that show up in our Q2 results, which are surprisingly good, and you're seeing that in our Q3 outlook. It's hard to know beyond that, but we sense plenty of road ahead for improvement in these dials and optimization of them given the amounts -- just the sheer amount of blue ocean that's off our bout.\nBrad Erickson: Got it. That\u2019s great. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question and, yes, really great to see everything coming back here. And Rich, I wanted to stick with the Premier Agent business. Two questions that\u2019s in here, you mentioned a comment around regardless of the revenue model, the focus is on revenue maximization. I'm curious if the pandemic accelerated Flex or how you're thinking about that, assuming no change, but interesting comment. And then maybe, Allen, with EBITDA margins guiding to around 39%, 40% or so in the IMT business, advertising is coming back, which you talked about, despite strong user growth. So that's one thing. But just wondering how sustainable that margin is for the IMT business and what's driving that? Thank you.\nAllen Parker: Yes. The only -- hey, Ron, thanks for the questions. I can take the second, and then we can talk about Flex. I think -- so Ron, with respect to our Q3 guide on our IMT margins, our margin outlook in Q3 is reflective of how our marketplace business models can perform when topline growth is combined with cost discipline. Our focus is providing a great customer experience by improving connections, customer satisfaction and conversion for our customers through technology and partnering with high-performing agent partners. This focus is working, as evidenced by the strong trends we're experiencing exiting Q2, and has informed the accelerating revenue growth incorporated into our Q3 outlook. But we control the cost levers, and we'll continue to focus on cost discipline. I would call out, though, that we'll also invest strategically and opportunistically to press our leadership position where warranted. So given the uncertainty and lack of clarity, we're not providing any guidance or target updates outside of the Q3 outlook, but we feel really good about where we are and the business models that we're operating with it.\nRich Barton: Okay. I see your first one, Ron. Thanks for jumping in there, Allen. I started talking, and I did the classic Zoom mute air. Sorry about that. I was talking at my computer stream to myself. So on the -- yes, on the Flex question, certainly early in the pandemic, you heard us comment that we were certainly happy that we had the Flex arrow in in our quiver. We had to Flex entr\u00e9e on our dinner menu of stuff that we can offer our partners as we move to get these better partners who are better at converting and are focused on customer satisfaction and transactions. And we're willing to delay gratification from revenue in order to do that. So it's been -- it was certainly nice to have, especially at an uncertain time. It's still uncertain, but a decent amount of fog has cleared. And the way we're thinking about this really, Ron, is as kind of the menu that I described. We have these different business models, these different ways we interact with different partners in different geographies, and not just in PA, but also on the businesses that surround Zillow offers. And what we're finding is that having a flexible menu of things that we can figure out how to make them work the best with different partners has offered us a really interesting optimization opportunity. And that's really what's going on now. We continue to test and roll out this and other models, but we think about this just in a much broader context of continuing to get more dollars to drop out the bottom of this customer funnel. And so you're going to probably hear less specific stuff about Flex, I think, going forward. And that's not to say we don't love it. We do. It's just become part of the way we do business. And because of the -- we don't -- I should let Allen speak about it. But the only reason we started talking about it as a separate thing initially was because of this revenue recognition thing. And I think we've kind of -- that's just not as necessary anymore to focus on. I hope that helps, Ron.\nRon Josey: It does. Thank you, Rich. Appreciate it. Thank you, Allen.\nAllen Parker: Yes. I'd just add, Rich, it flows out that one question that now that we are also offering and monetizing Flex, alongside MBP in the same markets, it just becomes more of an optimization, how do we manage our business versus our Flex versus MBP by market assessment. And so that's why I think we're in an optimization model, looking to maximize revenue per lead, and that's how we'll be looking at the business.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nQ \u2013 Robert Zeller: Hi. This is Robert Zeller for Naved. Thank you for taking the question. So following the pause and subsequent resumption of purchasing homes, how aggressive do you expect to be with Zillow Offers going forward in Q3 and the rest of the year, and just curious how consumers' interest in this offering has evolved throughout the pandemic. And then separately, in the shareholder letter, I think you said that you have agreed to repurchase homes, but sometimes the closing can take weeks or months to close, which is why some won't be added to inventory until Q3 or later. I'm just wondering -- I just want to clarify whether or not that's -- these homes are reflected in the 86 homes sold in the quarter. And then separately, how long do you expect it to take for these homes to close? And how much volatility do you expect in closing times? Thank you.\nRich Barton: So maybe I'll start, Allen, with the first half of the question, and then you -- if I screw anything up on trying to answer the second part of the question, you can hop in and help out. So starting with your question, Robert, about how aggressive we want to be with Zillow Offers, well, we've now, as of today, actually opened up all 24 of the markets that we had open before COVID hit. And so you can tell, by the way, we've opened markets and how aggressively we've reopened markets, you can tell we feel good about it. And the supposition is that this price certainty, this time certainty and convenience and the kind of safety associated with -- if you're a seller, not having to have a bunch of people go through your house; and if you're a buyer, letting yourself into a home with a Zillow app with nobody there, those both feel like good things in the midst of a health crisis, and we're seeing that play out. So we feel that in a way, the pandemic highlights some of the benefits of working with Zillow Offers. It is -- the reopening is early days. So we're watching. And carefully, but we're feeling good about kind of the post-COVID Zillow Offers. On the repurchase question, I'm not -- maybe you have the letter in front of you. I think what you're asking is -- what maybe a little confusion is just basically us highlighting that, of course, pausing the factory for 8 weeks or so is going to cause an air gap of product coming out of the other side of the factory, and then it just takes the cycle time in the factory of getting a home all the way through the factory out the other side and sold takes some time. So we're going to see -- what you're basically seeing is in our guidance for Homes next quarter. I'll have -- maybe Allen, you have it in front of you. You're just going to see that air gap in the factory reflected in that outlook.\nAllen Parker: Yes. I think it's exactly right, Rich. And I'll just try to add a little color to that. So we purchased 86 homes in Q2. We disclosed that in the shareholder letter. And we unpaused -- we started up again, until it offers up again. We were only in 15 markets coming out of Q2. We're now in all 24. That's exactly what Rich mentioned. Our guide -- our revenue guidance of $140 million to $160 million, down 61% year-over-year and 67% sequentially at the midpoint, is really due to this air pocket. We have not seen any substantial increases in the cycle time from when we agreed to an offer with one of our customers who's selling their home to when we close, but it does take time. And so what we've got here is because of the pause and we were actually paused up to 21 weeks before we were open in all 24 markets. It's just going to take a little time as we restart the factory. It's air gap that Rich mentioned, to run that through. I'll give you a historical reference. We entered this quarter into Q3 with 440 homes. You'd have to go back to when we entered Q1 of 2019, we had a little over 500 homes. So that's the closest reference point. We did about $130 million in revenue in that quarter. We are planning and our guidance implies a slight acceleration versus that quarter with our $140 million to $160 million, but that's the reason the revenue is declining sequentially. I'm sorry I was distracted by a fluffy kitten that just ran to my room. It's a joys of working from home.\nBradley Berning: Allen, it's Brad. I'm going to add one thing, just to clarify the question specifically, which is the 86 homes or homes we closed on from a purchase perspective, it does not include commitments that we did to purchase homes, so just to clarify that as well.\nRobert Zeller: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nRich Barton: Brian?\nOperator: Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley, your line is now open. Again, Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley, your line is now open.\nRich Barton: You can maybe go to the next one, Abigail.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Maria Ripps from Canaccord. Your line is now open.\nMaria Ripps: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow up on Homes. So now that you resume your home buying across all of your markets, can you comment on what you are seeing in terms of pricing and homes availability? And are you finding good undervalued homes to buy? And any updated thinking on targets for average return on homes sold now that your data models are getting better and better?\nRich Barton: Maybe I'll take the first half, Allen. You take the second?\nAllen Parker: Yes. Okay.\nRich Barton: All right. So just as -- thanks for your question, Maria. So just as a reminder, what we're doing in our Zillow Offers Homes business is not looking for distressed situation, deep discounting, take advantage of a seller situation and make a big profit. We're really going for a high-volume scaled service that offers anybody within our buy box a fair price and the ability for them to choose a convenient date to affect the transaction. So that doesn't mock with their lives. So I'm just saying that because embedded in your question was a little bit that we have a -- it's just a house flipper type of business. But what we are finding, it's early in the reopening, and we're feeling good about the product refining. I want to see inventories build, and inventories are beginning to build now, and that's good. When it was scary, and we couldn't see the future, I wanted to see the inventories go down, and they did. And now inventories are rising. And so it's reinforcing that lots of sellers in our 24 markets are seeing the value of the convenience and certainty and safety of the Zillow Offers service. Allen?\nAllen Parker: Yes. And so the second part of your question on the average return, again, we're still very early stages in ZO in 24 markets. And so we're not adjusting our guardrails of the plus or minus 200 basis points. We still believe that we've got a lot of testing and iteration to do across a lot of areas. We are very excited as we start up operations again with opportunities to improve our cost structure. But for right now, the plus or minus 200 basis points are still the guardrails we have in place as we test and iterate. I will call out that given our pause and our restart we do expect some increased volatility near term in these metrics as we refill our factory across all 24 markets. And this is going to be driven by what would have been a normal operating cycle curve and a normal distribution of aged inventory when we were in normal operations, is going to be skewed a little bit to older inventory as the pause, works its way through our factory. And then the newer inventory comes in, and we expect end of 2020 to early 2021 to be back on a normal operating cycle. So there will be a little volatility there, but we're really excited to get going and be buying from our customers again and providing the service.\nMaria Ripps: All right. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak: Can you guys hear me now?\nAllen Parker: He was there. The mute problem, yes.\nBrian Nowak: Yes. And I'm bad at technology. Thanks for the call again. So I have two questions. The first one on the Agent discounts. So I appreciate the color about Better Together. I guys to be curious to hear about how to think about the order of magnitude, how big was that in the second quarter? And then as you look at your third quarter guide, what are you assuming for discounting? Are you sort of assuming that those go away given the strength of underlying demand? Then the second one, curious to hear about just how your discussion with agents has evolved throughout a shelter-in-place and now the reopening. There's a lot of other real estate platforms that are trying to compete for your agents. How has that discussion changed around their asks of you to really provide value for them? Thanks.\nRich Barton: Allen, do you want to take the first bit, at least?\nAllen Parker: Yes. I'll take the first bit. So, Brian, I think that we spoke about the Better Together as one of the many action items that we took late in Q1 to manage our business, and we're really excited we did. We think those, along with other actions, help retain our partners and respond. So we were able to respond when the industry came back faster than expected, is the right thing to do. And we're seeing the benefits in record sales, high retention, higher connections and improved customer satisfaction. With respect to how I would look at the business, I think the best way for you guys to think about the business is I would guide you towards our Q3 outlook for PA with a guide range on revenue of 272 to 282. That's year-over-year growth of about 15% at the midpoint. That is the best barometer of where we kind of feel the business is going into the quarter. The discounts were very heavily weighted to early in the quarter. And so a number over the quarter doesn't really help you too much. So I look to our Q3 guide, there are no discounts implied in that range as kind of where we are trending coming out of Q2 into Q3 and onward.\nRich Barton: And I guess, Brian, for the second part, how is the agent discussions changed with shelter-in-place and the reshuffling, I guess, I would characterize it that, well, I guess, number one, we feel like we are the outsized beneficiary of agent retention right now as they hunt for new customers, simply because people have fewer places to go to shop and agents have fewer places to get visibility where customers are. And so we are finding more inbound interest or more general interest. We've been working our way towards finding better, more productive, more transaction and customer satisfaction-focused agents. And I don't think I'd be going too far to say that we made -- we've accelerated those trends during COVID. As Allen was saying, we bought a lot of goodwill with the Better Together discount. And we are seeing that play out in some numbers but feeling it play out in just general partnership sentiment, which is really good. And then finally, I'd say we've seen attitudes towards technology adoption amongst the agent community to be quite different during COVID than pre-COVID, put it that way. And that's not really a nasty comment. It's more - when everything is going fine, doing things the old way, it's just don't bother me with the new way stuff. Don't bother me with the 3D tours. Don't bother me with the virtual stuff. But let's just -- we can just do it the old way. And now, of course, they don't -- this is the way to do it, to do it safely. And so we're getting all kinds of adoption and usage of the tools that we've had in place for a while during this period. I hope that gives you some texture.\nBrian Nowak: That\u2019s really helpful. Yes, thank you both. Thanks.\nRich Barton: I'd add one more just for fun. And it's something you all are seeing, too, because most all of you, I'm sure, are mainly working remotely and trying to carry on business or reinvent the way you do business and the way you convene and the way you meet. Of course, communicating with our many thousands of Premier Agent partners is really important for us. And historically, we've been able to physically convene in Las Vegas or wherever to do unlock. And now we've begun to do that virtually and are having really tremendous early, knock on wood, success at using these fantastic new tools to run events, to educate, to field questions, to train. It's really -- it feels good to me. And it feels like something that we're not going to go back on. We can serve more partners virtually than we could in Las Vegas. And if we can do it just as well or better, then that's really amazing.\nBrian Nowak: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of John Campbell with Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.\nJohn Campbell: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Phenomenal results and good guidance. Good work. On the closing revenue, you guys kind of tuck that in that kind of new revenue line item under the recover of [indiscernible] last quarter. But just doing the math on the homes that you sold thus far this year, I mean, it's small potatoes. It's $0.30 or so per home sold, but I'm guessing that you guys -- the closing services that you have in there with title and escrow and some of the other settlement services, that could probably get you somewhere up to, I don't know, $5,000, $6, 000, maybe $7,000 per transaction, is that the right way to think about it?\nRich Barton: Allen, you're on mute, and I'm waiting for you to reply.\nAllen Parker: Yes. So this is title and escrow. And yes, we reported $436 million in Q2. We had $761 million. It's so not -- just everyone knows in other revenue within our Homes segment. And what this really is, is more of a play on integrated transaction. I believe it's about 100 basis points is what we're talking about, and it saves us on cost when we use VCS services, our own internal services and a transaction that we're closing with ZO. And then there are other times where we're able to use that for non-ZO transactions, but more like 100 basis points, so you may be a little high on your number for the escrow services that we're providing now, but we believe we can scale that. We're open in all 24 markets. We were not open throughout the entire year in all 24 markets, but we're really excited how quickly this team has kind of built up and supporting our customers. But again, what we really like is in partnering with our actual Zillow Offers business, these two services can make the transaction painless fast, and it's actually a cost structure reduction for us when we do ourselves versus pay a third party. Does that answer your question?\nJohn Campbell: Yes, that makes sense. And then second question for me. On the reduction in sales and marketing are getting a little bit of leverage in sales and marketing, I'm imagining you guys are probably going to see a little bit of lift there over the next couple of quarters, but how much of that is driven by kind of deemphasizing Trulia, or is there other pieces there that are helping offset some of that marketing spend?\nAllen Parker: Yes. So again, we talked about our pause in marketing for Q2. We announced that even prior to our Q2 guidance. It was incorporated in our Q2 guidance. We are starting to at least sequentially in Q3 look for opportunities where it makes sense to support our brand and to increase spending. We continue to support both Trulia and Zillow, but our priority is on the Zillow brand. And what I'd say is that, we'll continue to look, access, monitor, measure and adjust the spend as appropriate to support our brand and to continue to support growth. But the guide of Q3 incorporates a sequential increase but still providing year-over-year leverage, and that's coming both on the Trulia brand and the Zillow brand.\nJohn Campbell: Okay, very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thanks for that. Rich, you've mentioned a few times the increased pace of adoption that you're seeing from brokers of new technology. You've never been one to shy away from sort of leaning into the development of that technology. Seeing this, what are you doing? How are you using this opportunity to sort of push Zillow's investment in that technology? How much more do you want to spend, need to spend and to the -- obviously, I'm sure you don't want to tip your hand to any public or private competitors, but to the extent that there are -- that there is a road map priorities of where the biggest opportunities for you in that technology investment, I would appreciate those sort of insights.\nRich Barton: Yes. Heath, I think if I broaden out, if I could at least choose to hear your question in a broad framework, I'd say there's no greater priority. We are -- it's weird, but real estate has been a laggard in adoption of modern technology even before COVID. And for a lot of legacy regulatory complexity, fragmentation, distribution reasons, it's been pretty stubborn in its resistance to technology adoption. So I really -- I believe we are at the beginning of a cycle of complete re-platforming and near gear being escorted out and a new foundation for the industry being built. And so unlike -- this is it. We are really excited about this. And we're excited that we're in a position to be able to just have the talent and hire the talent , that is able to dream up what that looks like. Make it all work together, and to do so in a way with the ultimate customer in mind, not necessarily the legacy industry user in mind. But the industry user matters a lot, but it's really the customer experience that we need to fix. It's really quite broken, and we're at the early stages of that. So broadly speaking, I would say, it's like -- it's the top development platform that we have. Specifically, I think you're asking more about kind of the virtual touring stuff and the stuff that we've been talking about. And yes, we're leaning into that, too. It's pretty clear that people want to shop this way even as we ask them about shopping post pandemic, would you still want to take virtual tours? Yes. Would you still want to let yourself into a home so that you can tour it yourself? Yes, et cetera. And so we do think that these are rapidly becoming industry norms. And so we're leaning into that. We do have -- there is some competition there, no doubt, that is investing in this, but I think our collective -- our R&D expenditure and capabilities in this area really give us an advantage.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thanks a lot, Rich.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nLloyd Walmsley: Great. Thanks. Two if I can. First, just what is the latest update on seller leads and fact converting sales inquiries from Zillow Offers where you don't make an offer to seller leads for Premier Agent? And then second, can you talk about whether you're seeing any signs of just increased moving activity in the sense of people looking to move out of cities or tolerating longer commutes? So is there any real signal in search activity that this notion of potentially unlocking like a multiyear trend of elevated moves that could be real? Anything you could share there would be great. Thanks.\nRich Barton: You want to start, Allen, and I'll finish?\nAllen Parker: Yes. So on -- we call it partner leads. But on partner leads, what I'd say is that Zillow Offers buying pause was an opportunity for us to look at and refine our partner lead generation channel. We're continuing to enhance our processes to better support our customers. We're providing them with multiple options now early in the pipeline, whether they want to sell to ZO or sell traditionally through with our PA partners. So we're very excited. It's still very early. We're seeing some positive trends, but we're still iterating, and we're excited about the opportunity here.\nRich Barton: Hey, Lloyd, thanks for your question. Yes, it's a tricky one. It's a really popular story to tell this deurbanization story. Everybody seems to want to tell it. The real story is that shopping is up everywhere, and that's what our data says. And we're speculating beyond what we're seeing as is everybody. We are -- we do have -- COVID has accelerated many pre-existing trends, pick your trends, social, political and in business, and COVID has accelerated these trends. And there was a preexisting trend that was kind of an affordability crisis in some coastal urban -- high-density urban areas, and we were already seeing a deceleration of migration. And we actually expect logically to have COVID be an accelerant of that. And the longer we go on with companies -- I think I said that the longer we go on working -- having many companies, not all, but the lucky companies being able to have people work from home, the more the concrete kind of sets and the more habits get set, and the less likely companies are to go back the way it was. And so we are pretty confident that this is going to be a lasting, multiyear meaningful trend. We can't call exactly how it's going to play out from the data yet. But from an intuition supported by some bit of data, it seems like something real.\nLloyd Walmsley: All right. Thank you.\nRich Barton: Yeah.\nOperator: And this completes the allotted time for questions, I will now turn the call back over to Rich Barton for any closing remarks.\nRich Barton: Thanks, Abigail. Thanks, everybody. This quarter, it's just further evidence that Zillow is in a strong position to lead the industry through the tech transformation ahead that I've been talking about. In the short term and the long term, we're committed to bringing our customers a safe, convenience, seamless way to move forward. And we feel like the wind is at our backs, and we're in a great position. I really appreciate your partnership in this journey. Stay safe, and carry on. And again, make sure you take a break and enjoy the summer. It's more important now than ever. Good talking to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rich Barton",
            "content": "Thanks, Brad. It's great to be on the line with you all from Zillow Cloud HQ to discuss our results. I hope you're getting some downtime in this summer and staying safe. Downtime matters now more than ever, so take care of yourselves and you get some. Okay. The second quarter was one for our history books. We faced down fear and uncertainty and took prudent action to control costs, stopping short of layoffs or furloughs and to extend the lifeline to our valued agent partners. We've refinanced to convert and raised nearly $1 billion of capital for defense and for offense. Since the curse in COVID commenced for us here in the U.S., you've heard me speak several times on quarterly earnings and pop-up conference calls striking what was perhaps a more optimistic tone than you thought was warranted. This quarter's numbers are even better than we had hoped and to firm up our belief that Zillow's business is experiencing powerful tailwinds in both real estate and technology. As I said before, I believe we are at the dawn of a great reshuffling. I'm sure I don't need to spell it out for you because we are all living it, spending an average of 9 hours more per day at home. Zoom meetings are changing the way families think about space and privacy. Home offices are in high demand. Backyards are more desirable than parks and gyms. Work-from-home policies are eliminating the commute for many. There's an endless list of considerations. Millions of people are currently considering upsizing, downsizing, getting closer to family, further from the office, et cetera. At Zillow last week, we announced our intent to be a flexible employer, offering most of our employees the option to work remotely at least part of the time indefinitely. It's some we never could have anticipated year ago. New habits and norms are forming rapidly right now, in many cases, as with working from home we have found better, more efficient, and more healthy ways to live and work. We're not going to just go back to the way things were. This is a tectonic shift that we expect to play out for years to come. Additionally, home turnover has been abnormally low since the global financial crisis, which means we entered the pandemic already carrying pent-up demand. These are the forces driving the real estate tailwind, supported by all signals we see and intuit. You see this reflected in our outperformance in Q2 almost every measure, which sets us up well going up well going into Q3, for which we have an outlook that now exceeds our pre-COVID estimates on most metrics. The great reshuffling is driving unusually high interest in home shopping. As the category leader, synonymous with real estate, we hit a record 218 million average monthly unique users this quarter. During the month of June, we grew users on Zillow Group sites and apps by more than 32 million year-over-year. Across every industry, we are all studying, we are seeing an acceleration in the preexisting o-to-o customer migration, navigating from offline to online. In the absence of being able to do much in the physical world, folks have turned to digital delivery systems, Amazon, Netflix, Zoom, et cetera. These are the forces powering tailwind number two, the technology tailwind. We believe we are the outsized beneficiary of this tailwind. No company in our industry is better positioned than Zillow to deliver on seismic shifts in technology adoption. Zillow recreated what it meant to search and find real estate, and we are now investing to recreate and digitize the transaction itself. Three out of four U.S. adults said they want to use video or virtual 3D tour technology to shop for a home right now. Sellers are creating three times as many Zillow 3D home tours as they were in March. Okay. These two tailwinds, real estate and technology, are rapidly converging with Zillow at the nexus. The o-to-o shift as it pertains to Zillow is, in part, what we've been talking about as real estate 2.0, and we're seeing years of adoption accelerate in the months. Real estate 2.0 will be an integrated transaction with virtual shopping, digital document routing, and one day, a trade-in button for your house. Zillow has the tech and R&D capabilities to enable this shift. And with the leading brand in real estate, we are best positioned to capture more transactions as more change the places they call home. These tailwinds paired with excellent execution this past quarter and set us up well for up well for the future. Let me recap a few highlights. In the haze of uncertainty, as the crisis began, we budgeted conservatively, but we planned aggressively to be ready to step on the gas when real estate bounced back. We avoided layoffs and other deep permanent cuts to our cost structure, and we've set ourselves up to press advantages, ending Q2 with $3.5 billion in cash. This positions us well now that the real estate market is snapping back more quickly than many expected. Our Premier Agent business delivered its best sales and retention month on record in June. We expect this momentum to continue and are forecasting 15% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3. Regardless of the monetization model, we believe goodness flows from partnering with high-performing agents and teams to deliver high customer satisfaction and maximization of revenue and profit per customer. Q2's higher-than-expected revenue in our IMT segment, coupled with COVID-driven expense prudence, drove year-over-year margin expansion of 584 basis points that far exceeded our expectations. We continue to see top line momentum in this segment, which informs a Q3 EBITDA margin outlook of close to 40%. Should we achieve this outlook, it will serve as a preview of profit leverage we can achieve in this business. However, we continue to see attractive growth opportunities in IMT and will invest appropriately. In Zillow Offers, we used enhanced selling strategies and differentiated data signals to manage our inventory. The fact that we were able to make it gracefully through the uncertainty of the past 5 months, continuing to sell inventory, is a testament to the team's agility. Our combination of machines and humans is getting smarter and more experienced. We have since reopened all 24 markets after our March pause, offering a certain, convenient and safe way to sell. And the digital shopping experience of the future for buyers, this includes Zillow app's 3D home tours from anywhere, virtual home tours with a Zillow Premier Agent by appointment and in-person self-tours where buyers can unlock Zillow-owned homes with their mobile phones. A recent study by researchers at Sanford, Northwestern and Colombia shared how Zillow Offers should increase liquidity and mobility by making it easier for people to move, especially people who are downsizing. Zillow Offers is likely helping grease the skids of the great reshuffling. Our Zillow Home Loans business is doing well, with June loan volume up 2.6 times versus a year ago, our best month ever. Zillow closing services is now up and running, and all Zillow Offers markets after less than 12 months. It's still early, but these adjacent businesses are gaining some traction, offering our customers value and convenience along the way. Real estate 2.0 is picking up steam, and we are leading the way. Going forward, we remain focused on driving more transactions across all business segments during this remarkable moment in time that we are all living through. People in all sorts of situations are rethinking their living space, and they're coming to Zillow for help to rent, buy, sell, finance and to close. We are continuing to invest heavily in technology and services that will allow more people to do more of their transactions with Zillow, whether that's through our Zillow branded transaction services or our best-in-class partners. The video we included in the shareholder letter of Seattle landlord, Rahul Tela [ph], and his new tenants demonstrates the technology tailwind in action. Rahul is a local doctor and a Colombian immigrant whose fledgling real estate investment business as a piece of his American dream. When public health orders made it difficult to show his townhouse to potential renters this summer, he turned to Zillow and discovered a suite of virtual tools that made it possible for renters to take a 3D tour online, go on a personalized virtual tour, sign their lease and pay their rent, all without ever meeting Tela in person. He went from nervous to relieved and surprised. He said, there's no other way I would have been able to do this without the Zillow platform. Before I pass the mic over to Allen, I want to take a moment to acknowledge that we, at Zillow recognize the tailwinds we are experiencing are an advantage of being in the shelter business, which is at the base of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, a good and lucky place to be in a pandemic. Our country is grappling with fear, loss, protest and anger through a health crisis and a social reckoning. I'm proud of how our team at Zillow has responded. Our employees helped raise over $1 million for COVID-19 relief efforts in our communities. And additionally, our company has since pledged at least $1 million to support equity and racial justice. Further, we have made a public comment that we can and will do more, starting at our own company and helping to lead progress in the real estate industry, which has a troubled legacy of discrimination that has impacted generations. Recently deceased U.S. representative, John Lewis, wrote that 'Nothing can stop the power of committed and determined people to make a difference in our society.' We at Zillow are committed and determined to help shape a more equitable world. We appreciate your partnership in this journey. Okay. Allen? Yes. I mean it's not as hard to forecast as it was 4 months ago, but it's still pretty foggy. There's a ton of uncertainty, but here's what we're seeing, and I'm sure you're seeing it, too. Demand is high. Supply is relatively low, okay? And mortgage rates are low, okay? So all of that is supporting prices and increasing prices should or good prices should lead to increased inventory, but that's been a stubborn one. There are a couple of early leading indicators on inventory that are flashing yellow to green right now, though. So maybe that's changing right now. Rents are stable to up, and shopping is active. So I guess the question is why are we seeing this right now? I mean it really is those two big tailwinds I talked about that we are benefiting from here at Zillow. We're lucky to be benefiting from them. The more debatable tailwind is this great reshuffling that you heard me, waving on my arms about. But literally, it's almost math that we want -- that a lot of people want a new living space, whether they want to remodel it or move. And that is driving real estate demand for all, everywhere, not just in the suburbs, everywhere. The tailwind that is more powerful and advantage Zillow more is this technology-driven O-to-O tailwind, this retail to digital that's happening in every category, of course. But it's really happening in real estate now. And we're the digital leader, all the way from the top-of-funnel search and find right through 3D floor plans, deep down the shopping funnel. So, I guess, we're benefiting for this title shift up and down the funnel. And we're positioned really well going forward given our roots, really, our roots are as a tech company. Yesterday, I spoke to 106 Zillow interns in a cloud -- on a Zoom-based cloud meeting. It's pretty phenomenal. The large majority of these interns are engineering and data science interns. I'd say a few other companies are in our industry even have an intern program, much less such a diverse set of young, bright people from top schools, and we're running it all remotely. This is really quite amazing, and it's a great advantage for us. If it weren't for a pandemic and potential economic calamity, we could really get excited. Anyway, it's sort of exciting nonetheless. I hope that helps clarify things. But signals are looking pretty good. I mean it feels good, Brad. I mean it feels -- it's up and down the funnel. I mean at the top of the funnel, and it was driven by this O-to-O shift, I guess, and people wanting to find a new place, but just for instance, I think the stat I cited was that we increased new use in June by 32 million unique users. But the more interesting thing to sustain, we can't expect that kind of thing to continue. So we have to move down funnel to find the levers to drive the business in a sustainable way, right? And we have these levers all the way down the funnel, these kind of dials that we have all the way down the funnel that we are not yet maximizing or monetizing and we've begun to turn them, and we're beginning to see action. So our focus -- we began a year or a little over a year ago a focus -- this focus on transactions. And that focus on driving transactions is helping us drive more and better connections out of the same traffic flow. We got to increase traffic flow, but it's helping us drive more and better connections out of a similar traffic flow. We're getting them to better partners who are delivering better customer satisfaction and more transactions, so all of that results in more revenues and profit per customer for Zillow. So you're seeing that show up in our Q2 results, which are surprisingly good, and you're seeing that in our Q3 outlook. It's hard to know beyond that, but we sense plenty of road ahead for improvement in these dials and optimization of them given the amounts -- just the sheer amount of blue ocean that's off our bout. Okay. I see your first one, Ron. Thanks for jumping in there, Allen. I started talking, and I did the classic Zoom mute air. Sorry about that. I was talking at my computer stream to myself. So on the -- yes, on the Flex question, certainly early in the pandemic, you heard us comment that we were certainly happy that we had the Flex arrow in in our quiver. We had to Flex entre\u0301e on our dinner menu of stuff that we can offer our partners as we move to get these better partners who are better at converting and are focused on customer satisfaction and transactions. And we're willing to delay gratification from revenue in order to do that. So it's been -- it was certainly nice to have, especially at an uncertain time. It's still uncertain, but a decent amount of fog has cleared. And the way we're thinking about this really, Ron, is as kind of the menu that I described. We have these different business models, these different ways we interact with different partners in different geographies, and not just in PA, but also on the businesses that surround Zillow offers. And what we're finding is that having a flexible menu of things that we can figure out how to make them work the best with different partners has offered us a really interesting optimization opportunity. And that's really what's going on now. We continue to test and roll out this and other models, but we think about this just in a much broader context of continuing to get more dollars to drop out the bottom of this customer funnel. And so you're going to probably hear less specific stuff about Flex, I think, going forward. And that's not to say we don't love it. We do. It's just become part of the way we do business. And because of the -- we don't -- I should let Allen speak about it. But the only reason we started talking about it as a separate thing initially was because of this revenue recognition thing. And I think we've kind of -- that's just not as necessary anymore to focus on. I hope that helps, Ron. So maybe I'll start, Allen, with the first half of the question, and then you -- if I screw anything up on trying to answer the second part of the question, you can hop in and help out. So starting with your question, Robert, about how aggressive we want to be with Zillow Offers, well, we've now, as of today, actually opened up all 24 of the markets that we had open before COVID hit. And so you can tell, by the way, we've opened markets and how aggressively we've reopened markets, you can tell we feel good about it. And the supposition is that this price certainty, this time certainty and convenience and the kind of safety associated with -- if you're a seller, not having to have a bunch of people go through your house; and if you're a buyer, letting yourself into a home with a Zillow app with nobody there, those both feel like good things in the midst of a health crisis, and we're seeing that play out. So we feel that in a way, the pandemic highlights some of the benefits of working with Zillow Offers. It is -- the reopening is early days. So we're watching. And carefully, but we're feeling good about kind of the post-COVID Zillow Offers. On the repurchase question, I'm not -- maybe you have the letter in front of you. I think what you're asking is -- what maybe a little confusion is just basically us highlighting that, of course, pausing the factory for 8 weeks or so is going to cause an air gap of product coming out of the other side of the factory, and then it just takes the cycle time in the factory of getting a home all the way through the factory out the other side and sold takes some time. So we're going to see -- what you're basically seeing is in our guidance for Homes next quarter. I'll have -- maybe Allen, you have it in front of you. You're just going to see that air gap in the factory reflected in that outlook. Brian? You can maybe go to the next one, Abigail. Maybe I'll take the first half, Allen. You take the second? All right. So just as -- thanks for your question, Maria. So just as a reminder, what we're doing in our Zillow Offers Homes business is not looking for distressed situation, deep discounting, take advantage of a seller situation and make a big profit. We're really going for a high-volume scaled service that offers anybody within our buy box a fair price and the ability for them to choose a convenient date to affect the transaction. So that doesn't mock with their lives. So I'm just saying that because embedded in your question was a little bit that we have a -- it's just a house flipper type of business. But what we are finding, it's early in the reopening, and we're feeling good about the product refining. I want to see inventories build, and inventories are beginning to build now, and that's good. When it was scary, and we couldn't see the future, I wanted to see the inventories go down, and they did. And now inventories are rising. And so it's reinforcing that lots of sellers in our 24 markets are seeing the value of the convenience and certainty and safety of the Zillow Offers service. Allen? Allen, do you want to take the first bit, at least? And I guess, Brian, for the second part, how is the agent discussions changed with shelter-in-place and the reshuffling, I guess, I would characterize it that, well, I guess, number one, we feel like we are the outsized beneficiary of agent retention right now as they hunt for new customers, simply because people have fewer places to go to shop and agents have fewer places to get visibility where customers are. And so we are finding more inbound interest or more general interest. We've been working our way towards finding better, more productive, more transaction and customer satisfaction-focused agents. And I don't think I'd be going too far to say that we made -- we've accelerated those trends during COVID. As Allen was saying, we bought a lot of goodwill with the Better Together discount. And we are seeing that play out in some numbers but feeling it play out in just general partnership sentiment, which is really good. And then finally, I'd say we've seen attitudes towards technology adoption amongst the agent community to be quite different during COVID than pre-COVID, put it that way. And that's not really a nasty comment. It's more - when everything is going fine, doing things the old way, it's just don't bother me with the new way stuff. Don't bother me with the 3D tours. Don't bother me with the virtual stuff. But let's just -- we can just do it the old way. And now, of course, they don't -- this is the way to do it, to do it safely. And so we're getting all kinds of adoption and usage of the tools that we've had in place for a while during this period. I hope that gives you some texture. I'd add one more just for fun. And it's something you all are seeing, too, because most all of you, I'm sure, are mainly working remotely and trying to carry on business or reinvent the way you do business and the way you convene and the way you meet. Of course, communicating with our many thousands of Premier Agent partners is really important for us. And historically, we've been able to physically convene in Las Vegas or wherever to do unlock. And now we've begun to do that virtually and are having really tremendous early, knock on wood, success at using these fantastic new tools to run events, to educate, to field questions, to train. It's really -- it feels good to me. And it feels like something that we're not going to go back on. We can serve more partners virtually than we could in Las Vegas. And if we can do it just as well or better, then that's really amazing. Allen, you're on mute, and I'm waiting for you to reply. Yes. Heath, I think if I broaden out, if I could at least choose to hear your question in a broad framework, I'd say there's no greater priority. We are -- it's weird, but real estate has been a laggard in adoption of modern technology even before COVID. And for a lot of legacy regulatory complexity, fragmentation, distribution reasons, it's been pretty stubborn in its resistance to technology adoption. So I really -- I believe we are at the beginning of a cycle of complete re-platforming and near gear being escorted out and a new foundation for the industry being built. And so unlike -- this is it. We are really excited about this. And we're excited that we're in a position to be able to just have the talent and hire the talent , that is able to dream up what that looks like. Make it all work together, and to do so in a way with the ultimate customer in mind, not necessarily the legacy industry user in mind. But the industry user matters a lot, but it's really the customer experience that we need to fix. It's really quite broken, and we're at the early stages of that. So broadly speaking, I would say, it's like -- it's the top development platform that we have. Specifically, I think you're asking more about kind of the virtual touring stuff and the stuff that we've been talking about. And yes, we're leaning into that, too. It's pretty clear that people want to shop this way even as we ask them about shopping post pandemic, would you still want to take virtual tours? Yes. Would you still want to let yourself into a home so that you can tour it yourself? Yes, et cetera. And so we do think that these are rapidly becoming industry norms. And so we're leaning into that. We do have -- there is some competition there, no doubt, that is investing in this, but I think our collective -- our R&D expenditure and capabilities in this area really give us an advantage. You want to start, Allen, and I'll finish? Hey, Lloyd, thanks for your question. Yes, it's a tricky one. It's a really popular story to tell this deurbanization story. Everybody seems to want to tell it. The real story is that shopping is up everywhere, and that's what our data says. And we're speculating beyond what we're seeing as is everybody. We are -- we do have -- COVID has accelerated many pre-existing trends, pick your trends, social, political and in business, and COVID has accelerated these trends. And there was a preexisting trend that was kind of an affordability crisis in some coastal urban -- high-density urban areas, and we were already seeing a deceleration of migration. And we actually expect logically to have COVID be an accelerant of that. And the longer we go on with companies -- I think I said that the longer we go on working -- having many companies, not all, but the lucky companies being able to have people work from home, the more the concrete kind of sets and the more habits get set, and the less likely companies are to go back the way it was. And so we are pretty confident that this is going to be a lasting, multiyear meaningful trend. We can't call exactly how it's going to play out from the data yet. But from an intuition supported by some bit of data, it seems like something real. Yeah. Thanks, Abigail. Thanks, everybody. This quarter, it's just further evidence that Zillow is in a strong position to lead the industry through the tech transformation ahead that I've been talking about. In the short term and the long term, we're committed to bringing our customers a safe, convenience, seamless way to move forward. And we feel like the wind is at our backs, and we're in a great position. I really appreciate your partnership in this journey. Stay safe, and carry on. And again, make sure you take a break and enjoy the summer. It's more important now than ever. Good talking to you."

            "name": "Allen Parker",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich. I'll summarize a few key financial results from Q2, followed by a discussion of our outlook for Q3. As Rich discussed, Zillow Group delivered a strong second quarter. We reported consolidated revenue of $768 million, up 28% year-over-year. Our revenue outperformance was primarily due to a better-than-expected sales results in our Homes segment, when IMT and Mortgages also both outperforming our outlook. While our Zillow Offers home buying was paused temporarily at the beginning of Q2, our actions, improved housing market conditions and low mortgage rates helped drive better revenue than expected for all three of our segments. Stronger revenue, combined with continued focus on managing costs, delivered consolidated EBITDA of $16 million, significantly outperforming our expectations of a loss of $61 million at the midpoint of our outlook range. IMT segment revenue of $280 million and the underlying Premier Agent revenue of $192 million was impacted by the Better Together discounts provided to our partners during Q2. These discounts were effective in retaining our partners and put us in a strong position to benefit from the faster-than-expected housing market recovery. While our IMT segment revenue declined 13% year-over-year, the decline was better than the 25% decrease at the midpoint of our Q2 outlook. As Rich mentioned, in June, we experienced record new Premier Agent monthly recurring revenue, and at the end of June, experienced our highest level of total MRR and retention, since the inception of our Premier Agent MBP program. Given where the quarter started, this is a strong testament to our team's ability to manage through market volatility. IMT segment EBITDA margin was 25.6%, approximately 1,500 basis points above the midpoint of our Q2 outlook. This performance allowed us to grow EBITDA dollars 12% year-over-year, even with the declining revenue. While Homes segment revenue decreased sequentially due to the pause at home buying during the first half of the quarter, we did sell 1,437 homes, or 80% of the inventory we had at the beginning of Q2, exceeding our expectations. Housing transactions proved resilient as we, our partners and the broader industry participants found creative solutions to enable real estate transactions and customers to move forward safely. We restarted purchasing homes midway through the second quarter, and we are pleased with the initial inputs. We are seeing solid demand, while driving continued operational improvements and safety measures. Our Q2 Mortgages segment revenue of $34 million increased 25% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our outlook range. Increased loan officer productivity enabled us to participate in the refinance wave, driven by low mortgage rates. The Mortgages segment also delivered EBITDA of $5 million. As we stated on previous earnings calls, my focus as CFO continues to be establishing processes and mechanisms in support of three key priorities. Those priorities are: scaling our new businesses; executing within our IMT segment in order to fund investments in our new segments, along with additional growth opportunities; and implementing focused cost discipline and operational rigor across the company as we scale. Last quarter, I also discussed that during this uncertain time, the team and I have been focused on liquidity preservation to protect the enterprise and ensure we are well positioned to execute on opportunities to lead the industry to real estate 2.0. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash and investments, the highest balance in our history. In May, we completed nearly $1 billion in capital raises with a combined convertible debt and equity offering, effectively refinancing a portion of our convertible debt due next year. Turning to our outlook, we are providing a one quarter outlook for all segments. While we are pleased with the execution of our team coming out of Q2 and the strong current input trends have informed our Q3 outlook, we do note that given the pandemic, there remains a more -- there remains more of a macro uncertainty in our current environment than normal. Let me start with a few Q3 highlights. In Q3, we expect consolidated EBITDA at the midpoint of the guidance range to be $70.5 million, which is well above what we internally expected even pre-COVID. Accelerated revenue growth in our IMT and Mortgages segments are the primary factors driving top line contribution. EBITDA margins are expected to improve meaningfully as we leverage this revenue growth with continued focus on operating expense discipline. We will begin to increase marketing and advertising investments in Q3 as compared to Q2 as we press our leadership position and drive growth. However, we do expect to see continued year-over-year operating leverage in Q3 for marketing and advertising. We also expect operating leverage in our people costs, technology and development and other operating expenses. People costs are expected to be relatively flat year-over-year as we plan to cautiously manage headcount given the continued uncertain economic environment. Moving to each of our segments, within the IMT segment, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be $277 million, up 15% year-over-year at the midpoint of our outlook range. The sequential improvement from Q2 is driven by expected continued strong sales and partner retention in Q3, coupled with discontinuing our Better Together partner discounts. Other IMT segment revenue growth is also expected to improve in Q3, with further acceleration in rentals revenue growth and discontinued Better discount -- Better Together discounts. Partner hit marketplaces like New York City and display are expected to improve in Q3 from year-over-year declines in Q2 but still remained somewhat down year-over-year in Q3. In light of these factors, we expect IMT EBITDA margin to take a significant step upwards to 39% in Q3 at the midpoint of our outlook range, up nearly 1,200 basis points year-over-year from 27.2% in Q3 2019. In Q3, we expect our Homes segment revenue to be between $140 million and $160 million and an EBITDA loss to be between $80 million to $70 million. Revenue is expected to decline both sequentially and year-over-year due to the pause in purchasing homes that impacted Q2 and the resulting lower inventory balance coming into Q3. With regard to our Mortgages segment, our management team has successfully operationalized our move to conforming mortgages from FHA and VA loans, improved loan officer efficiency and has successfully navigated the dynamic environment. We are continuing to innovate our Mortgages technology platform to provide our customers and partners a more streamlined experience. We expect Q3 Mortgages revenue to be between $34 million and $37 million and EBITDA to be between a slight loss of $3 million and breakeven based upon capacity, current market conditions and additional investments in operations. As our results demonstrate, Zillow has a strong foundation despite the ongoing complex and rapidly changing environment around us. Our actions in Q2 to accelerate our virtual tools, provide partner discounts to support and retain partners and our reduced spending enabled us to extend our leadership position and deliver second quarter results above expectations. Our balance sheet is strong. Our demand indicators have reached record highs, and our platform and partners are well positioned and ready to help our customers move safely into the next chapter of their lives. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. Yes. The only -- hey, Ron, thanks for the questions. I can take the second, and then we can talk about Flex. I think -- so Ron, with respect to our Q3 guide on our IMT margins, our margin outlook in Q3 is reflective of how our marketplace business models can perform when topline growth is combined with cost discipline. Our focus is providing a great customer experience by improving connections, customer satisfaction and conversion for our customers through technology and partnering with high-performing agent partners. This focus is working, as evidenced by the strong trends we're experiencing exiting Q2, and has informed the accelerating revenue growth incorporated into our Q3 outlook. But we control the cost levers, and we'll continue to focus on cost discipline. I would call out, though, that we'll also invest strategically and opportunistically to press our leadership position where warranted. So given the uncertainty and lack of clarity, we're not providing any guidance or target updates outside of the Q3 outlook, but we feel really good about where we are and the business models that we're operating with it. Yes. I'd just add, Rich, it flows out that one question that now that we are also offering and monetizing Flex, alongside MBP in the same markets, it just becomes more of an optimization, how do we manage our business versus our Flex versus MBP by market assessment. And so that's why I think we're in an optimization model, looking to maximize revenue per lead, and that's how we'll be looking at the business. Yes. I think it's exactly right, Rich. And I'll just try to add a little color to that. So we purchased 86 homes in Q2. We disclosed that in the shareholder letter. And we unpaused -- we started up again, until it offers up again. We were only in 15 markets coming out of Q2. We're now in all 24. That's exactly what Rich mentioned. Our guide -- our revenue guidance of $140 million to $160 million, down 61% year-over-year and 67% sequentially at the midpoint, is really due to this air pocket. We have not seen any substantial increases in the cycle time from when we agreed to an offer with one of our customers who's selling their home to when we close, but it does take time. And so what we've got here is because of the pause and we were actually paused up to 21 weeks before we were open in all 24 markets. It's just going to take a little time as we restart the factory. It's air gap that Rich mentioned, to run that through. I'll give you a historical reference. We entered this quarter into Q3 with 440 homes. You'd have to go back to when we entered Q1 of 2019, we had a little over 500 homes. So that's the closest reference point. We did about $130 million in revenue in that quarter. We are planning and our guidance implies a slight acceleration versus that quarter with our $140 million to $160 million, but that's the reason the revenue is declining sequentially. I'm sorry I was distracted by a fluffy kitten that just ran to my room. It's a joys of working from home. Yes. Okay. Yes. And so the second part of your question on the average return, again, we're still very early stages in ZO in 24 markets. And so we're not adjusting our guardrails of the plus or minus 200 basis points. We still believe that we've got a lot of testing and iteration to do across a lot of areas. We are very excited as we start up operations again with opportunities to improve our cost structure. But for right now, the plus or minus 200 basis points are still the guardrails we have in place as we test and iterate. I will call out that given our pause and our restart we do expect some increased volatility near term in these metrics as we refill our factory across all 24 markets. And this is going to be driven by what would have been a normal operating cycle curve and a normal distribution of aged inventory when we were in normal operations, is going to be skewed a little bit to older inventory as the pause, works its way through our factory. And then the newer inventory comes in, and we expect end of 2020 to early 2021 to be back on a normal operating cycle. So there will be a little volatility there, but we're really excited to get going and be buying from our customers again and providing the service. He was there. The mute problem, yes. Yes. I'll take the first bit. So, Brian, I think that we spoke about the Better Together as one of the many action items that we took late in Q1 to manage our business, and we're really excited we did. We think those, along with other actions, help retain our partners and respond. So we were able to respond when the industry came back faster than expected, is the right thing to do. And we're seeing the benefits in record sales, high retention, higher connections and improved customer satisfaction. With respect to how I would look at the business, I think the best way for you guys to think about the business is I would guide you towards our Q3 outlook for PA with a guide range on revenue of 272 to 282. That's year-over-year growth of about 15% at the midpoint. That is the best barometer of where we kind of feel the business is going into the quarter. The discounts were very heavily weighted to early in the quarter. And so a number over the quarter doesn't really help you too much. So I look to our Q3 guide, there are no discounts implied in that range as kind of where we are trending coming out of Q2 into Q3 and onward. Yes. So this is title and escrow. And yes, we reported $436 million in Q2. We had $761 million. It's so not -- just everyone knows in other revenue within our Homes segment. And what this really is, is more of a play on integrated transaction. I believe it's about 100 basis points is what we're talking about, and it saves us on cost when we use VCS services, our own internal services and a transaction that we're closing with ZO. And then there are other times where we're able to use that for non-ZO transactions, but more like 100 basis points, so you may be a little high on your number for the escrow services that we're providing now, but we believe we can scale that. We're open in all 24 markets. We were not open throughout the entire year in all 24 markets, but we're really excited how quickly this team has kind of built up and supporting our customers. But again, what we really like is in partnering with our actual Zillow Offers business, these two services can make the transaction painless fast, and it's actually a cost structure reduction for us when we do ourselves versus pay a third party. Does that answer your question? Yes. So again, we talked about our pause in marketing for Q2. We announced that even prior to our Q2 guidance. It was incorporated in our Q2 guidance. We are starting to at least sequentially in Q3 look for opportunities where it makes sense to support our brand and to increase spending. We continue to support both Trulia and Zillow, but our priority is on the Zillow brand. And what I'd say is that, we'll continue to look, access, monitor, measure and adjust the spend as appropriate to support our brand and to continue to support growth. But the guide of Q3 incorporates a sequential increase but still providing year-over-year leverage, and that's coming both on the Trulia brand and the Zillow brand. Yes. So on -- we call it partner leads. But on partner leads, what I'd say is that Zillow Offers buying pause was an opportunity for us to look at and refine our partner lead generation channel. We're continuing to enhance our processes to better support our customers. We're providing them with multiple options now early in the pipeline, whether they want to sell to ZO or sell traditionally through with our PA partners. So we're very excited. It's still very early. We're seeing some positive trends, but we're still iterating, and we're excited about the opportunity here."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Berning, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nBrad Berning: Thank you, Cheryl. Good afternoon and welcome to Zillow Group\u2019s first quarter 2020 conference call. Joining me today to discuss our Q1 results are Zillow Group\u2019s Co-Founder and CEO, Rich Barton and CFO, Allen Parker. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements about our future performance and operating plans based on current expectations and assumptions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and we encourage you to consider the risk factors described in our SEC filings for additional information. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events, except as required by law. This call is being broadcast on the Internet and is accessible in our Investor Relations website. A recording of the call will be available later today. During the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, which we refer to as EBITDA. We encourage you to read our shareholder letter and our earnings release, which can be found on our Investor Relations website as they contain important information about our GAAP and non-GAAP results, including reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, please note we refer to our internet, media and technology segment as our IMT segment. We will open the call with brief remarks followed by live Q&A. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich.\nRich Barton: Thanks Brad. Hi, everyone. I wonder if this is starting to feel familiar to you too. Brad, Allen and I are once again broadcasting from our homes, where we are based for the foreseeable future along with thousands of Zillow Group employees and continuing work on our mission to give people the power to unlock life\u2019s next chapter. Although what we see physically day-to-day, it\u2019s pretty static and repetitive, we are all navigating a world in flux. According to MIT, about half the U. S. workforce is now working from home and they are not just working from home, they are teaching their kids, eating each meal, conducting their social lives all from home. Whether they are dreaming about an extra room for an office, a bigger yard, a less dense neighborhood, or for many of you maybe, a new second home, there is evidence that the experiences uncorked new aspirations and hopes of what home can be and needs to be. With each passing day, it becomes clear that we are not going back to the way things work. Collectively, we are turning the page. The past 2 months have been marked by health and economic of people across the globe amid the jolting stories of lives, jobs and businesses lost, we are grateful to be able to share not just strong Q1 results, but evidence of the housing market\u2019s resilience and an encouraging readiness, perhaps pent-up restlessness among people who are shopping on Zillow. When we talked last on our pop-up call on March 23, we had seen visits to Zillow fall nearly 20% from the prior year. Since then there has been a full rebound and shopping activity on Zillow Group has returned to double-digit year-over-year growth, along with an upswing in requests for our customers to connect with the Zillow partner agent at rates exceeding mid-March levels. From a balance sheet perspective, the foundation we laid in the last year put us on a really solid ground, then our swift actions to temporarily pause Zillow Offers home buying and reduce expenses by cutting marketing spend, discretionary spend and pausing most hiring helped us preserve and build cash. During our last call, we reviewed our mid-quarter balance sheet with you. It has strengthened since that call with $2.6 billion in cash and investments at the end of Q1. January and February were very strong months across all our businesses and we are a great counterbalance to the pullback we experienced in March. In all, the first quarter delivered strong results as we met or beat our outlook delivering record results across many measures, thanks to both strong execution and expense management. Our return to underlying double-digit IMT segment revenue growth and significant EBITDA margin expansion underscores the strength of our core business. In Premier Agent, we have found meaningful success with our strategy of connecting more and higher-intent customers with our high-performing agents, which was illustrated by record performance in January and February. When our partners were most fearful in March, the hashtag better together discounts, better together as one of our core values, plus the hashtag, these discounts we provided to our Premier Agents helped these small business operators and buoyed retention rates through the most uncertain and volatile period. Without being na\u00efve, I will say that better together showed our partners how much they mean to us and that they appreciate it. This will pay dividends. We continue to sharpen our skills in Zillow Offers and we demonstrated significant progress this quarter bought by applying early learnings and getting smarter. Our sales velocity broke records in February and March even as we adapted operations to comply with social distancing requirements. We did this without sacrificing unit economics as we continue to operate within the guideposts we set. We deliberately reduced our inventory through continued execution of buyer contracts ending the first quarter with about 1,800 homes in inventory, a decrease of 1,000 homes from the end of 2019. Our decision in March to pause home acquisition for Zillow Offers was due to concerns about our ability to safely and legally conduct acquisition activities, which Fed concerns of a market halt. While in crisis mode, we were very focused on inventory reduction to reduce enterprise risk. Inventory reduction is no longer our goal. We are actively planning to unfreeze Zillow Offers home buying. Internally, we call this Project [indiscernible] although our time present in the carbonite will be shorter than [indiscernible] was. We expect to begin home buying within the next few weeks. There are number of factors we are considering that will influence the timing of the impasse, including one, the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners; two, local orders and public health concerns; three, local housing market sectors; and four, confidence in our ability to price and transact. Stay tuned. During our last update, I walked through a severe stress test scenario for our business that demonstrated our ability to make it through a sustained market freeze. The lens we were paring through was foggy at the time, but the fog is cleared to a large extent. We still don\u2019t have perfect visibility, but the inputs are improving. The real estate market is predominantly open. And it\u2019s clear that we have passed peak here. In our Q4 report in February, we talked about key priorities for the year that focused on executing growth and scaling our business. While we plan to return to these, we have adjusted our priorities for the age of COVID. These are: one, protect the enterprise, including protecting the health and safety of our people customers and partners; two, reduce costs; three, accelerate technology to deliver seamless and now more virtual real estate shopping and transaction experiences faster to the future as our team likes to say; four, enhance our relative competitive position to lead the industry to real estate to point out. Overall, I\u2019d say we feel very good about where we are and the key advantages that give us the flexibility and solid footing to be both bold and nimble. One piece of evidence is Zillow Group\u2019s agility is the adaptability with which our team responded to working from homes starting March 10. We have recently announced most employees will have the option to continue working remotely through at least the end of the year. We did this in order to give our employees the visibility and flexibility to make important life decisions like did I renew my lease in the city or move closer to my family without fear of losing their jobs. That and we have been impressed by how productive people have been given the circumstances. Our valuable people have been truly appreciative of this flexibility and this policy sets us up well to potentially take advantage of a whole new way to work post-COVID. Turning to the future, we feel pretty darn good. We have seen all our metrics bounce off the bottom. Some metrics at the top of the funnel exhibits have more fully recovered and are up more than fully recovered \u2013 and are up double-digit percentages year-over-year indicating to us even higher demand to move or at least fantasize about moving than before. The bottom of the funnel metrics took a bigger hit, but we are pleased to have largely maintained our Premier Agent monthly recurring revenue pace. We are lucky that it\u2019s possible to shop for homes and close transactions without much human contact. That said, we are still watching antiquated processes like in-person appraisals, filings and closings cause unnecessary friction in real estate during this crucial time. If interested, check out my tweet from this morning showing Dawn Lyon, our Corporate Relations Chief, signing her refi paperwork this past weekend with a ballpoint pen and ink stamping thumb prints, why? Time for a change. Our proprietary 3D tours and floor plans appointment based virtual tours, physical self-tours, e-signings and remote closings are providing necessary solutions for social distancing today. Adoption is accelerating. Agents used Zillow\u2019s proprietary tech to create 525% more 3D home tours in April than in February. As customers embrace this new normal for virtual shopping and selling we can allow agents to focus their manual high-touch services on high intent qualified buyers who have already looked around, narrowed the field and are ready to make an offer. I just heard a great story of this coming to life from our Premier Agent, Chris Spiker, a member of our agent advisory board who said his team recently helped a Washington DC area buyer who is facing the end of her lease, but works night at the ICU at Walter Reed Medical Center. It is an extremely heart-wrenching busy and dangerous time for this buyer to be at work, but our partner agent was able to use virtual tours and showings to help her narrow her choices on her schedule to when under contract last weekend on a new home near the hospital with a backyard fire pit that will give her a place to wind down after her shift. Another great example of how this is unfolding before our eyes is our recent Zillow Offers customers Estevan and Stacy Garza who shopped for 2 years before they found their dream home at Zillow Offers owned home outside of Phoenix last month. The timing intersected with stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements and the Garza said that sale would not have happened without the flexibility and piece of mind that came with buying a non-owner occupied home from Zillow, which allowed the inspector and appraiser to easily do their jobs. Now, Estevan said they can take a deep breath and enjoy their beautiful new home. The virtual tools home shoppers need for safety today, will become their expectations for convenience tomorrow. Our focus now is not just on managing our way through this crisis we are also moving faster to the future. Our vision of Zillow 2.0 is becoming a reality even sooner than we have had planned. Like we discussed with you during our pop-up successfully navigating storms requires the ability to know when to pullback and tap the breaks and when to hit the accelerator. We are beginning to see our passing lane. Make no mistake we are clear-eyed about the public health and economic crisis on the ground and are doing what\u2019s right to actively support our employees, partners and communities and we are mindful of how important it is for the company to have extra buffer for the uncertain future, but we are also not blind to the opportunities being unlocked to accelerate a new era for real estate. We are not alone in this endeavour. We are leaning into lead, working closely with our partners and industry leaders to move the entire category forward and ensure that no matter what happens in our world we can assure our customers that real estate is always on to help them move safely into life\u2019s next chapter. We are ready. Our customers are ready. Time is now. Thank you for your partnership and support of us in these unique times. I will now turn over the call to Allen to walk you through Q1 results and Q2 outlook and then we will take your questions.\nAllen Parker: Thank you, Rich. I am going to summarize the few key financial results from the first quarter before discussing our outlook for Q2. Overall, we are pleased with our Q1 results as we met or exceeded our revenue and EBITDA outlook both in total and for each of our segments despite headwinds in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. We reported Q1 consolidated revenue of $1.1 billion, up 148% year-over-year. The outperformance in revenue was due primarily to strong sales execution in our home segment. Our enhanced resell strategy accelerated home sales to the highest velocity realized in our Zillow Offers business since inception and did so without sacrificing unit economics. Our consolidated EBITDA outperformance was driven by stronger than expected leverage from operational rigor in all three of our segments. It was great to see IMT segment revenue, including our Premier Agent revenue return to double-digit year-over-year growth in Q1 while substantially expanding IMT segment EBITDA margin. We accelerated revenue growth for the IMT segment and for Premier Agent revenue from 6% year-over-year growth in Q4 to 11% year-over-year growth in Q1. IMT segment revenue was $331 million in the first quarter at the high end of our outlook even with the impact from discount provided to our partners. We estimate that a delayed revenue headwind from the previously announced flex testing reduce our Premier Agent Q1 year-over-year revenue growth rate by approximately 460 basis points. IMT EBITDA margin expanded more than expected improving by 540 basis points year-over-year, which includes approximately 160 basis points of net benefit from unplanned costs and revenue actions in response to the coronavirus outbreak. It\u2019s also important to note that this quarter faced a 290 basis point headwind from favorable one-time benefits in Q1 2019 EBITDA margin. The underlying inputs that we see in our IMT businesses give us confidence that when we exit this current period of economic uncertainty, we are well positioned to come out competitively stronger. Homes segment revenue increased $641 million year-over-year to $770 million exceeding our outlook. Average return on homes sold before interest expense was a profit of $140 per home or 4 basis points as a percentage of revenue. This is up from a loss of 48 basis points in Q4 2019 and within our expected range of plus or minus 200 basis point guardrails we have provided. As we have said in the past, we expect unit economics to fluctuate within this target range and we are pleased with our Q1 results, especially in light of the circumstances. Home segment EBITDA loss of $75 million was also better than our outlook as both gross profit and operating costs were better than expected. We continue to make progress on building out our mortgages segment. Despite unprecedented volatility in interest rates that pressured our margins on the resale of mortgage loans, our experienced mortgages team delivered better than expected EBITDA due to nimble product and operational focus. As we have stated on previous earnings calls, my focus as CFO continues to be establishing processes and mechanisms in support of three key priorities. Those priorities are: scaling our new businesses, executing within our IMT segment in order to fund investments in the new segments, along with additional growth opportunities, and implementing focused cost discipline and operational rigor across the company as we scale. During this uncertain time, the team and I also focused on liquidity preservation to protect the enterprise and ensure we are well positioned to execute on opportunities to lead the industry to Real Estate 2.0. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and investments, the highest balances in our history, up from $2.4 billion at the end of December. I am pleased with how we have executed on these priorities in Q1. While we did not plan for a global pandemic, our strategic position, operational rigor during 2019 and strong balance sheet put us in a solid position to successfully and flexibly navigate the current period of economic uncertainty. Before moving to Q2 outlook, I would like to update you on the severe stress test that we discussed on our March 23 pop-up investor call. We have updated our severe test modeling using the same framework, which is assuming 75% reduction in pre-coronavirus revenue levels for IMT and mortgages segments and having to repurchase most of the homes inventory with cash from our balance sheet. Under this scenario, we expect that we would end the year with $1.7 billion in cash and investments, up from the $1.35 billion previously discussed on our March 23 call to primarily to us continued strong results since the start of Q2 and continued selling of inventories since our March 23 call. That said such a severe scenario seems increasingly unlikely given the favorable demand indicators we've seen over just the past 5 weeks. Next, I would like to provide some additional thoughts about our Q2 outlook and what our inputs indicate as are likely trajectory hailing into Q3 in the absence of providing full year guidance as we have indicated during our late March investor call we would be providing quarterly guidance only for the time being due to the uncertainty of the current operating environment we expect for mere agent revenue to decline temporarily in the second quarter to between a $165 million to a $175 million primarily due to the discounts we provided to our premier agent partners. As Rich mentioned, the strong rebound in site traffic and agent connections we experienced in April and continue to see thus far in May have alleviated much of a pressure on issuing discounts. We have not yet determined what discounts if any we will provide in late May for the following month, but we have assumed some discount levels in our outlook into June. We also expect other revenue within our IMT segment to be down sequentially. Despite strong results in our rentals business, outside of New York, our StreetEasy brand is experiencing declining revenue due to the shelter-in-place orders. We are also seeing some pressures in some of the shorter term advertising related products for display and new construction. We do expect these to recover as health conditions improve and shelter-in-place orders begin to lift in light of the temporary revenue decline and inclusive of costs actions we described. We expect IMT segment EBITDA for the second quarter to be in the range of $20 million to $30 million improving throughout each month during the quarter. In the home segment, we expect total revenue to decline sequentially in light of the lower inventory balance going into the quarter we expect home segment revenue to be between $325 million and $350 million for the quarter we expect home segment EBITDA to be between a loss of $70 million and $80 million as un-pause Zillow Offers home acquisitions. However we do not expect Q2 results to be materially impacted by this un-pausing. With regard to our mortgages segment, we expect revenue to be between $17 million and $20 million and EBITDA to be within a loss of $12 million and $9 million. The sequential decline from Q1 reflects current conditions in our marketplace businesses as there is less demand for lower credit score leads due to tight underwriting in the financial sector. Overall, Zillow is on strong footing today. Despite the unexpectedly complex and rapidly changing environment around us, our balance sheet is strong. Our demand indicators have largely recovered from the recent lows in our platform and partners are well positioned and ready to help our customers move safely into the next chapter of their lives. And with that operator, we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Ron Josey of JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question and glad to hear everyone again and really glad to see the rebounds as much as we are seeing. So great to see Rich I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the PA business and I am sure we will get more later in the color on the homes business but on PA. specifically and the new chart I think on page 11 of the letter talks basically goes through the monthly trends for Zillow Group visits MRR index and the revenue index with traffic rebounding as much as it is here from the lows in March I just want to understand a little bit more how why the revenue index perhaps isn't rising as fast as the traffic understood the better together discounts has an impact and there is more targeted discounts potentially coming but, but maybe you can help us just understand how you are thinking about the PA business and how recovers is traffic is that leading indicator. Thank you, Rich.\nRich Barton: Thanks Ron. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll throw that one over to over to Allen I think.\nAllen Parker: Yes thanks for the question Ron and Rich jump in if you need to. So first Ron we provided this chart to help we thought there was a need to provide a little more clarity as to our input trends that we are seeing through the period and the related impact on some of our business outputs . And not just a quarter point but throughout the period and what this chart kind of what it does reflect is a strong start into Q1 reflecting the momentum we had coming out of Q4 and the continued strength of all of those trends through January and February. But you can see there was a dislocation of our input metrics in mid-March and we took a quick action that we discussed that in our March 23 call and made a broad 50% better together discount to support our partner base and that allowed us to maintain much of our monthly recurring revenue base, which is what the intent was to work with our agents, but protect our base. And after the initial round of discounts and you see that flow-through revenue on a lag basis as those discounts work through. In the next period, while we were seeing some input trends improve, we also were seeing in some areas still some challenges, so we utilize a much more targeted market-based discount, which resulted in discounts coming in about half of the initial discount level that we made in the first part of the month and you see those flow-through the chart. As of today, as Rich mentioned, we are seeing a lot of our input levels back to pre-coronavirus levels. We continue to monitor these at local markets. So, while we have not determined yet what if any discounts, we will provide for June, our outlook does assume there is some continued level of discounts in the quarter and that\u2019s what reflects the revenue slowly coming back up. We believe in summary that this action and leveraging this tool with the discount allowed us to largely retain the majority of our MRR base that we came into the year with. And so we feel like we are really well positioned with our partners coming out of Q2.\nRon Josey: Very helpful. Thank you, Allen.\nOperator: Your next question is from John Campbell of Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Campbell: If you could just maybe talk a little bit.\nRich Barton: I no longer hear, Cheryl.\nJohn Campbell: Rich, are you there?\nRich Barton: This is Rich. Sure, sure.\nJohn Campbell: Rich, are you there? Yes, I can hear you guys. Rich, I would appreciate if you could maybe just talk to the competitive environment obviously is kind of managing on the slide, things have changed a lot, but how have things shifted in the market over there call it the last month or two?\nRich Barton: Yes, I mean it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s tough out there of course. And I guess I broadly say, well I guess I first say that coincident with the arrival of Allen Parker to the company, I don\u2019t know how long ago that was now Allen but 18 months, feels longer than that. We embarked \u2013 yes, we embarked on getting fit. Allen had Project Airstream and he is teaching the company how to get fit and so we were well on our way to being very fit coming into this crisis. But from a competitive advantage perspective, I really feel like this situation has enhanced our competitive position. We have the biggest brand and the biggest audience. And in these kinds of times, people tend to fallback on familiar and trusted and big brands. I think you are seeing that across industries right now. We have a really strong balance sheet, the strongest balance sheet in the industry which is also terrific to have in a situation like now. We have the best partners. We have the best products intact. We have the best services and all of these things make me feel good. Turning to the partner side, there are probably fewer choices on how to market themselves and how to generate customer demand, how to generate relationships and generate commissions. And so we maybe finding that they are focusing their marketing energies on Zillow and Zillow Group\u2019s brands. We are also advantaged, because we are seeing like in so many industries that you guys are looking at you are seeing really \u2013 you are seeing years of technology progress get accelerated down in a month. And as the leaders \u2013 as the tech leaders in this industry, we are in a position to lead and we are the beneficiaries of that. As I said in my script, I said something like today\u2019s necessity for this kind of distance shopping and buying is tomorrow\u2019s expectations, because of course, virtual buying rich media experiences, 3D floor plans, virtual touring, electronic trafficking of documents and signing of documents that's all exactly what people what people's expectations for a for a 2020 industry how it should operate but today's real estate industry has not been operating that way it's been operating as if it's been back in the 1960\u2019s or 1970\u2019s anyway because of all that we're in a really fantastic position to accelerate out of this period of uncertainty and as we've said we're seeing a lot of green signals lights that were red only two months ago are moving through yellow and beginning to flash green and so we're not out of the woods yet but we're moving with a lot more confidence.\nJohn Campbell: That\u2019s helpful. And a quick follow-up and Rich I agree with you. I think we are going to enter a new normal kind of coming out this pandemic on the spike of virtual tours like to me that that's not really a flash in the pan I think that sticks and it\u2019s going to be part of a new kind of process of buying homes if that's the case I am just curious in near term which you guys are seeing if that\u2019s helping drive connections to me if feels it's helping lead home buyers to an action or its bringing them a little further down the funnel and creating a better connection is are you guys seeing that do you expect that to continue if so?\nRich Barton: Yes we are seeing it. We are seeing more a more qualified buyers show up because of it and we're seeing interestingly I don't know what was our comment whatever we released on connections I mean connections are good. And the buyers are more qualified and yes it's just completely obvious that the industry has been really, really resistant to even the most basic media enhancements and the systems that run the business and we've been trying for years to get our partners and owners and sellers to use all of this technology that we've been working on for a long time but what they don't really need to they don't really need to and so adoption was not, not that fast now it's happening really, really quickly so we're not going back this is now people expectation.\nJohn Campbell: Great. Thank you, Rich.\nRich Barton: Yes, next?\nOperator: Your next question is from Maria Ripps of Canaccord. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMaria Ripps: Thanks for taking my question and I hope everyone is doing well. You shared a lot of interesting commentary about the housing market in the shareholder letter would love to hear your perspective in a little more detail on what you are seeing in the real estate market how you position grow relative to that and may be again how you are leveraging your tech capabilities to navigate this environment?\nRich Barton: Yes okay. Hi Maria. This is Rich. So I guess my first \u2013 my First comment part of the answer would say that the real estate market that COVID waded into in a very uninvited and rude way was a strong one okay so we went the industry went into this in good shape and strong. back when we were having peak steer around the end of March middle to the end of March we didn't know if the market would continue to function properly because of safety concerns or legal concern that we thought that the market might close we and every and everybody else and it's very clear from the data we're reporting now and the data you are getting from other sources that the market is open okay it's not where it was exactly shopping is more than where it was but transactions are not quite where they were they were recovering on kind on kind of a check mark in a check mark pattern as you can see from that exhibit in the shareholder letter but the market is open. so top of funnel rebound bottom of funnel little bit slower so as I said we are fortunate to be in a business I mean we're not like a restaurant or a shopping mall shopping in transactions can happen with a lot of human contact in real estate and people are figuring that out and even as future if and as future waves of COVID hits we are now putting all of the procedures the kind of clean mask distance all of the stock that we need to do to get in place to allow shoppers to shop safely and to transact safely. Interestingly mortgage rates are really low. Right now for those who can qualify and that\u2019s encouraging for the industry but new listings are down which means inventory is low for those shopping so if you pair this kind of low inventory with high demand. I heard said internally, there are lots of fish biting, but just not a lot of bait in the water. We have got to figure out \u2013 so prices have stayed up. Supply and demand has had prices stay relatively level and we are \u2013 and our e-com team is not forecasting that prices come down that much. Our challenge now will be to educate the industry and educate sellers on the fact that it is actually pretty interesting time to throw some bait in the water if you want. If you want to move the markets there, demand is there and so we are working on how to educate people as to that and as well the whole industry is. Anyway, I hope that helps. We have a very talented and e-com team that has published a lot of stuff that I think we referred to in the letter that you can dig through on your own. So, thanks Maria.\nMaria Ripps: Appreciate the color. Thank you, Rich.\nOperator: Your next question is from Lauren Cassel [ph] of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrian Nowak: Hey, it\u2019s Brian on for Lauren. Thanks. Just had two questions for you, Rich, I guess, the first one maybe sort of talk to us about how post-COVID, post-downturn, how do you think about any real structural changes in the real estate industry that you see developing and talk about the investment sides that you need to make Zillow to really capitalize and drive those? And then secondly, where is your head on the timing to rollout Flex into more markets as the economy kind of starts to light up in the back half?\nRich Barton: Hey, Brian. Yes, post-COVID like yes, we have been chatting about that before. This is not going \u2013 we are not going to bounce back to the way things were done before. We are seeing all kinds of systems, processes, business models, players change right now. And there are going to be a bunch of sad stories there, but there are going to be a bunch of happy progress for our consumers and for the industry as a result. A lot of the technology that I have already been talking about this kind of Real Estate 2.0, a modern platform for virtual shopping and digital closing. That\u2019s all \u2013 it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s really rapidly progressing right now and that\u2019s not going to go back either. I think as an interesting one that is kind of a question right now, I think we all kind of feel a lot of pent-up demand to move, that maybe too simpler away to put it. We are all rethinking how we live, where we live, the structure of where we live. I am right now in my bedroom, because I have three kids on Zoom school right now at all over the house. I don\u2019t have an office in my house. My dad had an office when I was growing up. I never saw the need for an office. While I see the need now, all of a sudden I have the need. There are people certainly don\u2019t live in the city anymore. They may want to live somewhere else. I do think we are going to see a lot of companies, including Zillow get a lot more permissive in accepting and embracing of people who might want to work from anywhere and also all of these factors plus economic turmoil will dislocate people too, but all of these factors are leading to what I am thinking of is this great reshuffling. We are all going to a whole bunch of us who are able to force to or have the means to, are going to reshuffle where and the way we live our lives as a result of it. So, this is a major thing. At least, we view this as a major thing and this part of it at least is leading me to believe that we are going to see the great un-sticking of the housing market. The housing market has been stuck since the global financial crisis in this weird artificially low volume liquidity state and it just feels to me like this is going to be the thing that gets it unstuck.\nBrian Nowak: Got it, great. And then\u2026\nRich Barton: Yes, it was so long ago that I was talking for so long that I almost successfully dodged to Flex \u2013 the Flex question. We don\u2019t have any \u2013 we don\u2019t have any \u2013 we are really glad like we like we are so happy, we have Flex in our quiver. We are so happy that we have that as a weapon right now and a tool, because as you might imagine, pay later might be pretty attractive in a time when commissioning comes down for our partners. And so we are \u2013 we are really excited we have that in our quiver. We don\u2019t have anything new to report. We are methodically testing with a few additional kind of high-performing partners this quarter as we \u2013 just like we have previously announced. Regardless of business model, what we are doing, what we are trying to do is create a better customer satisfaction experience for our customers, more money for our partners with better partners and higher revenue and profit per lead and we are looking at this as kind of an optimization problem at this \u2013 I don\u2019t know problem, optimization opportunity at this point and working with different model \u2013 different business models to achieve those goals is what we are \u2013 is what we are focused on.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks, Rich.\nRich Barton: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question is from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nHeath Terry: Hey, thank you. Just you think a little bit into the flex side of things further. I guess one, and realized that this obviously has disrupted any chance of sort of having understandable metrics or trends or anything in any part of the business, but just any update on sort of what you are or maybe were seeing or it\u2019s probably just sort of how conversion rates or your feeling about the impact that, that businesses is having on customer satisfaction, agent close rates, agent ROIs would be helpful, understanding that it\u2019s all sort of taken within the context that we are in a very different world at the moment and probably will be for a while. And then I guess to follow-up a bit on that question about flex timing, given this disruption that we are in right now, any reason not to use this disruption to accelerate the timing on rolling out flex, is it \u2013 is there an almost what do you have to lose kind of component to just going ahead since you know that, that seems to be where you want to go that maybe now and might not be such a bad time to just go ahead and get there given everything else is already is disrupted as it is?\nRich Barton: It\u2019s the air cover. You have got air cover.\nHeath Terry: Right.\nRich Barton: Maybe Allen you want to take the first one? Yes, sure.\nAllen Parker: I was just going to try to get some color. We even called out the impact on Q1. So I guess I would say right now, flex is going about as expected. We had planned \u2013 we have called out a 400 basis point impact in Q1 on our call in February. That was actually about a 430 basis points to be rounded. The actual number came in a little over 460. So flex is going about as we expected. What I would say is that we are finding as we work through this and it\u2019s not just a flip a switch and let it go, it\u2019s a process, it\u2019s working with our best partners to put mechanisms and operational rigor in place to allow them to scale and grow. So, it\u2019s not something you can just flip and expect to serve the customer better and so that is why we are being a little more methodical as we test. So, we are looking at opportunities to work with our best partners. As Rich mentioned, we are continuing to expand the program and expect to continue still into Q2. But it\u2019s just not something we can flip. So, I don\u2019t know if you want to any more color? So I think we are finding and it does work, but there are things we are learning that make it work better and that\u2019s why we are continually refining it before just flipping a switch.\nRich Barton: Yes. And Heath, as you might imagine, it\u2019s a little harder to measure. We are doing all kinds of testing to figure out how and where it\u2019s working how it\u2019s better for us, from a revenue and profit per lead perspective and how it\u2019s better for our partners and customer satisfaction. And that equation is \u2013 as transactions plummeted during kind of peak fear, it kind of throws a little bit of a monkey rent in our measurement devices on that. And so you know what\u2019s great is that we are working to focus and where we are moving more quickly in using this time to move more quickly is focusing our lead flow, our customer flow, those partners that are best able to give good service and convert and we're taking this time to really build out those predominately teams of people in various cities to make that happen and we're really encouraged I'm really encouraged by what I'm hearing coming out of the. Coming out of the PA group they're super energized right now. \nHeath Terry: Right. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Your next question is from Naved Khan of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNaved Khan: Thanks a lot. I just wanted to understand the dynamics between MBP and the fact that you are now doing some discounting in Q2 just wanted to understand once you let the MBP decide what the advertising is going to be what the rates are going to be maybe in Q3 is it possible for you to have the recurring rates kind of come back to one in on below the one index that you are showing on the chart?\nAllen Parker: Yes, so I will take this. Thanks for the question. So again, we were providing guidance just for the quarter however and we put that chart in place to kind of show the relationship between the input metrics and this discount so as we moved to be honest from the first decision point at the end of March when we saw this location who are our inputs starting to come back this targeted market approach is actually moving our MBP back more and more to MBP as we go and so we expect. If these trends were to continue that we would be closer and closer to where we started the quarter if our inputs reflect that there is a lot of uncertainty and again we saw the we think we hit the quarter we're seeing the positives but our modeling would suggest that if we continue to see these input trends our discounting would become less and less and eventually to a very minimal amount our outlook as I mentioned did provide for some additional discount in the later part of the quarter but less so than even in the second round that was more targeted. If that helps?\nNaved Khan: Got it. And maybe one follow-up question for Rich it looks like we are able to use some machine-learning techniques for selling the inventory you had on the iBuyer side, can you just maybe give us some more color on what are these techniques and how much of help they are?\nRich Barton: Sorry I was muted. I mean it\u2019s just the machines getting smarter. This business is still big and old but this business is actually small and young for us and we have just gotten a whole lot better. How to figure out what to buy where to buy and how to re habit how to price it how to price drop it and all of this is informed by data and as demonstrated by the outputs of our sales velocity on ZO it's definitely working, working way better honestly than we anticipated at the beginning of the crisis we were quite worried we would not we were just worried we were wondering whether or not we would be able to move a bunch of that inventory and I'm being really impressed we were already on that trend we were already speeding sales faster than we were acquiring inventory and so that trend has continued I've been really impressed with that it's time for us to stop celebrating declining inventory numbers. However it\u2019s time for us to get back to business the offers and get Han solo out of that out of that carbonite. So we are excited about turning on the acquisition side too.\nNaved Khan: Got it. Would it be fair to say then maybe there was some kind of a step change in this the improvements that you derived may be in Q1 that helped you speed up the velocity or would that be a stretch?\nRich Barton: I think that\u2019s a stretch. I mean the improvements, improvements with machine learning may be early days come in big steps and then afterwards come into lots of small increments and that's what we are seeing right now and even though the markets a little wonky we will continue to we expect to continue to see that.\nNaved Khan: Thank you, Rich. Thank you, Allen.\nOperator: Your next question is from Edward Yruma of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nEdward Yruma: On the homes business, there is a little bit of competitiveness, but I think you guys said about 3 weeks from now, you will restart, what will the cash implications in that be as you re-ramp and kind of give us an idea of what gates you are going to use to evaluate kind of the re-ramp? And then second you indicated you are going to do some tactical discounts going forward in the PA business, I guess any kind of idea as to how much discounts will be and kind of what criteria you will use per market to determine what the discount should be? Thanks so much.\nAllen Parker: Okay, I will take the first one and then I want to make sure I understand the second one, but the un-pause of Zillow, again I do want to reiterate, we continue to believe in the thesis at Zillow Offers in that business model. And as Rich has discussed today, thesis maybe even stronger and Real Estate 2.0 and our customer needs maybe a better value proposition, which is obviously a positive. So, our penetration maybe better. With respect to the capital needs of that business, we made the pause, we talked about the actions we took we can startup again without a significant incremental cash or cost increase getting back to the volumes and run-rate that we were at. And again, Rich mentioned, we are going to the plan on how exactly we will start that up and we expect to do that soon. We will continue as we always have to just asses our ability to fund either with equity for our portion of the houses, we will continue to leverage the asset-backed warehouse yields that we have for the homes. We are excited about the resale velocity that we have, which allows us to move homes through quicker if those trends continue. So, we will just continue to monitor it on a cost of capital and a ROI basis looking at a long-term investment in that business. But I don\u2019t expect it to significantly change, in fact, it will likely be less than the capital we have talked about coming into the year just given that we have had to pause and we have to ramp up again, if that helps. And then you had a question, I believe you said how we are thinking about MBP discounts?\nEdward Yruma: Yes. And just tying to really understand again the dynamics you are considering, some of your competitors are kind of continuing to step on the gas from a promotional perspective. So kind of what gives you confidence that a more tactical approach is what\u2019s warranted in this environment? Thank you.\nAllen Parker: Yes. So, I guess what I stated just from the data point of that win after our first adjustment or discount, which was \u2013 I call this sledgehammer, but it 50% across the board and again inputs were dislocating. As trends start to come back up and as we made a more targeted adjustment to our discount process in late April, we are continuing to see very good retention of all of our partners and the partners that we want. So that\u2019s the data point that says that we believe this tool is working that is showing we are in this with our partners for the long-term as well as it\u2019s working to retain our partners to ensure our customer are serviced. So right now, we believe it\u2019s a tool that will continue to work. We are well-positioned if you look at our traffic, our brand, our balance sheet, I think we are in a great position to continue to win. We will continue to serve customers with technology, which will drive traffic. And so I believe that the metric that we showed in our ability to go back to more of an MBP pricing when we are providing value to our customers is we own and again there is a lot of uncertainty out there, but we are happy where we are. We feel like we are in a really good position.\nEdward Yruma: Great. Thanks so much, guys.\nOperator: This completes the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Rich Barton for any closing remarks.\nRich Barton: Okay. So, this period has clarified just how essential it is for people to be able to shop for a home and move. Now, we more clearly see that people have an innate desire to move and that this period may even be a catalyst for many who change their address for a variety of reasons that we have talked about. Watching this unfold has given new meaning to our mission and the important role that Zillow was privileged to play in the lives of so many. So as my e-mail auto signature says, be calm, be safe and carry on. We will talk to you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rich Barton",
            "content": "Thanks Brad. Hi, everyone. I wonder if this is starting to feel familiar to you too. Brad, Allen and I are once again broadcasting from our homes, where we are based for the foreseeable future along with thousands of Zillow Group employees and continuing work on our mission to give people the power to unlock life's next chapter. Although what we see physically day-to-day, it's pretty static and repetitive, we are all navigating a world in flux. According to MIT, about half the U. S. workforce is now working from home and they are not just working from home, they are teaching their kids, eating each meal, conducting their social lives all from home. Whether they are dreaming about an extra room for an office, a bigger yard, a less dense neighborhood, or for many of you maybe, a new second home, there is evidence that the experiences uncorked new aspirations and hopes of what home can be and needs to be. With each passing day, it becomes clear that we are not going back to the way things work. Collectively, we are turning the page. The past 2 months have been marked by health and economic of people across the globe amid the jolting stories of lives, jobs and businesses lost, we are grateful to be able to share not just strong Q1 results, but evidence of the housing market's resilience and an encouraging readiness, perhaps pent-up restlessness among people who are shopping on Zillow. When we talked last on our pop-up call on March 23, we had seen visits to Zillow fall nearly 20% from the prior year. Since then there has been a full rebound and shopping activity on Zillow Group has returned to double-digit year-over-year growth, along with an upswing in requests for our customers to connect with the Zillow partner agent at rates exceeding mid-March levels. From a balance sheet perspective, the foundation we laid in the last year put us on a really solid ground, then our swift actions to temporarily pause Zillow Offers home buying and reduce expenses by cutting marketing spend, discretionary spend and pausing most hiring helped us preserve and build cash. During our last call, we reviewed our mid-quarter balance sheet with you. It has strengthened since that call with $2.6 billion in cash and investments at the end of Q1. January and February were very strong months across all our businesses and we are a great counterbalance to the pullback we experienced in March. In all, the first quarter delivered strong results as we met or beat our outlook delivering record results across many measures, thanks to both strong execution and expense management. Our return to underlying double-digit IMT segment revenue growth and significant EBITDA margin expansion underscores the strength of our core business. In Premier Agent, we have found meaningful success with our strategy of connecting more and higher-intent customers with our high-performing agents, which was illustrated by record performance in January and February. When our partners were most fearful in March, the hashtag better together discounts, better together as one of our core values, plus the hashtag, these discounts we provided to our Premier Agents helped these small business operators and buoyed retention rates through the most uncertain and volatile period. Without being nai\u0308ve, I will say that better together showed our partners how much they mean to us and that they appreciate it. This will pay dividends. We continue to sharpen our skills in Zillow Offers and we demonstrated significant progress this quarter bought by applying early learnings and getting smarter. Our sales velocity broke records in February and March even as we adapted operations to comply with social distancing requirements. We did this without sacrificing unit economics as we continue to operate within the guideposts we set. We deliberately reduced our inventory through continued execution of buyer contracts ending the first quarter with about 1,800 homes in inventory, a decrease of 1,000 homes from the end of 2019. Our decision in March to pause home acquisition for Zillow Offers was due to concerns about our ability to safely and legally conduct acquisition activities, which Fed concerns of a market halt. While in crisis mode, we were very focused on inventory reduction to reduce enterprise risk. Inventory reduction is no longer our goal. We are actively planning to unfreeze Zillow Offers home buying. Internally, we call this Project [indiscernible] although our time present in the carbonite will be shorter than [indiscernible] was. We expect to begin home buying within the next few weeks. There are number of factors we are considering that will influence the timing of the impasse, including one, the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners; two, local orders and public health concerns; three, local housing market sectors; and four, confidence in our ability to price and transact. Stay tuned. During our last update, I walked through a severe stress test scenario for our business that demonstrated our ability to make it through a sustained market freeze. The lens we were paring through was foggy at the time, but the fog is cleared to a large extent. We still don't have perfect visibility, but the inputs are improving. The real estate market is predominantly open. And it's clear that we have passed peak here. In our Q4 report in February, we talked about key priorities for the year that focused on executing growth and scaling our business. While we plan to return to these, we have adjusted our priorities for the age of COVID. These are: one, protect the enterprise, including protecting the health and safety of our people customers and partners; two, reduce costs; three, accelerate technology to deliver seamless and now more virtual real estate shopping and transaction experiences faster to the future as our team likes to say; four, enhance our relative competitive position to lead the industry to real estate to point out. Overall, I'd say we feel very good about where we are and the key advantages that give us the flexibility and solid footing to be both bold and nimble. One piece of evidence is Zillow Group's agility is the adaptability with which our team responded to working from homes starting March 10. We have recently announced most employees will have the option to continue working remotely through at least the end of the year. We did this in order to give our employees the visibility and flexibility to make important life decisions like did I renew my lease in the city or move closer to my family without fear of losing their jobs. That and we have been impressed by how productive people have been given the circumstances. Our valuable people have been truly appreciative of this flexibility and this policy sets us up well to potentially take advantage of a whole new way to work post-COVID. Turning to the future, we feel pretty darn good. We have seen all our metrics bounce off the bottom. Some metrics at the top of the funnel exhibits have more fully recovered and are up more than fully recovered \u2013 and are up double-digit percentages year-over-year indicating to us even higher demand to move or at least fantasize about moving than before. The bottom of the funnel metrics took a bigger hit, but we are pleased to have largely maintained our Premier Agent monthly recurring revenue pace. We are lucky that it's possible to shop for homes and close transactions without much human contact. That said, we are still watching antiquated processes like in-person appraisals, filings and closings cause unnecessary friction in real estate during this crucial time. If interested, check out my tweet from this morning showing Dawn Lyon, our Corporate Relations Chief, signing her refi paperwork this past weekend with a ballpoint pen and ink stamping thumb prints, why? Time for a change. Our proprietary 3D tours and floor plans appointment based virtual tours, physical self-tours, e-signings and remote closings are providing necessary solutions for social distancing today. Adoption is accelerating. Agents used Zillow's proprietary tech to create 525% more 3D home tours in April than in February. As customers embrace this new normal for virtual shopping and selling we can allow agents to focus their manual high-touch services on high intent qualified buyers who have already looked around, narrowed the field and are ready to make an offer. I just heard a great story of this coming to life from our Premier Agent, Chris Spiker, a member of our agent advisory board who said his team recently helped a Washington DC area buyer who is facing the end of her lease, but works night at the ICU at Walter Reed Medical Center. It is an extremely heart-wrenching busy and dangerous time for this buyer to be at work, but our partner agent was able to use virtual tours and showings to help her narrow her choices on her schedule to when under contract last weekend on a new home near the hospital with a backyard fire pit that will give her a place to wind down after her shift. Another great example of how this is unfolding before our eyes is our recent Zillow Offers customers Estevan and Stacy Garza who shopped for 2 years before they found their dream home at Zillow Offers owned home outside of Phoenix last month. The timing intersected with stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements and the Garza said that sale would not have happened without the flexibility and piece of mind that came with buying a non-owner occupied home from Zillow, which allowed the inspector and appraiser to easily do their jobs. Now, Estevan said they can take a deep breath and enjoy their beautiful new home. The virtual tools home shoppers need for safety today, will become their expectations for convenience tomorrow. Our focus now is not just on managing our way through this crisis we are also moving faster to the future. Our vision of Zillow 2.0 is becoming a reality even sooner than we have had planned. Like we discussed with you during our pop-up successfully navigating storms requires the ability to know when to pullback and tap the breaks and when to hit the accelerator. We are beginning to see our passing lane. Make no mistake we are clear-eyed about the public health and economic crisis on the ground and are doing what's right to actively support our employees, partners and communities and we are mindful of how important it is for the company to have extra buffer for the uncertain future, but we are also not blind to the opportunities being unlocked to accelerate a new era for real estate. We are not alone in this endeavour. We are leaning into lead, working closely with our partners and industry leaders to move the entire category forward and ensure that no matter what happens in our world we can assure our customers that real estate is always on to help them move safely into life's next chapter. We are ready. Our customers are ready. Time is now. Thank you for your partnership and support of us in these unique times. I will now turn over the call to Allen to walk you through Q1 results and Q2 outlook and then we will take your questions. Thanks Ron. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll throw that one over to over to Allen I think. I no longer hear, Cheryl. This is Rich. Sure, sure. Yes, I mean it's \u2013 it's tough out there of course. And I guess I broadly say, well I guess I first say that coincident with the arrival of Allen Parker to the company, I don't know how long ago that was now Allen but 18 months, feels longer than that. We embarked \u2013 yes, we embarked on getting fit. Allen had Project Airstream and he is teaching the company how to get fit and so we were well on our way to being very fit coming into this crisis. But from a competitive advantage perspective, I really feel like this situation has enhanced our competitive position. We have the biggest brand and the biggest audience. And in these kinds of times, people tend to fallback on familiar and trusted and big brands. I think you are seeing that across industries right now. We have a really strong balance sheet, the strongest balance sheet in the industry which is also terrific to have in a situation like now. We have the best partners. We have the best products intact. We have the best services and all of these things make me feel good. Turning to the partner side, there are probably fewer choices on how to market themselves and how to generate customer demand, how to generate relationships and generate commissions. And so we maybe finding that they are focusing their marketing energies on Zillow and Zillow Group's brands. We are also advantaged, because we are seeing like in so many industries that you guys are looking at you are seeing really \u2013 you are seeing years of technology progress get accelerated down in a month. And as the leaders \u2013 as the tech leaders in this industry, we are in a position to lead and we are the beneficiaries of that. As I said in my script, I said something like today's necessity for this kind of distance shopping and buying is tomorrow's expectations, because of course, virtual buying rich media experiences, 3D floor plans, virtual touring, electronic trafficking of documents and signing of documents that's all exactly what people what people's expectations for a for a 2020 industry how it should operate but today's real estate industry has not been operating that way it's been operating as if it's been back in the 1960's or 1970's anyway because of all that we're in a really fantastic position to accelerate out of this period of uncertainty and as we've said we're seeing a lot of green signals lights that were red only two months ago are moving through yellow and beginning to flash green and so we're not out of the woods yet but we're moving with a lot more confidence. Yes we are seeing it. We are seeing more a more qualified buyers show up because of it and we're seeing interestingly I don't know what was our comment whatever we released on connections I mean connections are good. And the buyers are more qualified and yes it's just completely obvious that the industry has been really, really resistant to even the most basic media enhancements and the systems that run the business and we've been trying for years to get our partners and owners and sellers to use all of this technology that we've been working on for a long time but what they don't really need to they don't really need to and so adoption was not, not that fast now it's happening really, really quickly so we're not going back this is now people expectation. Yes, next? Yes okay. Hi Maria. This is Rich. So I guess my first \u2013 my First comment part of the answer would say that the real estate market that COVID waded into in a very uninvited and rude way was a strong one okay so we went the industry went into this in good shape and strong. back when we were having peak steer around the end of March middle to the end of March we didn't know if the market would continue to function properly because of safety concerns or legal concern that we thought that the market might close we and every and everybody else and it's very clear from the data we're reporting now and the data you are getting from other sources that the market is open okay it's not where it was exactly shopping is more than where it was but transactions are not quite where they were they were recovering on kind on kind of a check mark in a check mark pattern as you can see from that exhibit in the shareholder letter but the market is open. so top of funnel rebound bottom of funnel little bit slower so as I said we are fortunate to be in a business I mean we're not like a restaurant or a shopping mall shopping in transactions can happen with a lot of human contact in real estate and people are figuring that out and even as future if and as future waves of COVID hits we are now putting all of the procedures the kind of clean mask distance all of the stock that we need to do to get in place to allow shoppers to shop safely and to transact safely. Interestingly mortgage rates are really low. Right now for those who can qualify and that's encouraging for the industry but new listings are down which means inventory is low for those shopping so if you pair this kind of low inventory with high demand. I heard said internally, there are lots of fish biting, but just not a lot of bait in the water. We have got to figure out \u2013 so prices have stayed up. Supply and demand has had prices stay relatively level and we are \u2013 and our e-com team is not forecasting that prices come down that much. Our challenge now will be to educate the industry and educate sellers on the fact that it is actually pretty interesting time to throw some bait in the water if you want. If you want to move the markets there, demand is there and so we are working on how to educate people as to that and as well the whole industry is. Anyway, I hope that helps. We have a very talented and e-com team that has published a lot of stuff that I think we referred to in the letter that you can dig through on your own. So, thanks Maria. Hey, Brian. Yes, post-COVID like yes, we have been chatting about that before. This is not going \u2013 we are not going to bounce back to the way things were done before. We are seeing all kinds of systems, processes, business models, players change right now. And there are going to be a bunch of sad stories there, but there are going to be a bunch of happy progress for our consumers and for the industry as a result. A lot of the technology that I have already been talking about this kind of Real Estate 2.0, a modern platform for virtual shopping and digital closing. That's all \u2013 it's just \u2013 it's really rapidly progressing right now and that's not going to go back either. I think as an interesting one that is kind of a question right now, I think we all kind of feel a lot of pent-up demand to move, that maybe too simpler away to put it. We are all rethinking how we live, where we live, the structure of where we live. I am right now in my bedroom, because I have three kids on Zoom school right now at all over the house. I don't have an office in my house. My dad had an office when I was growing up. I never saw the need for an office. While I see the need now, all of a sudden I have the need. There are people certainly don't live in the city anymore. They may want to live somewhere else. I do think we are going to see a lot of companies, including Zillow get a lot more permissive in accepting and embracing of people who might want to work from anywhere and also all of these factors plus economic turmoil will dislocate people too, but all of these factors are leading to what I am thinking of is this great reshuffling. We are all going to a whole bunch of us who are able to force to or have the means to, are going to reshuffle where and the way we live our lives as a result of it. So, this is a major thing. At least, we view this as a major thing and this part of it at least is leading me to believe that we are going to see the great un-sticking of the housing market. The housing market has been stuck since the global financial crisis in this weird artificially low volume liquidity state and it just feels to me like this is going to be the thing that gets it unstuck. Yes, it was so long ago that I was talking for so long that I almost successfully dodged to Flex \u2013 the Flex question. We don't have any \u2013 we don't have any \u2013 we are really glad like we like we are so happy, we have Flex in our quiver. We are so happy that we have that as a weapon right now and a tool, because as you might imagine, pay later might be pretty attractive in a time when commissioning comes down for our partners. And so we are \u2013 we are really excited we have that in our quiver. We don't have anything new to report. We are methodically testing with a few additional kind of high-performing partners this quarter as we \u2013 just like we have previously announced. Regardless of business model, what we are doing, what we are trying to do is create a better customer satisfaction experience for our customers, more money for our partners with better partners and higher revenue and profit per lead and we are looking at this as kind of an optimization problem at this \u2013 I don't know problem, optimization opportunity at this point and working with different model \u2013 different business models to achieve those goals is what we are \u2013 is what we are focused on. Yes. It's the air cover. You have got air cover. Maybe Allen you want to take the first one? Yes, sure. Yes. And Heath, as you might imagine, it's a little harder to measure. We are doing all kinds of testing to figure out how and where it's working how it's better for us, from a revenue and profit per lead perspective and how it's better for our partners and customer satisfaction. And that equation is \u2013 as transactions plummeted during kind of peak fear, it kind of throws a little bit of a monkey rent in our measurement devices on that. And so you know what's great is that we are working to focus and where we are moving more quickly in using this time to move more quickly is focusing our lead flow, our customer flow, those partners that are best able to give good service and convert and we're taking this time to really build out those predominately teams of people in various cities to make that happen and we're really encouraged I'm really encouraged by what I'm hearing coming out of the. Coming out of the PA group they're super energized right now. Sorry I was muted. I mean it's just the machines getting smarter. This business is still big and old but this business is actually small and young for us and we have just gotten a whole lot better. How to figure out what to buy where to buy and how to re habit how to price it how to price drop it and all of this is informed by data and as demonstrated by the outputs of our sales velocity on ZO it's definitely working, working way better honestly than we anticipated at the beginning of the crisis we were quite worried we would not we were just worried we were wondering whether or not we would be able to move a bunch of that inventory and I'm being really impressed we were already on that trend we were already speeding sales faster than we were acquiring inventory and so that trend has continued I've been really impressed with that it's time for us to stop celebrating declining inventory numbers. However it's time for us to get back to business the offers and get Han solo out of that out of that carbonite. So we are excited about turning on the acquisition side too. I think that's a stretch. I mean the improvements, improvements with machine learning may be early days come in big steps and then afterwards come into lots of small increments and that's what we are seeing right now and even though the markets a little wonky we will continue to we expect to continue to see that. Okay. So, this period has clarified just how essential it is for people to be able to shop for a home and move. Now, we more clearly see that people have an innate desire to move and that this period may even be a catalyst for many who change their address for a variety of reasons that we have talked about. Watching this unfold has given new meaning to our mission and the important role that Zillow was privileged to play in the lives of so many. So as my e-mail auto signature says, be calm, be safe and carry on. We will talk to you soon. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Rich. I am going to summarize the few key financial results from the first quarter before discussing our outlook for Q2. Overall, we are pleased with our Q1 results as we met or exceeded our revenue and EBITDA outlook both in total and for each of our segments despite headwinds in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. We reported Q1 consolidated revenue of $1.1 billion, up 148% year-over-year. The outperformance in revenue was due primarily to strong sales execution in our home segment. Our enhanced resell strategy accelerated home sales to the highest velocity realized in our Zillow Offers business since inception and did so without sacrificing unit economics. Our consolidated EBITDA outperformance was driven by stronger than expected leverage from operational rigor in all three of our segments. It was great to see IMT segment revenue, including our Premier Agent revenue return to double-digit year-over-year growth in Q1 while substantially expanding IMT segment EBITDA margin. We accelerated revenue growth for the IMT segment and for Premier Agent revenue from 6% year-over-year growth in Q4 to 11% year-over-year growth in Q1. IMT segment revenue was $331 million in the first quarter at the high end of our outlook even with the impact from discount provided to our partners. We estimate that a delayed revenue headwind from the previously announced flex testing reduce our Premier Agent Q1 year-over-year revenue growth rate by approximately 460 basis points. IMT EBITDA margin expanded more than expected improving by 540 basis points year-over-year, which includes approximately 160 basis points of net benefit from unplanned costs and revenue actions in response to the coronavirus outbreak. It's also important to note that this quarter faced a 290 basis point headwind from favorable one-time benefits in Q1 2019 EBITDA margin. The underlying inputs that we see in our IMT businesses give us confidence that when we exit this current period of economic uncertainty, we are well positioned to come out competitively stronger. Homes segment revenue increased $641 million year-over-year to $770 million exceeding our outlook. Average return on homes sold before interest expense was a profit of $140 per home or 4 basis points as a percentage of revenue. This is up from a loss of 48 basis points in Q4 2019 and within our expected range of plus or minus 200 basis point guardrails we have provided. As we have said in the past, we expect unit economics to fluctuate within this target range and we are pleased with our Q1 results, especially in light of the circumstances. Home segment EBITDA loss of $75 million was also better than our outlook as both gross profit and operating costs were better than expected. We continue to make progress on building out our mortgages segment. Despite unprecedented volatility in interest rates that pressured our margins on the resale of mortgage loans, our experienced mortgages team delivered better than expected EBITDA due to nimble product and operational focus. As we have stated on previous earnings calls, my focus as CFO continues to be establishing processes and mechanisms in support of three key priorities. Those priorities are: scaling our new businesses, executing within our IMT segment in order to fund investments in the new segments, along with additional growth opportunities, and implementing focused cost discipline and operational rigor across the company as we scale. During this uncertain time, the team and I also focused on liquidity preservation to protect the enterprise and ensure we are well positioned to execute on opportunities to lead the industry to Real Estate 2.0. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and investments, the highest balances in our history, up from $2.4 billion at the end of December. I am pleased with how we have executed on these priorities in Q1. While we did not plan for a global pandemic, our strategic position, operational rigor during 2019 and strong balance sheet put us in a solid position to successfully and flexibly navigate the current period of economic uncertainty. Before moving to Q2 outlook, I would like to update you on the severe stress test that we discussed on our March 23 pop-up investor call. We have updated our severe test modeling using the same framework, which is assuming 75% reduction in pre-coronavirus revenue levels for IMT and mortgages segments and having to repurchase most of the homes inventory with cash from our balance sheet. Under this scenario, we expect that we would end the year with $1.7 billion in cash and investments, up from the $1.35 billion previously discussed on our March 23 call to primarily to us continued strong results since the start of Q2 and continued selling of inventories since our March 23 call. That said such a severe scenario seems increasingly unlikely given the favorable demand indicators we've seen over just the past 5 weeks. Next, I would like to provide some additional thoughts about our Q2 outlook and what our inputs indicate as are likely trajectory hailing into Q3 in the absence of providing full year guidance as we have indicated during our late March investor call we would be providing quarterly guidance only for the time being due to the uncertainty of the current operating environment we expect for mere agent revenue to decline temporarily in the second quarter to between a $165 million to a $175 million primarily due to the discounts we provided to our premier agent partners. As Rich mentioned, the strong rebound in site traffic and agent connections we experienced in April and continue to see thus far in May have alleviated much of a pressure on issuing discounts. We have not yet determined what discounts if any we will provide in late May for the following month, but we have assumed some discount levels in our outlook into June. We also expect other revenue within our IMT segment to be down sequentially. Despite strong results in our rentals business, outside of New York, our StreetEasy brand is experiencing declining revenue due to the shelter-in-place orders. We are also seeing some pressures in some of the shorter term advertising related products for display and new construction. We do expect these to recover as health conditions improve and shelter-in-place orders begin to lift in light of the temporary revenue decline and inclusive of costs actions we described. We expect IMT segment EBITDA for the second quarter to be in the range of $20 million to $30 million improving throughout each month during the quarter. In the home segment, we expect total revenue to decline sequentially in light of the lower inventory balance going into the quarter we expect home segment revenue to be between $325 million and $350 million for the quarter we expect home segment EBITDA to be between a loss of $70 million and $80 million as un-pause Zillow Offers home acquisitions. However we do not expect Q2 results to be materially impacted by this un-pausing. With regard to our mortgages segment, we expect revenue to be between $17 million and $20 million and EBITDA to be within a loss of $12 million and $9 million. The sequential decline from Q1 reflects current conditions in our marketplace businesses as there is less demand for lower credit score leads due to tight underwriting in the financial sector. Overall, Zillow is on strong footing today. Despite the unexpectedly complex and rapidly changing environment around us, our balance sheet is strong. Our demand indicators have largely recovered from the recent lows in our platform and partners are well positioned and ready to help our customers move safely into the next chapter of their lives. And with that operator, we will open the line for questions. Yes thanks for the question Ron and Rich jump in if you need to. So first Ron we provided this chart to help we thought there was a need to provide a little more clarity as to our input trends that we are seeing through the period and the related impact on some of our business outputs . And not just a quarter point but throughout the period and what this chart kind of what it does reflect is a strong start into Q1 reflecting the momentum we had coming out of Q4 and the continued strength of all of those trends through January and February. But you can see there was a dislocation of our input metrics in mid-March and we took a quick action that we discussed that in our March 23 call and made a broad 50% better together discount to support our partner base and that allowed us to maintain much of our monthly recurring revenue base, which is what the intent was to work with our agents, but protect our base. And after the initial round of discounts and you see that flow-through revenue on a lag basis as those discounts work through. In the next period, while we were seeing some input trends improve, we also were seeing in some areas still some challenges, so we utilize a much more targeted market-based discount, which resulted in discounts coming in about half of the initial discount level that we made in the first part of the month and you see those flow-through the chart. As of today, as Rich mentioned, we are seeing a lot of our input levels back to pre-coronavirus levels. We continue to monitor these at local markets. So, while we have not determined yet what if any discounts, we will provide for June, our outlook does assume there is some continued level of discounts in the quarter and that's what reflects the revenue slowly coming back up. We believe in summary that this action and leveraging this tool with the discount allowed us to largely retain the majority of our MRR base that we came into the year with. And so we feel like we are really well positioned with our partners coming out of Q2. I was just going to try to get some color. We even called out the impact on Q1. So I guess I would say right now, flex is going about as expected. We had planned \u2013 we have called out a 400 basis point impact in Q1 on our call in February. That was actually about a 430 basis points to be rounded. The actual number came in a little over 460. So flex is going about as we expected. What I would say is that we are finding as we work through this and it's not just a flip a switch and let it go, it's a process, it's working with our best partners to put mechanisms and operational rigor in place to allow them to scale and grow. So, it's not something you can just flip and expect to serve the customer better and so that is why we are being a little more methodical as we test. So, we are looking at opportunities to work with our best partners. As Rich mentioned, we are continuing to expand the program and expect to continue still into Q2. But it's just not something we can flip. So, I don't know if you want to any more color? So I think we are finding and it does work, but there are things we are learning that make it work better and that's why we are continually refining it before just flipping a switch. Yes, so I will take this. Thanks for the question. So again, we were providing guidance just for the quarter however and we put that chart in place to kind of show the relationship between the input metrics and this discount so as we moved to be honest from the first decision point at the end of March when we saw this location who are our inputs starting to come back this targeted market approach is actually moving our MBP back more and more to MBP as we go and so we expect. If these trends were to continue that we would be closer and closer to where we started the quarter if our inputs reflect that there is a lot of uncertainty and again we saw the we think we hit the quarter we're seeing the positives but our modeling would suggest that if we continue to see these input trends our discounting would become less and less and eventually to a very minimal amount our outlook as I mentioned did provide for some additional discount in the later part of the quarter but less so than even in the second round that was more targeted. If that helps? Okay, I will take the first one and then I want to make sure I understand the second one, but the un-pause of Zillow, again I do want to reiterate, we continue to believe in the thesis at Zillow Offers in that business model. And as Rich has discussed today, thesis maybe even stronger and Real Estate 2.0 and our customer needs maybe a better value proposition, which is obviously a positive. So, our penetration maybe better. With respect to the capital needs of that business, we made the pause, we talked about the actions we took we can startup again without a significant incremental cash or cost increase getting back to the volumes and run-rate that we were at. And again, Rich mentioned, we are going to the plan on how exactly we will start that up and we expect to do that soon. We will continue as we always have to just asses our ability to fund either with equity for our portion of the houses, we will continue to leverage the asset-backed warehouse yields that we have for the homes. We are excited about the resale velocity that we have, which allows us to move homes through quicker if those trends continue. So, we will just continue to monitor it on a cost of capital and a ROI basis looking at a long-term investment in that business. But I don't expect it to significantly change, in fact, it will likely be less than the capital we have talked about coming into the year just given that we have had to pause and we have to ramp up again, if that helps. And then you had a question, I believe you said how we are thinking about MBP discounts? Yes. So, I guess what I stated just from the data point of that win after our first adjustment or discount, which was \u2013 I call this sledgehammer, but it 50% across the board and again inputs were dislocating. As trends start to come back up and as we made a more targeted adjustment to our discount process in late April, we are continuing to see very good retention of all of our partners and the partners that we want. So that's the data point that says that we believe this tool is working that is showing we are in this with our partners for the long-term as well as it's working to retain our partners to ensure our customer are serviced. So right now, we believe it's a tool that will continue to work. We are well-positioned if you look at our traffic, our brand, our balance sheet, I think we are in a great position to continue to win. We will continue to serve customers with technology, which will drive traffic. And so I believe that the metric that we showed in our ability to go back to more of an MBP pricing when we are providing value to our customers is we own and again there is a lot of uncertainty out there, but we are happy where we are. We feel like we are in a really good position."

And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich.\nRich Barton: Thank you, Brad. Hello, everyone. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy despite volatility, stubborn COVID variants, mixed macro signals in the geopolitical environment, I'm feeling grounded and excited by what's happening at Zillow and the opportunity in front of us. Today, we're going to walk through the next steps for Zillow as we grow our core business, innovate to make it easier for people to move and provide a progress report on the wind-down of our Zillow-owned homes inventory. First, on the inventory wind-down. We are selling homes faster than we anticipated at better pricing levels than we projected. We have now sold or entered into agreements to sell or dispose of more than 85% of our inventory, which Allen will speak about more. The wind-down process is running smoothly, efficiently, and we expect it to generate positive cash flow. We felt confident in November and we feel even more confident today that exiting iBuying and eliminating housing market balance sheet risk to our company and our shareholders was a great decision while giving full respect to the affected employees. Moving forward, we know our customers better than we ever have before because we've been in the trenches with them buying and selling thousands of homes. We developed valuable software services and support that persist. And we've been freed up to turn our formidable R&D capabilities and capacity toward innovating for a much broader set of mover customers than the narrow focus that iBuying allowed. As we look to the future, we have the building blocks in place, and now it's about stacking them in new impactful ways to solve more problems for more customers and partners. I'd like to emphasize that the problem we are solving is not new to us. Throughout these past 16 years, our mission has been to give people power, power to the people, to unlock life's next chapter and to move. So even now, the real estate industry continues to be archaic, primarily off-line and fragmented. Throughout Zillow's history, beginning with Zestimate, Zillow has turned on the lights with data and information and empowered customers in a way that began to transform the industry. But it wasn't happening fast enough. So 3 years ago, we shifted strategic focus from a purely ad-based business model to 1 that expanded our focus down-funnel to the transaction itself. This marked our transition from Zillow 1.0 to 2.0. Over the past 3 years, we have focused on helping customers navigate the real estate transaction in an easier, simpler way with our suite of tech-enabled solutions and an ever-improving partner network. We all know that moving is complicated, time-consuming and full of loops and hoops to jump through in a disjointed and opaque process. Anyone who has been through a move knows how challenging it can be to research, shop, select, finance, appraise, close and have to connect all these separate vendors and spend time taking down information and managing the process yourself. Sometimes you do all of this and still end up losing out on your dream home, especially in this competitive market. On top of the time and energy we expended on this taxing process, all of these pieces add up to between $26,000 and $40,000 of extra expense on an average priced home. Moving is exhausting and expensive. And to us, it's painfully clear that customers deserve and control. Our opportunity is to create the housing super app, an integrated digital experience in which Zillow connects all of the fragmented pieces of the moving process and brings them together on 1 transaction platform, empowering customers with data, a suite of Zillow-owned solutions at their fingertips and a network of best-in-class partners to make it easier for them to move, start to finish. Our customers will be able to do everything within the Zillow ecosystem. That's the dream we're building towards. Accompanying this dream is a significant addressable market. Housing-related transaction fees were roughly a $300 billion industry in 2021. This includes residential real estate, rentals, mortgage, title and escrow. It does not include more speculative future potential in adjacent services like renovations, home insurance, moving services and appraisals. The TAM is large. And currently, we are a very small part of it despite our outsized audience and trusted brand. We are well positioned to capitalize though, but doing so requires relentless innovation in both product and business model. So why do I feel so good about this? Well, we have an unbelievably solid foundation from which to innovate and a great track record of growth in our core business. No company in our category has a stronger claim to hearts and minds at the top of the funnel, with nearly 200 million unique users flocking to our sites and apps every month. The strength of our brand is unmatched with Zillow searched more on Google than the term for real estate. Similarly, no other company has our track record of technology innovation in the housing industry. Over the past 15-plus years, we have steadily grown the size and quality of our team of engineers, designers, product managers, data scientists and analysts and many more that make up a formidable investment in R&D, reflecting our belief in the opportunity ahead. In 2021, we 4x-ed our software releases into production versus our releases in 2015, and we are investing in our ability to further accelerate our pace of innovation for customers and for partners. We have also done well using acquisition as an accelerant. Late last year, we closed our purchase of ShowingTime, the industry's leading for-sale home touring reservation system. ShowingTime receives tens of millions of touring requests a year, and last year, it facilitated 63 million home tours. We acquired ShowingTime because we recognize how critically important tours are to the shopping experience. People come to Zillow to look at homes and the next logical step in the moving process is to tour them.  Tours are where much of the magic happens. It's the point-of-sale moment for agents, and it's a powerful mechanism for identifying high-intent movers and helping them get to the next step of their moving journey. Our opportunity is to transform a manual phone call-based reservation system into a digital one, with software making touring more integrated and simpler for all agents and customers in the industry. We believe in and are investing in software that underpins an increasingly digital industry as a whole, with the firm belief that a rising tide lifts all boats, including our own. ShowingTime's platform will help convert more shoppers into transactors. In fact, our internal data shows us that the transaction conversion rate of a customer who requests a tour on Zillow is 3x higher than any other connection point our customers have with our partner agents. So buyers who request a tour with a Premier Agent partner are more likely to buy a home with that partner. We assume this conversion boost from a tour is similar for the industry as a whole, much of which uses ShowingTime, as I said. Yet, we see so much opportunity to increase both the quality and quantity of tours that are facilitated throughout the industry. As a proxy, today, we are fulfilling less than 1/3 of tours requested on Zillow. The combination of ShowingTime and new product releases should drive better touring experiences and higher conversion rates across the industry and for Zillow moving forward. We have big ambitions across our business, which I'll take you through next. But before I do so, I want to highlight how strong our business is today. We reported positive fourth quarter results, which Allen will speak more about. In our IMT segment, from 2018 to 2021, revenue increased 57% and adjusted EBITDA increased from $240 million to $853 million, about 3.5x growth. Our strong gross profit generation in IMT, coupled with our healthy cash position of $3.1 billion, gives us the flexibility to invest in R&D and innovation, accelerate business development and drive growth moving forward. Since our iBuying wind-down announcement, a consistent question we've gotten asked has been, where does growth come from now? Brad mentioned that we posted an updated investor deck on our website, which I encourage you to peruse when you have time. But while I have your attention, I want to outline where I expect growth to come from moving forward. First, let's ground ourselves in the U.S. housing market. In 2021, 6.1 million existing homes exchanged hands in the country. For every home exchanged, there are 2 customer transactions, 1 on the buy side and 1 on the sell side, which results in 12.2 million customer transaction TAM. Buy-side shopping much like the house tour is where consumers are super engaged and energetic. Moving is about life's next chapter and the next home is the aspiration. Helping movers dream and shop is our historical power alley and the wellspring of our massive audience and engagement. Of the 6.1 million buy-side customer transactions that occurred last year, we estimate that 4.1 million of those actual buyers were on our sites and apps, which accounts for 2/3 of all buyers in the U.S. This seems remarkable but shouldn't surprise us, given how it tracks the unique user and app tracking data we all look at across the category. What may surprise you all is that roughly 1.4 million actual homebuyers asked to connect with a Zillow Premier Agent last year. Wow. That means about 1/4 of all buyers in the U.S. last year clicked a button to connect to a Zillow Premier Agent. This tells us that we are the preeminent place for high-intent movers to find their next home. Of those 1.4 million high-intent movers, we estimate that about 360,000 customers ended up transacting with us. That number is primarily buyers but we do have some customers today who connect with a Premier Agent and end up selling their existing home with our partner as well. Overall, we estimate that our buy-side market share today is roughly 5%, and our overall customer transaction share is roughly 3%. We worked hard over 15-plus years to achieve this 3% transaction penetration and we are proud of what we've accomplished today. But oh my, do I see an opportunity to increase our share of customer transactions from 3% to 6% in 2025 and meaningfully higher than that longer term by vastly improving our customer experience and funnel. Let's take each of these critical numbers and break down what we are doing to improve the fidelity of our funnel and customer experience from beginning to end. First, we are going to grow engagement with the roughly 4.1 million homebuyers who use our product. We will do this by leveraging our tech and product innovation and investment to deliver personalized and immersive content and curated experience like -- experiences like 3D tours integrated with interactive floor plans and intuitive tools to understand affordability early in the customer journey. At the same time, we will continue to improve our core experience in Zestimate search and find and other expanded services. Next, we plan to grow both the roughly 1.4 million actual homebuyers who raised their hands to connect with us last year and the roughly 360,000 home buyers and sellers who transacted with us. We expect to do this in 3 ways: one, we'll be leveling up that critical touring experience with ShowingTime to make it easier for movers to tour homes and connect with our partners. Two will be an increased focus on preparing these customers to be transaction-ready through intuitive and digitized financing offerings. And three, we will develop seller solutions by leveraging learnings from our iBuying experience to stand up new more asset-light services. As we take all of the energy potential from buyers on Zillow and open up broader seller solutions and financing opportunities, we expect to increase the number of people who raise their hand to transact with Zillow and open up access to the 6.1 million sell-side customer transactions that mirror the 6.1 million buy-side transactions that we've been focused on to date. We will couple these product improvements with an enhanced partner agent network and how we interact with, support and improve the experience for our partners as well as our mutual customers. Here, we will continue to focus on working with high-performing agents who have demonstrated stellar customer service, a proven ability to close and an appetite to grow with us as partners as we expand. One of the great benefits of these product and service improvements is they have an eye towards integration, which is a win for the customer, a win for our partners and a win for Zillow because it will drive more transactions and more revenue per transaction. One prominent way to do this will be integrating Zillow Home Loans into the shopping experience to better serve our customers. Today, nearly 90% of all homebuyers finance for the mortgage, and many of them want to get prequalified before finding an agent. By offering intuitive and reliable pre-approval and prequalification services earlier in the shopper's journey, we hope to keep customers engaged in our funnel and improve their overall experience. Getting prequalified with financing is a strong signal of a mover's serious intent to buy a home, and referring a customer that already has financing is more valuable and efficient for our Premier Agent partners as well. We see expanded seller services and closing services as key to the integration we expect to provide and are hard at work cooking up what's next based on our learnings from having now bought and sold thousands of homes. When we put all of these ingredients into the pot, we see an opportunity to meaningfully increase the number of customers who raise their hands to work with us and the number of customers who ultimately transact with us.  We know that the size of the prize is large when we become the central integrator, connecting pieces of the fragmented process and turning dreamers into transactors within the Zillow Housing Super App ecosystem. We expect all of these efforts to translate into $5 billion in annual revenue by the end of 2025 with strong gross profits that will allow us to invest in the opportunities that we'll have in front of us, while also translating into healthy 45% EBITDA margins for our shareholders. Before I hand it over to Allen, I want to acknowledge that the past few months have been challenging for us all, Zillow employees and investors alike. Innovation is a bumpy road and really proud of our history of innovation, and I have 100% confidence in our ability to accelerate innovation in the months and years ahead. Our company was built on big swings and we're going to continue taking them. We take big swings on products, on technologies, on business models and even on the future of how our employees work. Big swings are as core to Zillow as is Zestimate, and they are part of what makes our company so special. Finally, a really wild and wonderful characteristic of being Zillow is that we throw a much longer shadow than we are tall. In the last year, we have experienced the upside and the downside of capturing the hearts and minds of so many. People care about our brand and their homes deeply. There is something particularly gratifying and motivating, knowing that we are solving a problem that is so near and dear to people, so meaningful, and because of that, everyone is watching. Within all of that meaningfulness is a massive business opportunity to help people move using our housing super app to help them unlock life's next chapter and to help our partners grow their businesses. As I said earlier, our foundation and positioning are strong, and we are so much smarter, more experienced and more battle-hardened now than we were a year ago. As many of you know, I'm the largest individual shareholder and co-founder of Zillow in addition to being CEO. For the past 16 years, I thought about Zillow every day. I care about the long-term meaning of the Zillow brand and the value of our company in a way that couldn't be more personal. And I'm continuously awed by the sheer size of the opportunity and the relative immaturity of technologies advance into residential real estate, such a large, incredibly important and endlessly entertaining industry. Thank you for your continued support. I enjoy being on the journey with you.  I'll now pass the line over to Allen.\nAllen Parker: Thank you, Rich, and hello, everyone. I'm going to take a brief moment to provide an update on the progress of winding down our iBuying operations. I'll then discuss our quarterly results and Q1 outlook and will conclude with comments on our newly announced 2025 products. As previously discussed, we expected a wide range of potential results for the home segment this quarter as we work to free up operational and renovation capacity and pursue retail strategies in order to protect the value of our assets and optimize the speed of the wind-down, all while respectively managing our people. This quarter, we reported home segment revenue of $3.3 billion, well exceeding our updated outlook range of $2.3 billion to $2.9 billion provided in early December. The revenue outperformance benefited from a combination of better renovation capacity that allowed us to accelerate listings in Q4 as well as better retail velocity. With the better-than-expected resale and better prices, we had $93 million of write-down in the quarter compared to previously expected additional losses of $240 million to $265 million in Q4. This brings our total write-down to $405 million for Q3 and Q4, an improvement of $160 million compared to the midpoint of our initial estimated range. The better-than-expected write-down resulted in Q4 EBITDA loss of $206 million, $141 million better than our outlook range for a loss of $347 million at the midpoint. We continue to make good progress on winding down this business and have now sold or entered into agreements to sell and dispose more than 85% of the homes in the home segment that we expected to resell during the entire wind-down process. In January, we finished acquiring all the homes that we plan to buy. We continue to expect to sell most of our remaining homes inventory by the end of Q2 2022, with a small number of homes remaining thereafter. We have updated our expected iBuying wind-down restructuring costs to $175 million to $205 million in aggregate compared to the $175 million to $230 million we previously expected. $71 million was recognized in Q4 and the remainder we expect to be realized in 2022. We expect the approximately $800 million of cash equity that was in the inventory at end of Q3 will more than cover the realized losses on inventory, operating cost and the cash portion of restructuring cost of the wind-down. As a result, we now expect the net effect of the wind-down of iBuying operations to be cash flow positive in aggregate, slightly better than our prior outlook of at least cash flow neutral at the end of Q3. I would like to sincerely thank our dedicated employees who have been executing the wind-down process. Moving to the core business results. We'll start with IMT revenue, which was $483 million, growing 14% year-over-year and 51% on a 2-year stack basis, which accelerated compared to the 43% 2-year growth in Q3. Our IMT segment revenue came in slightly above the $481 million midpoint of our guidance, driven primarily by Premier Agent revenue at the low end of our outlook range and better-than-expected results in our rentals business. PA revenue grew 13% year-over-year, which outperformed industry growth of 4% and posted accelerating 2-year stack growth of 52% compared to 49% 2-year growth in Q3. The Omicron variant and severe cold weather resulted in lower new for-sale listings in late Q4, which had a slight impact on our results but remain within our expected seasonal range and outlook. Rentals revenue was flat year-over-year but better than we anticipated despite continued pressures from high occupancy rates, which dampens demand for rentals advertising. We saw stronger-than-expected customer interest in applications and success in renters leasing properties. Rentals also faced a difficult second half comp due to strong 2020 results following the initial impact from COVID-related volatility a year ago. IMT segment EBITDA and margin were $220 million and 46% for Q4, respectively, exceeding our outlook of $200 million and 42% at the midpoint. The outperformance was driven by increased operating efficiency as well as lower-than-anticipated advertising and marketing spend. For 2021, IMT segment adjusted EBITDA was $853 million or 45% of IMT segment revenue, representing more than 2,100 basis points of margin expansion over 2019. We have continuously driven operating efficiencies by prioritizing and streamlining internal processes and recognizing the efficiency of marketing. I would also like to call out that our high gross margins enabled us to invest in innovating on behalf of our customers, partners and our platform customers to drive future growth while delivering industry-leading EBITDA within online real estate. Mortgages segment revenue of $51 million came in at the high end of our Q4 outlook range as refinancing loan originations did not slow as much as expected, while gain on sale margins compressed within our expectations. Segment adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $14 million, near the midpoint of our outlook as we expected lower profitability due to lower purchase volume from unwinding our iBuying operations. I would like to reiterate that Zillow's financial position remains strong and flexible.  We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and investments, slightly less than $3.2 billion at the end of Q3. After the impact of our $302 million in share repurchases in December, largely offset by earnings from our IMT segment. The wind-down leaves us in a strong position to invest in more scalable customer solutions that are less capital-intensive as we execute on our vision and make strategic long-term investments. Our expectation is that we will continue to be a positive earnings and positive cash flow company with our revised product strategy. Turning to our outlook. For the first quarter, in our IMT segment, we expect 9% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 at the midpoint, within an outlook range of 7% to 11% and 47% 2-year growth. Within the IMT segment, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be between $358 million to $368 million, up 9% year-over-year and up 50% over Q1 2020 at the midpoint of our outlook.  Our wider-than-normal IMT and PA Q1 outlook revenue ranges are informed by the following. We saw slower housing activity late in Q4 and have also seen a slow start to new for-sale inventory listings in Q1. Despite that, our customer and agent activity levels indicate strong customer demand, which is consistent with the Conference Board's December consumer survey indicating plans to buy a home during the next 6 months were at record levels and recovered sharply from lower levels at the end of September. In other IMT, we continue to expect headwinds in rentals from the continued low industry vacancy rates and in new construction because of builders' low inventory levels. We expect Q1 IMT EBITDA margin to be 41%, at the midpoint of our outlook. This margin reflects the investment level we believe is necessary to drive innovation and execution towards our 2025 targets. We expect our Mortgages segment revenue to be between $44 million to $49 million in Q1, which is down sequentially from Q4. Our Q1 outlook reflects slower industry refinance activity from the recent move in interest rates, consistent gain on sale spreads and slower growth in purchase originations impacted by the wind-down of our iBuying operations.  As a result of lower sequential revenue and continued investments to grow mortgage originations, we expect the Mortgages segment EBITDA to be between a loss of $17 million and a loss of $12 million, as we focus on preparing customers to be transaction-ready through intuitive and digitized mortgage offerings, we are working to integrate mortgages across our platform with a focus on purchase originations. We expect these efforts to make progress over the course of this year. In Q1, we expect our home segment revenue to be $2.75 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be a loss of $37.5 million at the midpoint of our outlook range. Given the wind-down of our iBuying operations and the path forward we see, we think it is prudent to initiate new financial targets for year-end 2025.  Before doing so, we wanted to remind you of where we stand on our February 2019 3- to 5-year targets. We have just completed the third year of the original targets and are expecting to soon be run-rating the $2 billion IMT segment revenue targets. And we are already well above our original IMT segment EBITDA targets of $600 million or 30% margin. As we wind down iBuying operations, the original home segment and related Zillow Home Loans attach related targets are no longer relevant. With that, I'll take a moment to walk through the 2025 financial model that we've included in the investor deck published on the IR website today. Our long-term growth model shows how we plan to deliver Zillow's new 2025 financial projects. The model is quite simple: industry customer transactions times transaction share times average revenue per customer transaction for our PA, ZHL and VCS services, added to other services and marketplaces revenue that include rentals, new construction, mortgage marketplace and real estate industry services. It's important to note that we are assuming no growth in overall existing home sales from 2021 levels and only 3% annual appreciation for the industry. This is not a macro call we are making on our outlook. It is merely the approach we took to look at how we can drive strong secular growth. Simply put, we expect to grow our share of customer transactions from 3% to 6%, which should drive over 700,000 customer transactions annually. We have a good understanding of our customers' key pain points and are focused on executing better connections, touring, mortgage approvals and expanding seller services. By better meeting their needs, we expect our customers to remain engaged deeper into our funnel, which should double our market share and also drive higher revenue per transaction via the expanded services. This model implies 24% revenue CAGR, yielding our 2025 targets of $5 billion in annual revenue and $2.25 billion in EBITDA, which equates to 45% EBITDA margin. We expect margins to scale with our revenue while we continue to invest prudently where we see opportunities to drive growth. As we look forward, our priorities remain focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners. We plan to: grow our customer engagement through a compelling dream and shop experience; deliver a more integrated customer transactional experience to drive customers to choose to transact with us and our partners; invest in sustainable top line growth opportunities across the company, including new integrated services that are more scalable, less subject to earnings volatility and more capital efficient; and lastly, manage our cost structure and improve productivity to drive a profitable, scalable and positive cash flow company.  And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have a couple about the multiyear targets. The first one, so the 24% annualized growth on the new $5 billion target, pretty healthy growth. I guess, Rich, I'd be curious to hear, first of all, how you think about some of the keys to execution in the next couple of years to sort of realize that type of growth? And how should we think about the slope to the next couple of years' growth relative to the, call it, the next 4? And then the second 1 is, if I do some math on the transactions, it looks like you already have a decent amount of seller-side transactions on the platform. Can you just talk to us again, remind us about where are you on monetizing seller leads and how big of a part is that in the long-term targets?\nRich Barton: Okay, Brian. Well, maybe I'll set the table and then Allen, you can serve the real food on this one. We did drop a whole bunch of new stuff on you all this quarter. I tell you, we had a lot of fun putting together these 2025 long-term targets as well as putting together this, I think it's a pretty tight deck that maybe many of you are looking at right now that really gets to answering, Brian, exactly what you're talking about. But from a table-setting perspective, it's really important to the new stuff we've said as we've made it a little crisper just what we mean by such a huge engaged audience, okay? We have always talked about the 200 million or so unique users. We put a little bit finer point on that by focusing on the app by saying, we get about 4 million daily app users, which is 3x the size of our nearest competitor. And the key to growth really is nothing more complicated than converting more of those 4 million daily app users into transacting customers, okay? Another kind of really interesting and eye-opening data points that I talked about in my script was that we actually have 1.4 million of the actual homebuyers last year raised their hand to connect with us, all right? And yet we've only ended up with 3% customer transaction share. We said 360,000 transactions. So the big long lever is converting users into transactions, into customer transactions. We're better at it. We're going to be better at -- we have a history of driving that transaction penetration, no question. And innovation in both product and business model has been what that's about. But we have a lot more experience now because we have been in the guts of the business buying and selling thousands of homes. We've built a bunch of stuff to support that, and that puts us in a terrific position to now build what we're calling this housing super app, which will act as the integration and dashboard of bringing these disparate components of the process altogether in 1 place in a really interesting way. I'll pass it over to Allen by saying the 2025 -- highlighting that the 2025 targets assume that we take that 3% transaction share to 6% transaction share. And given all the stuff we're doing, especially, say, in the closer term, in terms of touring and financing with mortgages, we think that is achievable and exciting.\nAllen Parker: Yes. Thanks, Rich. And thanks for asking the question, Brian. So I guess I'll start with, -- the 2025 financial targets was an opportunity for us to add some more transparency about the opportunity that's ahead of us that we're excited about as well as clarify the strong position we currently are in. And so as we think about that path to $5 billion and 45% EBITDA, as we've talked about, it's driven by this expectation that broader integrated offerings are going to drive both more transactions and higher revenue per transaction than where we are today. And from a modeling perspective and starting with the 12.2 million customer TAM, both the buy side and sell side. We talked about the 360,000 transactions we participate in today and just growing that share of 3% to 6%. In addition to that, it's taking the revenue per transaction we get today of around $4,100 and growing that to $5,200 a transaction. And we think that comes from having more customers using more of our services in an integrated way. In addition, I'll just call out that those 2025 targets include our other marketplace and industry software solutions businesses growing from $609 million in 2021 to $1.2 billion in 2025. As we think about the slope, we provided guidance for Q1. We think that this model is driven off of our ability to control and drive secular growth by serving the customer and integrating better with our partners. And I think there are some more near-term things and some longer-term things as we innovate, that's kind of the innovation path. And we'll continue to share as we can how that slope may play out. But right now, I think what we'd say is we feel really comfortable based on the position we're in today with our brand, our audience, our partner network, our current standing with the number of -- the 1.4 million buyers who utilize our site today and the financial position we are in and the business model that can generate positive cash flow to execute well on the 2025 targets.\nRich Barton: I guess I served some of the dinner in there and we overlapped. But there were 2 other things in there, you were talking about the slope, Allen, in Brian's question, and that is kind of implicit in it, its kind of where are we in the S curve of penetration, where are we in the S curve of market share? And is the path from here to 2025 convex, linear, concave, what is it? Here, my expectations are that once we get to the 6%, given this giant gap between the 6% and our usage and engagement numbers, which are 2/3 of the industry, of actual buyers that are using the site, I would expect -- it is my expectation that we will be continuing to invest for growth in a prudent way at that point. And so I expect continued growth. I don't know what that means about the implications of the curve, but I hope it's linear or better. And then on the sell-side transaction question, yes, I think you can kind of connect dots based on what we shared and get at what our estimated sell-side transactions that we're getting -- that we are monetizing today is. It is a nontrivial chunk of our 360,000 customer transactions that we estimate.  And mainly, that is because people who are coming to buy homes with Zillow and with our partners, at least half of them are also selling their home, and a whole bunch of them do end up selling with our Premier Agent partners. And so we already access the sell side of the market. Now we want to enhance that and drive share there with more products and the super app, but we already have a terrific foothold today. All right. That was a long answer, sorry, but thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Erickson of RBC Capital Markets.\nBrad Erickson: Just have a couple there. So you mentioned now a few times that you're engaging with this quarter of all buy staff last year versus market share at about 5%. I guess, can you just give a little more color on how either MVP or Flex may be contributing there as you look to reduce that leakage and any sense of the mix between the 2 models? And second, I guess a little related to the first. On the seller leads that you're looking to drive, you mentioned some that -- you've talked about before some of the calls to action that you're looking to implement on the site. Just curious to hear maybe a bit more about how you might serve to sort of tease out that signal of potential sellers and any maybe early proof points as to how that's going.\nAllen Parker: Do you want me to start with the MVP Flex transaction, Rich? Thanks, Brad. I'll take the first part of the question.\nRich Barton: Sorry, I was on mute, yes.\nAllen Parker: Okay. So I guess how I would describe it, Brad, is that we feel like we have a very strong Premier Agent partner network both across our MBP and our Flex models. Flex, in and of itself, is not a driver for transactions, but it is a driver for better alignment between ourselves, our customers and our partners, we feel. And so we will continue to innovate and iterate on ways to align our partners with our products and services and our customers in ways to generate more transactions, higher conversion and more revenue per transaction. So we're very pleased with where we are, both on the MBP and Flex model. And I wouldn't call one or the other out as the biggest driver of the journey to the 2025 targets. But I think the key is alignment. And as Rich mentioned, the more integrated transaction with tools that serve our customers well and also sort of our partner network flow.\nRich Barton: And on your second part, Brad, look, what we what we have come to fully realize is something that, I guess, we should all intuitively understand. And that is -- I don't know if -- like, Ford for the Super Bowl ads that they have coming up is not going to make an advertisement that says, sell your current car, okay? What they're do -- what their marketing on the Super Bowl ad is the dream of the new car with the red bow on it in the driveway. The housing equivalent of that, it holds. People -- the inspiration and aspiration of the move is the new place. The greatest seller lead opportunity we have is in helping people dream about the new house, okay? And we have a really fantastic position in that, that we're already converting into some sell-side business today. Now we also understand that solving this kind of painful but necessary part of the super app, part of the moving process of selling your house is a big deal and having good solves for that with creative new solutions is an important area of innovation, and we are fully embracing that. As you well know, we ran a big giant experiment with iBuying so we know a whole lot more about that now, and we\u2019ll pitch a big test over that and are innovating and working with partners to make sure we have compelling offerings to solve that particular problem.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Colantuoni of Jefferies.\nJohn Colantuoni: Wanted to start with the housing market. Maybe you could just walk us through what you're seeing today from a macro perspective and how your outlook for the housing market over the next 3 years ties into your 2025 targets. And second, you outlined plans to increase the 1.4 million homebuyers who tried to connect on Zillow last year, which is already an impressive figure. One of the initiatives you mentioned is developing asset-light seller solutions by leveraging your learnings from iBuying. Given the seller side, it's been more elusive for Zillow in the past, can you provide any specifics around the products that you're planning to roll out that will help bolster seller connections?\nRich Barton: Okay. Hey, John. You want me to -- Allen, I'll start with the macro stuff and maybe Brad, jump in if I get it -- if and when I get it wrong. I realize that we're in a particularly interesting macro environment, given the high level of uncertainty, okay? We are well aware that it's more uncertain than usual. But our economists forecast strong macro and strong housing market this year, following up a very strong market in 2021. In fact, I think highest trends at number of transactions since 2006, Brad, am I right? Am I getting a nod?\nBrad Berning: Correct, yes.\nRich Barton: All right, correct. Thank you. I don't want to get that wrong. It didn't certainly feel like that last year, did it, because inventory was so low and inventory continues to be low, but that doesn't mean there can't be a lot of transactions. And while our economists are forecasting that, we are taking -- Allen and his team are certainly taking the more uncertain than usual into account. What's driving the strength is this kind of millennial tide that's rising. They are really -- this demographic tide is rising on the industry and that coupled with supply that's not rising as fast is making this, we think, continuing to be a strong market.  Did I say that okay, Allen, Brad?\nAllen Parker: Yes. And I'll just add on top of that, that as you mentioned, Rich, our Q1 guide reflects some of that macro uncertainty that Rich talked about in the short term. The lower new sale listings, high occupancy rates and rentals and lower builder inventory are all reflective in and formed our Q1 guide. But we continue to see strong demand signals on our site and strong interest from our partners with very low churn. And so the opportunity, we feel well positioned as we look at this opportunity in this path to the 2025 targets to focus the customer, improving our partner network and providing them tools, and that -- we believe that the 2025 targets are appropriately aggressive but achievable through a lot of the things that we just talked about. Just to get on the macro and how it affects our '25 targets, I just want to reiterate that our 2025 financial targets are based on flat industry transaction assumptions, so no increase in industry transactions and low single-digit HPA assumptions. So our model and the KPIs that we built really are based on our opportunity to innovate and integrate our services and drive secular growth based on the strong foundation that we have.\nRich Barton: Okay. But what Allen said about low single-digit 3% HPA home price appreciation and flat transactions, that's not a macro call we're making. We're just -- that's just for modeling purposes. That's what we've done. So that's not our macro call. I mean, that 3% compares to what, 9% CAGR since 1971 or is that total industry? Anyway, 1 more thing, sorry. I'd be remiss if I didn't say amidst all this macro conversation, which I understand is important for a read-through to all of our businesses in the economy, I get it. But really the big shift that we are on the leading edge of is the shift in a giant industry, the largest perhaps in the U.S., of moving from the offline non-digital way of doing things to the online digital way of doing things with us as the leader in that. And that actually is really the most important lever and shift from a macro perspective to our long-term results.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. I'll go back to that 2025 outlook and I love the idea of swinging for the fences, Rich and Allen, and laying out these long-term markers. I look at the assumptions that are in there, and the 1 that strikes me as most aggressive is that 6% share of transactions? I know it's up 3% but that's a doubling of the share from what you had in '21. So maybe just double-click on that a little bit. The other assumptions don't seem as aggressive. That 1 does seem aggressive. Maybe we need some context as to where that -- if it was 3% in '21, where it was before. Or if you look at all of the different things you could do to increase that going from 3% to 6%, what do you think are the easiest things to do? And what would be the hardest things to do, just on that particular metric because I think that's pretty key to this $5 billion outlook?\nRich Barton: Mark, maybe I'll start, and Allen, you guys jump in. When you break it down into the components, it doesn't feel -- it feels doable to me, Mark, and I'm a big believer in BHAGs. I don't even know if I'd call this BHAG, a big hairy audacious goal. It is, no doubt, not timid, okay? But these goals end up being self-fulfilling because of the creativity they tend to release internally with all the smart people we have and given the resources we have, I'm confident. But 2 rather low bits of hanging fruit. We talked about a bit on conversion here is getting on top and really taking advantage of our position with home touring and building a digital home tour reservation system. Right now, it's super complicated to schedule a home tour. And so a good deal of home tour request demand goes unfulfilled. I don't know what the data point on that, is that, Brad? -- we might --\nBrad Berning: Yes, it's 23% of our tours only that we're fulfilling today. We have meaningful opportunities to upside those. And the other point just to throw in for -- to hit there is we get about double the conversion rate on a tour of our other leads. And so growing the mix of touring is pretty significant to help drive conversion rate.\nRich Barton: I think in my script, I said 3x the conversion, Brad. I'm not sure, but --\nBrad Berning: Sorry, correct. You're correct, Rich.\nRich Barton: Yes, okay. So 3x the conversion when we actually connect a partner with a customer on a tour. And so that -- it doesn't take too much imagination to see how us wiring up that into the Zillow super app experience could drive increased conversion rate to transaction. Another 1 is financing. I did mortgages. I talked already quite a bit about that. But we had our guns in mortgages all trained towards iBuying. So all the work we've really been doing for the last couple of years with Zillow Home Loans and building our own mortgage operation was in service to iBuying. And a lot of it was actually pretty interesting. And we have this factor. We had not been focused on the bigger lever, on the bigger opportunity, which is basically distributing a mortgage product directly to our customers and via our Premier Agent partners. In this time period, we are confident that we will be able to develop our fantastic partner network into a distribution network for our mortgage that will then be just integrated into the super app in a way that puts the mortgage in its proper place, which really is kind of a painful but important support stepping stone along the way to the new house. We just wanted to be integrated right into the super app. I don't know if that -- I mean, there is a lot more to driving to that 6% but those are 2 of the big ones.\nAllen Parker: Yes. And the only thing that I'd just, I guess, reiterate, you talked about some of the features and services that we think are going to improve conversion. But starting with this 25% of homebuyers already asking to speak to an agent. And so those being customers that have raised their hand is a great starting point. And that's only being 1 in 4 right now gives us confidence that these services and improved features of integration should give us quite a bit of leverage as we go through and grow this transaction count.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Ryan McKeveny of Zelman & Associates.\nRyan McKeveny: I appreciate all the detail, all the new stuff, and Rich, I agree with you, shout-out to the designers and marketing folks and data folks, the content of the deck is very good, so I appreciate that. But back to my question. So I've got 2 on the long-term opportunity. First one, somewhat similar to others, so focusing on this movement from 3% market share to 6% market share. Maybe I'll ask a bit more in terms of how we can look at the past to possibly help think about the future. So Slide 7, you show 360,000 transactions in 2021 on 1.4 million connections so about a 25% conversion rate. Can you share any insight on how that conversion rate from connection to consumer or to customer compares to maybe the last 2, 3, 4, 5 years? I'd imagine both the number of connections as well as the conversion rate has improved over time. But maybe seeing a bit of a trend line there on how things have trended will help us bridge to what to expect in the future.\nRich Barton: Allen, do you want to take a stab at that?\nAllen Parker: Yes, yes. I guess what I'd say is that when we made a decision in 2018 to go deeper into the transaction, we -- that was the start of us taking a harder look at how can we drive transactions and success for our customers through the transaction. And maybe the proxy I'll use is connections. But since 2019, we've seen our ability to drive connections and conversion through our partner agent base grow. I don't have the, I guess, the analogue to -- compared to the 1.4 million, 360,000, but we have seen growth as we started to focus on ensuring our customers were connected with an agent were served well. And I think you heard about us talk about connections, high-intent customers and the things we've done to drive that and close transactions versus the more ad-based or lead-based gen that we had been prior to '19.  I don't know, Brad or Rich, would you add anything to that? I just don't have the data.\nRich Barton: Well, it's taken a lot. I guess what I'd say, Ryan, its like strategically, you've been hearing us talk about Zillow 2.0 and the move towards the transaction for a few years, right? And we -- it's taken us this long to get to a point where we could even find the transaction to count, given the diversity of our business model. And so a big reason we don't have a good historical comp for you on that is that we don't have historical comps. We have worked really hard to come up with this estimate so that we can -- to communicate to you all for sure, but this is how we want to manage our business and our strategy internally, all right? So this is super important for us to get right internally. But as Allen pointed out, the history of the company is about slowly but surely driving conversion rates from user in the customer. And now we have what we think it should be a pretty good denominator for that.\nRyan McKeveny: That makes sense. A quick second question. Rich, a big picture 1 for you. So after the Zillow wind-down, you're left with a significant amount of cash, you can focus on growth, repurchase stock as you have been, investing in R&D. I guess to focus a bit more on the M&A side of things. I guess I wonder, how do you think about the opportunity or the possibility to be more active with proptech investments, either directly investing in early-stage proptech startups or outright acquiring companies? I'm just -- I'm almost thinking, is there an opportunity to be somewhat of an incubator? I'm sure you see a lot of interesting tech early in the days as things get started and just wonder how you think big picture about that opportunity or just the M&A opportunity to tack some good tech on over time.\nRich Barton: Yes. I mean, it's an opportunity. I would call -- looking at Zillow, our history is that a consistent but opportunistic acquirer, okay? When we see opportunities to really accelerate what we're trying to do strategically, we will take advantage of that. And the ShowingTime acquisition last year is a good example of that. A couple of years ago when we acquired Mortgage Lenders of America, to get a -- not have a cold start on our mortgage operation, that was another one. Jeremy Hoffman, who runs our corp dev group in addition to strategy and IR, is probably the most popular guy in proptech. So we talk with, we run tests with, partner with all of these companies in the space. We don't have an explicit incubation venture capital -- kind of corporate venture capital endeavour. We do have a lot of opportunity in that regard. We don't necessarily think we need to invest because when things want to trade, everything kind of lands on our doorstep first anyway. And I don't want to sound too opportunistic that way, we have really good relationships with these companies, and we think there's a lot of cool innovation happening.\nOperator: I'll now turn the call back to Rich Barton.\nRich Barton: All right. Thank you all for showing up. It is -- as I said at the end of my prepared remarks, it's a really, really fun and entertaining, endlessly interesting industry real estate is, maybe not quite as entertaining as Netflix but not too far off. We're really psyched to be on the journey with you and we'll talk to you soon. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rich Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad. Hello, everyone. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy despite volatility, stubborn COVID variants, mixed macro signals in the geopolitical environment, I'm feeling grounded and excited by what's happening at Zillow and the opportunity in front of us. Today, we're going to walk through the next steps for Zillow as we grow our core business, innovate to make it easier for people to move and provide a progress report on the wind-down of our Zillow-owned homes inventory. First, on the inventory wind-down. We are selling homes faster than we anticipated at better pricing levels than we projected. We have now sold or entered into agreements to sell or dispose of more than 85% of our inventory, which Allen will speak about more. The wind-down process is running smoothly, efficiently, and we expect it to generate positive cash flow. We felt confident in November and we feel even more confident today that exiting iBuying and eliminating housing market balance sheet risk to our company and our shareholders was a great decision while giving full respect to the affected employees. Moving forward, we know our customers better than we ever have before because we've been in the trenches with them buying and selling thousands of homes. We developed valuable software services and support that persist. And we've been freed up to turn our formidable R&D capabilities and capacity toward innovating for a much broader set of mover customers than the narrow focus that iBuying allowed. As we look to the future, we have the building blocks in place, and now it's about stacking them in new impactful ways to solve more problems for more customers and partners. I'd like to emphasize that the problem we are solving is not new to us. Throughout these past 16 years, our mission has been to give people power, power to the people, to unlock life's next chapter and to move. So even now, the real estate industry continues to be archaic, primarily off-line and fragmented. Throughout Zillow's history, beginning with Zestimate, Zillow has turned on the lights with data and information and empowered customers in a way that began to transform the industry. But it wasn't happening fast enough. So 3 years ago, we shifted strategic focus from a purely ad-based business model to 1 that expanded our focus down-funnel to the transaction itself. This marked our transition from Zillow 1.0 to 2.0. Over the past 3 years, we have focused on helping customers navigate the real estate transaction in an easier, simpler way with our suite of tech-enabled solutions and an ever-improving partner network. We all know that moving is complicated, time-consuming and full of loops and hoops to jump through in a disjointed and opaque process. Anyone who has been through a move knows how challenging it can be to research, shop, select, finance, appraise, close and have to connect all these separate vendors and spend time taking down information and managing the process yourself. Sometimes you do all of this and still end up losing out on your dream home, especially in this competitive market. On top of the time and energy we expended on this taxing process, all of these pieces add up to between $26,000 and $40,000 of extra expense on an average priced home. Moving is exhausting and expensive. And to us, it's painfully clear that customers deserve and control. Our opportunity is to create the housing super app, an integrated digital experience in which Zillow connects all of the fragmented pieces of the moving process and brings them together on 1 transaction platform, empowering customers with data, a suite of Zillow-owned solutions at their fingertips and a network of best-in-class partners to make it easier for them to move, start to finish. Our customers will be able to do everything within the Zillow ecosystem. That's the dream we're building towards. Accompanying this dream is a significant addressable market. Housing-related transaction fees were roughly a $300 billion industry in 2021. This includes residential real estate, rentals, mortgage, title and escrow. It does not include more speculative future potential in adjacent services like renovations, home insurance, moving services and appraisals. The TAM is large. And currently, we are a very small part of it despite our outsized audience and trusted brand. We are well positioned to capitalize though, but doing so requires relentless innovation in both product and business model. So why do I feel so good about this? Well, we have an unbelievably solid foundation from which to innovate and a great track record of growth in our core business. No company in our category has a stronger claim to hearts and minds at the top of the funnel, with nearly 200 million unique users flocking to our sites and apps every month. The strength of our brand is unmatched with Zillow searched more on Google than the term for real estate. Similarly, no other company has our track record of technology innovation in the housing industry. Over the past 15-plus years, we have steadily grown the size and quality of our team of engineers, designers, product managers, data scientists and analysts and many more that make up a formidable investment in R&D, reflecting our belief in the opportunity ahead. In 2021, we 4x-ed our software releases into production versus our releases in 2015, and we are investing in our ability to further accelerate our pace of innovation for customers and for partners. We have also done well using acquisition as an accelerant. Late last year, we closed our purchase of ShowingTime, the industry's leading for-sale home touring reservation system. ShowingTime receives tens of millions of touring requests a year, and last year, it facilitated 63 million home tours. We acquired ShowingTime because we recognize how critically important tours are to the shopping experience. People come to Zillow to look at homes and the next logical step in the moving process is to tour them.  Tours are where much of the magic happens. It's the point-of-sale moment for agents, and it's a powerful mechanism for identifying high-intent movers and helping them get to the next step of their moving journey. Our opportunity is to transform a manual phone call-based reservation system into a digital one, with software making touring more integrated and simpler for all agents and customers in the industry. We believe in and are investing in software that underpins an increasingly digital industry as a whole, with the firm belief that a rising tide lifts all boats, including our own. ShowingTime's platform will help convert more shoppers into transactors. In fact, our internal data shows us that the transaction conversion rate of a customer who requests a tour on Zillow is 3x higher than any other connection point our customers have with our partner agents. So buyers who request a tour with a Premier Agent partner are more likely to buy a home with that partner. We assume this conversion boost from a tour is similar for the industry as a whole, much of which uses ShowingTime, as I said. Yet, we see so much opportunity to increase both the quality and quantity of tours that are facilitated throughout the industry. As a proxy, today, we are fulfilling less than 1/3 of tours requested on Zillow. The combination of ShowingTime and new product releases should drive better touring experiences and higher conversion rates across the industry and for Zillow moving forward. We have big ambitions across our business, which I'll take you through next. But before I do so, I want to highlight how strong our business is today. We reported positive fourth quarter results, which Allen will speak more about. In our IMT segment, from 2018 to 2021, revenue increased 57% and adjusted EBITDA increased from $240 million to $853 million, about 3.5x growth. Our strong gross profit generation in IMT, coupled with our healthy cash position of $3.1 billion, gives us the flexibility to invest in R&D and innovation, accelerate business development and drive growth moving forward. Since our iBuying wind-down announcement, a consistent question we've gotten asked has been, where does growth come from now? Brad mentioned that we posted an updated investor deck on our website, which I encourage you to peruse when you have time. But while I have your attention, I want to outline where I expect growth to come from moving forward. First, let's ground ourselves in the U.S. housing market. In 2021, 6.1 million existing homes exchanged hands in the country. For every home exchanged, there are 2 customer transactions, 1 on the buy side and 1 on the sell side, which results in 12.2 million customer transaction TAM. Buy-side shopping much like the house tour is where consumers are super engaged and energetic. Moving is about life's next chapter and the next home is the aspiration. Helping movers dream and shop is our historical power alley and the wellspring of our massive audience and engagement. Of the 6.1 million buy-side customer transactions that occurred last year, we estimate that 4.1 million of those actual buyers were on our sites and apps, which accounts for 2/3 of all buyers in the U.S. This seems remarkable but shouldn't surprise us, given how it tracks the unique user and app tracking data we all look at across the category. What may surprise you all is that roughly 1.4 million actual homebuyers asked to connect with a Zillow Premier Agent last year. Wow. That means about 1/4 of all buyers in the U.S. last year clicked a button to connect to a Zillow Premier Agent. This tells us that we are the preeminent place for high-intent movers to find their next home. Of those 1.4 million high-intent movers, we estimate that about 360,000 customers ended up transacting with us. That number is primarily buyers but we do have some customers today who connect with a Premier Agent and end up selling their existing home with our partner as well. Overall, we estimate that our buy-side market share today is roughly 5%, and our overall customer transaction share is roughly 3%. We worked hard over 15-plus years to achieve this 3% transaction penetration and we are proud of what we've accomplished today. But oh my, do I see an opportunity to increase our share of customer transactions from 3% to 6% in 2025 and meaningfully higher than that longer term by vastly improving our customer experience and funnel. Let's take each of these critical numbers and break down what we are doing to improve the fidelity of our funnel and customer experience from beginning to end. First, we are going to grow engagement with the roughly 4.1 million homebuyers who use our product. We will do this by leveraging our tech and product innovation and investment to deliver personalized and immersive content and curated experience like -- experiences like 3D tours integrated with interactive floor plans and intuitive tools to understand affordability early in the customer journey. At the same time, we will continue to improve our core experience in Zestimate search and find and other expanded services. Next, we plan to grow both the roughly 1.4 million actual homebuyers who raised their hands to connect with us last year and the roughly 360,000 home buyers and sellers who transacted with us. We expect to do this in 3 ways: one, we'll be leveling up that critical touring experience with ShowingTime to make it easier for movers to tour homes and connect with our partners. Two will be an increased focus on preparing these customers to be transaction-ready through intuitive and digitized financing offerings. And three, we will develop seller solutions by leveraging learnings from our iBuying experience to stand up new more asset-light services. As we take all of the energy potential from buyers on Zillow and open up broader seller solutions and financing opportunities, we expect to increase the number of people who raise their hand to transact with Zillow and open up access to the 6.1 million sell-side customer transactions that mirror the 6.1 million buy-side transactions that we've been focused on to date. We will couple these product improvements with an enhanced partner agent network and how we interact with, support and improve the experience for our partners as well as our mutual customers. Here, we will continue to focus on working with high-performing agents who have demonstrated stellar customer service, a proven ability to close and an appetite to grow with us as partners as we expand. One of the great benefits of these product and service improvements is they have an eye towards integration, which is a win for the customer, a win for our partners and a win for Zillow because it will drive more transactions and more revenue per transaction. One prominent way to do this will be integrating Zillow Home Loans into the shopping experience to better serve our customers. Today, nearly 90% of all homebuyers finance for the mortgage, and many of them want to get prequalified before finding an agent. By offering intuitive and reliable pre-approval and prequalification services earlier in the shopper's journey, we hope to keep customers engaged in our funnel and improve their overall experience. Getting prequalified with financing is a strong signal of a mover's serious intent to buy a home, and referring a customer that already has financing is more valuable and efficient for our Premier Agent partners as well. We see expanded seller services and closing services as key to the integration we expect to provide and are hard at work cooking up what's next based on our learnings from having now bought and sold thousands of homes. When we put all of these ingredients into the pot, we see an opportunity to meaningfully increase the number of customers who raise their hands to work with us and the number of customers who ultimately transact with us.  We know that the size of the prize is large when we become the central integrator, connecting pieces of the fragmented process and turning dreamers into transactors within the Zillow Housing Super App ecosystem. We expect all of these efforts to translate into $5 billion in annual revenue by the end of 2025 with strong gross profits that will allow us to invest in the opportunities that we'll have in front of us, while also translating into healthy 45% EBITDA margins for our shareholders. Before I hand it over to Allen, I want to acknowledge that the past few months have been challenging for us all, Zillow employees and investors alike. Innovation is a bumpy road and really proud of our history of innovation, and I have 100% confidence in our ability to accelerate innovation in the months and years ahead. Our company was built on big swings and we're going to continue taking them. We take big swings on products, on technologies, on business models and even on the future of how our employees work. Big swings are as core to Zillow as is Zestimate, and they are part of what makes our company so special. Finally, a really wild and wonderful characteristic of being Zillow is that we throw a much longer shadow than we are tall. In the last year, we have experienced the upside and the downside of capturing the hearts and minds of so many. People care about our brand and their homes deeply. There is something particularly gratifying and motivating, knowing that we are solving a problem that is so near and dear to people, so meaningful, and because of that, everyone is watching. Within all of that meaningfulness is a massive business opportunity to help people move using our housing super app to help them unlock life's next chapter and to help our partners grow their businesses. As I said earlier, our foundation and positioning are strong, and we are so much smarter, more experienced and more battle-hardened now than we were a year ago. As many of you know, I'm the largest individual shareholder and co-founder of Zillow in addition to being CEO. For the past 16 years, I thought about Zillow every day. I care about the long-term meaning of the Zillow brand and the value of our company in a way that couldn't be more personal. And I'm continuously awed by the sheer size of the opportunity and the relative immaturity of technologies advance into residential real estate, such a large, incredibly important and endlessly entertaining industry. Thank you for your continued support. I enjoy being on the journey with you.  I'll now pass the line over to Allen. Okay, Brian. Well, maybe I'll set the table and then Allen, you can serve the real food on this one. We did drop a whole bunch of new stuff on you all this quarter. I tell you, we had a lot of fun putting together these 2025 long-term targets as well as putting together this, I think it's a pretty tight deck that maybe many of you are looking at right now that really gets to answering, Brian, exactly what you're talking about. But from a table-setting perspective, it's really important to the new stuff we've said as we've made it a little crisper just what we mean by such a huge engaged audience, okay? We have always talked about the 200 million or so unique users. We put a little bit finer point on that by focusing on the app by saying, we get about 4 million daily app users, which is 3x the size of our nearest competitor. And the key to growth really is nothing more complicated than converting more of those 4 million daily app users into transacting customers, okay? Another kind of really interesting and eye-opening data points that I talked about in my script was that we actually have 1.4 million of the actual homebuyers last year raised their hand to connect with us, all right? And yet we've only ended up with 3% customer transaction share. We said 360,000 transactions. So the big long lever is converting users into transactions, into customer transactions. We're better at it. We're going to be better at -- we have a history of driving that transaction penetration, no question. And innovation in both product and business model has been what that's about. But we have a lot more experience now because we have been in the guts of the business buying and selling thousands of homes. We've built a bunch of stuff to support that, and that puts us in a terrific position to now build what we're calling this housing super app, which will act as the integration and dashboard of bringing these disparate components of the process altogether in 1 place in a really interesting way. I'll pass it over to Allen by saying the 2025 -- highlighting that the 2025 targets assume that we take that 3% transaction share to 6% transaction share. And given all the stuff we're doing, especially, say, in the closer term, in terms of touring and financing with mortgages, we think that is achievable and exciting. I guess I served some of the dinner in there and we overlapped. But there were 2 other things in there, you were talking about the slope, Allen, in Brian's question, and that is kind of implicit in it, its kind of where are we in the S curve of penetration, where are we in the S curve of market share? And is the path from here to 2025 convex, linear, concave, what is it? Here, my expectations are that once we get to the 6%, given this giant gap between the 6% and our usage and engagement numbers, which are 2/3 of the industry, of actual buyers that are using the site, I would expect -- it is my expectation that we will be continuing to invest for growth in a prudent way at that point. And so I expect continued growth. I don't know what that means about the implications of the curve, but I hope it's linear or better. And then on the sell-side transaction question, yes, I think you can kind of connect dots based on what we shared and get at what our estimated sell-side transactions that we're getting -- that we are monetizing today is. It is a nontrivial chunk of our 360,000 customer transactions that we estimate.  And mainly, that is because people who are coming to buy homes with Zillow and with our partners, at least half of them are also selling their home, and a whole bunch of them do end up selling with our Premier Agent partners. And so we already access the sell side of the market. Now we want to enhance that and drive share there with more products and the super app, but we already have a terrific foothold today. All right. That was a long answer, sorry, but thanks for the question. Sorry, I was on mute, yes. And on your second part, Brad, look, what we what we have come to fully realize is something that, I guess, we should all intuitively understand. And that is -- I don't know if -- like, Ford for the Super Bowl ads that they have coming up is not going to make an advertisement that says, sell your current car, okay? What they're do -- what their marketing on the Super Bowl ad is the dream of the new car with the red bow on it in the driveway. The housing equivalent of that, it holds. People -- the inspiration and aspiration of the move is the new place. The greatest seller lead opportunity we have is in helping people dream about the new house, okay? And we have a really fantastic position in that, that we're already converting into some sell-side business today. Now we also understand that solving this kind of painful but necessary part of the super app, part of the moving process of selling your house is a big deal and having good solves for that with creative new solutions is an important area of innovation, and we are fully embracing that. As you well know, we ran a big giant experiment with iBuying so we know a whole lot more about that now, and we'll pitch a big test over that and are innovating and working with partners to make sure we have compelling offerings to solve that particular problem. Okay. Hey, John. You want me to -- Allen, I'll start with the macro stuff and maybe Brad, jump in if I get it -- if and when I get it wrong. I realize that we're in a particularly interesting macro environment, given the high level of uncertainty, okay? We are well aware that it's more uncertain than usual. But our economists forecast strong macro and strong housing market this year, following up a very strong market in 2021. In fact, I think highest trends at number of transactions since 2006, Brad, am I right? Am I getting a nod? All right, correct. Thank you. I don't want to get that wrong. It didn't certainly feel like that last year, did it, because inventory was so low and inventory continues to be low, but that doesn't mean there can't be a lot of transactions. And while our economists are forecasting that, we are taking -- Allen and his team are certainly taking the more uncertain than usual into account. What's driving the strength is this kind of millennial tide that's rising. They are really -- this demographic tide is rising on the industry and that coupled with supply that's not rising as fast is making this, we think, continuing to be a strong market.  Did I say that okay, Allen, Brad? Okay. But what Allen said about low single-digit 3% HPA home price appreciation and flat transactions, that's not a macro call we're making. We're just -- that's just for modeling purposes. That's what we've done. So that's not our macro call. I mean, that 3% compares to what, 9% CAGR since 1971 or is that total industry? Anyway, 1 more thing, sorry. I'd be remiss if I didn't say amidst all this macro conversation, which I understand is important for a read-through to all of our businesses in the economy, I get it. But really the big shift that we are on the leading edge of is the shift in a giant industry, the largest perhaps in the U.S., of moving from the offline non-digital way of doing things to the online digital way of doing things with us as the leader in that. And that actually is really the most important lever and shift from a macro perspective to our long-term results. Mark, maybe I'll start, and Allen, you guys jump in. When you break it down into the components, it doesn't feel -- it feels doable to me, Mark, and I'm a big believer in BHAGs. I don't even know if I'd call this BHAG, a big hairy audacious goal. It is, no doubt, not timid, okay? But these goals end up being self-fulfilling because of the creativity they tend to release internally with all the smart people we have and given the resources we have, I'm confident. But 2 rather low bits of hanging fruit. We talked about a bit on conversion here is getting on top and really taking advantage of our position with home touring and building a digital home tour reservation system. Right now, it's super complicated to schedule a home tour. And so a good deal of home tour request demand goes unfulfilled. I don't know what the data point on that, is that, Brad? -- we might -- I think in my script, I said 3x the conversion, Brad. I'm not sure, but -- Yes, okay. So 3x the conversion when we actually connect a partner with a customer on a tour. And so that -- it doesn't take too much imagination to see how us wiring up that into the Zillow super app experience could drive increased conversion rate to transaction. Another 1 is financing. I did mortgages. I talked already quite a bit about that. But we had our guns in mortgages all trained towards iBuying. So all the work we've really been doing for the last couple of years with Zillow Home Loans and building our own mortgage operation was in service to iBuying. And a lot of it was actually pretty interesting. And we have this factor. We had not been focused on the bigger lever, on the bigger opportunity, which is basically distributing a mortgage product directly to our customers and via our Premier Agent partners. In this time period, we are confident that we will be able to develop our fantastic partner network into a distribution network for our mortgage that will then be just integrated into the super app in a way that puts the mortgage in its proper place, which really is kind of a painful but important support stepping stone along the way to the new house. We just wanted to be integrated right into the super app. I don't know if that -- I mean, there is a lot more to driving to that 6% but those are 2 of the big ones. Allen, do you want to take a stab at that? Well, it's taken a lot. I guess what I'd say, Ryan, its like strategically, you've been hearing us talk about Zillow 2.0 and the move towards the transaction for a few years, right? And we -- it's taken us this long to get to a point where we could even find the transaction to count, given the diversity of our business model. And so a big reason we don't have a good historical comp for you on that is that we don't have historical comps. We have worked really hard to come up with this estimate so that we can -- to communicate to you all for sure, but this is how we want to manage our business and our strategy internally, all right? So this is super important for us to get right internally. But as Allen pointed out, the history of the company is about slowly but surely driving conversion rates from user in the customer. And now we have what we think it should be a pretty good denominator for that. Yes. I mean, it's an opportunity. I would call -- looking at Zillow, our history is that a consistent but opportunistic acquirer, okay? When we see opportunities to really accelerate what we're trying to do strategically, we will take advantage of that. And the ShowingTime acquisition last year is a good example of that. A couple of years ago when we acquired Mortgage Lenders of America, to get a -- not have a cold start on our mortgage operation, that was another one. Jeremy Hoffman, who runs our corp dev group in addition to strategy and IR, is probably the most popular guy in proptech. So we talk with, we run tests with, partner with all of these companies in the space. We don't have an explicit incubation venture capital -- kind of corporate venture capital endeavour. We do have a lot of opportunity in that regard. We don't necessarily think we need to invest because when things want to trade, everything kind of lands on our doorstep first anyway. And I don't want to sound too opportunistic that way, we have really good relationships with these companies, and we think there's a lot of cool innovation happening. All right. Thank you all for showing up. It is -- as I said at the end of my prepared remarks, it's a really, really fun and entertaining, endlessly interesting industry real estate is, maybe not quite as entertaining as Netflix but not too far off. We're really psyched to be on the journey with you and we'll talk to you soon. Thanks."

            "name": "Allen Parker",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich, and hello, everyone. I'm going to take a brief moment to provide an update on the progress of winding down our iBuying operations. I'll then discuss our quarterly results and Q1 outlook and will conclude with comments on our newly announced 2025 products. As previously discussed, we expected a wide range of potential results for the home segment this quarter as we work to free up operational and renovation capacity and pursue retail strategies in order to protect the value of our assets and optimize the speed of the wind-down, all while respectively managing our people. This quarter, we reported home segment revenue of $3.3 billion, well exceeding our updated outlook range of $2.3 billion to $2.9 billion provided in early December. The revenue outperformance benefited from a combination of better renovation capacity that allowed us to accelerate listings in Q4 as well as better retail velocity. With the better-than-expected resale and better prices, we had $93 million of write-down in the quarter compared to previously expected additional losses of $240 million to $265 million in Q4. This brings our total write-down to $405 million for Q3 and Q4, an improvement of $160 million compared to the midpoint of our initial estimated range. The better-than-expected write-down resulted in Q4 EBITDA loss of $206 million, $141 million better than our outlook range for a loss of $347 million at the midpoint. We continue to make good progress on winding down this business and have now sold or entered into agreements to sell and dispose more than 85% of the homes in the home segment that we expected to resell during the entire wind-down process. In January, we finished acquiring all the homes that we plan to buy. We continue to expect to sell most of our remaining homes inventory by the end of Q2 2022, with a small number of homes remaining thereafter. We have updated our expected iBuying wind-down restructuring costs to $175 million to $205 million in aggregate compared to the $175 million to $230 million we previously expected. $71 million was recognized in Q4 and the remainder we expect to be realized in 2022. We expect the approximately $800 million of cash equity that was in the inventory at end of Q3 will more than cover the realized losses on inventory, operating cost and the cash portion of restructuring cost of the wind-down. As a result, we now expect the net effect of the wind-down of iBuying operations to be cash flow positive in aggregate, slightly better than our prior outlook of at least cash flow neutral at the end of Q3. I would like to sincerely thank our dedicated employees who have been executing the wind-down process. Moving to the core business results. We'll start with IMT revenue, which was $483 million, growing 14% year-over-year and 51% on a 2-year stack basis, which accelerated compared to the 43% 2-year growth in Q3. Our IMT segment revenue came in slightly above the $481 million midpoint of our guidance, driven primarily by Premier Agent revenue at the low end of our outlook range and better-than-expected results in our rentals business. PA revenue grew 13% year-over-year, which outperformed industry growth of 4% and posted accelerating 2-year stack growth of 52% compared to 49% 2-year growth in Q3. The Omicron variant and severe cold weather resulted in lower new for-sale listings in late Q4, which had a slight impact on our results but remain within our expected seasonal range and outlook. Rentals revenue was flat year-over-year but better than we anticipated despite continued pressures from high occupancy rates, which dampens demand for rentals advertising. We saw stronger-than-expected customer interest in applications and success in renters leasing properties. Rentals also faced a difficult second half comp due to strong 2020 results following the initial impact from COVID-related volatility a year ago. IMT segment EBITDA and margin were $220 million and 46% for Q4, respectively, exceeding our outlook of $200 million and 42% at the midpoint. The outperformance was driven by increased operating efficiency as well as lower-than-anticipated advertising and marketing spend. For 2021, IMT segment adjusted EBITDA was $853 million or 45% of IMT segment revenue, representing more than 2,100 basis points of margin expansion over 2019. We have continuously driven operating efficiencies by prioritizing and streamlining internal processes and recognizing the efficiency of marketing. I would also like to call out that our high gross margins enabled us to invest in innovating on behalf of our customers, partners and our platform customers to drive future growth while delivering industry-leading EBITDA within online real estate. Mortgages segment revenue of $51 million came in at the high end of our Q4 outlook range as refinancing loan originations did not slow as much as expected, while gain on sale margins compressed within our expectations. Segment adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $14 million, near the midpoint of our outlook as we expected lower profitability due to lower purchase volume from unwinding our iBuying operations. I would like to reiterate that Zillow's financial position remains strong and flexible.  We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and investments, slightly less than $3.2 billion at the end of Q3. After the impact of our $302 million in share repurchases in December, largely offset by earnings from our IMT segment. The wind-down leaves us in a strong position to invest in more scalable customer solutions that are less capital-intensive as we execute on our vision and make strategic long-term investments. Our expectation is that we will continue to be a positive earnings and positive cash flow company with our revised product strategy. Turning to our outlook. For the first quarter, in our IMT segment, we expect 9% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 at the midpoint, within an outlook range of 7% to 11% and 47% 2-year growth. Within the IMT segment, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be between $358 million to $368 million, up 9% year-over-year and up 50% over Q1 2020 at the midpoint of our outlook.  Our wider-than-normal IMT and PA Q1 outlook revenue ranges are informed by the following. We saw slower housing activity late in Q4 and have also seen a slow start to new for-sale inventory listings in Q1. Despite that, our customer and agent activity levels indicate strong customer demand, which is consistent with the Conference Board's December consumer survey indicating plans to buy a home during the next 6 months were at record levels and recovered sharply from lower levels at the end of September. In other IMT, we continue to expect headwinds in rentals from the continued low industry vacancy rates and in new construction because of builders' low inventory levels. We expect Q1 IMT EBITDA margin to be 41%, at the midpoint of our outlook. This margin reflects the investment level we believe is necessary to drive innovation and execution towards our 2025 targets. We expect our Mortgages segment revenue to be between $44 million to $49 million in Q1, which is down sequentially from Q4. Our Q1 outlook reflects slower industry refinance activity from the recent move in interest rates, consistent gain on sale spreads and slower growth in purchase originations impacted by the wind-down of our iBuying operations.  As a result of lower sequential revenue and continued investments to grow mortgage originations, we expect the Mortgages segment EBITDA to be between a loss of $17 million and a loss of $12 million, as we focus on preparing customers to be transaction-ready through intuitive and digitized mortgage offerings, we are working to integrate mortgages across our platform with a focus on purchase originations. We expect these efforts to make progress over the course of this year. In Q1, we expect our home segment revenue to be $2.75 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be a loss of $37.5 million at the midpoint of our outlook range. Given the wind-down of our iBuying operations and the path forward we see, we think it is prudent to initiate new financial targets for year-end 2025.  Before doing so, we wanted to remind you of where we stand on our February 2019 3- to 5-year targets. We have just completed the third year of the original targets and are expecting to soon be run-rating the $2 billion IMT segment revenue targets. And we are already well above our original IMT segment EBITDA targets of $600 million or 30% margin. As we wind down iBuying operations, the original home segment and related Zillow Home Loans attach related targets are no longer relevant. With that, I'll take a moment to walk through the 2025 financial model that we've included in the investor deck published on the IR website today. Our long-term growth model shows how we plan to deliver Zillow's new 2025 financial projects. The model is quite simple: industry customer transactions times transaction share times average revenue per customer transaction for our PA, ZHL and VCS services, added to other services and marketplaces revenue that include rentals, new construction, mortgage marketplace and real estate industry services. It's important to note that we are assuming no growth in overall existing home sales from 2021 levels and only 3% annual appreciation for the industry. This is not a macro call we are making on our outlook. It is merely the approach we took to look at how we can drive strong secular growth. Simply put, we expect to grow our share of customer transactions from 3% to 6%, which should drive over 700,000 customer transactions annually. We have a good understanding of our customers' key pain points and are focused on executing better connections, touring, mortgage approvals and expanding seller services. By better meeting their needs, we expect our customers to remain engaged deeper into our funnel, which should double our market share and also drive higher revenue per transaction via the expanded services. This model implies 24% revenue CAGR, yielding our 2025 targets of $5 billion in annual revenue and $2.25 billion in EBITDA, which equates to 45% EBITDA margin. We expect margins to scale with our revenue while we continue to invest prudently where we see opportunities to drive growth. As we look forward, our priorities remain focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners. We plan to: grow our customer engagement through a compelling dream and shop experience; deliver a more integrated customer transactional experience to drive customers to choose to transact with us and our partners; invest in sustainable top line growth opportunities across the company, including new integrated services that are more scalable, less subject to earnings volatility and more capital efficient; and lastly, manage our cost structure and improve productivity to drive a profitable, scalable and positive cash flow company.  And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. Yes. Thanks, Rich. And thanks for asking the question, Brian. So I guess I'll start with, -- the 2025 financial targets was an opportunity for us to add some more transparency about the opportunity that's ahead of us that we're excited about as well as clarify the strong position we currently are in. And so as we think about that path to $5 billion and 45% EBITDA, as we've talked about, it's driven by this expectation that broader integrated offerings are going to drive both more transactions and higher revenue per transaction than where we are today. And from a modeling perspective and starting with the 12.2 million customer TAM, both the buy side and sell side. We talked about the 360,000 transactions we participate in today and just growing that share of 3% to 6%. In addition to that, it's taking the revenue per transaction we get today of around $4,100 and growing that to $5,200 a transaction. And we think that comes from having more customers using more of our services in an integrated way. In addition, I'll just call out that those 2025 targets include our other marketplace and industry software solutions businesses growing from $609 million in 2021 to $1.2 billion in 2025. As we think about the slope, we provided guidance for Q1. We think that this model is driven off of our ability to control and drive secular growth by serving the customer and integrating better with our partners. And I think there are some more near-term things and some longer-term things as we innovate, that's kind of the innovation path. And we'll continue to share as we can how that slope may play out. But right now, I think what we'd say is we feel really comfortable based on the position we're in today with our brand, our audience, our partner network, our current standing with the number of -- the 1.4 million buyers who utilize our site today and the financial position we are in and the business model that can generate positive cash flow to execute well on the 2025 targets. Do you want me to start with the MVP Flex transaction, Rich? Thanks, Brad. I'll take the first part of the question. Okay. So I guess how I would describe it, Brad, is that we feel like we have a very strong Premier Agent partner network both across our MBP and our Flex models. Flex, in and of itself, is not a driver for transactions, but it is a driver for better alignment between ourselves, our customers and our partners, we feel. And so we will continue to innovate and iterate on ways to align our partners with our products and services and our customers in ways to generate more transactions, higher conversion and more revenue per transaction. So we're very pleased with where we are, both on the MBP and Flex model. And I wouldn't call one or the other out as the biggest driver of the journey to the 2025 targets. But I think the key is alignment. And as Rich mentioned, the more integrated transaction with tools that serve our customers well and also sort of our partner network flow. Yes. And I'll just add on top of that, that as you mentioned, Rich, our Q1 guide reflects some of that macro uncertainty that Rich talked about in the short term. The lower new sale listings, high occupancy rates and rentals and lower builder inventory are all reflective in and formed our Q1 guide. But we continue to see strong demand signals on our site and strong interest from our partners with very low churn. And so the opportunity, we feel well positioned as we look at this opportunity in this path to the 2025 targets to focus the customer, improving our partner network and providing them tools, and that -- we believe that the 2025 targets are appropriately aggressive but achievable through a lot of the things that we just talked about. Just to get on the macro and how it affects our '25 targets, I just want to reiterate that our 2025 financial targets are based on flat industry transaction assumptions, so no increase in industry transactions and low single-digit HPA assumptions. So our model and the KPIs that we built really are based on our opportunity to innovate and integrate our services and drive secular growth based on the strong foundation that we have. Yes. And the only thing that I'd just, I guess, reiterate, you talked about some of the features and services that we think are going to improve conversion. But starting with this 25% of homebuyers already asking to speak to an agent. And so those being customers that have raised their hand is a great starting point. And that's only being 1 in 4 right now gives us confidence that these services and improved features of integration should give us quite a bit of leverage as we go through and grow this transaction count. Yes, yes. I guess what I'd say is that when we made a decision in 2018 to go deeper into the transaction, we -- that was the start of us taking a harder look at how can we drive transactions and success for our customers through the transaction. And maybe the proxy I'll use is connections. But since 2019, we've seen our ability to drive connections and conversion through our partner agent base grow. I don't have the, I guess, the analogue to -- compared to the 1.4 million, 360,000, but we have seen growth as we started to focus on ensuring our customers were connected with an agent were served well. And I think you heard about us talk about connections, high-intent customers and the things we've done to drive that and close transactions versus the more ad-based or lead-based gen that we had been prior to '19.  I don't know, Brad or Rich, would you add anything to that? I just don't have the data."

And with that, I turn the call over to Rich.\nRich Barton: Thanks, Brad. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. This afternoon, we announced financial results for the third quarter and, most notably, our decision to wind down our Zillow Offers operations, which will unfortunately involve a reduction in our workforce of approximately 25% over the next few quarters. This decision was not taken lightly, especially considering the hard work and commitment from the Zillow Offers team. But ultimately, we determined that further scaling up Zillow Offers is too risky, too volatile to our earnings and operations, too low of a return on equity opportunity and too narrow in its ability to serve our customers, a tough but necessary determination. Before getting into the results for the quarter, I'd like to explain our logic. As you've heard numerous times from me on these calls, our vision is to help people unlock life's next chapter. We are uniquely well positioned to deliver on this vision, given our audience, our brand and our profitable and growing core business. In service of this vision, we are innovating on products and services that allow us to evolve from a search and find company to one that is directly helping our customers transact and move. We call this Zillow 2.0 and it firmly remains our vision today. We've made many investments towards Zillow 2.0, one of the biggest being Zillow Offers as a way to provide a compelling product offering for home sellers. When we decided to take a big swing on Zillow Offers 3.5 years ago, our aim was to become a market maker, not a market risk taker. And this was underpinned by the need to forecast the price of homes accurately three to six months into the future. We used historical data and countless simulations to test this belief. We set unit economic targets that required us to stay within plus or minus 200 basis points in breakeven, holding ourselves accountable to these levels publicly with you all. Yet in our short tenure operating Zillow Offers, we've experienced a series of extraordinary events: a global pandemic, a temporary freezing of the housing market and then a supply/demand imbalance that led to a rise in home prices at a rate that was without precedent. We have been unable to accurately forecast future home prices at different times in both directions by much more than we modeled as possible, with Zillow Offers unit economics on a quarterly basis swinging from plus 576 basis points in Q2 to an expected minus 500 to minus 700 basis points in Q4. Put simply, our observed error rate has been far more volatile than we ever expected possible and makes us look far more like a leveraged housing trader than the market maker we set out to be. We could blame this outsized volatility on exogenous black swan events, tweak our models based on what we've learned and press on. But based on our experience to-date, it would be na\u00efve to assume unpredictable price forecasting and disruption events will not happen in the future. Because of the price forecasting volatility, we have also had to reconsider what the business would look like at a larger scale. We have offered sellers a fair market price from the start, but we've also been clear that the business only becomes consistently profitable at scale. With the price forecasting volatility we have observed and now must expect in the future, we have determined that the scale would require too much equity capital, create too much volatility in our earnings and balance sheet, and ultimately, result in a far lower return on equity than we imagined. We have also experienced significant capacity and demand planning challenges, exacerbated by an admittedly difficult labor and supply chain environment. The combination of these factors has caused a meaningful backup in our processing of homes in the Zillow pipeline, which we announced two weeks ago. We judged future significant volume volatility to be a tough impediment to ramp a scaled operation, and any interruptions in the supply chain like we recently experienced will result in increased holding times, further increasing our exposure to volatility and lowering our return on equity. A final factor in this wind-down decision is that to-date, we have been able to serve only a limited number of customers. We've been able to convert only about 10% of the serious sellers who ask for a Zillow Offer, and we have tended to disappoint the roughly 90% who didn't sell through us. Given our hard-earned position at the top of the seller funnel with 220 million-plus average monthly unique users and the popularity of the Zestimate, there are better, broader, less risky, more brand-aligned ways of enabling all of our customers who want to move. So, these are the essential components of our wind-down logic. Our price forecasting accuracy was far more volatile than we planned for and was further exacerbated by unpredictable black swan-type events. And that volatility contributed to operational volatility and cash flow and balance sheet volatility that is beyond the tolerance level that we are comfortable with moving forward. Lastly, we believe this is an opportunity to refocus and more broadly address a wider audience of customers with more asset-light solutions. Of course, the natural question is, what's next? Before I get there, it's worth highlighting how strong our core business is, which has thrived while we port its profits into our ZO iBuying operation. Over that investment period, we expect IMT segment revenue to increase 57% from a reported $1.2 billion in 2018 to $1.9 billion in 2021 at the midpoint of our outlook range. Further, we expect IMT segment adjusted EBITDA to increase by nearly 3.5 times from $240 million in 2018 to $833 million in 2021 at the midpoint of our outlook range. So, we start the what's next conversation from a position of strength because of how the core business has performed. As we move forward, we remain focused on the same key areas, all with the end goal of helping turn dreamers into movers. First and foremost, we are going to continue to create engaging experiences that attract people to our apps and sites in droves on a daily basis. Most prominently, we believe our ability to continually improve the Zestimate to be fundamental and foundational to our top of funnel audience and brand advantage. As those that dream with us start to shop with us, we will continue to evolve our capabilities to make our shopping experience more digital and less friction-filled. Now that showing time is officially part of Zillow Group, we will go to work on solving another pain point for home shoppers and agents, the cumbersome process of scheduling a tour. The touring opportunity is spiritually similar to the opportunity we pursued with our Connections program back in 2018. Removing friction and streamlining communication between home shoppers and agents was one of our first steps towards a better and more integrated home shopping experience. We expect showing time will help us enable another. Coupled with the frictionless shopping experience must be capable partners, internal operators, and seamless tools and technology to service our customers. For our Premier Agent business, that means continuing to work with high-performing partners to convert -- that convert our high-intent shoppers into movers. For Zillow Home Loans and Zillow Closing Services, that means continuing to enable integration on our moving platform. Zillow 360 is an example of the potential golden path for our customers, a seamless move through shopping, connecting, selling, buying, financing, and closing, a single place for all customers moving needs. The change necessitated by today's announcement is the evolution of how we will help a customer sell her current home. Before today, the selling option was overly focused on Zillow Offers and was able to serve only a small number of our available customer set. Going forward, we will have the ability to plug in multiple, more scalable solutions to offer better customer choice. Instead of a sole focus on solving the seller's pain point by purchasing from her ourselves as the primary through Zillow Offers, we will expand our view and explore marketplace as selling solutions that give her certainty and convenience all while addressing the broader opportunity. In solving for her move, however, we plan to focus on solutions that are asset and capital-light for Zillow. We can still offer choice, simplicity, speed, and convenience. We will be open-minded about our exploration into providing these sell solutions ourselves and/or through partners. Both are interesting. And rather than having to buy her home to help her sell, we are now simply going to help her sell. We are confident our current and future technology platform and tools will enable us to deliver an increasingly integrated digital and seamless experience via our own services and through partners. We continue to be in a competitively advantageous position due to our audience, our brand, and our healthy and profitable core business. We see opportunity in using our learnings from Zillow Offers, our tools and our capabilities to broaden our seller focus beyond only iBuying. Further, we look forward to using these same tools and services to increase conversion and attach rate in our large home buyer funnel. For perspective, Zillow overall still only participates in a mid-single-digit market share of transactions today, despite being used by almost every shopper, dreamer, renter, financer and mover in the country. The opportunity continues to be very large to drive growth with higher conversion and to increase the depth, number and integration of the services we offer our customers. Before I close and hand it over to Allen, I'd like you all to know how personal this is for me. I am founder and first money into Zillow 16 years ago and am the largest individual shareholder. I distinctly remember brainstorming to come up with the name of the company with my co-Founder, Lloyd, and then buying zillow.com for $8.95 on GoDaddy all those years ago. It weighs heavily on me that our strategic decision to wind down the Zillow Offers operation after 3.5 years involves having to let about 25% of our great colleagues go over the coming quarters. I'm sorry for how difficult and disruptive this will be. I am grateful to them. They have worked hard and will be missed. We are committed to providing a smooth transition for those affected. The decision was tough but absolutely necessary, given the capital risk and volatility that is now obviously inherent to the Zillow Offers iBuying business. After careful assessment and volatile earnings, instead of doubling down on a single capital-constrained risk-heavy solution, we will focus on the broader problem, helping people move, and we continue the mission of having solutions that can be accessed by everyone moving, not just a narrow set of folks who have to negotiate with us as the primary buyer, leaving most unsatisfied when we can't come to terms. We are lucky to have a strong and growing core Marketplace business from which to invest moving forward. We are lucky to have a courageous team who have helped us on our journey and the strong culture of innovation that encourages taking big swings but also is clear-eyed when we miss. We are lucky to have a deep untapped well of opportunity for innovation in our massive user base, partner network and trusted brands. And finally, as a shareholder, I am lucky to have fellow investors who will appreciate both the necessity and the opportunity in this decision. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Allen for his comments. Allen?\nAllen Parker: Thank you, Rich. You've heard a lot about Zillow Offers, but we should not lose sight of the strong core business results we continue to produce in Q3. Zillow Group reported Q3 results for our IMT and Mortgages segments as well as Premier Agent revenue within or above our previously provided revenue and EBITDA outlook ranges. Premier Agent revenue growth of 20% year-over-year remains strong. IMT segment EBITDA margin of 43.1% was better than expected. Our Mortgages segment revenue grew 30% year-over-year to $70 million, exceeding our outlook range. Moving into more detail. Q3 IMT segment revenue was $480 million, growing 16% year-over-year and 43% on a two-year stacked basis compared to Q3 of 2019. Our IMT segment revenue growth continued to benefit from our Premier Agent business. We continue to execute on making better connections between our high-intent customers and high-performing agents, driving higher monetization. Turning to other revenue within our IMT segment. Our Rentals business decelerated primarily due to a difficult comparison in Q3 as a result of abnormal seasonality in 2020. Rentals revenue also underperformed our expectations as we incurred headwinds related to high rental occupancy rates, which tempered advertising demand. IMT segment EBITDA was $207 million in Q3, exceeding our outlook. The IMT segment EBITDA margin outperformance was driven by increased operating efficiency, as well as less than previously planned second half overall Zillow brand marketing spend. Mortgages segment revenue increased 30% year-over-year in Q3 to $70 million, and Mortgages segment EBITDA was a positive $5 million, compared to the midpoint of our outlook range of a loss of $9.5 million. Total loan origination volume was up 115% in Q3 year-over-year and up 25% sequentially from Q2, driven by growth in our loan originations business. Purchase loan origination volume was up 119% and refinance loan origination volume was up 113% year-over-year. Now to address a few more details in our Home segment and Zillow Offers business. We reported Q3 Home segment revenue of $1.2 billion, below our outlook range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. We reported Q3 Home segment EBITDA loss of $381 million, below our outlook range, impacted by $304 million of an inventory write-down. The revenue miss was primarily driven by capacity constraints as we overestimated our ability to quickly scale operations in addition to industry-wide renovation labor supply constraints. This resulted in a shift in home closings into Q4 that were previously expected to close in Q3. For clarity, I want to provide some additional details behind the inventory valuation process and the recognition and timing of losses. For inventory on our balance sheet, at period end, we compare our cost basis, our purchase price of inventory and other capitalized inventory costs to the estimated net realizable value, our estimated future selling price of those homes less estimated cost to sell. This resulted in the recognition of a $304 million inventory write-down included in Home segment cost of revenue in Q3. We expect to recognize additional inventory losses in Q4 of approximately $240 million to $265 million. These estimated losses primarily relate to homes that were under contract to purchase as of the end of Q3 that we expect to acquire during Q4 and that we expect to resell for less than purchased. The Zillow Enterprise remains in a strong position with more than sufficient liquidity to weather the impact of home purchases in Zillow Offers in Q4. We ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and investments. We expect the net effect of the wind-down of Zillow Offers to be at least cash flow neutral in the aggregate. We believe the wind-down will leave us in a strong position to invest in more scalable customer solutions that are less capital intensive as we execute our Zillow 2.0 vision and make strategic long-term investments. Our expectation is that we will be a positive earnings and positive cash flow company with our revised product strategy once the wind-down is complete. In addition to what I just discussed, we expect the following in relation to our wind-down plan. As disclosed in the Form 8-K we filed earlier this afternoon, in addition to the inventory losses we expect to record in Q4, we expect to record additional pretax charges of approximately $175 million to $230 million related to the wind-down of Zillow Offers operations, primarily in Q4 and in the first half of 2022. These charges are expected to include certain employee retention and termination costs, cost to exit contractual obligations, including borrowing and lease arrangements and write-offs of long-lived assets. We expect unit economics to be between negative 500 to negative 700 basis points before interest expense in Q4 as informed by our Q3 inventory write-down and Q4 outlook. As a result of homes already under contract but not yet purchased as of the end of Q3, we expect to continue to grow our inventory balance during Q4 and then expect inventory to begin to decline in future periods. We expect to sell most of the remaining homes inventory primarily by the end of Q2 2022, with a small number of homes remaining thereafter. This implies that we will invest cash and inventory during Q4 as our inventory balance grows, and we'll begin to see cash flow back to Zillow as our inventory levels decrease through the first half of 2022. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. In our IMT segment, we expect 13% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 and 50% growth over Q4 2019 at the midpoint of our outlook range. Within IMT segment, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be between $354 million to $362 million, up 14% year-over-year and up 53% over Q4 2019 at the midpoint of our outlook. We expect Q4 IMT EBITDA margin to be 42% at the midpoint of our outlook, roughly flat sequentially from 43% in Q3. Our outlook includes our plans to continue to invest in staffing and technology in Q4 to drive our 2.0 vision, including things like touring, bundling products such as Zillow 360, expanding 3D photos and floor plans along with continuing to invest in integrating Zillow 2.0 products. Separately, we closed our acquisition of ShowingTime on September 30, which will be included in our IMT segment results beginning in Q4. We are beginning to integrate ShowingTime's platform and are excited about the opportunity to better serve our customers and partners. We plan to invest further in innovating ShowingTime's solutions to better serve the entire industry. In Q4, we expect our Homes segment revenue to be between $1.9 billion -- we expect Homes segment revenue to be $1.9 billion and EBITDA to be a loss of $348 million at the midpoint of our outlook range. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to record an additional loss in Q4 of between $240 million and $265 million, primarily related to the homes under contract to purchase as of the end of Q3 that we expect to purchase in Q4. During Q4, given our resale capacity constraints, we expect our inventory balance to grow and then decline beginning in Q1 of 2022. We expect there could be a wide array of results in Q4 for our Homes segment as we work to free up operational and renovation capacity and pursue various resale strategies as we seek to protect the value of our assets and optimize our wind-down while respectfully managing our people. We expect our Mortgages segment revenue to be between $47 million to $52 million in Q4, which is down sequentially from Q3. Our Q4 outlook reflects slower industry refinance activity from the recent move in interest rates, slight compression in gain on sale spreads and slower growth in purchase originations impacted by the wind-down of Zillow Offers operations. As a result of lower sequential revenue and continued investments to grow mortgage originations, we expect Mortgages segment EBITDA to be between a loss of $16 million and $11 million in Q4. While we are in the midst of 2022 planning, we wanted to share that we are focused internally on continuing to drive secular growth faster than the industry. We do want to highlight that during 2021, our Premier Agent business has outgrown the industry in each quarter and expect the business to continue to do so in our Q4 outlook. While there are near-term cyclical pressures on some of our other Marketplace businesses, we are hard at work with initiatives to drive growth regardless. We are also well-positioned with our strong traffic in our other IMT marketplaces to benefit as rental and new construction supply and demand imbalances normalize and when these advertising pressures subside. We have a large audience, but a significant growth opportunity with only approximately mid-single-digit market share of industry transactions. Progress on improving connections and showings as well as the customer dream, shop, buy, sell, rent, and finance experiences are among the numerous tangible initiatives we are delivering to continue to drive secular growth to connect more high-intent customers with a growing mix of high-performing partners. As we look forward, my priorities remain focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners, and I look to ensure an orderly wind-down of Zillow Offers operations, right-size our cost structure, and improve productivity to drive a profitable, scalable, and positive cash flow company, drive prioritization to invest in sustainable topline growth opportunities across the company, including new integrated services that are more scalable, less subject to earnings volatility, and more capital efficient. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Brad Erickson with RBC Capital Markets.\nBrad Erickson: Hi thanks. So, a couple of questions. One, I recognize, Rich, you've explained things in the shareholder letter [announced](ph) a few minutes ago. But I think people really want to understand just the mechanics maybe a bit better of what went wrong here, particularly in the bidding. So, let's start there, and then I have a follow-up.\nRich Barton: Yes. Hey Brad, thanks for the question. We were -- fundamentally, we have been unable to predict future pricing of homes to a level of accuracy that makes this a safe business to be in. We hadn't modeled this kind of pricing market nor supply market to even be possible when we got the business going. And we've seen all this volatility in both directions right now in the wrong direction. And we're still at a scale that is small compared to what it needs to be. And so as we put our minds in the state of, all right, we've got these new assumptions that we'd be na\u00efve not to assume will happen again in the future, we pump them into the model and the model cranks out a business that has a high likelihood, at some point, of putting the whole company at risk, not just the business, but in the more normal case, just causes a ton of volatility in earnings, which is not a great look for a public company. That's -- basically, that's what it boils down to. There's capacity issues, et cetera, that we can talk about, that we've had internally and externally on the backdrop of a really tight environment. What it boils down to is our inability to have confidence in pricing in the future, enough confidence to put our own capital at risk that we don't have to.\nBrad Erickson: Got it. And then I guess the follow-up is you mentioned looking to expand solutions to work with sellers in different ways, despite no longer doing iBuying. So I guess the question is, can you just, I guess, expand on some of those tools that you might engage with for those sellers with this new shift in strategy? Thanks.\nRich Barton: Yes, okay. So most -- I don't want to say all, it's probably not all, but it's certainly most sellers in the market, even when they're at the very early stages of selling, maybe we'll call it dreaming, transitioning to selling, they show up in our apps. They look at their Zestimate. They start talking to people. They start looking at comps and consuming information. We have a lot of very interesting, highly engaged touch points that -- with these customers. And we've learned a whole lot about transitioning that light touch into a conversation. In doing Zillow Offers, we've learned a ton about that. And so whether the front door is through the Zestimate or through a request for prequalification or looking for an agent or just wanting advice, we have a lot of ways to take a customer conversation from a kind of a shallow one to an advisory conversation. And we look forward to being able to now refocus more broadly on that, that set of customers rather than basically having one really, really having the organization and all our profits from the core business focused on that one thing to sell in the store. We only have kind of one thing to sell in the store in our iBuying operation. This is going to free us up from having to think so narrowly. We think that these are still interesting solutions, but it frees us up from having to think so narrowly and we can capitalize on a broader opportunity.\nBrad Erickson: Got it. Thanks.\nRich Barton: Yes. Thanks, Brad.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan McKeveny with Zelman & Associates.\nRyan McKeveny: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Rich, I want to focus again on kind of what's next for Zillow. So if I just think about the evolution to Zillow 2.0 and the efforts to build a more integrated experience, obviously, the last few years, iBuying has been a big piece of that, longer-term vision of getting the Zestimate effectively to a live bid. And to Brad's question, you mentioned being committed to creating that integrated experience still, solving pain points, doing so asset and capital light. I guess just asked slightly differently, I mean, big picture, Zillow has always been mainly a platform that's monetized the buy side. And I think a lot of people looked at iBuying and said, this is opening up that sell-side opportunity. So maybe it's the same question twice, but how does this play out on the sell side going forward? What's next in that regard? What's the strategy to really drive this so it's not just viewed to be a buy-side monetization vehicle and really capture what should be a significant opportunity on the sell side?\nRich Barton: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ryan. I'll -- I won't just give the same answer, but it's -- there is a much more interesting scope of an answer and your focus on unlocking the sell side is where I'll land or I'll start and then Allen or anyone can jump in. But look, our dream of basically making the transaction a lot easier breaks down into -- for sellers who are moving, breaks that down into a whole lot of pain point components, okay? And those pain points that we're trying to use our technology to solve for start with simply shopping on the site and looking at listings. And one of the big things that we have invested a lot of people and R&D in is making that shopping experience much more immersive 3D, digital floor plans, and giving shoppers a much more realistic sense for what the home is like. So, we have a big investment there and that kind of came from this effort. We just closed the ShowingTime acquisition, which is a way for us to look at creating a touring reservation system. This is another big pain point for movers and shoppers when they're just trying to arrange to go see homes in the flesh. And with ShowingTime, we have an opportunity to turn that into a much better experience and give us a chance to actually sell some things to those customers who are in that process, which is a really interesting opportunity. Next, the mover, the seller might want to pre-qual for the next mortgage or get a mortgage. Next, we want to route documents and do closings and title and escrow all integrated into the same fluid experience. So, we have invested in -- those are just a few of the steps. But we've -- because of our -- because of Zillow Offers and our focus on the sell side of the market that you're talking about, we have invested in each one of those components and with our technology, we have an opportunity to stitch these things together in a way that very few are going to have the opportunity to do it. So, the seller -- the Rubik's cube of unlocking the seller is a really interesting challenge. It turns out that a whole bunch of buyers are sellers, too, so there is a pretty heavy overlap between buyers and sellers. And we firmly believe focusing on the transaction will provide a ton of growth for us.\nAllen Parker: Yes, I'll just touch on that, most sellers are buyers. One of their friction points is freeing up equity in their current home. Obviously, iBuying provided an opportunity for that with us as a counterparty purchasing the home, but there are a lot of other proptech and opportunities for us to look at ways to free up that equity and help that seller move into their next home that are less capital-intensive and can provide that seller with possibly more value as they list their home, but with similar certainty or at least less friction. So, we believe that there will be quite a few different calls to action to help sellers as they dream into that next home but just that are not the counterparty of us negotiating with that seller only. And as Rich mentioned, only about 10% of those sellers actually took our offer.\nRyan McKeveny: Got it, okay. Thank you. And my second question, I just want to clarify what you're saying about the overall kind of macro home price environment. So, most of the measures that are out there of CoreLogic, Case-Shiller or any of the home price indices, generally, it seems to be an environment where price is still going up, albeit at a much slower pace than what had been happening. So I guess to take a step back to the macro side of things, you talk a lot about the volatility and the unit margin swing. I just want to make the make the question, how much of that is related to, again, the forecasting side of things potentially being too optimistic versus a very volatile swing in natural prices within the broader housing market at this point? Thanks again.\nRich Barton: It was -- forecasting volatility, Ryan, is the short answer.\nAllen Parker: Yeah, the way I would describe it, Ryan, is that as we came into the first half of the year and then into the second half and we made the decision to go ahead and grow, given our Q1 performance, we made a decision that we needed to increase our acquisition pace, and we -- and our models -- our forecasting process, I should say, at that time was not keeping up with that rapid rate of HPA increase that was occurring. And as we went into the second half of the year, HPA still continues to increase and we believe that there's still a strong market but the rate of increase declined significantly. So there was this volatility that Rich talked about that was way outside of the normal distribution you would expect. And that's where I think our pricing forecasting accuracy was less than we had expected. The volatility was higher, maybe another way of saying it. And so we still believe that the -- and I can talk more about the write-down, but the assets are valuable, the market's still strong, but we ended up with that volatility agreeing to prices that are going to be higher than what we expect to sell those houses for less selling costs.\nRyan McKeveny: Understood. Thank you for the clarification. Make sense. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Rich, you're blessed with a really high margin IMT business, and many have asked the sustainability of that margin profile going forward. Can you talk to what this environment does, if anything, to the margin profile of that core business as we head into 2022?\nAllen Parker: Rich, do you want me to start with that and you can jump in?\nRich Barton: Yeah, please, Allen. Thank you.\nAllen Parker: Yeah. So as we reported coming out of the pandemic in the second half of 2020 and then coming into the first half of 2021, we've seen margins that have been in the 46%, 47% range. I think at the midpoint of our outlook this year, 44% is our margin rate for IMT. 42% is the margin rate for this quarter. We think the 42%, 43% margin rates are durable, tight margins. And that's with a level of investment that still allows us to do some of the things I talked about in my prepared remarks in terms of touring and continuing to drive higher intent customers to high performing agents. When I look at the IMT business and I look at the growth opportunities, again, we participate in a very small number of transactions. We continue to make progress on connecting these customers to high-performing agents and improving conversion and so there's a lot of opportunity for growth. We believe we can leverage that growth, which is why I feel comfortable that some of those margin rates are durable going forward. I do think we'll reserve the right, over time, to invest because we're long-term focused, not just short-term focused. But these margin rates of 40% to 42%, in that range, I believe, are durable margin rates for this business. And I believe that the top line, as we mentioned, we believe can continue to grow faster than the industry.\nRich Barton: Well said, Allen.\nBrent Thill: Great. And can I follow up one with Rich? Just last quarter, we all heard you kind of commit and say you had increasing thought, support for the business in that every quarter that passed, you had more conviction. And then all of a sudden, the record scratches this quarter and we understand that things change. But what was it versus last quarter to now that really changed your perspective? Was there one or two events that triggered, or just -- I think everyone was trying to reconcile what you said last quarter to what just happened and sort of go back as well on that, but I want to make sure we truly understand what you were meaning there.\nRich Barton: Well, extraordinary volatility in our earnings and this big markdown on a relatively low volume of units, coupled with us running into internal and external kind of capacity and labor constraints basically brought into high relief and forced us to recognize the inherent risk that exists in the iBuying operation. It's almost as simple as that. I mean, we could have -- we could solve our forecasting problems in most markets, for sure, and we can solve our operations problems. But what we can't solve is what the model is going to tell us about how much capital we need to raise, deploy and risk in the future in order to achieve a scale that we think is necessary to offer a fair price to customers for their homes in a competitive way. We have been offering a fair price now while we've learned the business, but in order to get the scale economies, we have to get a lot bigger. So the score has changed a lot this quarter, but if we're 10 times, 20 times the size we are now, it's just -- it doesn't compute. And look, that's what happened. And luckily, our calculus is different. We built Zillow Offers on top of an incredibly strong core business that has grown tremendously while we've been taking a big swing on Zillow Offers. And it's that strong core business that gives us such an enviable position in the upstream in the customer funnel. That's what happened. It's not actually all that complicated logically. It is complicated emotionally because of the people ramifications of our decision to wind it down. So that's where it gets you.\nBrent Thill: Yes. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: Two questions, please. First, do you think that there's any change in dynamics with real estate agents? Was that at all a factor in your decision? And getting out of the Zillow Offers, would you expect that to have any impact on relations with professional real estate agents across the industry? And then secondly, just talk \u2013 double-click on the mortgages business and the path to potential robust profitability or if there is a path and how you get there? Thank you. \nRich Barton: Hey Mark. Do you want me to start, Allen?\nAllen Parker: Yes.\nRich Barton: Okay. We have a really large partner network in our agents, Mark, as you know. We have helped them really \u2013 have helped the ones who partner with us and get on with our \u2013 get on board with our program to really drive their businesses. So we've had great relationships with them. We continue to \u2013 some may see this as a sign of one thing or another. But honestly, we're really focused on innovating for customers and bringing new customer solutions to market. And as long as we're doing great things for customers, we know that partners will be there to be with us. So that's kind of how we think about that. The second part of the question, Allen, maybe?\nAllen Parker: Yes, I can take that, Mark. And I guess what I'd say is that we're glad that we have the ZHL mortgage business and mortgage marketplace business. We built the factory over the last 2.5 years or so initially off of refinancing, and we showed that we can close loans on time and satisfy customers. And we have shown our ability to be profitable with enough volume. Now as we came into '21 and the refi volume slowed down, when the volume goes down by a certain level, we start to see this investment we're making in our loan purchase originations business show through as investment versus profit. But as shown in Q3, $70 million of revenue, 32% of our funded loans were purchased, that's up 600 basis points from the quarter prior. Now 70% of those were leads from the Zillow Offers business. That gives us comfort that financing is a very important part of the moving process and that having a financing factory that could help serve our customers in a variety of ways is a capability that we must have as we think about serving our customers as they move. And that as we get volume, we're able to generate profitability that you would expect from a purchase company or I should say, a mortgage origination company as that volume grows. So we may see a little bit of choppiness as we go into Q4 and Q1, but there's a lot of opportunities for us to present and provide our customers with pre-qualification and eventually pre-approval and to work with our partner base in using our ZHL as the loan origination. And so we're, Rich, you can add anything, but we're excited to have this capability.\nRich Barton: That was really a thorough answer. I mean, maybe one summary point, and just to remind investors that we do collect a ton of mortgage interest from consumers right now because of our way up funnel position. And we process only a small portion of that ourselves with ZHL, and we have a marketplace for the balance of them, that's -- this puts us in a really good position to innovate here.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thank you, Rich, thank you, Allen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ygal Arounian with Wedbush Securities.\nYgal Arounian: Hey guys. First question, understanding the difficulty in pricing and forecasting. The way you're talking about Zillow Offers is really different than how you've talked about it in the past, that it serves a narrow part of your customers. And what you've talked about in the past is really a central piece to the public offering, the central piece to Zillow 360, expecting it to drive partner leads, expecting it -- as Allen just mentioned, on purchase originations on the mortgage side. So, it does feel like there's a little bit of a hole here in the middle of the vision. Can you just -- I know you've talked about it, but maybe like why is there not a hole in the vision with the iBuyer business now pulled out of it? And then the second question, since -- now, I guess, where there will be a lot more focus on Premier Agent, and you've talked a lot about the high-performing agents and connecting them with high-converting customers. Can we get a little bit more color around that? What's changed? What's changing? How that's benefiting and how that will continue to kind of benefit as we get into next year? Thanks.\nRich Barton: Okay. Hopefully, you took some notes, Allen.\nAllen Parker: I did. Maybe you could just talk about the first question is, again, what's next, I think.\nRich Barton: Yes, yes. I mean, -- we've talked about it a couple of times, but maybe I'll go into a little bit more subtle point, Ygal, that maybe is not as obvious. I tried to say it in my script, but being in a position where we are having to negotiate with sellers about their most important asset -- and the most important thing they own in their lives, emotionally and financially, and being put in a position of being the primary to negotiate with them on that and to have 90% of them approximately go do something else, some of them pretty miffed about the brand, is not what we're used to. It's not what we're trying to be. It's not what the history of our brand has been. And so there is -- a little bit of what's in here is how -- what has been emerging is that it's been a little bit too narrow of a solution. The ends aren't that big either, but that is a little bit of what's going on here. I also -- you've been looking for, for many quarters, us to draw straight hard, solid lines to seller leads from that interaction. And we've said we're making progress. We're trying things. We're improving. But it hasn't been a big business driver for us so far, some of which because of the subtle interactions that I was talking about. Having this be the only thing we're selling to sellers was -- has been the realization we've made is that, that is limiting and that being able to have a larger, broader menu of things to offer our sellers is what we want to be able to focus on. We think we can serve a lot more people that way. And you don't need to look much further than a ton of kind of venture capital proptech investment that is going into the space trying to address this same kind of problem in a more asset-light way. So we think there's a lot of potential here, but in ways that don't force us to put our whole balance sheet at risk. The second part of the...\nAllen Parker: Yes, maybe I'll take the second part. So it was about, how do we feel about, I guess, higher-performing agents and getting them higher-intent customers, what are the drivers there, I believe? Is that a fair representation of the question?\nYgal Arounian: Yes. And obviously, it feels like that's a driver of PA and -- \nAllen Parker: Yes, yes. And so I guess what I talked about is -- yes. What we look at when we look at the opportunities in our Premier Agent business is high-intent customers and there are actions that customers take which are more sticky than others. For example, touring is a great example of as we invest and develop the touring technology, especially with ShowingTime now part of the Zillow Group, we believe that those actions to schedule a tour generate a higher-intent customer that we can connect with an agent in a much more friction-free basis with a higher actual face time connection. 3D homes and floor plans allow our customers to engage in a variety of different homes and then pick the ones they want and so they're higher intent. Zillow 360 and a lot of these discussions we're having about what -- how do we drive an integrated transaction with ZHL and sellers or buyers who need financing when they're buyers or need to free up equity when they're sellers of an old home and want to buy. All of these things, as we think about moving forward in Zillow 2.0, are going to generate additional, as Rich mentioned, partner leads that are coming off of other channels or other areas of our funnel, then the current channel, which right now is HDP submits that we have that then turn into connection. So we continue to get better about monetizing our current traffic and transactions, but we're also investing and developing tools and technologies that create higher-intent, slightly stickier actions that get our customers to agents in a way that are driving conversion up and we get paid for that either in as part of a return on the ROI through MVP or through just number of transactions based on conversion rates with a flex transaction, if that helps. Would you add anything, Brad or Rich?\nRich Barton: That was great.\nYgal Arounian: It\u2019s helpful. Appreciate the color. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our last question today comes from Andrew Boone with JMP Securities.\nAndrew Boone: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two, please. So the first, just on Zillow Offers. It felt like it was a key on-ramp for Zillow 360. Can you talk about your vision for Zillow 360 through just PA? And then for number two, Rich, iBuying, to some, felt like a defensive move initially. To that end, where do iBuying fit into your vision of real estate more broadly? And is this now something that's just too narrow for an over base, or is it simply put, as you mentioned multiple times, just not the best use of Zillow's capital? So, kind of, where is the end state of iBuying? Thanks guys.\nRich Barton: Hi, Andrew, it's early days for Zillow 360. Excuse me, I just swallowed my cough drop. Yeah, it's early days for Zillow 360. We have been doing a lot of testing of it. Zillow Offers has been a part of it for some, but just a part. And we actually think being able to slot many different choices for unlocking sellers as a part of Zillow 360 is a good opportunity. Most interestingly, we're assembling all these other components, all these other ingredients that we've built to make this integrated experience better. But it is -- it's early days, so talking about it more than that would be, I think, is premature. Anything to add on that, Allen?\nAllen Parker: Well, no, I'd just say that it was always broader than just iBuying being the only source. ZHL and PA are example and Closing Services are an example of services that we can bundle together. It was really a concept of bundling together more than one service, and we were not always -- didn't always have to be iBuying. So it's still a concept that I think we've seen improved conversion when we've been able to offer customers integrated services in a package and leverage the lower CAC.\nRich Barton: As for the back half of your question, Andrew, it's really hard to say. We can only talk about this in the context of our calculus, the amount of risk and equity and balance sheet we're willing to take. We were -- we have been willing to take a really big swing on this but not a bet the company swing. There was a potential defensive motivation in going into it in the first place, but we feel after 3.5 years of experience with it, we feel really confident in our offensive position without having to be the primary ourselves. I guess that's how I would answer that, Andrew. Is that it, Brad?\nBrad Berning: I think that was it. Operator, is that correct?\nRich Barton: Yeah. Okay. I'll wrap it up. Zoom life. I'll wrap it up. Thanks. Thanks, everybody, for your time. Look, similar to other leading technology companies that have gone before us, we strongly believe in taking big swings and failing fast. We have learned from our experience in Zillow Offers in Q3 and are applying those learnings as we look ahead. We continue -- as you can hear, we continue to be excited about the opportunity we see in front of us, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Okay, operator, we can conclude the call. Thank you all very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rich Barton",
            "content": "Thanks, Brad. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. This afternoon, we announced financial results for the third quarter and, most notably, our decision to wind down our Zillow Offers operations, which will unfortunately involve a reduction in our workforce of approximately 25% over the next few quarters. This decision was not taken lightly, especially considering the hard work and commitment from the Zillow Offers team. But ultimately, we determined that further scaling up Zillow Offers is too risky, too volatile to our earnings and operations, too low of a return on equity opportunity and too narrow in its ability to serve our customers, a tough but necessary determination. Before getting into the results for the quarter, I'd like to explain our logic. As you've heard numerous times from me on these calls, our vision is to help people unlock life's next chapter. We are uniquely well positioned to deliver on this vision, given our audience, our brand and our profitable and growing core business. In service of this vision, we are innovating on products and services that allow us to evolve from a search and find company to one that is directly helping our customers transact and move. We call this Zillow 2.0 and it firmly remains our vision today. We've made many investments towards Zillow 2.0, one of the biggest being Zillow Offers as a way to provide a compelling product offering for home sellers. When we decided to take a big swing on Zillow Offers 3.5 years ago, our aim was to become a market maker, not a market risk taker. And this was underpinned by the need to forecast the price of homes accurately three to six months into the future. We used historical data and countless simulations to test this belief. We set unit economic targets that required us to stay within plus or minus 200 basis points in breakeven, holding ourselves accountable to these levels publicly with you all. Yet in our short tenure operating Zillow Offers, we've experienced a series of extraordinary events: a global pandemic, a temporary freezing of the housing market and then a supply/demand imbalance that led to a rise in home prices at a rate that was without precedent. We have been unable to accurately forecast future home prices at different times in both directions by much more than we modeled as possible, with Zillow Offers unit economics on a quarterly basis swinging from plus 576 basis points in Q2 to an expected minus 500 to minus 700 basis points in Q4. Put simply, our observed error rate has been far more volatile than we ever expected possible and makes us look far more like a leveraged housing trader than the market maker we set out to be. We could blame this outsized volatility on exogenous black swan events, tweak our models based on what we've learned and press on. But based on our experience to-date, it would be nai\u0308ve to assume unpredictable price forecasting and disruption events will not happen in the future. Because of the price forecasting volatility, we have also had to reconsider what the business would look like at a larger scale. We have offered sellers a fair market price from the start, but we've also been clear that the business only becomes consistently profitable at scale. With the price forecasting volatility we have observed and now must expect in the future, we have determined that the scale would require too much equity capital, create too much volatility in our earnings and balance sheet, and ultimately, result in a far lower return on equity than we imagined. We have also experienced significant capacity and demand planning challenges, exacerbated by an admittedly difficult labor and supply chain environment. The combination of these factors has caused a meaningful backup in our processing of homes in the Zillow pipeline, which we announced two weeks ago. We judged future significant volume volatility to be a tough impediment to ramp a scaled operation, and any interruptions in the supply chain like we recently experienced will result in increased holding times, further increasing our exposure to volatility and lowering our return on equity. A final factor in this wind-down decision is that to-date, we have been able to serve only a limited number of customers. We've been able to convert only about 10% of the serious sellers who ask for a Zillow Offer, and we have tended to disappoint the roughly 90% who didn't sell through us. Given our hard-earned position at the top of the seller funnel with 220 million-plus average monthly unique users and the popularity of the Zestimate, there are better, broader, less risky, more brand-aligned ways of enabling all of our customers who want to move. So, these are the essential components of our wind-down logic. Our price forecasting accuracy was far more volatile than we planned for and was further exacerbated by unpredictable black swan-type events. And that volatility contributed to operational volatility and cash flow and balance sheet volatility that is beyond the tolerance level that we are comfortable with moving forward. Lastly, we believe this is an opportunity to refocus and more broadly address a wider audience of customers with more asset-light solutions. Of course, the natural question is, what's next? Before I get there, it's worth highlighting how strong our core business is, which has thrived while we port its profits into our ZO iBuying operation. Over that investment period, we expect IMT segment revenue to increase 57% from a reported $1.2 billion in 2018 to $1.9 billion in 2021 at the midpoint of our outlook range. Further, we expect IMT segment adjusted EBITDA to increase by nearly 3.5 times from $240 million in 2018 to $833 million in 2021 at the midpoint of our outlook range. So, we start the what's next conversation from a position of strength because of how the core business has performed. As we move forward, we remain focused on the same key areas, all with the end goal of helping turn dreamers into movers. First and foremost, we are going to continue to create engaging experiences that attract people to our apps and sites in droves on a daily basis. Most prominently, we believe our ability to continually improve the Zestimate to be fundamental and foundational to our top of funnel audience and brand advantage. As those that dream with us start to shop with us, we will continue to evolve our capabilities to make our shopping experience more digital and less friction-filled. Now that showing time is officially part of Zillow Group, we will go to work on solving another pain point for home shoppers and agents, the cumbersome process of scheduling a tour. The touring opportunity is spiritually similar to the opportunity we pursued with our Connections program back in 2018. Removing friction and streamlining communication between home shoppers and agents was one of our first steps towards a better and more integrated home shopping experience. We expect showing time will help us enable another. Coupled with the frictionless shopping experience must be capable partners, internal operators, and seamless tools and technology to service our customers. For our Premier Agent business, that means continuing to work with high-performing partners to convert -- that convert our high-intent shoppers into movers. For Zillow Home Loans and Zillow Closing Services, that means continuing to enable integration on our moving platform. Zillow 360 is an example of the potential golden path for our customers, a seamless move through shopping, connecting, selling, buying, financing, and closing, a single place for all customers moving needs. The change necessitated by today's announcement is the evolution of how we will help a customer sell her current home. Before today, the selling option was overly focused on Zillow Offers and was able to serve only a small number of our available customer set. Going forward, we will have the ability to plug in multiple, more scalable solutions to offer better customer choice. Instead of a sole focus on solving the seller's pain point by purchasing from her ourselves as the primary through Zillow Offers, we will expand our view and explore marketplace as selling solutions that give her certainty and convenience all while addressing the broader opportunity. In solving for her move, however, we plan to focus on solutions that are asset and capital-light for Zillow. We can still offer choice, simplicity, speed, and convenience. We will be open-minded about our exploration into providing these sell solutions ourselves and/or through partners. Both are interesting. And rather than having to buy her home to help her sell, we are now simply going to help her sell. We are confident our current and future technology platform and tools will enable us to deliver an increasingly integrated digital and seamless experience via our own services and through partners. We continue to be in a competitively advantageous position due to our audience, our brand, and our healthy and profitable core business. We see opportunity in using our learnings from Zillow Offers, our tools and our capabilities to broaden our seller focus beyond only iBuying. Further, we look forward to using these same tools and services to increase conversion and attach rate in our large home buyer funnel. For perspective, Zillow overall still only participates in a mid-single-digit market share of transactions today, despite being used by almost every shopper, dreamer, renter, financer and mover in the country. The opportunity continues to be very large to drive growth with higher conversion and to increase the depth, number and integration of the services we offer our customers. Before I close and hand it over to Allen, I'd like you all to know how personal this is for me. I am founder and first money into Zillow 16 years ago and am the largest individual shareholder. I distinctly remember brainstorming to come up with the name of the company with my co-Founder, Lloyd, and then buying zillow.com for $8.95 on GoDaddy all those years ago. It weighs heavily on me that our strategic decision to wind down the Zillow Offers operation after 3.5 years involves having to let about 25% of our great colleagues go over the coming quarters. I'm sorry for how difficult and disruptive this will be. I am grateful to them. They have worked hard and will be missed. We are committed to providing a smooth transition for those affected. The decision was tough but absolutely necessary, given the capital risk and volatility that is now obviously inherent to the Zillow Offers iBuying business. After careful assessment and volatile earnings, instead of doubling down on a single capital-constrained risk-heavy solution, we will focus on the broader problem, helping people move, and we continue the mission of having solutions that can be accessed by everyone moving, not just a narrow set of folks who have to negotiate with us as the primary buyer, leaving most unsatisfied when we can't come to terms. We are lucky to have a strong and growing core Marketplace business from which to invest moving forward. We are lucky to have a courageous team who have helped us on our journey and the strong culture of innovation that encourages taking big swings but also is clear-eyed when we miss. We are lucky to have a deep untapped well of opportunity for innovation in our massive user base, partner network and trusted brands. And finally, as a shareholder, I am lucky to have fellow investors who will appreciate both the necessity and the opportunity in this decision. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Allen for his comments. Allen? Yes. Hey Brad, thanks for the question. We were -- fundamentally, we have been unable to predict future pricing of homes to a level of accuracy that makes this a safe business to be in. We hadn't modeled this kind of pricing market nor supply market to even be possible when we got the business going. And we've seen all this volatility in both directions right now in the wrong direction. And we're still at a scale that is small compared to what it needs to be. And so as we put our minds in the state of, all right, we've got these new assumptions that we'd be nai\u0308ve not to assume will happen again in the future, we pump them into the model and the model cranks out a business that has a high likelihood, at some point, of putting the whole company at risk, not just the business, but in the more normal case, just causes a ton of volatility in earnings, which is not a great look for a public company. That's -- basically, that's what it boils down to. There's capacity issues, et cetera, that we can talk about, that we've had internally and externally on the backdrop of a really tight environment. What it boils down to is our inability to have confidence in pricing in the future, enough confidence to put our own capital at risk that we don't have to. Yes, okay. So most -- I don't want to say all, it's probably not all, but it's certainly most sellers in the market, even when they're at the very early stages of selling, maybe we'll call it dreaming, transitioning to selling, they show up in our apps. They look at their Zestimate. They start talking to people. They start looking at comps and consuming information. We have a lot of very interesting, highly engaged touch points that -- with these customers. And we've learned a whole lot about transitioning that light touch into a conversation. In doing Zillow Offers, we've learned a ton about that. And so whether the front door is through the Zestimate or through a request for prequalification or looking for an agent or just wanting advice, we have a lot of ways to take a customer conversation from a kind of a shallow one to an advisory conversation. And we look forward to being able to now refocus more broadly on that, that set of customers rather than basically having one really, really having the organization and all our profits from the core business focused on that one thing to sell in the store. We only have kind of one thing to sell in the store in our iBuying operation. This is going to free us up from having to think so narrowly. We think that these are still interesting solutions, but it frees us up from having to think so narrowly and we can capitalize on a broader opportunity. Yes. Thanks, Brad. Yes. Thanks for the question, Ryan. I'll -- I won't just give the same answer, but it's -- there is a much more interesting scope of an answer and your focus on unlocking the sell side is where I'll land or I'll start and then Allen or anyone can jump in. But look, our dream of basically making the transaction a lot easier breaks down into -- for sellers who are moving, breaks that down into a whole lot of pain point components, okay? And those pain points that we're trying to use our technology to solve for start with simply shopping on the site and looking at listings. And one of the big things that we have invested a lot of people and R&D in is making that shopping experience much more immersive 3D, digital floor plans, and giving shoppers a much more realistic sense for what the home is like. So, we have a big investment there and that kind of came from this effort. We just closed the ShowingTime acquisition, which is a way for us to look at creating a touring reservation system. This is another big pain point for movers and shoppers when they're just trying to arrange to go see homes in the flesh. And with ShowingTime, we have an opportunity to turn that into a much better experience and give us a chance to actually sell some things to those customers who are in that process, which is a really interesting opportunity. Next, the mover, the seller might want to pre-qual for the next mortgage or get a mortgage. Next, we want to route documents and do closings and title and escrow all integrated into the same fluid experience. So, we have invested in -- those are just a few of the steps. But we've -- because of our -- because of Zillow Offers and our focus on the sell side of the market that you're talking about, we have invested in each one of those components and with our technology, we have an opportunity to stitch these things together in a way that very few are going to have the opportunity to do it. So, the seller -- the Rubik's cube of unlocking the seller is a really interesting challenge. It turns out that a whole bunch of buyers are sellers, too, so there is a pretty heavy overlap between buyers and sellers. And we firmly believe focusing on the transaction will provide a ton of growth for us. It was -- forecasting volatility, Ryan, is the short answer. Yeah, please, Allen. Thank you. Well said, Allen. Well, extraordinary volatility in our earnings and this big markdown on a relatively low volume of units, coupled with us running into internal and external kind of capacity and labor constraints basically brought into high relief and forced us to recognize the inherent risk that exists in the iBuying operation. It's almost as simple as that. I mean, we could have -- we could solve our forecasting problems in most markets, for sure, and we can solve our operations problems. But what we can't solve is what the model is going to tell us about how much capital we need to raise, deploy and risk in the future in order to achieve a scale that we think is necessary to offer a fair price to customers for their homes in a competitive way. We have been offering a fair price now while we've learned the business, but in order to get the scale economies, we have to get a lot bigger. So the score has changed a lot this quarter, but if we're 10 times, 20 times the size we are now, it's just -- it doesn't compute. And look, that's what happened. And luckily, our calculus is different. We built Zillow Offers on top of an incredibly strong core business that has grown tremendously while we've been taking a big swing on Zillow Offers. And it's that strong core business that gives us such an enviable position in the upstream in the customer funnel. That's what happened. It's not actually all that complicated logically. It is complicated emotionally because of the people ramifications of our decision to wind it down. So that's where it gets you. Hey Mark. Do you want me to start, Allen? Okay. We have a really large partner network in our agents, Mark, as you know. We have helped them really \u2013 have helped the ones who partner with us and get on with our \u2013 get on board with our program to really drive their businesses. So we've had great relationships with them. We continue to \u2013 some may see this as a sign of one thing or another. But honestly, we're really focused on innovating for customers and bringing new customer solutions to market. And as long as we're doing great things for customers, we know that partners will be there to be with us. So that's kind of how we think about that. The second part of the question, Allen, maybe? That was really a thorough answer. I mean, maybe one summary point, and just to remind investors that we do collect a ton of mortgage interest from consumers right now because of our way up funnel position. And we process only a small portion of that ourselves with ZHL, and we have a marketplace for the balance of them, that's -- this puts us in a really good position to innovate here. Okay. Hopefully, you took some notes, Allen. Yes, yes. I mean, -- we've talked about it a couple of times, but maybe I'll go into a little bit more subtle point, Ygal, that maybe is not as obvious. I tried to say it in my script, but being in a position where we are having to negotiate with sellers about their most important asset -- and the most important thing they own in their lives, emotionally and financially, and being put in a position of being the primary to negotiate with them on that and to have 90% of them approximately go do something else, some of them pretty miffed about the brand, is not what we're used to. It's not what we're trying to be. It's not what the history of our brand has been. And so there is -- a little bit of what's in here is how -- what has been emerging is that it's been a little bit too narrow of a solution. The ends aren't that big either, but that is a little bit of what's going on here. I also -- you've been looking for, for many quarters, us to draw straight hard, solid lines to seller leads from that interaction. And we've said we're making progress. We're trying things. We're improving. But it hasn't been a big business driver for us so far, some of which because of the subtle interactions that I was talking about. Having this be the only thing we're selling to sellers was -- has been the realization we've made is that, that is limiting and that being able to have a larger, broader menu of things to offer our sellers is what we want to be able to focus on. We think we can serve a lot more people that way. And you don't need to look much further than a ton of kind of venture capital proptech investment that is going into the space trying to address this same kind of problem in a more asset-light way. So we think there's a lot of potential here, but in ways that don't force us to put our whole balance sheet at risk. The second part of the... That was great. Hi, Andrew, it's early days for Zillow 360. Excuse me, I just swallowed my cough drop. Yeah, it's early days for Zillow 360. We have been doing a lot of testing of it. Zillow Offers has been a part of it for some, but just a part. And we actually think being able to slot many different choices for unlocking sellers as a part of Zillow 360 is a good opportunity. Most interestingly, we're assembling all these other components, all these other ingredients that we've built to make this integrated experience better. But it is -- it's early days, so talking about it more than that would be, I think, is premature. Anything to add on that, Allen? As for the back half of your question, Andrew, it's really hard to say. We can only talk about this in the context of our calculus, the amount of risk and equity and balance sheet we're willing to take. We were -- we have been willing to take a really big swing on this but not a bet the company swing. There was a potential defensive motivation in going into it in the first place, but we feel after 3.5 years of experience with it, we feel really confident in our offensive position without having to be the primary ourselves. I guess that's how I would answer that, Andrew. Is that it, Brad? Yeah. Okay. I'll wrap it up. Zoom life. I'll wrap it up. Thanks. Thanks, everybody, for your time. Look, similar to other leading technology companies that have gone before us, we strongly believe in taking big swings and failing fast. We have learned from our experience in Zillow Offers in Q3 and are applying those learnings as we look ahead. We continue -- as you can hear, we continue to be excited about the opportunity we see in front of us, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Okay, operator, we can conclude the call. Thank you all very much."

            "name": "Allen Parker",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich. You've heard a lot about Zillow Offers, but we should not lose sight of the strong core business results we continue to produce in Q3. Zillow Group reported Q3 results for our IMT and Mortgages segments as well as Premier Agent revenue within or above our previously provided revenue and EBITDA outlook ranges. Premier Agent revenue growth of 20% year-over-year remains strong. IMT segment EBITDA margin of 43.1% was better than expected. Our Mortgages segment revenue grew 30% year-over-year to $70 million, exceeding our outlook range. Moving into more detail. Q3 IMT segment revenue was $480 million, growing 16% year-over-year and 43% on a two-year stacked basis compared to Q3 of 2019. Our IMT segment revenue growth continued to benefit from our Premier Agent business. We continue to execute on making better connections between our high-intent customers and high-performing agents, driving higher monetization. Turning to other revenue within our IMT segment. Our Rentals business decelerated primarily due to a difficult comparison in Q3 as a result of abnormal seasonality in 2020. Rentals revenue also underperformed our expectations as we incurred headwinds related to high rental occupancy rates, which tempered advertising demand. IMT segment EBITDA was $207 million in Q3, exceeding our outlook. The IMT segment EBITDA margin outperformance was driven by increased operating efficiency, as well as less than previously planned second half overall Zillow brand marketing spend. Mortgages segment revenue increased 30% year-over-year in Q3 to $70 million, and Mortgages segment EBITDA was a positive $5 million, compared to the midpoint of our outlook range of a loss of $9.5 million. Total loan origination volume was up 115% in Q3 year-over-year and up 25% sequentially from Q2, driven by growth in our loan originations business. Purchase loan origination volume was up 119% and refinance loan origination volume was up 113% year-over-year. Now to address a few more details in our Home segment and Zillow Offers business. We reported Q3 Home segment revenue of $1.2 billion, below our outlook range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. We reported Q3 Home segment EBITDA loss of $381 million, below our outlook range, impacted by $304 million of an inventory write-down. The revenue miss was primarily driven by capacity constraints as we overestimated our ability to quickly scale operations in addition to industry-wide renovation labor supply constraints. This resulted in a shift in home closings into Q4 that were previously expected to close in Q3. For clarity, I want to provide some additional details behind the inventory valuation process and the recognition and timing of losses. For inventory on our balance sheet, at period end, we compare our cost basis, our purchase price of inventory and other capitalized inventory costs to the estimated net realizable value, our estimated future selling price of those homes less estimated cost to sell. This resulted in the recognition of a $304 million inventory write-down included in Home segment cost of revenue in Q3. We expect to recognize additional inventory losses in Q4 of approximately $240 million to $265 million. These estimated losses primarily relate to homes that were under contract to purchase as of the end of Q3 that we expect to acquire during Q4 and that we expect to resell for less than purchased. The Zillow Enterprise remains in a strong position with more than sufficient liquidity to weather the impact of home purchases in Zillow Offers in Q4. We ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and investments. We expect the net effect of the wind-down of Zillow Offers to be at least cash flow neutral in the aggregate. We believe the wind-down will leave us in a strong position to invest in more scalable customer solutions that are less capital intensive as we execute our Zillow 2.0 vision and make strategic long-term investments. Our expectation is that we will be a positive earnings and positive cash flow company with our revised product strategy once the wind-down is complete. In addition to what I just discussed, we expect the following in relation to our wind-down plan. As disclosed in the Form 8-K we filed earlier this afternoon, in addition to the inventory losses we expect to record in Q4, we expect to record additional pretax charges of approximately $175 million to $230 million related to the wind-down of Zillow Offers operations, primarily in Q4 and in the first half of 2022. These charges are expected to include certain employee retention and termination costs, cost to exit contractual obligations, including borrowing and lease arrangements and write-offs of long-lived assets. We expect unit economics to be between negative 500 to negative 700 basis points before interest expense in Q4 as informed by our Q3 inventory write-down and Q4 outlook. As a result of homes already under contract but not yet purchased as of the end of Q3, we expect to continue to grow our inventory balance during Q4 and then expect inventory to begin to decline in future periods. We expect to sell most of the remaining homes inventory primarily by the end of Q2 2022, with a small number of homes remaining thereafter. This implies that we will invest cash and inventory during Q4 as our inventory balance grows, and we'll begin to see cash flow back to Zillow as our inventory levels decrease through the first half of 2022. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. In our IMT segment, we expect 13% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 and 50% growth over Q4 2019 at the midpoint of our outlook range. Within IMT segment, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be between $354 million to $362 million, up 14% year-over-year and up 53% over Q4 2019 at the midpoint of our outlook. We expect Q4 IMT EBITDA margin to be 42% at the midpoint of our outlook, roughly flat sequentially from 43% in Q3. Our outlook includes our plans to continue to invest in staffing and technology in Q4 to drive our 2.0 vision, including things like touring, bundling products such as Zillow 360, expanding 3D photos and floor plans along with continuing to invest in integrating Zillow 2.0 products. Separately, we closed our acquisition of ShowingTime on September 30, which will be included in our IMT segment results beginning in Q4. We are beginning to integrate ShowingTime's platform and are excited about the opportunity to better serve our customers and partners. We plan to invest further in innovating ShowingTime's solutions to better serve the entire industry. In Q4, we expect our Homes segment revenue to be between $1.9 billion -- we expect Homes segment revenue to be $1.9 billion and EBITDA to be a loss of $348 million at the midpoint of our outlook range. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to record an additional loss in Q4 of between $240 million and $265 million, primarily related to the homes under contract to purchase as of the end of Q3 that we expect to purchase in Q4. During Q4, given our resale capacity constraints, we expect our inventory balance to grow and then decline beginning in Q1 of 2022. We expect there could be a wide array of results in Q4 for our Homes segment as we work to free up operational and renovation capacity and pursue various resale strategies as we seek to protect the value of our assets and optimize our wind-down while respectfully managing our people. We expect our Mortgages segment revenue to be between $47 million to $52 million in Q4, which is down sequentially from Q3. Our Q4 outlook reflects slower industry refinance activity from the recent move in interest rates, slight compression in gain on sale spreads and slower growth in purchase originations impacted by the wind-down of Zillow Offers operations. As a result of lower sequential revenue and continued investments to grow mortgage originations, we expect Mortgages segment EBITDA to be between a loss of $16 million and $11 million in Q4. While we are in the midst of 2022 planning, we wanted to share that we are focused internally on continuing to drive secular growth faster than the industry. We do want to highlight that during 2021, our Premier Agent business has outgrown the industry in each quarter and expect the business to continue to do so in our Q4 outlook. While there are near-term cyclical pressures on some of our other Marketplace businesses, we are hard at work with initiatives to drive growth regardless. We are also well-positioned with our strong traffic in our other IMT marketplaces to benefit as rental and new construction supply and demand imbalances normalize and when these advertising pressures subside. We have a large audience, but a significant growth opportunity with only approximately mid-single-digit market share of industry transactions. Progress on improving connections and showings as well as the customer dream, shop, buy, sell, rent, and finance experiences are among the numerous tangible initiatives we are delivering to continue to drive secular growth to connect more high-intent customers with a growing mix of high-performing partners. As we look forward, my priorities remain focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners, and I look to ensure an orderly wind-down of Zillow Offers operations, right-size our cost structure, and improve productivity to drive a profitable, scalable, and positive cash flow company, drive prioritization to invest in sustainable topline growth opportunities across the company, including new integrated services that are more scalable, less subject to earnings volatility, and more capital efficient. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. Yes, I'll just touch on that, most sellers are buyers. One of their friction points is freeing up equity in their current home. Obviously, iBuying provided an opportunity for that with us as a counterparty purchasing the home, but there are a lot of other proptech and opportunities for us to look at ways to free up that equity and help that seller move into their next home that are less capital-intensive and can provide that seller with possibly more value as they list their home, but with similar certainty or at least less friction. So, we believe that there will be quite a few different calls to action to help sellers as they dream into that next home but just that are not the counterparty of us negotiating with that seller only. And as Rich mentioned, only about 10% of those sellers actually took our offer. Yeah, the way I would describe it, Ryan, is that as we came into the first half of the year and then into the second half and we made the decision to go ahead and grow, given our Q1 performance, we made a decision that we needed to increase our acquisition pace, and we -- and our models -- our forecasting process, I should say, at that time was not keeping up with that rapid rate of HPA increase that was occurring. And as we went into the second half of the year, HPA still continues to increase and we believe that there's still a strong market but the rate of increase declined significantly. So there was this volatility that Rich talked about that was way outside of the normal distribution you would expect. And that's where I think our pricing forecasting accuracy was less than we had expected. The volatility was higher, maybe another way of saying it. And so we still believe that the -- and I can talk more about the write-down, but the assets are valuable, the market's still strong, but we ended up with that volatility agreeing to prices that are going to be higher than what we expect to sell those houses for less selling costs. Rich, do you want me to start with that and you can jump in? Yeah. So as we reported coming out of the pandemic in the second half of 2020 and then coming into the first half of 2021, we've seen margins that have been in the 46%, 47% range. I think at the midpoint of our outlook this year, 44% is our margin rate for IMT. 42% is the margin rate for this quarter. We think the 42%, 43% margin rates are durable, tight margins. And that's with a level of investment that still allows us to do some of the things I talked about in my prepared remarks in terms of touring and continuing to drive higher intent customers to high performing agents. When I look at the IMT business and I look at the growth opportunities, again, we participate in a very small number of transactions. We continue to make progress on connecting these customers to high-performing agents and improving conversion and so there's a lot of opportunity for growth. We believe we can leverage that growth, which is why I feel comfortable that some of those margin rates are durable going forward. I do think we'll reserve the right, over time, to invest because we're long-term focused, not just short-term focused. But these margin rates of 40% to 42%, in that range, I believe, are durable margin rates for this business. And I believe that the top line, as we mentioned, we believe can continue to grow faster than the industry. Yes. Yes, I can take that, Mark. And I guess what I'd say is that we're glad that we have the ZHL mortgage business and mortgage marketplace business. We built the factory over the last 2.5 years or so initially off of refinancing, and we showed that we can close loans on time and satisfy customers. And we have shown our ability to be profitable with enough volume. Now as we came into '21 and the refi volume slowed down, when the volume goes down by a certain level, we start to see this investment we're making in our loan purchase originations business show through as investment versus profit. But as shown in Q3, $70 million of revenue, 32% of our funded loans were purchased, that's up 600 basis points from the quarter prior. Now 70% of those were leads from the Zillow Offers business. That gives us comfort that financing is a very important part of the moving process and that having a financing factory that could help serve our customers in a variety of ways is a capability that we must have as we think about serving our customers as they move. And that as we get volume, we're able to generate profitability that you would expect from a purchase company or I should say, a mortgage origination company as that volume grows. So we may see a little bit of choppiness as we go into Q4 and Q1, but there's a lot of opportunities for us to present and provide our customers with pre-qualification and eventually pre-approval and to work with our partner base in using our ZHL as the loan origination. And so we're, Rich, you can add anything, but we're excited to have this capability. I did. Maybe you could just talk about the first question is, again, what's next, I think. Yes, maybe I'll take the second part. So it was about, how do we feel about, I guess, higher-performing agents and getting them higher-intent customers, what are the drivers there, I believe? Is that a fair representation of the question? Yes, yes. And so I guess what I talked about is -- yes. What we look at when we look at the opportunities in our Premier Agent business is high-intent customers and there are actions that customers take which are more sticky than others. For example, touring is a great example of as we invest and develop the touring technology, especially with ShowingTime now part of the Zillow Group, we believe that those actions to schedule a tour generate a higher-intent customer that we can connect with an agent in a much more friction-free basis with a higher actual face time connection. 3D homes and floor plans allow our customers to engage in a variety of different homes and then pick the ones they want and so they're higher intent. Zillow 360 and a lot of these discussions we're having about what -- how do we drive an integrated transaction with ZHL and sellers or buyers who need financing when they're buyers or need to free up equity when they're sellers of an old home and want to buy. All of these things, as we think about moving forward in Zillow 2.0, are going to generate additional, as Rich mentioned, partner leads that are coming off of other channels or other areas of our funnel, then the current channel, which right now is HDP submits that we have that then turn into connection. So we continue to get better about monetizing our current traffic and transactions, but we're also investing and developing tools and technologies that create higher-intent, slightly stickier actions that get our customers to agents in a way that are driving conversion up and we get paid for that either in as part of a return on the ROI through MVP or through just number of transactions based on conversion rates with a flex transaction, if that helps. Would you add anything, Brad or Rich? Well, no, I'd just say that it was always broader than just iBuying being the only source. ZHL and PA are example and Closing Services are an example of services that we can bundle together. It was really a concept of bundling together more than one service, and we were not always -- didn't always have to be iBuying. So it's still a concept that I think we've seen improved conversion when we've been able to offer customers integrated services in a package and leverage the lower CAC."

And with that, I\u2019d turn the call over to Rich.\nRich Barton: Thanks, Brad. Hello, everyone. I hope you\u2019re all enjoying the summer wherever you may be. I am Zoom connecting once again from Zillow CloudHQ. We had another strong quarter for Zillow with our consolidated business, as well as each segment meeting or beating our outlook ranges. We\u2019ve begun to show good execution on Zillow 2.0, our dream of building a seamless integrated experience for our customers and partners. I will talk more about that in just a moment. But first I will top line some quarterly highlights. On the buy side, Premier Agent revenue grew 82% year-over-year and 50% compared to two years ago. Our goal on the buy side of the real estate transaction is to connect high intent customers with high performing partners. And our performance was driven by strong execution against this goal, as well as continued housing industry tailwinds. We continue to improve the quality and quantity of connections we send to our partners by enhancing how our customers shop on Zillow with a particular focus on touring. In addition, once a customer raises her hand to work with a Zillow Premier Agent, we are constantly refining how quickly we introduce that customer to her agent, which makes all the difference in such a competitive buyer environment. On the partner side, we continue to focus on building a network of high performing agents who are aligned with us on providing a high quality experience to our customers as they move to a new home. On the sell side, Zillow Offers continued to accelerate in Q2 with a record 3,805 homes purchased. We sold 2,086 homes generating a record $777 million in revenue on our Home segment, surpassing our internal expectations for both revenue and EBITDA. Importantly, the Zillow Offers value proposition of a fast, fair, flexible and convenient close has proved more than durable, even in this sizzling hot sellers market. It\u2019s a nod to just have dreadful and dreaded prospect of selling, buying and moving is to people. Likely this is not a surprise to any of you. In our surveys of homeowners who want and need to move, when we present the Zillow Offers concept, the largest objection is there must be a catch. I\u2019m pretty happy to market to that objection. As we discussed on our last call, we entered Q2 with strong customer interest in ZO, which accelerated throughout the quarter and into Q3. Allen will get into more details. But as we said on our Q1 call, we saw significant customer demand at the beginning of Q2 that we expected would drive revenue growth on a lagged basis in Q3, which is now leading to our strong Q3 outlook. And we continued to see strong growth in customer demand as we entered Q3 that we expect will favorably impact revenue in future quarters. With that in mind, we are focused on making progress automating key workflows in support of building a large scale operation. Also as we discussed last quarter, we recognized that our Zillow Offers unit economics are above our plus or minus 200 basis point guardrails as we build and scale the business, a trend that continued in Q2 despite our efforts. We expect these unit economic trends to normalize over time as we iterate, continue to learn and as home price appreciation inevitably slows. We\u2019ve been testing pricing elasticity in this hot housing market and we saw rapid conversion game throughout the quarter as we improved our offer strength. We believe these tests will serve as well across future market conditions. As we strive to be a market maker across housing cycles. We expect to the homes we are scheduled to purchase will trend towards our plus or minus 200 basis points target over the course of the second half of the year. Additionally, earlier this week, a Zillow Offers subsidiary launched and priced a securitized debt offering, which is expected to close next week. Allen will provide more details on this later in the call. As the Zillow Offers business continues to accelerate, we are seeing lift to our Zillow Home Loans with approximately 40% of purchase originations in Q2 sourced from Zillow Offers. In total, our Q2 purchase originations grew by 90% year-over-year as we continue to build a mortgage factory that serves both purchase and refinance transactions. An example of this is our new self service mortgage prequalification offering, which automates the process and makes it more efficient for our customers. All of these efforts came together this quarter to deliver a total company revenue of $1.3 billion up 70% year-over-year. And importantly, our newly provided gross profit measure, which I will talk to more in a moment, was $538 million in Q2, up 92% year-over-year and 79% from the same period two years ago. Now onto what\u2019s happening around us. We believe there is strong durable support for the housing market. Historically work and location have been inextricably bound together. The pandemic has jolting and dramatically unbundled work from location for many, creating a new flexibility by enabling people to optimize for work and location separately and simultaneously. Moving to the big city is no longer a requirement for many job seekers and that shift will inevitably disperse talent and economic opportunities. This untethering of location from work fields deeply important to me for the future of work and life and by implication housing, what we\u2019ve been calling the great reshuffling. It is also why we at Zillow leaned in hard and early on the CloudHQ idea as the future of work, as you can read about it in today\u2019s New York Times front page business section article by Sarah Kessler, featuring Zillow Vice President, Meghan Reibstein one of our many folks who cut the cord from our old Seattle HQ and moved to Asheville, North Carolina, to be near and support her family. On the recruiting side year-to-date, we have had 153,000 candidates apply for a job at Zillow, which we believe has been fueled in part by the possibilities of our permanent location flexible policy. This is one of the factors we see driving the housing market for some time, the other important factors being millennials entering their prime home buying years and low interest rates. Stepping back, we have always had audacious goals guided by our strong urge to empower people vis-a-vis the expensive, confusing, emotionally and financially fraught process of buying and selling a home. Our initial dream was to build the most trusted environment home-related marketplace and to solve a big problem in real estate, the lack of transparency in home shopping, to turn on the lights. This dream started with both the Zestimate, our killer algorithm that put a price on every rooftop in America and zillow.com one marketplace where everyone could search and find homes with data easily at their fingertips, something not possible prior to Zillow. This transparency and convenience became the accelerant for establishing Zillow\u2019s brand in real estate and making it the most popular place to dream and shop with an average of 229 million monthly unique users coming to our mobile apps and websites in Q2, including our great adopted sister brands, Trulia and StreetEasy. Zillow brand became synonymous with real estate empowerment. But the fundamental transaction continued to be painfully stuck in the 50s, resisting the gravity of digitization. So our dream and ambition moved from the top of the consumer funnel down to the bottom of the funnel to the transaction itself. We of course, recognize that our huge brand and traffic, as well as our DNA as software engineers, many of us grew up at Microsoft in the 90\u2019s would advantage us relative to this large and daunting challenge. So our expanded dream is to reengineer streamline and digitize the moving process, as you heard me call it many times Zillow 2.0. We believe customers want speed, simplicity, integration and value, fairly safe consumer desires in which to invest in my opinion. To deliver on this dream, our strategy has been to build an integrated set of real estate products and services, both owned and operated and with professional partners that can be mixed and matched to make it radically easier for all the dreamers and choppers on to transact and move to their next chapters. We are executing nicely on this ambitious growth strategy and progressing well towards each of the three to five year growth objectives that we communicated 2.5 years ago when we announced Zillow 2.0. In our IMT segment, our stated three to five-year objective was $2 billion in revenue up from $1.2 billion for 2018, and we are on track to deliver. Additionally, our current run rate has already exceeded our original three to five-year objective for IMT segment annual EBITDA of $600 million and 30% margin. And our Home segment is performing well just by completely shutting down purchases in the early phases of the pandemic and building operations during the most rapid change in home prices ever recorded. As I said above, we are now back on track with our original objective to purchase 5,000 homes per month and to generate annualized revenue of $20 billion within the original three to five-year timeline. For Zillow Home Loans were also on course to achieve our stated goal of 3,000 mortgages originated per month within the original timeframe we set. Today, we are seeing more and more signals from our customers that validate our integration thesis and growth strategy. Home shoppers and buyers who once just thought of Zillow as a place to search and find are starting to understand and take advantage of the reality that we now offer so much more. As one example, we are building a program called Zillow 360 that enables our customers to sell their current 100 Zillow Offers, by their next time with a Premier Agent and finance it with Zillow Home Loans. The customer then uses Zillow Closing Services to finalize the transaction and ultimately receives a discount for using the bundle package. While we still have a long way to go on scaling Zillow 360, we are seeing strong interest in higher close rates when offering packages of services to customers versus single standalone services. Looking forward, we see our ability to execute on programs like Zillow 360 is competitively differentiated. Due to the volume of visitors to our apps and sites on a daily basis, we are able to spread our low customer acquisition costs across these additional adjacent services, which allows us to pass along savings to our customers while generating returns for our shareholders. As we broaden and integrate our services, our business lines are beginning to merge in service of our end customers. In an effort to pick a long-term success measure that considers this integration, we have increasingly been focusing on total company gross profit dollars. For context in the last 12 months, our total company gross profit was just over $1.9 billion growing 54% compared to the prior 12 month period. Moving forward, we plan to focus on growth profit dollar growth as a key measure of success. First and foremost, the metric is increasingly how we are measuring the business internally. Instead of optimizing for gross profit dollars generated by one particular service, we are increasingly finding ourselves thinking about the total enterprise gross profit pool that is produced when we offer multiple services to our customers. We think this creates the right incentives to run our business and as much more in line with how we want our end customers to think about what we offer to them. Second, this metric level the playing field for comparability between our seemingly disparate businesses that are actually showing up to customers under one Zillow branded umbrella. Set another way, gross profit enables us to simplify comparisons across the various segments, including Zillow offers, where we report revenue based on the full sales price of the home. This simplification allows us to measure our operating efficiency in a more holistic and understandable way. As we ultimately strive to grow total company cash flows over time. From an external perspective, our gross profit measure reminds us that we have built a differentiated platform for growth. One that is tackling all parts of the moving process with so much room to grow across all of our services, and last, as we scan across the competitive set, we look at our sizable gross profit pool as a competitive advantage to further invest in innovation with the end goal of building terrific customer experiences and driving sustainable long-term profitable growth. Since we launched Zillow 2.0, we have vastly broadened our service, which is allowed us to grow our gross profit dollars well beyond real estate industry growth. My expectation is that we will continue to grow our currently small market share transactions like continuing to broaden our services and increasing the number of services each of our customers use per transaction. Embedded in our ability to drive secular growth or some confident assumptions about our business and opportunity, first, consumers will demand an e-commerce experience for their real estate transactions. Second, our scale and strength of brand gives us a customer acquisition cost advantage. Third, our suite of connected offerings fit together well to serve our customers and partners. And fourth, our location flexible workforce will allow us to attract and retain a deeper and more representative talent pool from across the country to best serve our customers. Our recent customer example validated all four of these assumptions. Enna and Tony of Atlanta recently wrapped up a seamless move to their new home with the help of Zillow 360, feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of balancing closing dates with their daughter's school schedule and other commitments, Enna and Tony decided to accept an offer to sell their home to Zillow, recognizing the ease that Zillow brought to this experience, they were intrigued when our teams told them they could buy, finance, close their new homes in Zillow 2.0. The opportunity to align the buying and selling process, so it could work on their timeline was too good to pass up. So we connected them to one of our awesome agent partners who help them find their dream home. By this point, financing with Zillow was no brainer for the couple. To put icing on the cake, I found out last week that Tony was so impressed with Zillow during his move that he subsequently applied for, God offered and then accepted a role with our Zillow office team as an estimator, wow. To close as a significant Zillow shareholder, I evaluate our opportunity in three ways, is our TAM large and untapped? Are we in a strong position to capture that opportunity? And are we able to execute? It is clear. And my 2.5 years back in the CEO seat that the answers to these three questions are all resounding yes. I'm really proud of the progress the team has made, but we do have miles to go before we sleep in our new home on a soft pillow, above a kitchen with marble countertops and a doggy door to the backyard. We truly appreciate your continued support, confidence and investments. I will now pass the microphone over to Allen.\nAllen Parker: Thank you. Thank you, Rich. Zillow group delivered another strong quarter reporting Q2 consolidated revenue of $1.3 billion and EBITDA of $183 million both exceeding the high end of our outlook range, while we accelerated investments into our business in Q2 is important to note that total EBITDA of $183 million was up from $2 million in the same period two years ago. We are at the point in our Zillow 2.0 journey where it makes sense to evolve, how we measure our success. As our business becomes more integrated, our focus is shifting towards growing our total gross profit pool. This will allow us to continue to invest in innovation for our customers and partners and drive sustainable, profitable growth for shareholders, by getting this quarter and going forward, we are now presenting gross profit within our statement of operations. We have made adjustments to our prior period cost of revenue figures to reflect the calculation of gross profit in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments are summarized in Note 2 to our Form 10-Q. Gross profit for Q2 was $538 million, up 92% year-over-year. And it was $1 billion for the first half of 2021, up 70% year-over-year. As we look forward, it is important to note that we will optimize our total gross profit and EBITDA versus individual segment results, as we execute to best serve our customers. Moving to our segment results, Q2 IMT segment revenue was $476 million, growing 70% year-over-year and 40% on a two-year stock basis. Our IMT segment continued to benefit from improved execution that drove higher \u2013 that drove growth and higher intent connections in Premier Agent, continued demand for services in our other IMT segment marketplaces as well as tailwinds in the housing market year-over-year. IMT segment EBITDA was $218 million in Q2 or 46% of IMT segment revenue. The revenue outperformance and continue to operate in efficiency translated into more than 130% year-over-year EBITDA growth in Q2, when excluding the impact of our Better Together discounts from the same period a year ago. Growth in Zillow Offers continue to accelerate in Q2 and exceeded our expectations with 2,086 homes sold, driving $777 million in Home segment revenue. We made progress this quarter in improving our pricing models, including launching the Neural Zestimate, which sharpened our Offers strength. The Neural Zestimate puts more weight on attributes of Homes and allows more granularity at the asset level placing less emphasis on repeat home sales price comparisons. In addition, we continue to make progress building automation at the top of the funnel when providing offers to customers. These improvements drove rapid gains in conversion rates in Q2 when compared to Q1, resulted in record purchases, more than catching up to our pre-pandemic pace. We purchased 3,805 homes during the second quarter, more than double what we purchased in Q1. Our Q2 Zillow Offers unit economics of 576 basis points before interest expense was above the plus or minus 200 basis point guardrails we set for ourselves while working to scale the business. The outsized unit economic results of 665 basis points higher than Q2 2020 did benefit from the ongoing strong housing market, which we fully recognize is temporal in nature, and largely contributed to the 312 basis points, lower home acquisition costs of 87.1% in Q2. We also note that the 353 basis point improvement from a year ago in renovation, holding and selling costs were largely durable operational improvements, clearly some portion of the holding costs and a smaller portion of the renovation costs likely benefited from the strong housing market. But we also see opportunities for continued operational improvements over time. Mortgages segment revenue increased 68% year-over-year in Q2, a $57 million and Mortgages segment EBITDA was a loss of $6 million compared to the midpoint of our outlook range of a loss of $7 million. We made significant progress in our integrated origination platform during the quarter with Zillow Offers contributing approximately 40% of purchase originations, helping to drive 100% sequential purchase growth in Q1 and 90% purchase growth year-over-year. With the increased purchase originations and the slowdown in refinance activity, purchase origination is now comprised 26% of the total loan origination volume, up from 10% in Q1. The purchase mix will bounce around from quarter-to-quarter based on the refinance market, but we are focused on growing our purchase origination platform. This is just one more example of how our services are becoming more integrated and complimentary to one another, following our success in launching Zillow Closing Services. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, on a consolidated level, we expect revenue to be $2 billion at the midpoint of our outlook and EBITDA to be between $94 million and $126 million. In our IMT segment, we expect 15% year-over-year revenue growth and 43% growth over 2019 in Q3 at the midpoint of our outlook range. Within the IMT segment, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be between $352 million to $360 million, up 19% year-over-year and up 48% over Q3 2019 at the midpoint of our outlook. The progress we have made and growing and improving our higher intent connections is allowing us to maintain our PA growth rate on a two-year stock basis, despite the impact of continuing low inventory in the housing market. We expect Q3 IMT EBITDA margin to be 37% at the midpoint of our outlook, down sequentially from 46% in Q2. As we discussed last quarter, we plan to accelerate investments in marketing, staffing and technology in Q3 to drive our 2.0 vision. This includes things like touring, underlying integration products, such as Zillow 360, expanding 3D photos and floor plans along with better integration between Premier Agent and Zillow Home Loans. We expect these investment levels to be consistent in Q3 and Q4 when modeling it is also good to keep in mind the seasonality of typically lower Q4 revenue.  Thinking about full year 2021, it's important to remember that IMT EBITDA exceeded our expectations for the first two quarters of the year. We expect the incremental outperformance in the first half to flow through resulting an IMT EBITDA dollar growth outpacing revenue growth for the full year. In Q3, we expect our Home segment revenue to increase sequentially from Q2 to $1.45 billion at the midpoint of our outlook range. This step up in pace demonstrates our confidence in our ability to scale resulting from the progress we have made in strengthening our pricing models and automating the top of the funnel. Evidence of our accelerated pace can be seen in our homes under contract, which was $1.2 billion at the end of Q2, up 126% from $511 million at the end of Q1. I will reiterate that our goal here is to become a true market maker. As we think about unit economics on a go-forward basis, we would expect to see a unit economics trend towards our stated goal of plus or minus 200 basis points before interest expense over the course of the second half of the year. Please also note that this quarter we provided a wider forecast range for our Home segment, which incorporates a range and resell velocity that we think is appropriate, given we are finding market pricing levels and approaching the slower seasonal period of the year. We expect Mortgages segment revenue to be between $55 million to $62 million in Q3, which is roughly flat from Q2. Our Q3 outlook reflects slower industry refinance activity, consistent gain on sales spreads and continued growth in purchase originations. As a result of flat revenue and continued investments to grow mortgage originations, we expect Mortgages segment EBITDA to be between a loss of $13 million and $6 million. We ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash and investments, which puts us in a strong position to fund our vision for Zillow and make strategic long-term investments both organically and inorganically. As a reminder, we have a $500 million commitment to acquire ShowingTime, as we continue to cooperate with federal regulators to work diligently towards closing the pending acquisition. Earlier this week, at Zillow Offers subsidiary launched in price it's securitized debt offering, which is expected to close on around August 11. The company anticipates gross proceeds of approximately $450 million from the offering. The securities will have a 30-month term and a 24-month reinvestment period in a weighted average interest rate of 2.43%, which is lower than the rate on our existing credit facilities. Similar to our existing debt financing, this is a non-recourse to Zillow group subject to limited exceptions. Proceeds of the offering will be used to finance the growth of Zillow Offers business. The securities weren't registered and not being on this call should be interpreted as an offer of the securities. As we look forward to the balance of the year, my priorities are focused on building processes and mechanisms to support rapid scaling of Zillow 2.0 products and services, prioritizing investments in sustainable gross profit growth opportunities across the company, improving our cost structure by increasing productivity and transaction services through operational discipline. And with that operator, we'll open the line for questions\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Good afternoon. Rich, you mentioned that you're on track to for your 2019 original goal to hit over the next three to five years. Could you just articulate the pathway of what you need to do now to achieve the full vision of that goal? And then I had a quick follow-up.\nRich Barton: Hey, Brent. Thanks. Yes. Zillow Offers is back on track which is nice. In terms of the kind of constraints to the plan going forward and then achieving the ultimate dream here, I guess I classify them in three categories. One ourselves, two, consumer awareness, and three capital. The biggest one and most important one constraint is ourselves and by that I'm just saying it's execution. Like we're growing this thing as rapidly as we can, and really quickly in an operationally complex way and we're tuning it simultaneously. So it is a challenge we've got to focus on increasing automation. We've got to get better and better at pricing. We have to reduce costs all at the same time. So there is a executional constraint or challenge that I do I believe, and I'm confident we're up for it. But that's the biggest. The consumer awareness one, I talked about it a little bit, in my prepared remarks. It's not insurmountable at all. It is a relatively straightforward marketing challenge to have such a compelling consumer proposition. So I think we're okay there, we will have to focus on increasing consumer awareness of it though. But again, we have a big advantage with these hundreds of millions of people that come to Zillow, looking at Zestimate, many of which are Zestimate offers now. So we have we're up to that challenge. And then capital, you heard Allen talk in a very legally scripted way due to SEC regulations about where we are in that offering right now, but we're, I'm really excited by the progress we are making on cheapening, deepening and lengthening our access to capital. So while it is a really important constraint, it's kind of the fuel for the ship. We're looking very good on access \u2013 on securing access to that fuel. I know I'm getting long-winded. You asked it a bit of a kind of ultimate opportunity in TAM question. I confess to being quite excited by how well Zillow Offers is doing in such a hot sellers market, which has me for one kind of probing at the perimeter of my kind of penetration and TAM expectations here. And thinking about, just how \u2013 we don't know of course, but just how much of the market will end up moving towards iBuying and Zillow Offers solution, I don't know, but comparatively more confident now than I was even a quarter ago \u2013 so even a quarter ago. So it feels good to me. TAM is a good question, but it is a question for later we're so under penetrated right now at less than \u2013 way less than 1% of home transactions that we can kind of begin to explore that in more detail later, just because it's such early days anyway. Thanks for the question, Brent.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ron Josey of JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. And Rich, just wanted to say, I really appreciate your podcasts this quarter on how I built this. And I wanted to ask a little bit more on the early on Zillow 2.0 and the launching of Zillow 360. I know we're in the early stages and I think you said miles to go, but we also set talked about 40% of purchase originations were sourced by Zillow Offers. And so we're starting to see this integration happened in the real world. And so maybe talk just about what needs to happen for all these integrations. Maybe the bigger picture from a value can we know the consumer value prop, but just the bigger picture of the roadmap of how PA integrates with Offers and integrates with Mortgages, et cetera. And then since, we're more focused on gross profit would love to understand the financial benefits of call it the bundling. Thank you.\nRich Barton: Okay. Thanks for the question, Ron. Yes, and that guy Ross thing was \u2013 it was fun. It was a bit of a death march though. I think the interview went for like four hours and he clipped it down to an hour. I was kind of exhausted by the end of that thing, but it was fun. Okay. So yes, I mean, clearly Zillow is going \u2013 going \u2013 accelerating as you noted. And you also noted that kind of interestingly, so is everything else, all right. And it's not just the market that's doing that for us. PA is cooking really nicely and has plenty of room, our Premier Agent business. Rentals is growing nicely. Mortgages is going and Zillow Closing Services is going really nicely as well. It just turns out it's not a surprise. It's a bet we've made. But it just turns out that all of these businesses are interrelated because it really is. They're all just part of one transaction. I've come to think of them as different doors into the same room. That room is I want to move, make it easier, please, so our ability to increasingly package integrate and offer these mix and match menu of services is clearly working. The numbers tell the story there. So that anecdotal data point we gave you, you just cited the 40% of purchase mortgages originating with Zillow door is one of the kind of specifics we're sharing to kind of give some light on that. We also have had some early success with our Zillow 360, which is a new package that offers a discount that we're playing around with. And that's showing real promise. The Zillow Closing Services attached is going well. So we can look at \u2013 we can begin to look at these little breadcrumbs of it working, but I think the best evidence is really staring us in the face. And that is just simply looking at quantum gross profit, $1.9 billion of trailing 12 months quantum gross profit, that's big and it's growing quickly. And it is that pool of gross profit that funds all of this other cool stuff that we're doing, all of this R&D, all of this marketing, all of these new services that are in development for our customers. And as we're able to invest all of that money in these things, the lovely scale economy wheel begins to turn and it's turning nicely right now. Anyway, so it's that integration of the businesses that has driven us internally to look at this overall gross profit dollars, rather than by vertical business. We also want to be able to play with pricing as well without having internal competition. It's all just one transaction. On a go-forward basis, you asked what are we watching, and I would say that, we're focused on the normal, typical, transactional e-commerce like drivers, okay. That your experience with your e-commerce companies, very different from the old Zillow, very similar to your e-commerce companies, how many trends \u2013 how many transacting customers do we have? How many transactions do we have? How many services per transactions are there? What is the profit per transaction? Okay. And we have an eye on the overall customer package profitability rather than optimizing for any of these individual ones. So that's one of the key reasons we like it, we like the comparability to. Our guidance ramp implies a ramp \u2013 our guidance implies a ramp in gross profit, right. but I for one and quite \u2013 as you can hear, I'm quite excited by the potential growth of each of these variables that go into the gross profit equation. Each one of those drivers that I just laid out, I see lots of opportunity for driving higher, which will multiply the leverage we see or growth leverage we see and we now have organized the company, we're organizing our filings and segment reporting, we're getting organized around these new e-commerce transactional metrics. So anyway, I had tons of interesting stuff ahead in my opinion.\nRon Josey: Thanks, Rich. Very helpful.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brad Erikson of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBrad Erikson: Thanks. So I guess a question for Allen. Allen, you talked about the accelerating investment across the IMT business. So I guess within that, there's a lot of moving parts, but maybe just talk about how sustainable the IMT margins are feeling certainly through the second half of the year and then maybe beyond, and then separately. Can you just give us any details, I guess, on how some of those investments are being allocated here in the second half of the year? Thanks.\nAllen Parker: Yes. Brett, thanks for the question. Well, I'll start just to reiterate that what we said before, we believe the margins that we saw in the second half of 2020 and continuing into the first half of 2021 for IMT are indicative of the inherent underlying margins of steady state business. But we're still very early in our journey and we see opportunities to invest into growth. We participate only in a small percentage of transactions relative to our audience and the industry. Our Q3 outlook implies 37% EBITDA margins at the midpoint, which is down 875 basis points sequentially. We expect our Q4 investment levels to be consistent with Q3 factoring in that Q4 revenues do experience historically a little weaker seasonality as compared to Q3, but fairly consistent in the Q4. I'd note that the 37% margins are still up significantly over 2019 full year levels, which are 23.8%, and up from our three to five-year objectives at 30%. So while we're increasing our investment levels in the second half of 2021, we continue to generate leverage across the segment as we've made progress even during the pandemic. In terms of areas of investment or where we're thinking of investing, I called out some tangible examples in my prepared remarks. The priorities we have is to drive better customer experience, broader integrated product offerings, and continued scalability through operational rigor and automation across the businesses. It gets back to Rich's point that the consumer is going to demand an e-commerce solution for the industry and we're well positioned to serve that. We do expect these investments deliver strong ROI via gross profit growth, and we believe it's prudent given our focus on the customer and driving transactions to make these investments. It's the right thing to do to continue to invest here.\nBrad Erikson: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Wanted into sort of drill a little bit into the PA growth in the quarter there's a lot of discussion around sort of the macro housing market and certainly will a deceleration and transactions impact growth? Maybe talk to us about what you saw on growth in price per impression or transaction growth. You mentioned earlier, Rich. So what are you seeing in sort of the underlying auction dynamics driving this PA growth? And then what are you sort of incorporating in the guide from a transaction or a price per transaction perspective? Just so we can sort of understand the macro assumptions underlying the business right now.\nAllen Parker: Yes. So maybe I'll start Rich and you could follow on. Thanks for the question, Brian. First, I'll say I have been really impressed by our PA team's execution, while the macro over the last 12 months has provided some tailwinds. This really is I think a story of execution in terms of our performance. We\u2019re continuing to grow the quantity and quality of the connections. We\u2019ve said that a few times. So, our Q3 guide implies PA revenue growth of 19% year-over-year at the midpoint, but 48% growth over the two year stack compared to Q3 2019. We\u2019ve have demonstrated our ability to improve and grow our higher intent connections by enhancing how our customers shop at Zillow with a particular focus on touring. We believe this is the next opportunity, and it\u2019s part of our endless quest to improve the integrity of our funnel and improve customer experience for our consumer customers, looking to move and buy a house. When a customer raises their hand to work with one of our partner agents, we are constantly finding how quickly we introduced him to that customer that customer to our agent. And that makes all the difference in such a competitive buying environment. So again, what I\u2019d say is, a lot of the factors that we look to that are driving growth are our ability to take our customers that are in the funnel based on the actions they take, take the high intent customers, provide them with a great performing agent, quickly to help them get to the home that they want to buy. And again, we\u2019re continuing to introduce our customers to higher performing agents as well as we go through our agent base, who share the same goal was us, which is helping our mutual customer buy their next home. So lastly, we continue to see opportunities to invest in innovation and technology. We\u2019re investing, because we think there\u2019s a really good return here and a big opportunity, while we have a large audience with still a very small percentage of the transaction share. Rich, I don\u2019t know if you would add anything.\nRich Barton: Well, Hey, Brian. Yes, I mean, so recent macro stuff in the industry, like skinny inventory for \u2013 of homes, coupled with super rapid sales cycles, and skinny rental inventory as well is obviously factoring into our business in some way and factoring into our guidance. I think we\u2019re lucky though, and that\u2019s really big trend that sits above all the throne to rule them all for us here is this kind of big shift of offline to online. That\u2019s the big lever kind of the old way, the new way, analog to digital. And we\u2019re really a great beneficiary there as the digital leader. We see that as the dominant trend and there are some kind of smaller, shorter wavelengths, cyclical things going on in the industry right now that certainly affect things. But I don\u2019t want to ignore them, but are a little less important. That said, even in those cycles, we see the big tailwinds being demographics for millennials, low interest rates, and the great reshuffling as good durable positive housing market macro wins. On the PA guide in particular that you\u2019re asking, I\u2019ll also say that yes, the PA transaction and revenue guide is important. But it is just one of many transactions that are happening now and happening in an increasingly integrated way. So I\u2019d be remiss without pointing out that looking at kind of transactions overall is the \u2013 is what tells the big \u2013 I think the big story and the really good news for us going forward.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thank you both.\nRich Barton: Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: The next question comes from Spencer Ken of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nRich Barton: Spencer, you might be on mute.\nMark Mahaney: Hello. Can you hear me?\nRich Barton: Yes, we can.\nMark Mahaney: It\u2019s Mark Mahaney. Sorry. I think we got our codes mixed up. Sorry about that, Rich. I like the gross profit maximization optimization reporting strategy, ethos, whatever it is. I\u2019m not sure about quantum gross profit, but gross profit I get. So I think that\u2019s good. I like that. And then the one question I had had to do with these \u2013 the guardrails getting back to that plus or minus 200 bps. Now you\u2019ve been saying this for a bit in the last couple of quarters, you\u2019ve been well above that. What\u2019s the most logical way for which of those expense items is going to show a little bit of deleverage and get you back down to that negative 200 deposit of 200. Thanks.\nAllen Parker: Yes. I can start Rich. So I think if you look at the improvement, I called out in my remarks, the 312 basis points that we\u2019ve seen versus this time last year Q2 of 2020 in acquisition costs, that\u2019s going to be the area where we see most of the decline as we move back into our guardrails. We\u2019ll likely see if sales velocity, resell velocity goes down a little, we\u2019ll likely see a slight uptick in holding costs. But the big change is just going to be this. Right now, we\u2019ve got a 13% spread between what we sell the house for and what we acquired it for. And again, as a market maker, that spread is being impacted by HPA. And we expect that to go down over time and be more temporal.\nRich Barton: Yes. Price is moving really quickly, Mark, it\u2019s hard for us to keep up with it. On the quantum gross profit, let me argue though, just make the argument I did, but maybe I wasn\u2019t clear, is this normal? It\u2019s just a big pool and that big pool enables us to invest a ton more in tech and R&D than competitor. So, I mean, it\u2019s kind of a way of us making sure that we can internally compare things on a level playing field, but it enables \u2013 you all were looking at gross profit already, honestly. So, that\u2019s maybe not the way, it\u2019s not big news to you. But we\u2019re beginning to \u2013 we have begun to really focus on it internally anyway.\nMark Mahaney: No. It makes a lot of sense. Thanks. Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan McKeveny of Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.\nRyan McKeveny: Hey guys, congrats on the results and also on the securitization. Thank you for taking my questions. Following up a bit on Mark\u2019s question just now around the guardrail \u2013 the guardrails, and maybe asking a bit differently. Where are the service fees today? And if you can\u2019t say directly, maybe directionally, how have those changed. And I think implied in your commentary about testing the price elasticity and seeing the conversion on the improved offer strength effectively implies a better fee to the customer. And I guess part two of this question is ultimately if we move to a housing market, that home price is growing at a more normal pace, as opposed to the rapid gains we\u2019ve seen. What do you envision as that consumer fee, maybe relative to the competitive set of traditional commission rates, because I think ultimately that\u2019s what investors are somewhat grappling with on the margin profile of buying is ultimately where the margin shakes out in a more normalized environment. So we\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on kind of the consumer fee piece of things, where that has trended and ultimately where that may shake out in a more normal environment. Thank you very much.\nRich Barton: You want to start Allen?\nAllen Parker: I can. Yes. So I guess, I would describe it one, thanks for the question is we\u2019ve provided a kind of long at scale type profitability. We think we can get on a return on home sold before interest of around 400 to 500 basis points. But again, given the penetration, the low penetration numbers of iBuying right now, and the opportunity to scale the guardrails that we\u2019ve set are the plus or minus 200 basis points. We don\u2019t think about it, I guess, in individual components of fee versus value. We kind of look at it, what\u2019s the overall transaction cost to the customer to incent them and that we can still turn into a profitable business. So I think the fee is likely to continue to vacillate and change as we test pricing and elasticity. What we\u2019re focused on is trying to get the most accurate pricing to be fair to the customer and to continue to reduce our cost structure with the benefits of scale automation and productivity. So I guess to answer your question, we still believe on a standalone basis the 400 to 500 basis points at scale is likely a number that we would see as a market maker. But it\u2019ll come in a lot of different forms. And then as Rich mentioned, what will also be there is as we have our customers come through various funnels on Zillow their ability or their willingness as we introduce multiple services to them to take those multiple services allows us to provide even sharper pricing across those services, because we\u2019re not having to go out and use CAC to acquire each customer for each service. Rich or Brad, would you add anything?\nRich Barton: I thought that was pretty good, Allen, really good. We think if we can get \u2013 we\u2019ll play with all these different levers that we have, Ryan, with the fee, home price appreciation, net price, et cetera, we\u2019ll play with it. But ultimately what we\u2019re trying to do is get people an amount of dollars in their pocket that they would have gotten approximately what they would have gotten via any other way that they would have sold, that\u2019s the goal. And we think doing that, offering a fair price, it\u2019s a terrific consumer proposition and a great business for us.\nRyan McKeveny: That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Thank you both. And one follow-up question on the cost side of the iBuying model. So the selling cost as a percent of revenue, I think this is the third quarter in a row, maybe longer that that\u2019s been 3.8% of revenue. And I think one of the assumptions has been that using in-house agents on the iBuyer transactions would over time move that selling cost lower, actually make more leverage in the model on that. So is that still a fair expectation going forward? And maybe just big picture, where are you in the process of transitioning to the in-house agents? Thank you.\nRich Barton: Yes. So I think the answer to your first question is, we continue to see opportunity to reduce the 3.8% as we build Zillow brokerage services, as well as continued to partner with our agents. We are still very early in the number of markets that we have Zillow broken services in. And so, we are focused on scaling the business as well as Zillow broker services, but it\u2019s still relatively early as we roll that out.\nRyan McKeveny: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This completes the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Rich Barton for any closing remarks.\nRich Barton: Okay. Well, thanks everybody. Thanks for your time today. I know it\u2019s a busy earnings day. And I\u2019m on the East Coast, so I know its perch and cocktail hour as well. We appreciate your continued support and confidence. And I look forward \u2013 we all look forward to talking with you again really soon. Have a nice night.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rich Barton",
            "content": "Thanks, Brad. Hello, everyone. I hope you're all enjoying the summer wherever you may be. I am Zoom connecting once again from Zillow CloudHQ. We had another strong quarter for Zillow with our consolidated business, as well as each segment meeting or beating our outlook ranges. We've begun to show good execution on Zillow 2.0, our dream of building a seamless integrated experience for our customers and partners. I will talk more about that in just a moment. But first I will top line some quarterly highlights. On the buy side, Premier Agent revenue grew 82% year-over-year and 50% compared to two years ago. Our goal on the buy side of the real estate transaction is to connect high intent customers with high performing partners. And our performance was driven by strong execution against this goal, as well as continued housing industry tailwinds. We continue to improve the quality and quantity of connections we send to our partners by enhancing how our customers shop on Zillow with a particular focus on touring. In addition, once a customer raises her hand to work with a Zillow Premier Agent, we are constantly refining how quickly we introduce that customer to her agent, which makes all the difference in such a competitive buyer environment. On the partner side, we continue to focus on building a network of high performing agents who are aligned with us on providing a high quality experience to our customers as they move to a new home. On the sell side, Zillow Offers continued to accelerate in Q2 with a record 3,805 homes purchased. We sold 2,086 homes generating a record $777 million in revenue on our Home segment, surpassing our internal expectations for both revenue and EBITDA. Importantly, the Zillow Offers value proposition of a fast, fair, flexible and convenient close has proved more than durable, even in this sizzling hot sellers market. It's a nod to just have dreadful and dreaded prospect of selling, buying and moving is to people. Likely this is not a surprise to any of you. In our surveys of homeowners who want and need to move, when we present the Zillow Offers concept, the largest objection is there must be a catch. I'm pretty happy to market to that objection. As we discussed on our last call, we entered Q2 with strong customer interest in ZO, which accelerated throughout the quarter and into Q3. Allen will get into more details. But as we said on our Q1 call, we saw significant customer demand at the beginning of Q2 that we expected would drive revenue growth on a lagged basis in Q3, which is now leading to our strong Q3 outlook. And we continued to see strong growth in customer demand as we entered Q3 that we expect will favorably impact revenue in future quarters. With that in mind, we are focused on making progress automating key workflows in support of building a large scale operation. Also as we discussed last quarter, we recognized that our Zillow Offers unit economics are above our plus or minus 200 basis point guardrails as we build and scale the business, a trend that continued in Q2 despite our efforts. We expect these unit economic trends to normalize over time as we iterate, continue to learn and as home price appreciation inevitably slows. We've been testing pricing elasticity in this hot housing market and we saw rapid conversion game throughout the quarter as we improved our offer strength. We believe these tests will serve as well across future market conditions. As we strive to be a market maker across housing cycles. We expect to the homes we are scheduled to purchase will trend towards our plus or minus 200 basis points target over the course of the second half of the year. Additionally, earlier this week, a Zillow Offers subsidiary launched and priced a securitized debt offering, which is expected to close next week. Allen will provide more details on this later in the call. As the Zillow Offers business continues to accelerate, we are seeing lift to our Zillow Home Loans with approximately 40% of purchase originations in Q2 sourced from Zillow Offers. In total, our Q2 purchase originations grew by 90% year-over-year as we continue to build a mortgage factory that serves both purchase and refinance transactions. An example of this is our new self service mortgage prequalification offering, which automates the process and makes it more efficient for our customers. All of these efforts came together this quarter to deliver a total company revenue of $1.3 billion up 70% year-over-year. And importantly, our newly provided gross profit measure, which I will talk to more in a moment, was $538 million in Q2, up 92% year-over-year and 79% from the same period two years ago. Now onto what's happening around us. We believe there is strong durable support for the housing market. Historically work and location have been inextricably bound together. The pandemic has jolting and dramatically unbundled work from location for many, creating a new flexibility by enabling people to optimize for work and location separately and simultaneously. Moving to the big city is no longer a requirement for many job seekers and that shift will inevitably disperse talent and economic opportunities. This untethering of location from work fields deeply important to me for the future of work and life and by implication housing, what we've been calling the great reshuffling. It is also why we at Zillow leaned in hard and early on the CloudHQ idea as the future of work, as you can read about it in today's New York Times front page business section article by Sarah Kessler, featuring Zillow Vice President, Meghan Reibstein one of our many folks who cut the cord from our old Seattle HQ and moved to Asheville, North Carolina, to be near and support her family. On the recruiting side year-to-date, we have had 153,000 candidates apply for a job at Zillow, which we believe has been fueled in part by the possibilities of our permanent location flexible policy. This is one of the factors we see driving the housing market for some time, the other important factors being millennials entering their prime home buying years and low interest rates. Stepping back, we have always had audacious goals guided by our strong urge to empower people vis-a-vis the expensive, confusing, emotionally and financially fraught process of buying and selling a home. Our initial dream was to build the most trusted environment home-related marketplace and to solve a big problem in real estate, the lack of transparency in home shopping, to turn on the lights. This dream started with both the Zestimate, our killer algorithm that put a price on every rooftop in America and zillow.com one marketplace where everyone could search and find homes with data easily at their fingertips, something not possible prior to Zillow. This transparency and convenience became the accelerant for establishing Zillow's brand in real estate and making it the most popular place to dream and shop with an average of 229 million monthly unique users coming to our mobile apps and websites in Q2, including our great adopted sister brands, Trulia and StreetEasy. Zillow brand became synonymous with real estate empowerment. But the fundamental transaction continued to be painfully stuck in the 50s, resisting the gravity of digitization. So our dream and ambition moved from the top of the consumer funnel down to the bottom of the funnel to the transaction itself. We of course, recognize that our huge brand and traffic, as well as our DNA as software engineers, many of us grew up at Microsoft in the 90's would advantage us relative to this large and daunting challenge. So our expanded dream is to reengineer streamline and digitize the moving process, as you heard me call it many times Zillow 2.0. We believe customers want speed, simplicity, integration and value, fairly safe consumer desires in which to invest in my opinion. To deliver on this dream, our strategy has been to build an integrated set of real estate products and services, both owned and operated and with professional partners that can be mixed and matched to make it radically easier for all the dreamers and choppers on to transact and move to their next chapters. We are executing nicely on this ambitious growth strategy and progressing well towards each of the three to five year growth objectives that we communicated 2.5 years ago when we announced Zillow 2.0. In our IMT segment, our stated three to five-year objective was $2 billion in revenue up from $1.2 billion for 2018, and we are on track to deliver. Additionally, our current run rate has already exceeded our original three to five-year objective for IMT segment annual EBITDA of $600 million and 30% margin. And our Home segment is performing well just by completely shutting down purchases in the early phases of the pandemic and building operations during the most rapid change in home prices ever recorded. As I said above, we are now back on track with our original objective to purchase 5,000 homes per month and to generate annualized revenue of $20 billion within the original three to five-year timeline. For Zillow Home Loans were also on course to achieve our stated goal of 3,000 mortgages originated per month within the original timeframe we set. Today, we are seeing more and more signals from our customers that validate our integration thesis and growth strategy. Home shoppers and buyers who once just thought of Zillow as a place to search and find are starting to understand and take advantage of the reality that we now offer so much more. As one example, we are building a program called Zillow 360 that enables our customers to sell their current 100 Zillow Offers, by their next time with a Premier Agent and finance it with Zillow Home Loans. The customer then uses Zillow Closing Services to finalize the transaction and ultimately receives a discount for using the bundle package. While we still have a long way to go on scaling Zillow 360, we are seeing strong interest in higher close rates when offering packages of services to customers versus single standalone services. Looking forward, we see our ability to execute on programs like Zillow 360 is competitively differentiated. Due to the volume of visitors to our apps and sites on a daily basis, we are able to spread our low customer acquisition costs across these additional adjacent services, which allows us to pass along savings to our customers while generating returns for our shareholders. As we broaden and integrate our services, our business lines are beginning to merge in service of our end customers. In an effort to pick a long-term success measure that considers this integration, we have increasingly been focusing on total company gross profit dollars. For context in the last 12 months, our total company gross profit was just over $1.9 billion growing 54% compared to the prior 12 month period. Moving forward, we plan to focus on growth profit dollar growth as a key measure of success. First and foremost, the metric is increasingly how we are measuring the business internally. Instead of optimizing for gross profit dollars generated by one particular service, we are increasingly finding ourselves thinking about the total enterprise gross profit pool that is produced when we offer multiple services to our customers. We think this creates the right incentives to run our business and as much more in line with how we want our end customers to think about what we offer to them. Second, this metric level the playing field for comparability between our seemingly disparate businesses that are actually showing up to customers under one Zillow branded umbrella. Set another way, gross profit enables us to simplify comparisons across the various segments, including Zillow offers, where we report revenue based on the full sales price of the home. This simplification allows us to measure our operating efficiency in a more holistic and understandable way. As we ultimately strive to grow total company cash flows over time. From an external perspective, our gross profit measure reminds us that we have built a differentiated platform for growth. One that is tackling all parts of the moving process with so much room to grow across all of our services, and last, as we scan across the competitive set, we look at our sizable gross profit pool as a competitive advantage to further invest in innovation with the end goal of building terrific customer experiences and driving sustainable long-term profitable growth. Since we launched Zillow 2.0, we have vastly broadened our service, which is allowed us to grow our gross profit dollars well beyond real estate industry growth. My expectation is that we will continue to grow our currently small market share transactions like continuing to broaden our services and increasing the number of services each of our customers use per transaction. Embedded in our ability to drive secular growth or some confident assumptions about our business and opportunity, first, consumers will demand an e-commerce experience for their real estate transactions. Second, our scale and strength of brand gives us a customer acquisition cost advantage. Third, our suite of connected offerings fit together well to serve our customers and partners. And fourth, our location flexible workforce will allow us to attract and retain a deeper and more representative talent pool from across the country to best serve our customers. Our recent customer example validated all four of these assumptions. Enna and Tony of Atlanta recently wrapped up a seamless move to their new home with the help of Zillow 360, feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of balancing closing dates with their daughter's school schedule and other commitments, Enna and Tony decided to accept an offer to sell their home to Zillow, recognizing the ease that Zillow brought to this experience, they were intrigued when our teams told them they could buy, finance, close their new homes in Zillow 2.0. The opportunity to align the buying and selling process, so it could work on their timeline was too good to pass up. So we connected them to one of our awesome agent partners who help them find their dream home. By this point, financing with Zillow was no brainer for the couple. To put icing on the cake, I found out last week that Tony was so impressed with Zillow during his move that he subsequently applied for, God offered and then accepted a role with our Zillow office team as an estimator, wow. To close as a significant Zillow shareholder, I evaluate our opportunity in three ways, is our TAM large and untapped? Are we in a strong position to capture that opportunity? And are we able to execute? It is clear. And my 2.5 years back in the CEO seat that the answers to these three questions are all resounding yes. I'm really proud of the progress the team has made, but we do have miles to go before we sleep in our new home on a soft pillow, above a kitchen with marble countertops and a doggy door to the backyard. We truly appreciate your continued support, confidence and investments. I will now pass the microphone over to Allen. Hey, Brent. Thanks. Yes. Zillow Offers is back on track which is nice. In terms of the kind of constraints to the plan going forward and then achieving the ultimate dream here, I guess I classify them in three categories. One ourselves, two, consumer awareness, and three capital. The biggest one and most important one constraint is ourselves and by that I'm just saying it's execution. Like we're growing this thing as rapidly as we can, and really quickly in an operationally complex way and we're tuning it simultaneously. So it is a challenge we've got to focus on increasing automation. We've got to get better and better at pricing. We have to reduce costs all at the same time. So there is a executional constraint or challenge that I do I believe, and I'm confident we're up for it. But that's the biggest. The consumer awareness one, I talked about it a little bit, in my prepared remarks. It's not insurmountable at all. It is a relatively straightforward marketing challenge to have such a compelling consumer proposition. So I think we're okay there, we will have to focus on increasing consumer awareness of it though. But again, we have a big advantage with these hundreds of millions of people that come to Zillow, looking at Zestimate, many of which are Zestimate offers now. So we have we're up to that challenge. And then capital, you heard Allen talk in a very legally scripted way due to SEC regulations about where we are in that offering right now, but we're, I'm really excited by the progress we are making on cheapening, deepening and lengthening our access to capital. So while it is a really important constraint, it's kind of the fuel for the ship. We're looking very good on access \u2013 on securing access to that fuel. I know I'm getting long-winded. You asked it a bit of a kind of ultimate opportunity in TAM question. I confess to being quite excited by how well Zillow Offers is doing in such a hot sellers market, which has me for one kind of probing at the perimeter of my kind of penetration and TAM expectations here. And thinking about, just how \u2013 we don't know of course, but just how much of the market will end up moving towards iBuying and Zillow Offers solution, I don't know, but comparatively more confident now than I was even a quarter ago \u2013 so even a quarter ago. So it feels good to me. TAM is a good question, but it is a question for later we're so under penetrated right now at less than \u2013 way less than 1% of home transactions that we can kind of begin to explore that in more detail later, just because it's such early days anyway. Thanks for the question, Brent. Okay. Thanks for the question, Ron. Yes, and that guy Ross thing was \u2013 it was fun. It was a bit of a death march though. I think the interview went for like four hours and he clipped it down to an hour. I was kind of exhausted by the end of that thing, but it was fun. Okay. So yes, I mean, clearly Zillow is going \u2013 going \u2013 accelerating as you noted. And you also noted that kind of interestingly, so is everything else, all right. And it's not just the market that's doing that for us. PA is cooking really nicely and has plenty of room, our Premier Agent business. Rentals is growing nicely. Mortgages is going and Zillow Closing Services is going really nicely as well. It just turns out it's not a surprise. It's a bet we've made. But it just turns out that all of these businesses are interrelated because it really is. They're all just part of one transaction. I've come to think of them as different doors into the same room. That room is I want to move, make it easier, please, so our ability to increasingly package integrate and offer these mix and match menu of services is clearly working. The numbers tell the story there. So that anecdotal data point we gave you, you just cited the 40% of purchase mortgages originating with Zillow door is one of the kind of specifics we're sharing to kind of give some light on that. We also have had some early success with our Zillow 360, which is a new package that offers a discount that we're playing around with. And that's showing real promise. The Zillow Closing Services attached is going well. So we can look at \u2013 we can begin to look at these little breadcrumbs of it working, but I think the best evidence is really staring us in the face. And that is just simply looking at quantum gross profit, $1.9 billion of trailing 12 months quantum gross profit, that's big and it's growing quickly. And it is that pool of gross profit that funds all of this other cool stuff that we're doing, all of this R&D, all of this marketing, all of these new services that are in development for our customers. And as we're able to invest all of that money in these things, the lovely scale economy wheel begins to turn and it's turning nicely right now. Anyway, so it's that integration of the businesses that has driven us internally to look at this overall gross profit dollars, rather than by vertical business. We also want to be able to play with pricing as well without having internal competition. It's all just one transaction. On a go-forward basis, you asked what are we watching, and I would say that, we're focused on the normal, typical, transactional e-commerce like drivers, okay. That your experience with your e-commerce companies, very different from the old Zillow, very similar to your e-commerce companies, how many trends \u2013 how many transacting customers do we have? How many transactions do we have? How many services per transactions are there? What is the profit per transaction? Okay. And we have an eye on the overall customer package profitability rather than optimizing for any of these individual ones. So that's one of the key reasons we like it, we like the comparability to. Our guidance ramp implies a ramp \u2013 our guidance implies a ramp in gross profit, right. but I for one and quite \u2013 as you can hear, I'm quite excited by the potential growth of each of these variables that go into the gross profit equation. Each one of those drivers that I just laid out, I see lots of opportunity for driving higher, which will multiply the leverage we see or growth leverage we see and we now have organized the company, we're organizing our filings and segment reporting, we're getting organized around these new e-commerce transactional metrics. So anyway, I had tons of interesting stuff ahead in my opinion. Well, Hey, Brian. Yes, I mean, so recent macro stuff in the industry, like skinny inventory for \u2013 of homes, coupled with super rapid sales cycles, and skinny rental inventory as well is obviously factoring into our business in some way and factoring into our guidance. I think we're lucky though, and that's really big trend that sits above all the throne to rule them all for us here is this kind of big shift of offline to online. That's the big lever kind of the old way, the new way, analog to digital. And we're really a great beneficiary there as the digital leader. We see that as the dominant trend and there are some kind of smaller, shorter wavelengths, cyclical things going on in the industry right now that certainly affect things. But I don't want to ignore them, but are a little less important. That said, even in those cycles, we see the big tailwinds being demographics for millennials, low interest rates, and the great reshuffling as good durable positive housing market macro wins. On the PA guide in particular that you're asking, I'll also say that yes, the PA transaction and revenue guide is important. But it is just one of many transactions that are happening now and happening in an increasingly integrated way. So I'd be remiss without pointing out that looking at kind of transactions overall is the \u2013 is what tells the big \u2013 I think the big story and the really good news for us going forward. Thanks, Brian. Spencer, you might be on mute. Yes, we can. Yes. Price is moving really quickly, Mark, it's hard for us to keep up with it. On the quantum gross profit, let me argue though, just make the argument I did, but maybe I wasn't clear, is this normal? It's just a big pool and that big pool enables us to invest a ton more in tech and R&D than competitor. So, I mean, it's kind of a way of us making sure that we can internally compare things on a level playing field, but it enables \u2013 you all were looking at gross profit already, honestly. So, that's maybe not the way, it's not big news to you. But we're beginning to \u2013 we have begun to really focus on it internally anyway. You want to start Allen? I thought that was pretty good, Allen, really good. We think if we can get \u2013 we'll play with all these different levers that we have, Ryan, with the fee, home price appreciation, net price, et cetera, we'll play with it. But ultimately what we're trying to do is get people an amount of dollars in their pocket that they would have gotten approximately what they would have gotten via any other way that they would have sold, that's the goal. And we think doing that, offering a fair price, it's a terrific consumer proposition and a great business for us. Yes. So I think the answer to your first question is, we continue to see opportunity to reduce the 3.8% as we build Zillow brokerage services, as well as continued to partner with our agents. We are still very early in the number of markets that we have Zillow broken services in. And so, we are focused on scaling the business as well as Zillow broker services, but it's still relatively early as we roll that out. Okay. Well, thanks everybody. Thanks for your time today. I know it's a busy earnings day. And I'm on the East Coast, so I know its perch and cocktail hour as well. We appreciate your continued support and confidence. And I look forward \u2013 we all look forward to talking with you again really soon. Have a nice night."

            "content": "Thank you. Thank you, Rich. Zillow group delivered another strong quarter reporting Q2 consolidated revenue of $1.3 billion and EBITDA of $183 million both exceeding the high end of our outlook range, while we accelerated investments into our business in Q2 is important to note that total EBITDA of $183 million was up from $2 million in the same period two years ago. We are at the point in our Zillow 2.0 journey where it makes sense to evolve, how we measure our success. As our business becomes more integrated, our focus is shifting towards growing our total gross profit pool. This will allow us to continue to invest in innovation for our customers and partners and drive sustainable, profitable growth for shareholders, by getting this quarter and going forward, we are now presenting gross profit within our statement of operations. We have made adjustments to our prior period cost of revenue figures to reflect the calculation of gross profit in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments are summarized in Note 2 to our Form 10-Q. Gross profit for Q2 was $538 million, up 92% year-over-year. And it was $1 billion for the first half of 2021, up 70% year-over-year. As we look forward, it is important to note that we will optimize our total gross profit and EBITDA versus individual segment results, as we execute to best serve our customers. Moving to our segment results, Q2 IMT segment revenue was $476 million, growing 70% year-over-year and 40% on a two-year stock basis. Our IMT segment continued to benefit from improved execution that drove higher \u2013 that drove growth and higher intent connections in Premier Agent, continued demand for services in our other IMT segment marketplaces as well as tailwinds in the housing market year-over-year. IMT segment EBITDA was $218 million in Q2 or 46% of IMT segment revenue. The revenue outperformance and continue to operate in efficiency translated into more than 130% year-over-year EBITDA growth in Q2, when excluding the impact of our Better Together discounts from the same period a year ago. Growth in Zillow Offers continue to accelerate in Q2 and exceeded our expectations with 2,086 homes sold, driving $777 million in Home segment revenue. We made progress this quarter in improving our pricing models, including launching the Neural Zestimate, which sharpened our Offers strength. The Neural Zestimate puts more weight on attributes of Homes and allows more granularity at the asset level placing less emphasis on repeat home sales price comparisons. In addition, we continue to make progress building automation at the top of the funnel when providing offers to customers. These improvements drove rapid gains in conversion rates in Q2 when compared to Q1, resulted in record purchases, more than catching up to our pre-pandemic pace. We purchased 3,805 homes during the second quarter, more than double what we purchased in Q1. Our Q2 Zillow Offers unit economics of 576 basis points before interest expense was above the plus or minus 200 basis point guardrails we set for ourselves while working to scale the business. The outsized unit economic results of 665 basis points higher than Q2 2020 did benefit from the ongoing strong housing market, which we fully recognize is temporal in nature, and largely contributed to the 312 basis points, lower home acquisition costs of 87.1% in Q2. We also note that the 353 basis point improvement from a year ago in renovation, holding and selling costs were largely durable operational improvements, clearly some portion of the holding costs and a smaller portion of the renovation costs likely benefited from the strong housing market. But we also see opportunities for continued operational improvements over time. Mortgages segment revenue increased 68% year-over-year in Q2, a $57 million and Mortgages segment EBITDA was a loss of $6 million compared to the midpoint of our outlook range of a loss of $7 million. We made significant progress in our integrated origination platform during the quarter with Zillow Offers contributing approximately 40% of purchase originations, helping to drive 100% sequential purchase growth in Q1 and 90% purchase growth year-over-year. With the increased purchase originations and the slowdown in refinance activity, purchase origination is now comprised 26% of the total loan origination volume, up from 10% in Q1. The purchase mix will bounce around from quarter-to-quarter based on the refinance market, but we are focused on growing our purchase origination platform. This is just one more example of how our services are becoming more integrated and complimentary to one another, following our success in launching Zillow Closing Services. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, on a consolidated level, we expect revenue to be $2 billion at the midpoint of our outlook and EBITDA to be between $94 million and $126 million. In our IMT segment, we expect 15% year-over-year revenue growth and 43% growth over 2019 in Q3 at the midpoint of our outlook range. Within the IMT segment, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be between $352 million to $360 million, up 19% year-over-year and up 48% over Q3 2019 at the midpoint of our outlook. The progress we have made and growing and improving our higher intent connections is allowing us to maintain our PA growth rate on a two-year stock basis, despite the impact of continuing low inventory in the housing market. We expect Q3 IMT EBITDA margin to be 37% at the midpoint of our outlook, down sequentially from 46% in Q2. As we discussed last quarter, we plan to accelerate investments in marketing, staffing and technology in Q3 to drive our 2.0 vision. This includes things like touring, underlying integration products, such as Zillow 360, expanding 3D photos and floor plans along with better integration between Premier Agent and Zillow Home Loans. We expect these investment levels to be consistent in Q3 and Q4 when modeling it is also good to keep in mind the seasonality of typically lower Q4 revenue.  Thinking about full year 2021, it's important to remember that IMT EBITDA exceeded our expectations for the first two quarters of the year. We expect the incremental outperformance in the first half to flow through resulting an IMT EBITDA dollar growth outpacing revenue growth for the full year. In Q3, we expect our Home segment revenue to increase sequentially from Q2 to $1.45 billion at the midpoint of our outlook range. This step up in pace demonstrates our confidence in our ability to scale resulting from the progress we have made in strengthening our pricing models and automating the top of the funnel. Evidence of our accelerated pace can be seen in our homes under contract, which was $1.2 billion at the end of Q2, up 126% from $511 million at the end of Q1. I will reiterate that our goal here is to become a true market maker. As we think about unit economics on a go-forward basis, we would expect to see a unit economics trend towards our stated goal of plus or minus 200 basis points before interest expense over the course of the second half of the year. Please also note that this quarter we provided a wider forecast range for our Home segment, which incorporates a range and resell velocity that we think is appropriate, given we are finding market pricing levels and approaching the slower seasonal period of the year. We expect Mortgages segment revenue to be between $55 million to $62 million in Q3, which is roughly flat from Q2. Our Q3 outlook reflects slower industry refinance activity, consistent gain on sales spreads and continued growth in purchase originations. As a result of flat revenue and continued investments to grow mortgage originations, we expect Mortgages segment EBITDA to be between a loss of $13 million and $6 million. We ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash and investments, which puts us in a strong position to fund our vision for Zillow and make strategic long-term investments both organically and inorganically. As a reminder, we have a $500 million commitment to acquire ShowingTime, as we continue to cooperate with federal regulators to work diligently towards closing the pending acquisition. Earlier this week, at Zillow Offers subsidiary launched in price it's securitized debt offering, which is expected to close on around August 11. The company anticipates gross proceeds of approximately $450 million from the offering. The securities will have a 30-month term and a 24-month reinvestment period in a weighted average interest rate of 2.43%, which is lower than the rate on our existing credit facilities. Similar to our existing debt financing, this is a non-recourse to Zillow group subject to limited exceptions. Proceeds of the offering will be used to finance the growth of Zillow Offers business. The securities weren't registered and not being on this call should be interpreted as an offer of the securities. As we look forward to the balance of the year, my priorities are focused on building processes and mechanisms to support rapid scaling of Zillow 2.0 products and services, prioritizing investments in sustainable gross profit growth opportunities across the company, improving our cost structure by increasing productivity and transaction services through operational discipline. And with that operator, we'll open the line for questions Yes. Brett, thanks for the question. Well, I'll start just to reiterate that what we said before, we believe the margins that we saw in the second half of 2020 and continuing into the first half of 2021 for IMT are indicative of the inherent underlying margins of steady state business. But we're still very early in our journey and we see opportunities to invest into growth. We participate only in a small percentage of transactions relative to our audience and the industry. Our Q3 outlook implies 37% EBITDA margins at the midpoint, which is down 875 basis points sequentially. We expect our Q4 investment levels to be consistent with Q3 factoring in that Q4 revenues do experience historically a little weaker seasonality as compared to Q3, but fairly consistent in the Q4. I'd note that the 37% margins are still up significantly over 2019 full year levels, which are 23.8%, and up from our three to five-year objectives at 30%. So while we're increasing our investment levels in the second half of 2021, we continue to generate leverage across the segment as we've made progress even during the pandemic. In terms of areas of investment or where we're thinking of investing, I called out some tangible examples in my prepared remarks. The priorities we have is to drive better customer experience, broader integrated product offerings, and continued scalability through operational rigor and automation across the businesses. It gets back to Rich's point that the consumer is going to demand an e-commerce solution for the industry and we're well positioned to serve that. We do expect these investments deliver strong ROI via gross profit growth, and we believe it's prudent given our focus on the customer and driving transactions to make these investments. It's the right thing to do to continue to invest here. Yes. So maybe I'll start Rich and you could follow on. Thanks for the question, Brian. First, I'll say I have been really impressed by our PA team's execution, while the macro over the last 12 months has provided some tailwinds. This really is I think a story of execution in terms of our performance. We're continuing to grow the quantity and quality of the connections. We've said that a few times. So, our Q3 guide implies PA revenue growth of 19% year-over-year at the midpoint, but 48% growth over the two year stack compared to Q3 2019. We've have demonstrated our ability to improve and grow our higher intent connections by enhancing how our customers shop at Zillow with a particular focus on touring. We believe this is the next opportunity, and it's part of our endless quest to improve the integrity of our funnel and improve customer experience for our consumer customers, looking to move and buy a house. When a customer raises their hand to work with one of our partner agents, we are constantly finding how quickly we introduced him to that customer that customer to our agent. And that makes all the difference in such a competitive buying environment. So again, what I'd say is, a lot of the factors that we look to that are driving growth are our ability to take our customers that are in the funnel based on the actions they take, take the high intent customers, provide them with a great performing agent, quickly to help them get to the home that they want to buy. And again, we're continuing to introduce our customers to higher performing agents as well as we go through our agent base, who share the same goal was us, which is helping our mutual customer buy their next home. So lastly, we continue to see opportunities to invest in innovation and technology. We're investing, because we think there's a really good return here and a big opportunity, while we have a large audience with still a very small percentage of the transaction share. Rich, I don't know if you would add anything. Yes. I can start Rich. So I think if you look at the improvement, I called out in my remarks, the 312 basis points that we've seen versus this time last year Q2 of 2020 in acquisition costs, that's going to be the area where we see most of the decline as we move back into our guardrails. We'll likely see if sales velocity, resell velocity goes down a little, we'll likely see a slight uptick in holding costs. But the big change is just going to be this. Right now, we've got a 13% spread between what we sell the house for and what we acquired it for. And again, as a market maker, that spread is being impacted by HPA. And we expect that to go down over time and be more temporal. I can. Yes. So I guess, I would describe it one, thanks for the question is we've provided a kind of long at scale type profitability. We think we can get on a return on home sold before interest of around 400 to 500 basis points. But again, given the penetration, the low penetration numbers of iBuying right now, and the opportunity to scale the guardrails that we've set are the plus or minus 200 basis points. We don't think about it, I guess, in individual components of fee versus value. We kind of look at it, what's the overall transaction cost to the customer to incent them and that we can still turn into a profitable business. So I think the fee is likely to continue to vacillate and change as we test pricing and elasticity. What we're focused on is trying to get the most accurate pricing to be fair to the customer and to continue to reduce our cost structure with the benefits of scale automation and productivity. So I guess to answer your question, we still believe on a standalone basis the 400 to 500 basis points at scale is likely a number that we would see as a market maker. But it'll come in a lot of different forms. And then as Rich mentioned, what will also be there is as we have our customers come through various funnels on Zillow their ability or their willingness as we introduce multiple services to them to take those multiple services allows us to provide even sharper pricing across those services, because we're not having to go out and use CAC to acquire each customer for each service. Rich or Brad, would you add anything?"

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Zillow Group First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Berning, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nBrad Berning: Thank you, Riley. Good afternoon, and welcome to Zillow Group's first quarter 2021 conference call. Joining me today to discuss our Q1 results are Zillow Group's Co-Founder and CEO, Rich Barton; and CFO, Allen Parker. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements about our future performance and operating plans based on our current expectations and assumptions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and we encourage you to consider the risk factors described in our SEC filings for additional information. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events, except as required by law. This call is being broadcast on the Internet and is accessible on our Investor Relations website. A recording of the call will be available later today. During the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, which we refer to as EBITDA. We encourage you to read our shareholder letter and our earnings release, which can be found on our Investor Relations website, as they contain important information about our GAAP and non-GAAP results, including reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, please note, we will refer to our Internet, Media & Technology segment as our IMT segment. We will now open the call with brief remarks followed by live Q&A. And with that, I'll turn over the call to Rich.\nRich Barton: Thank you, Brad. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining our first quarter 2021 earnings call. We are in a much better place compared to one long year ago. And I'm so grateful and impressed these miraculous COVID vaccines are now widely available across the country. I hope that you and yours are beginning to find some normalcy after such a trying year. In a typical year, spring begins the traditional home buying season. But we know that this past year was anything but typical. Home buying never really slowed down. A great reshuffling driven by changes in what we want and need out of our homes have fueled continued interest in moving. And we expect this movie demand to continue as we all adjust to a safer world ahead. Our research team recently published a survey based mover report, which we have hyperlink to from the shareholder letter. It's a great read when you have the time. The report indicates that the pandemic has indeed caused people to rethink where they live, and concludes that approximately 8 million existing homeowner households that have been on the sidelines may enter a real estate market already be set by unrelenting demand. Additionally, 8.9% of consumers plan to purchase a home in the next six months near a 20 year high per the conference board's April consumer confidence survey. The reaction we got from our own employee base when we told them last March that we intended to have a more flexible workplace policy for the long-term is an interesting case study in how remote work catalyzes the great reshuffling. We found 30% more employees moved in the year following our announcement compared to the previous pre-pandemic year. This time last year, we had employees in 25 states. Now they are in all 50. This is obviously a small sample, but it shows how the great reshuffling might play out as people get certainty about their companies post COVID workplace plans. Zillow was an early embracer of a more flexible long-term workplace model. So we are a few steps ahead in firming up our plans. But we expect that other companies will adopt more physical location flexibility in varying degrees, simply because it's hard to take back something that employees have been given and value. That cultural shift will free up more restless households to list to move and Zillow will be here to serve as their trusted partner and resource. Beyond the continued reassessment of where we all are had denied the housing market is underpinned by demographic and economic tailwind that will persist for the foreseeable future. Millennials are moving up. Baby Boomers are downsizing and in between people of all generations are rethinking their lives. Despite recent shocks, mortgage rates are expected to be quite constructive for the foreseeable future and are near all time lows versus historical levels. It appears that housing turnover should accelerate from the historically low rates in the past several years along with an easier digital transaction all of these trends point to more liquidity and household formation long-term, which creates a healthy backdrop for the housing market and the business in which we operate. Of course, the most powerful and important shift driving our business is the title shift moving consumers real estate, dreaming, searching and transacting from offline to online. Just as they have in many other parts of their lives, consumers have experienced the greater convenience of a digital technology enabled home search and some the magic of a digital transaction. They will only expect further advancements in the future. Moving on now, to some business results from another strong quarter here at Zillow cloud HQ. First and foremost, all of this energy around moving has created a Zillow wave of sorts. And our customers are surfing it every day. Just last week, Time named Zillow, one of the 100 most influential companies for in their words, \u201cMaking an extraordinary impact on the world.\u201d A little grand perhaps, but definitely a nod to the vast reserve of brand goodness that we have been building up over 15 years. An up tick in pop culture recognition this past year has helped to accelerate our traffic. In Q1, 221 million average monthly unique visitors -- users visited our sites and apps, which represents an increase of nearly 30 million average monthly unique users versus this time last year. This is a level that we previously would not have thought possible and should provide the fuel for years of customer growth into the future. Our top of funnel engagement with our customers translated into excellent results across Zillow's suite of products and services. Our flagship buy-side business, Zillow Premier Agent once again generated the strongest results we've ever seen reporting 38% revenue growth year-over-year in Q1. Our nascent sell-side business Zillow Offers continued to accelerate out of the pause we instituted in the pandemic generating over 700 million in revenue and surpassing our internal expectations on revenue, EBITDA and unit level economics. The success from our buy-side and sell-side offerings when combined with solid execution from our adjacent services and sporting businesses, translated into total revenue growth of 54% sequentially and total company EBITDA of $181 million for the quarter. With that number in context of Zillow's history, it represents 90% of our full year 2018 EBITDA, which was just prior to the commencement of our heavy investment in our Zillow 2.0 vision. We are now beginning to register the benefits of the investments we have made across our product innovations for buyers and renters, as well as our major ventures into Zillow Offers, Zillow Home Loans and Zillow Closing Services. This increased profit generation after such a meaningful investment period gives us confidence that the bets we are making across the business are accretive and we are allocating our time, our people and our capital appropriately for the long-term. Speaking of our people, Fortune named Zillow, one of its 100 Best Companies to Work for based on our own employees\u2019 feedback about working at Zillow in 2020, including how trustworthy caring and fair they felt Zillow has been during the pandemic, which forced most into Zoom line. As we reimagined the future of our workplace, we are grateful for our flexible and talented workforce. While our employees are doing well and our quarterly results are strong, we are oriented to the multi-decade journey in front of us, the journey to digitize and simplifies a huge industry, delivering more and more movers gracefully to their next homes. Pursuit of these growth opportunities deserves continued appropriate reinvestment of profits. As part of that journey, we recently launched a new advertising campaign with the tagline to \u201cMove is to grow.\u201d We think it wonderfully captures the essence of why moving is both exciting and daunting and how we at Zillow are increasingly able to help our customers navigate this crossing. The campaign supports the expedition we are on as a company as well. Just as we've been reorienting our employees and mission around transactions, we have the exciting task of re educating our customers on who the new Zillow is and what we can do for them. Every signal we see based on data and customer feedback is that customers expect and demand a more seamless experience. This is Zillow 2.0. A great example of our customers enthusiasm for ease is the reaction to our recent announcement that many homeowners in Zillow Offers markets now can see that there's estimate is a live initial offer from Zillow. The announcement price alone drove record breaking interest in the service with requests coming in at levels we've never seen before. We believe we are onto something with this zestimate offer. The continuing challenge and opportunity going forward will be to translate customer interest into transactions. Now that we have many of the ingredients for our end-to-end home transaction to Zillow services and products, we are upgrading our giant leaky customer funnel in converting more browsers into customers. We are motivated every day to ensure we deliver our customers excellent integrated experiences on par with simpler smaller ecommerce transactions in other parts of their lives. To reiterate, it is still early days in these efforts and there's so much work to be done as we begin to scale. Across Zillow, we estimate that our 2020 gross profit was larger than any other player in the residential real estate technology category. But our buy-side Premier Agent business and sell-side Zillow Offers businesses still represent less than 2% of the total annual residential real estate industry service fees. We are proud of our business but we have an ocean of opportunity in front of us. Each customer who uses Zillow to move has a story. One we're sharing today is about first time home sellers Jessica LaRue-Briscoe and her husband Sean. They turned to Zillow when they were anxious about a move from Colorado to Texas, where they wanted their two-year-old son to grow up near their families. Zillow connected Jessica to an agent partner Adam Unger and he walked her through the selling process. It was all new to her and she was scared and dubious. I'm going to take a gamble on you she told him. Adam's experience and professionalism kept their worries at bay and Jessica and Sean felt informed and prepared throughout their move. I really feel like we were able to be connected with the best real estate agent for us because we went through Zillow, Jessica said. Their happy ending to their stories that their son is now spending time in Texas with Jessica's grandparents who are in their 90s. We are motivated every day like customer and partner success stories like Jessica, Sean and Adam's, like our ad campaign says to \u201cMove is to grow.\u201d And we're seeing that here at Zillow with our employees, our customers and with our industry partners. As far our investor partners, we appreciate the support as we go on this journey with you. With that, I'll turn it over to Allen.\nAllen Parker: Thank you, Rich. As Rich discussed Zillow Group delivered another strong quarter reporting Q1 consolidated revenue of 1.2 billion in EBITDA of 181 million, both exceeding the high end of our outlook range. Q1 IMT segment revenue of 446 million grew 35% year-over-year, as we continue to see accelerated growth in Premiere Agent and strong growth in rentals. IMT segment EBITDA was 209 million in Q1 or 47% of IMT segment revenue. Accelerating revenue growth, combined with year-over-year declines in operating costs, translated into 143% year-over-year EBITDA growth in Q1. Premiere Agent revenue grew 38% year-over-year in Q1, the accelerated growth was primarily driven from connections growing faster than traffic, as well as our focus on providing outstanding service and optimizing to connect high intent customers with high performing partner agents. Growth in Zillow Offers continued to reaccelerate in Q1. We reported home segment revenue of 704 million, which exceeded the high-end of our outlook with 1,965 home sales. Resale velocity was above our expectations. In Q1, we sold 128% of the beginning inventory of 1,531 homes was contributed to inventory decline at the end of Q1 to 1,422 homes. Purchases increased to 1,856 homes in the quarter from 1,789 homes purchased in Q4. But not quite at the pace we planned as we continued to work on refining our models to catch up with the rapid acceleration in home price appreciation. During Q1, we continued to focus on unit costs, automation, adding capacity, and sharpening pricing models to improve offer strength as we continue to scale. Our Q1 Zillow offers unit economics of 549 basis points return before interest expense was above the plus or minus 200 basis point guard rails we've set for ourselves while working to scale the business. The outsides economic results were impacted by the ongoing strong housing market, which is temporal in nature. We made progress during the quarter on improving offer strength and sharpen pricing that tightened our unit economics by approximately 120 basis points from that of Q4. The durable operational improvements in overall cost per home contributed 280 basis points improvement from Q1 2020. Our mortgages segment revenue increased 169% year-over-year in Q1 to 68 million and mortgages segment EBITDA was 6 million compared to the midpoint of our outlook range for a loss of 1 million. The revenue and EBITDA outperformance was primarily driven by mortgage loan origination volume, which was up more than 8x year-over-year, as well as our mortgage marketplace, both as a result of strong refinance activity. Beginning this quarter and going forward, we will disclose our mortgage loan origination purchase and refinance volume. In Q1 refinance loan origination volume comprised 90% of total origination volume. We continued to invest in our mortgage platform to provide a compelling experience for our purchase customers, as well as integrating across our business. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. At a consolidated level, we expect revenue to be 1.26 billion up 64% year-over-year at the midpoint of our outlook. And EBITDA to be between 116 million and 140 million. In our IMT segment, we are forecasting 66% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 and 44% revenue growth over Q2 2019 at the midpoint of our outlook range. Within the IMT segment, we expect from Premier Agent revenue to be between 342 million to 350 million up 80% year-over-year and up 49% over Q2 2019 at the midpoint of our outlook. This is being driven by strong top of funnel traffic and connections as we enter Q2. It is important to know that during Q2 last year, we provided Better Together billing relief to our Premiere Agent and other marketplace partners. Excluding the impact of this billing relief, we expect Q2 year-over-year Premier Agent revenue growth to be 38% and IMT segment revenue growth to be 35% at the midpoint of the respective outlook ranges. We expect Q2 IMT EBITDA margin could be 41% at the midpoint of our outlook down sequentially from 47% in Q1. As we position ourselves to drive sustainable, profitable long-term growth, we expect Q2 IMT EBITDA margin to reflect accelerated investments in marketing, staffing and technology up from Q1 levels and we expect to further accelerate investments into Q3. For full year 2021, we expect EBITDA dollar growth more in line with revenue growth rates rather than expansion from the 38% EBITDA margin we reported in 2020. In Q2, we expect our home segment revenue to increase sequentially to 735 million at the midpoint of our outlook. The higher than expected Q1 resale velocity I mentioned previously pulled forward a portion of expected Q2 home sales. Customer interest in selling their homes to Zillow and the operational improvements we have continued to make have shown strong improvement in top of funnel as we enter Q2, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to scale the business in the periods ahead. We expect mortgage segment revenue to be between 57 million to 62 million in Q2, which is down from Q1. Our Q2 guide reflects slower industry refinance activity and narrow gain on sale spreads. As we have discussed for the past couple of quarters, we do not expect the [indiscernible] high gain on sale margins from originations to be sustainable. We plan to continue to capture solid refinance demand and invest in building the factory to scale our operations, as the purchase business is built over time. As a result, we expect mortgages segment EBITDA to be between a loss of 9 million and a loss of 5 million. We further strengthened our balance sheet during the quarter by initiating and at the market offering or ATM, selling 551 million of capital stock. We have been and will continue to be opportunistic and prudent in any potential future share sales and have approximately 450 million remaining on the authorization. We ended the quarter with 4.7 billion in cash and investments, which puts us in a strong position to fund our vision for Zillow and make strategic long-term investments both organically and inorganically. As a reminder, we do have a $500 million commitment to acquire showing time as we cooperate with federal regulators to work diligently toward closing the acquisition. As we look forward to the balance of the year, our priorities remain focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners. We look to grow our customer base and engagement through a compelling dream and shop experience. Invest in sustainable top-line growth opportunities across the company, reduce cost structure and improve productivity and transaction services, drive profit growth through operational discipline. And with that operator, we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Ron Josey with JMP Securities.\nRon Josey: I wanted to ask clearly so much going on. I wanted to maybe zero in on Zillow Offers here first. I mean, significant demand in the quarter sales pulled forward. Allen you talked about that, Zestimate driving even more demand, maybe with supply seems being a little bit harder here and you're sharpening pricing to offset that. Rich, can you just talk about the broader market for offers in a stronger real estate market? Just how do you acquire the inventory relative demand? How do you balance those two things together? Thank you.\nRich Barton: Hey, Ron, thanks. I mean, we are rapidly learning how ZO lives in this, really this unprecedented home price appreciation environment. The appreciation over the last six months is the largest move up or down that we observe in the data set over the last 35 years, right. So it's a very fluid market. But as you noted in your question and Allen talked about in his script, our top of funnel indicators are good. Like, it turns out, speed, certainty and convenience are attractive to sellers no matter what kind of market they are in. So we are seeing record levels of folks raising their hand to get a Zillow offer. I think part of that is driven by this really nifty feature we launched last quarter that we internally called Zestimate offers which is this, live initial -- having the Zestimate via a live initial offer for lots of the homes inside of the buy box in Zillow Offers markets. So anyway, we're also really happy with this kind of glow that we're seeing across the business from this positive reinforcement we have from having all of these linked businesses and having this very large, single funnel of customer demand coming in. And the IMT and adjacent business numbers are really, really commendable. But on ZO in particular Ron, we're leaning in like -- we're leaning in, we're expanding in the 25 markets. We're heavily staffing as I think we made an announcement maybe Allen just talked about it too. We are we are planning as a company hiring a net 2000 people in 2021. And a lot of that will be for Zillow Offers and we're making other investments in ZO as well. So we are comfortable with that increased investment because of what we're seeing top of funnel because what we know about the consumer value proposition. And also, we're leaning in because most consumers don't even know what Zillow Offers is yet. They don't even know, we've got to take Zillow 2.0 out of the kind of quarterly conference call realm and into the consumer awareness realm. And so we got a lot of work to do there and basis points penetrated in the business overall. So long answer, but we're feeling we're leaning in and feeling good.\nAllen Parker: Hey, Ron and Rich, I will just add. Just to give a little color to the guidance for Q2 with respect to home segment revenue. We've called out the resale velocity pulling some sales in the Q1. And I just want to call it even with strong top of funnel activity, there is a lag as we go through between offer, purchase and an eventual sale and when we see the revenue and so a lot of this top of funnel activity will start to show up more in Q3 and that's part of the reason for the Q2 guide that's reflected -- that lag is reflected in the Q2 guide.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Naved Khan with Truist Securities.\nNaved Khan: There is couple of questions. So maybe just one Zillow 2.0, how do we measure the progress that you're making on the initiative and how do you think about the long-term profitability potential in the 2.0. And then, just maybe on hiring? What are the areas that are seeing the biggest increase in headcount?\nRich Barton: Okay. Hey, Naved. The 2.0 bet is all about the fact that we believe customers want speed, simplicity, integration, value, like these are not risky bets to make on consumer behavior, okay. They're kind of timeless features of what customers demand. And we also believe that our brand and our traffic give us a competitive advantage, relative to point solution competitors, because we have a large audience, we can spread any customer acquisition costs we may have for those customers over a much larger revenue, profit and transaction base. So that's kind of the Business School answer to why we like the competitive advantage. So that's why we've made the bet. So we've made these big bets over the last two and a half years when we really leaned into 2.0. And building out all the 2.0 components, like Zillow Offers, mortgages, Zillow closing services, even rentals. Anyway, the short answer to your question is, it's working. All the children appear to be above average. I don't know if we're getting any chuckles out there to the Garrison Keillor reference, but all the businesses are performing really well beyond our expectations. So that's a terrific proof point that the integrated strategy and the transaction strategy is working our revenue and profit on a per user basis and steadily rising, which is really nice to see and it's still quite low. So we have a ways to go. I said in my script, to kind of introduce a new kind of TAM and penetration concept. This less than 2% gross profit penetration into the total addressable market of services in the industry. We keep struggling for ways to talk about the full opportunity in quarters past we talked about trying to estimate transaction share, and what share of transactions we touched, that is fraught, because we don't exactly know how many transactions we touched, or were, I challenged the team to try to figure out if there's maybe a gross profit penetration metric, we can come out to communicate the opportunity for ourselves and for you all. So that could be interesting. Anyway, there's still a ton of work to do on 2.0 not the least of which as I said before, is awareness of 2.0. That's where you're seeing marketing investment, increased marketing investment from us anyway. Stay tuned, we're on the path, we like the path, things look clear and lots of green lights out the front windshield.\nNaved Khan: Thank you, Rich. And maybe on the headcount and give us some more clarity on the areas where these are\u2026\nRich Barton: Maybe Allen, if you want to answer that?\nAllen Parker: Yes. I mean, I guess what I would just say is, I would classify, we're continuing to make investments across a variety of our businesses where we feel like there's a lot of opportunity to accelerate innovation for our customer, shop and dream, buy with, sell with. And so there's quite a bit of tech and dev, but there's also transactional type resources that are necessary as we scale the business. And so I think you're seeing kind of a mix of those, there are some additional innovative ideas around 3D tours and other things. So, most of the initiatives we talk about, we are looking at where we need the resource and to accelerate our investment. But it's spread across the company. And, I'll just take this moment to say we continue to prioritize, our existing resources as well, to make sure we're making bets on the right thing. But we like the results we're seeing, we like the inputs that we're tracking and look forward to execution.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Two questions. First, you're recognizing better growth in the second quarter guide on that kind of normalized basis excluding the better together discounts? Can you just talk about the sustainability of the PA business, particularly into the second half as comms get harder? What are some of the drivers behind the outlook for 2Q and that can help in the second half? And then, secondly, you've put up the 47% segment margin in IMT guidance implies first margins about 44%. So if full year margins are going to be kind of flashed with last year, it implies a big step up in the second half, can you give us a better sense of what you're investing in? How it's going to flow across the segments? And then, what specifically will we be weighing on IMT segment margins in the second half, given disciplined on cost growth there for multiple years now? Thanks for your help there.\nRich Barton: Thanks Lloyd . That sounds like an Allen question.\nAllen Parker: Sure. Thanks, Lloyd. So on growth, yes, in Q1 Premier Agent growth of 38% year-over-year, if you compare it to the underlying growth rates we talked about in Q4 was 27%. And in Q4 2020 was 27% and in Q3 of 2020, was 20%. So we've seen this accelerating underlying growth trend in Premiere Agent. If you look in our Q2 outlook, the underlying growth rate of 38%, at the midpoint, after you adjust for the better together discounts, is a continuation of the inputs that we're seeing. We have a large audience, strong top of the funnel. And when you combine that with a focus on some of the inputs of customer satisfaction and conversion and revenue per lead, we're just seeing very encouraging trends on the inputs. And I think it's all predicated by this focus on helping the customer get through the transaction. In terms of the second half, we are not providing guidance, but what I would call out is that the Premier Agent Q2, two year growth rate of 49%, we pulled out in the shareholder letter, at the midpoint of our range is probably a good way to think about growth, as you look at your models on how to model forward through this weird year that we had in 2020. So hopefully, that helps. With respect to margin, our Q2 IMT margin, we expect to be 41% at the midpoint of our outlook that is down sequentially from the 47% in Q1. As we position ourselves to drive sustainable, profitable long-term growth, we do expect this margin rate to reflect accelerated investments in marketing and staffing and technology to provide innovation on behalf of the customer. And so we do expect that to increase from Q1 levels and we expect further acceleration in Q3. When I think about full year, given your question, what I'd say is, we do expect either dollar growth, but that growth more in line with revenue growth rates, rather than expansion off the 38% margin rate we put it in 2020. So hopefully that helps.\nLloyd Walmsley: Yes. No, that's great. And just to clarify, when you say kind of a two year growth kind of consistent is a good way to think about it. Is that excluding the better together? Or is that just on headline basis?\nAllen Parker: That's on a headline basis. It's the 49%, if you just take Q2 2019 for instance, Q2 2021 midpoint, that's 49% growth. And we think that's a good way to pin your models.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan McKeveny with Zelman & Associates.\nRyan McKeveny: Thank you. Congrats on the results and great to see the momentum continuing. So the first question, I apologize if I've missed this, but can you share an update on the transition to using in-house agents or employees on the high buyer transactions? Maybe what share transactions in the quarter were working in-house? And how that transition is going versus your expectations? And second question on the mortgage business, so the stat on the 90% share of refi is very interesting thing, it seems to be a bit of a kind of early confirmation signal that the overall Zillow business is moving from something that was once servicing and monetizing buyers, to then sellers and now homeowners that might want to refi. So I guess I'm curious on the mortgage space. Can you talk about the strategy and maybe that interplay between driving the actual attachment on the high buyer purchase product and driving mortgage value more generally because I know, there can, of course, be a lot of differences in just strategy to the approach of kind of purchase versus refi share over time. So hoping you can maybe separate those pieces and talk a bit about strategy. Thanks so much.\nAllen Parker: All right. I'll start and Rich or Brad jump in. But on Zillow brokerage services, we're operating in just a few of the 25 markets. So that's still relatively nascent, it's going well. We're excited about initial results. But there's nothing with respect to attach or any kind of data point yet. Over time, we do believe that's a great way to have a better integrated customer experience. But we still work with partners across all our markets. And we're learning the services that we can provide, but it's still relatively new. And then, our mortgage, I guess, the way I would describe it, as you think about our mortgage strategy coming together. When we purchased mortgage lenders of America way back in 2018, they were really a direct consumer non-conforming origination shop. Our initial strategy was to move to a broader mix of conforming mortgages, while updating and transforming the platform and bringing in new leadership. In 2020, we started to share, our focus on building the factory to bringing in the loan officers and loan processors and building the systems. And we did that off of the strong refinance demand. And we continue to do that in the Q1. I think over time, you'll see that mix normalize more to industry standards. But we want to have a compelling and great customer experience and we're continuing to work with customers and learn. And I think over time, we expect to provide all more good services that a customer may want, whether it be refi our customer, both those that are doing other services within Zillow, as well as refi customers who come looking for refi. So we're very excited about what the team has done and where we are. And we think that mortgage is a very important part of the Zillow 2.0 and we're continuing to expand there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ygal Arounian with Wedbush Securities.\nYgal Arounian: So just one question on Zillow Offers and one on Premier Agent. So let's go back to Allen's comment, hope I'm not miss quoting it, highlighted purchases were not at the pace that you were expecting kind of over the course of the quarter and do work to kind of catch up with HPA and really strong environment, can you expand on that and what you're doing to catch up [indiscernible] for that and fix the model or just the model to what we're seeing, especially in light of some data that we've seen from your competitors continuing to accelerate some of their purchases there. And then, on PA, you highlighted improvements in PA connections and that's what I was hoping, you could talk about that a little bit. And then, listings are still challenged overall. Can you talk about the impact that has the PA business down significantly year-over-year? Does that have a meaningful impact? Thanks.\nRich Barton: You want to start with the ZO stuff, Allen?\nAllen Parker: Sure. Yes. So, yes, I mean, I think Rich, hit it pretty well. What I'd say is, if you look at our unit economics and as I mentioned 549 basis points of return on home sold before interest expense, being above our plus or minus 200 basis point guardrails, the driver that's there that has improved from Q4 is home acquisition cost as a percent of the sale. So it's at 87% of homes revenue versus 85.9 in Q4, but still higher than, we would expect and that's reflective of this resale velocity and our selling of homes at rates higher than we would have expected or underwrote to, when we acquired them. And so, this expansion that we're catching up with, there's also a lot of nuance just in the offers and how we present them. That we're also iterating. So I guess what I would describe is, we are continually figuring out how to improve our offer strength in the way we communicate that to our customers, the top of funnel and the interest is strong. We're seeing early trends in Q2 that give us confidence that this is something that we are going to be able to do. The guide that I provided in Q2 is reflective of the lag as we purchased those homes, renovate them and then we sell them, as well as the Q1, kind of overperformance. But we're very confident that we have a compelling offer that high-buying is something customers want even in this market. And the early signs give us confidence that we can continue to grow and scale this business. So hopefully that helps.\nRich Barton: Before I -- let me editorialize on that just a little bit that the risk of keeping this issue open. Allen, the unit economics, the margins that we're earning on a unit basis right now are, not what our goal is? I'll just reiterate that. We want this and know this can be a giant business. And it's only going to be a giant business when the pricing is perceived to be fair to consumers. So it's not our goal, to have 549 basis points or whatever it is we just printed on a unit basis. No, it's slightly better than last quarter. In other words, it's lower. But what we're aiming to do is to provide a fair offer and charge a fair fee to our customers. And thus we believe we maximize the TAM, we maximize the number of transactions we can touch and participate in. And we have the ability to sell a bunch of adjacent services around those transactions. So it's worth pausing there for a sec. All right. On the listings, question, yes, listings are really, really skinny, inventories really, really low. I think I said this last quarter, it's kind of like the flight attendant on the airplane when she says even though the airbag does not appear to inflate the oxygen will flow. That is what's happening clearly in the market, volumes are up, price appreciation is way up to but homes are just moving really, really fast. And so, we like to see a market where lots of activity is happening. We see offline to online shifts happening. We see demographic shifts happening. We see great reshuffling things happening, all to put wind in the sails of our pa business and our business indeed overall.\nYgal Arounian: Thanks guys. I think just a real quick follow up on Zillow Offers, would it be wrong to characterize that maybe you're slowing your purchases or being more cautious on your purchases based on what's going on with HPA?\nRich Barton: Risk is always an important component of pricing, of course and forecast of home price appreciation is a very important part of pricing as well. And needless to say, we're in a really -- just in a really fluid environment on that and we're learning really quickly so.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Campbell with Stephens Inc.\nJohn Campbell: Congrats on the continued success. You guys have a couple of positive things kind of spinning up across the product set, obviously, but it feels like rentals just seems to kind of fly under the radar. You guys put up some good growth this quarter, last couple quarters of good growth. Just curious about the drivers there and how much lift you seen from kind of a shift in the monetizing of the rentals. And then, maybe also the broader opportunity ahead for Zillow rental manager?\nAllen Parker: 46% year-over-year growth rate is fantastic. We're really pleased with our rentals business. It comes from and it's driven by a lot of the decisions we've made to invest in a fairly good streamline set of product innovations. And I think we're starting to see the benefit of some of those over the last few years that we've made. A lot of those are integrated services like one click applications, payments, listings and these services are all kind of coming together. In fact, as we talked about, Zillow, 2.0, getting closer to the transactions, I believe we're seeing that in the rental space. It's also assisted though by this continued strength in top of funnel and our large audience. And even some of the demographics we talked about on the housing market, the broader, the great reshuffling and these demographic trail wins are also helping our rentals business. So we're excited with the progress. The growth has been strong. And we're excited about the products and services that we're able to deliver both to our customers and to our property managers. I don't know, Rich, if you want to add anything.\nRich Barton: No, that was completely great. Thanks, Allen.\nJohn Campbell: And then, one more follow up and appreciate the color, that's very helpful. On the IDX shift for you guys, Allen, I don't know if you've ever framed this up, because maybe help us understand kind of the offset on operating costs from the shift.\nAllen Parker: Yes. I guess what I'd say is, we're now taking feeds as we're MLS, there's some puts and takes across that there's I would say that we continue to invest to make that a great experience. And there is some costs that come with that. Whereas there's also some costs that are reduced from some of the other data acquisition costs that we may have had in the future. But it's not a big enough call, I think where we've disclosed one way or the other, what the savings are, what we really think it's a great customer experience. And it's just really consistent with our ability to have great information on the site and to provide a great experience to our customers. So that's the real win, I think on the IDX side.\nBrad Berning: Allen, I'll just jump in real quick and add, it was really Q3 of last year when we saw the largest net benefit. There's been other tangible benefits but there's been a clause to invest in the platform since then. So it's been in the expense restructure for a couple quarters already.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: Two questions. Just talk through the EBITDA margins in the mortgages segment. And I'm sorry, if you touched on this before, seemed like they picked on a little bit, not assuming anything material, but just talk through that. And then, getting back to the unit economics on the homes business, so it sounds like that you want to run this business with those, I forget what you call them, the rail guards, whatever it is, plus 200 minus 200. And the strategy, Rich, I think is you extract economics from this, then to take those economics and bring them down to the guardrail. So that long-term, you can bring down commissions. And so you can expand TAMs and just feed this beast. So that's my understanding of the flywheel. Now there are scale advantages as you do more and more of this, where did the scale advantages most show up in terms of bringing those costs down as a percentage of revenue? And maybe that's really the question I'm asking here is, as you get more and more experience and more and more scale in homes business, where are you seeing and where you think the most leverage is going to come from in the expense line items that's going to allow you to get past more of those savings back to the consumer and feed that flywheel.\nRich Barton: Hey, Mark, nice to see a brand new analyst from Evercore here on the call with us today. Congrats on the new job. I think Allen maybe start with the ZO margin question and then we can both tackle the \u2013\nAllen Parker: Yes. I do mortgage, I'll start ZO and you can jump on. So Mark, thanks for the question. On mortgage, EBITDA margin what we see and what's reflected in the guide is that a significant portion of the revenue downtick in our guide compared to Q1 is related to the gain on sales spreads in our guidance. And so that kind of falls through we still are very excited about the platform we're building and we're continuing to build the factory. And so when you see that downtick, it has an effect, that kind of falls straight through the EBITDA versus Q1 performance. And so that's what's driving the majority of that downtick Q1 to Q2 on the mortgage margin rates. And on ZO, sorry, I think you hit it right on the head, what I'd say is, we still provided long-term targets, of 400, 500 basis points return before interest, but current period and in near term, our guidance that we provided is no -- this plus or minus 200 basis points because of the size of the opportunity and because it's important to get out there and provide a great experience as we learn. We're willing to invest in as plus or minus 200 as we learn the business. I'd say we see opportunities across all areas, we have improved 280 basis points, primarily across renovations and selling costs versus last year. You can imagine renovations, as you have more density in the area for your renovations. And as you get better and smarter about what needs to be done and what the customer is willing to pay for. Who is repurchasing the home that you'll see benefits in that area, right now is about 3% costs of revenue. Holding costs are reflected with a lot of things but there are definitely many things we can do to improve that's a relatively small cost. And then selling costs over time as we as we grow Zillow brokerage services. And as we reduce through automation and technology, some of these non-value added costs that currently happen in the world today, we expect that number to come down. And we expect acquisition costs to be to be reflective of a fair offer, as Rich mentioned, but solid cost structure. Our decision to be plus or minus 200 basis points is reflective of us reinvesting any improvements we make right now to be at this plus or minus 200, because of the size of the opportunity. And as we've mentioned several times, the fact that we're 549 is just saying that we're still working, you know, to catch up.\nRich Barton: At the scale we are right now, thank you for clarifying what I said Allen, I didn't mean to imply we didn't want to make money natively off this business. But we are subscale dramatically subscale right now in our estimation and while we are scaling it, we're targeting this plus or minus 200. So anyway, thanks. Thanks for clarifying. And you have the flywheel right. That's the flywheel that we're making. We also bet in addition to the leverage, we see on the three line items Allen was talking about, we see leverage on customer acquisition costs, because we have a much cheaper customer funnel. The zestimate offer being just like the perfect characterization of that people come look at the zestimates and if more and more customers know that zestimate is alive, initial offer for their home, we are more likely to get first crack at them. Now the challenge is making sure that people even know Zillow Offers exists and what it is and is there a trick? Is it too good to be true and education and marketing? So we're in that early phase of doing that right now Mark.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Maria Ripps with Canaccord.\nMaria Ripps: I just wanted to follow up on the PA revenue growth, seems like a lot of strength there, can you maybe comment on how flex is performing relative to your core key business in this current strong environment. And are you able to share with us any color on how you are thinking about extending flex beyond your current market. And if so, sort of what determines what markets are suitable for this revenue model. And then I have a quick follow up.\nAllen Parker: Yes. Thanks, Maria. This is Allen. What I'd say is, our revenue growth in Q1 of 38% and compared to that underlying growth statistics, I gave a 27 in Q4 of 2020 and 20% in 3Q, obviously accelerating. There aren't any significant, there are no changes in revenue accounting or revenue recognition to call out in Q1. So that is the underlying growth rate and we've talked about the guide of 38%, adjusted in Q2 at the midpoint. That is a combination of both MVP and flex programs working together as two monetization tools that we have and they're both performing well. And again, if you go to the inputs of improving CSAT, driving more and more of our customers through our connections program and delivering high intent customers to high performing agents, those are all things -- the input dials that we're driving go across both flex and our MVP model and we're seeing results. We are continuing to look at and we expect to increase the flex representation across our pool. There's not any particular market, it requires us understanding and identifying agents that are willing to grow with us. And so, there's not really any particular attribute to call out or metric to give I think our growth rate is reflected last optimizing the process, the monetization models we have available and the inputs that we're driving around the customer and customer experience to help close transactions.\nMaria Ripps: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you. And as a quick follow up on sort of adjacent services opportunity, especially around home insurance. Can you maybe just talk about how you thinking about -- potential to bring this sort of additional service to consumers within your platform. And any thoughts sort of around, though and after this opportunity on your own versus partnering with someone else in space?\nRich Barton: Hey, Maria. This is Rich. We see lots of continued logical adjacency opportunities all around the transaction. We haven't targeted or begun talking about any additional ones other than the businesses we're in right now with mortgage titled escrow, etc. But we do obviously see other large adjacencies we're just going to knock things off one at a time and evaluate each additional one as the time calls for it. Thank you very much. One more maybe, Brad.\nOperator: Our last question today will come from Tom White with D.A. Davidson.\nTom White: I'll ask just one and maybe a follow up on your comments about kind of your cost advantages in the offers business and the multiple opportunities you guys are kind of developing to sort of monetize customers that hopefully stick with you. Maybe I was just curious to hear your thoughts on like, your appetite for maybe increasing the prices of the homes that you're going after anytime soon, as a way to maybe increase your TAM.\nRich Barton: Hey, Tom. Thanks for the question. We are constantly experimenting on a market-by-market basis with the buy box and what works and what doesn't. And we have lots of data streaming in not as much as I would like, I'd like it to be even bigger. If you step back and look at the overall number of transactions we've conducted here, it's still relatively low. So we want to get that up, keep the learning machine going and get the buy box as broad as we possibly can and as many markets as we possibly can.\nTom White: All right. Thanks guys. Congrats on a nice quarter.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Rich Barton for any closing remarks.\nRich Barton: Thank you very much and thank you all for your time today. We're really grateful to have you along for the journey. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter, if not sooner, talk to you soon.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rich Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining our first quarter 2021 earnings call. We are in a much better place compared to one long year ago. And I'm so grateful and impressed these miraculous COVID vaccines are now widely available across the country. I hope that you and yours are beginning to find some normalcy after such a trying year. In a typical year, spring begins the traditional home buying season. But we know that this past year was anything but typical. Home buying never really slowed down. A great reshuffling driven by changes in what we want and need out of our homes have fueled continued interest in moving. And we expect this movie demand to continue as we all adjust to a safer world ahead. Our research team recently published a survey based mover report, which we have hyperlink to from the shareholder letter. It's a great read when you have the time. The report indicates that the pandemic has indeed caused people to rethink where they live, and concludes that approximately 8 million existing homeowner households that have been on the sidelines may enter a real estate market already be set by unrelenting demand. Additionally, 8.9% of consumers plan to purchase a home in the next six months near a 20 year high per the conference board's April consumer confidence survey. The reaction we got from our own employee base when we told them last March that we intended to have a more flexible workplace policy for the long-term is an interesting case study in how remote work catalyzes the great reshuffling. We found 30% more employees moved in the year following our announcement compared to the previous pre-pandemic year. This time last year, we had employees in 25 states. Now they are in all 50. This is obviously a small sample, but it shows how the great reshuffling might play out as people get certainty about their companies post COVID workplace plans. Zillow was an early embracer of a more flexible long-term workplace model. So we are a few steps ahead in firming up our plans. But we expect that other companies will adopt more physical location flexibility in varying degrees, simply because it's hard to take back something that employees have been given and value. That cultural shift will free up more restless households to list to move and Zillow will be here to serve as their trusted partner and resource. Beyond the continued reassessment of where we all are had denied the housing market is underpinned by demographic and economic tailwind that will persist for the foreseeable future. Millennials are moving up. Baby Boomers are downsizing and in between people of all generations are rethinking their lives. Despite recent shocks, mortgage rates are expected to be quite constructive for the foreseeable future and are near all time lows versus historical levels. It appears that housing turnover should accelerate from the historically low rates in the past several years along with an easier digital transaction all of these trends point to more liquidity and household formation long-term, which creates a healthy backdrop for the housing market and the business in which we operate. Of course, the most powerful and important shift driving our business is the title shift moving consumers real estate, dreaming, searching and transacting from offline to online. Just as they have in many other parts of their lives, consumers have experienced the greater convenience of a digital technology enabled home search and some the magic of a digital transaction. They will only expect further advancements in the future. Moving on now, to some business results from another strong quarter here at Zillow cloud HQ. First and foremost, all of this energy around moving has created a Zillow wave of sorts. And our customers are surfing it every day. Just last week, Time named Zillow, one of the 100 most influential companies for in their words, \u201cMaking an extraordinary impact on the world.\u201d A little grand perhaps, but definitely a nod to the vast reserve of brand goodness that we have been building up over 15 years. An up tick in pop culture recognition this past year has helped to accelerate our traffic. In Q1, 221 million average monthly unique visitors -- users visited our sites and apps, which represents an increase of nearly 30 million average monthly unique users versus this time last year. This is a level that we previously would not have thought possible and should provide the fuel for years of customer growth into the future. Our top of funnel engagement with our customers translated into excellent results across Zillow's suite of products and services. Our flagship buy-side business, Zillow Premier Agent once again generated the strongest results we've ever seen reporting 38% revenue growth year-over-year in Q1. Our nascent sell-side business Zillow Offers continued to accelerate out of the pause we instituted in the pandemic generating over 700 million in revenue and surpassing our internal expectations on revenue, EBITDA and unit level economics. The success from our buy-side and sell-side offerings when combined with solid execution from our adjacent services and sporting businesses, translated into total revenue growth of 54% sequentially and total company EBITDA of $181 million for the quarter. With that number in context of Zillow's history, it represents 90% of our full year 2018 EBITDA, which was just prior to the commencement of our heavy investment in our Zillow 2.0 vision. We are now beginning to register the benefits of the investments we have made across our product innovations for buyers and renters, as well as our major ventures into Zillow Offers, Zillow Home Loans and Zillow Closing Services. This increased profit generation after such a meaningful investment period gives us confidence that the bets we are making across the business are accretive and we are allocating our time, our people and our capital appropriately for the long-term. Speaking of our people, Fortune named Zillow, one of its 100 Best Companies to Work for based on our own employees' feedback about working at Zillow in 2020, including how trustworthy caring and fair they felt Zillow has been during the pandemic, which forced most into Zoom line. As we reimagined the future of our workplace, we are grateful for our flexible and talented workforce. While our employees are doing well and our quarterly results are strong, we are oriented to the multi-decade journey in front of us, the journey to digitize and simplifies a huge industry, delivering more and more movers gracefully to their next homes. Pursuit of these growth opportunities deserves continued appropriate reinvestment of profits. As part of that journey, we recently launched a new advertising campaign with the tagline to \u201cMove is to grow.\u201d We think it wonderfully captures the essence of why moving is both exciting and daunting and how we at Zillow are increasingly able to help our customers navigate this crossing. The campaign supports the expedition we are on as a company as well. Just as we've been reorienting our employees and mission around transactions, we have the exciting task of re educating our customers on who the new Zillow is and what we can do for them. Every signal we see based on data and customer feedback is that customers expect and demand a more seamless experience. This is Zillow 2.0. A great example of our customers enthusiasm for ease is the reaction to our recent announcement that many homeowners in Zillow Offers markets now can see that there's estimate is a live initial offer from Zillow. The announcement price alone drove record breaking interest in the service with requests coming in at levels we've never seen before. We believe we are onto something with this zestimate offer. The continuing challenge and opportunity going forward will be to translate customer interest into transactions. Now that we have many of the ingredients for our end-to-end home transaction to Zillow services and products, we are upgrading our giant leaky customer funnel in converting more browsers into customers. We are motivated every day to ensure we deliver our customers excellent integrated experiences on par with simpler smaller ecommerce transactions in other parts of their lives. To reiterate, it is still early days in these efforts and there's so much work to be done as we begin to scale. Across Zillow, we estimate that our 2020 gross profit was larger than any other player in the residential real estate technology category. But our buy-side Premier Agent business and sell-side Zillow Offers businesses still represent less than 2% of the total annual residential real estate industry service fees. We are proud of our business but we have an ocean of opportunity in front of us. Each customer who uses Zillow to move has a story. One we're sharing today is about first time home sellers Jessica LaRue-Briscoe and her husband Sean. They turned to Zillow when they were anxious about a move from Colorado to Texas, where they wanted their two-year-old son to grow up near their families. Zillow connected Jessica to an agent partner Adam Unger and he walked her through the selling process. It was all new to her and she was scared and dubious. I'm going to take a gamble on you she told him. Adam's experience and professionalism kept their worries at bay and Jessica and Sean felt informed and prepared throughout their move. I really feel like we were able to be connected with the best real estate agent for us because we went through Zillow, Jessica said. Their happy ending to their stories that their son is now spending time in Texas with Jessica's grandparents who are in their 90s. We are motivated every day like customer and partner success stories like Jessica, Sean and Adam's, like our ad campaign says to \u201cMove is to grow.\u201d And we're seeing that here at Zillow with our employees, our customers and with our industry partners. As far our investor partners, we appreciate the support as we go on this journey with you. With that, I'll turn it over to Allen. Hey, Ron, thanks. I mean, we are rapidly learning how ZO lives in this, really this unprecedented home price appreciation environment. The appreciation over the last six months is the largest move up or down that we observe in the data set over the last 35 years, right. So it's a very fluid market. But as you noted in your question and Allen talked about in his script, our top of funnel indicators are good. Like, it turns out, speed, certainty and convenience are attractive to sellers no matter what kind of market they are in. So we are seeing record levels of folks raising their hand to get a Zillow offer. I think part of that is driven by this really nifty feature we launched last quarter that we internally called Zestimate offers which is this, live initial -- having the Zestimate via a live initial offer for lots of the homes inside of the buy box in Zillow Offers markets. So anyway, we're also really happy with this kind of glow that we're seeing across the business from this positive reinforcement we have from having all of these linked businesses and having this very large, single funnel of customer demand coming in. And the IMT and adjacent business numbers are really, really commendable. But on ZO in particular Ron, we're leaning in like -- we're leaning in, we're expanding in the 25 markets. We're heavily staffing as I think we made an announcement maybe Allen just talked about it too. We are we are planning as a company hiring a net 2000 people in 2021. And a lot of that will be for Zillow Offers and we're making other investments in ZO as well. So we are comfortable with that increased investment because of what we're seeing top of funnel because what we know about the consumer value proposition. And also, we're leaning in because most consumers don't even know what Zillow Offers is yet. They don't even know, we've got to take Zillow 2.0 out of the kind of quarterly conference call realm and into the consumer awareness realm. And so we got a lot of work to do there and basis points penetrated in the business overall. So long answer, but we're feeling we're leaning in and feeling good. Okay. Hey, Naved. The 2.0 bet is all about the fact that we believe customers want speed, simplicity, integration, value, like these are not risky bets to make on consumer behavior, okay. They're kind of timeless features of what customers demand. And we also believe that our brand and our traffic give us a competitive advantage, relative to point solution competitors, because we have a large audience, we can spread any customer acquisition costs we may have for those customers over a much larger revenue, profit and transaction base. So that's kind of the Business School answer to why we like the competitive advantage. So that's why we've made the bet. So we've made these big bets over the last two and a half years when we really leaned into 2.0. And building out all the 2.0 components, like Zillow Offers, mortgages, Zillow closing services, even rentals. Anyway, the short answer to your question is, it's working. All the children appear to be above average. I don't know if we're getting any chuckles out there to the Garrison Keillor reference, but all the businesses are performing really well beyond our expectations. So that's a terrific proof point that the integrated strategy and the transaction strategy is working our revenue and profit on a per user basis and steadily rising, which is really nice to see and it's still quite low. So we have a ways to go. I said in my script, to kind of introduce a new kind of TAM and penetration concept. This less than 2% gross profit penetration into the total addressable market of services in the industry. We keep struggling for ways to talk about the full opportunity in quarters past we talked about trying to estimate transaction share, and what share of transactions we touched, that is fraught, because we don't exactly know how many transactions we touched, or were, I challenged the team to try to figure out if there's maybe a gross profit penetration metric, we can come out to communicate the opportunity for ourselves and for you all. So that could be interesting. Anyway, there's still a ton of work to do on 2.0 not the least of which as I said before, is awareness of 2.0. That's where you're seeing marketing investment, increased marketing investment from us anyway. Stay tuned, we're on the path, we like the path, things look clear and lots of green lights out the front windshield. Maybe Allen, if you want to answer that? Thanks Lloyd . That sounds like an Allen question. You want to start with the ZO stuff, Allen? Before I -- let me editorialize on that just a little bit that the risk of keeping this issue open. Allen, the unit economics, the margins that we're earning on a unit basis right now are, not what our goal is? I'll just reiterate that. We want this and know this can be a giant business. And it's only going to be a giant business when the pricing is perceived to be fair to consumers. So it's not our goal, to have 549 basis points or whatever it is we just printed on a unit basis. No, it's slightly better than last quarter. In other words, it's lower. But what we're aiming to do is to provide a fair offer and charge a fair fee to our customers. And thus we believe we maximize the TAM, we maximize the number of transactions we can touch and participate in. And we have the ability to sell a bunch of adjacent services around those transactions. So it's worth pausing there for a sec. All right. On the listings, question, yes, listings are really, really skinny, inventories really, really low. I think I said this last quarter, it's kind of like the flight attendant on the airplane when she says even though the airbag does not appear to inflate the oxygen will flow. That is what's happening clearly in the market, volumes are up, price appreciation is way up to but homes are just moving really, really fast. And so, we like to see a market where lots of activity is happening. We see offline to online shifts happening. We see demographic shifts happening. We see great reshuffling things happening, all to put wind in the sails of our pa business and our business indeed overall. Risk is always an important component of pricing, of course and forecast of home price appreciation is a very important part of pricing as well. And needless to say, we're in a really -- just in a really fluid environment on that and we're learning really quickly so. No, that was completely great. Thanks, Allen. Hey, Mark, nice to see a brand new analyst from Evercore here on the call with us today. Congrats on the new job. I think Allen maybe start with the ZO margin question and then we can both tackle the \u2013 At the scale we are right now, thank you for clarifying what I said Allen, I didn't mean to imply we didn't want to make money natively off this business. But we are subscale dramatically subscale right now in our estimation and while we are scaling it, we're targeting this plus or minus 200. So anyway, thanks. Thanks for clarifying. And you have the flywheel right. That's the flywheel that we're making. We also bet in addition to the leverage, we see on the three line items Allen was talking about, we see leverage on customer acquisition costs, because we have a much cheaper customer funnel. The zestimate offer being just like the perfect characterization of that people come look at the zestimates and if more and more customers know that zestimate is alive, initial offer for their home, we are more likely to get first crack at them. Now the challenge is making sure that people even know Zillow Offers exists and what it is and is there a trick? Is it too good to be true and education and marketing? So we're in that early phase of doing that right now Mark. Hey, Maria. This is Rich. We see lots of continued logical adjacency opportunities all around the transaction. We haven't targeted or begun talking about any additional ones other than the businesses we're in right now with mortgage titled escrow, etc. But we do obviously see other large adjacencies we're just going to knock things off one at a time and evaluate each additional one as the time calls for it. Thank you very much. One more maybe, Brad. Hey, Tom. Thanks for the question. We are constantly experimenting on a market-by-market basis with the buy box and what works and what doesn't. And we have lots of data streaming in not as much as I would like, I'd like it to be even bigger. If you step back and look at the overall number of transactions we've conducted here, it's still relatively low. So we want to get that up, keep the learning machine going and get the buy box as broad as we possibly can and as many markets as we possibly can. Thank you very much and thank you all for your time today. We're really grateful to have you along for the journey. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter, if not sooner, talk to you soon."

            "content": "Thank you, Rich. As Rich discussed Zillow Group delivered another strong quarter reporting Q1 consolidated revenue of 1.2 billion in EBITDA of 181 million, both exceeding the high end of our outlook range. Q1 IMT segment revenue of 446 million grew 35% year-over-year, as we continue to see accelerated growth in Premiere Agent and strong growth in rentals. IMT segment EBITDA was 209 million in Q1 or 47% of IMT segment revenue. Accelerating revenue growth, combined with year-over-year declines in operating costs, translated into 143% year-over-year EBITDA growth in Q1. Premiere Agent revenue grew 38% year-over-year in Q1, the accelerated growth was primarily driven from connections growing faster than traffic, as well as our focus on providing outstanding service and optimizing to connect high intent customers with high performing partner agents. Growth in Zillow Offers continued to reaccelerate in Q1. We reported home segment revenue of 704 million, which exceeded the high-end of our outlook with 1,965 home sales. Resale velocity was above our expectations. In Q1, we sold 128% of the beginning inventory of 1,531 homes was contributed to inventory decline at the end of Q1 to 1,422 homes. Purchases increased to 1,856 homes in the quarter from 1,789 homes purchased in Q4. But not quite at the pace we planned as we continued to work on refining our models to catch up with the rapid acceleration in home price appreciation. During Q1, we continued to focus on unit costs, automation, adding capacity, and sharpening pricing models to improve offer strength as we continue to scale. Our Q1 Zillow offers unit economics of 549 basis points return before interest expense was above the plus or minus 200 basis point guard rails we've set for ourselves while working to scale the business. The outsides economic results were impacted by the ongoing strong housing market, which is temporal in nature. We made progress during the quarter on improving offer strength and sharpen pricing that tightened our unit economics by approximately 120 basis points from that of Q4. The durable operational improvements in overall cost per home contributed 280 basis points improvement from Q1 2020. Our mortgages segment revenue increased 169% year-over-year in Q1 to 68 million and mortgages segment EBITDA was 6 million compared to the midpoint of our outlook range for a loss of 1 million. The revenue and EBITDA outperformance was primarily driven by mortgage loan origination volume, which was up more than 8x year-over-year, as well as our mortgage marketplace, both as a result of strong refinance activity. Beginning this quarter and going forward, we will disclose our mortgage loan origination purchase and refinance volume. In Q1 refinance loan origination volume comprised 90% of total origination volume. We continued to invest in our mortgage platform to provide a compelling experience for our purchase customers, as well as integrating across our business. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. At a consolidated level, we expect revenue to be 1.26 billion up 64% year-over-year at the midpoint of our outlook. And EBITDA to be between 116 million and 140 million. In our IMT segment, we are forecasting 66% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 and 44% revenue growth over Q2 2019 at the midpoint of our outlook range. Within the IMT segment, we expect from Premier Agent revenue to be between 342 million to 350 million up 80% year-over-year and up 49% over Q2 2019 at the midpoint of our outlook. This is being driven by strong top of funnel traffic and connections as we enter Q2. It is important to know that during Q2 last year, we provided Better Together billing relief to our Premiere Agent and other marketplace partners. Excluding the impact of this billing relief, we expect Q2 year-over-year Premier Agent revenue growth to be 38% and IMT segment revenue growth to be 35% at the midpoint of the respective outlook ranges. We expect Q2 IMT EBITDA margin could be 41% at the midpoint of our outlook down sequentially from 47% in Q1. As we position ourselves to drive sustainable, profitable long-term growth, we expect Q2 IMT EBITDA margin to reflect accelerated investments in marketing, staffing and technology up from Q1 levels and we expect to further accelerate investments into Q3. For full year 2021, we expect EBITDA dollar growth more in line with revenue growth rates rather than expansion from the 38% EBITDA margin we reported in 2020. In Q2, we expect our home segment revenue to increase sequentially to 735 million at the midpoint of our outlook. The higher than expected Q1 resale velocity I mentioned previously pulled forward a portion of expected Q2 home sales. Customer interest in selling their homes to Zillow and the operational improvements we have continued to make have shown strong improvement in top of funnel as we enter Q2, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to scale the business in the periods ahead. We expect mortgage segment revenue to be between 57 million to 62 million in Q2, which is down from Q1. Our Q2 guide reflects slower industry refinance activity and narrow gain on sale spreads. As we have discussed for the past couple of quarters, we do not expect the [indiscernible] high gain on sale margins from originations to be sustainable. We plan to continue to capture solid refinance demand and invest in building the factory to scale our operations, as the purchase business is built over time. As a result, we expect mortgages segment EBITDA to be between a loss of 9 million and a loss of 5 million. We further strengthened our balance sheet during the quarter by initiating and at the market offering or ATM, selling 551 million of capital stock. We have been and will continue to be opportunistic and prudent in any potential future share sales and have approximately 450 million remaining on the authorization. We ended the quarter with 4.7 billion in cash and investments, which puts us in a strong position to fund our vision for Zillow and make strategic long-term investments both organically and inorganically. As a reminder, we do have a $500 million commitment to acquire showing time as we cooperate with federal regulators to work diligently toward closing the acquisition. As we look forward to the balance of the year, our priorities remain focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners. We look to grow our customer base and engagement through a compelling dream and shop experience. Invest in sustainable top-line growth opportunities across the company, reduce cost structure and improve productivity and transaction services, drive profit growth through operational discipline. And with that operator, we will open the line for questions. Hey, Ron and Rich, I will just add. Just to give a little color to the guidance for Q2 with respect to home segment revenue. We've called out the resale velocity pulling some sales in the Q1. And I just want to call it even with strong top of funnel activity, there is a lag as we go through between offer, purchase and an eventual sale and when we see the revenue and so a lot of this top of funnel activity will start to show up more in Q3 and that's part of the reason for the Q2 guide that's reflected -- that lag is reflected in the Q2 guide. Yes. I mean, I guess what I would just say is, I would classify, we're continuing to make investments across a variety of our businesses where we feel like there's a lot of opportunity to accelerate innovation for our customer, shop and dream, buy with, sell with. And so there's quite a bit of tech and dev, but there's also transactional type resources that are necessary as we scale the business. And so I think you're seeing kind of a mix of those, there are some additional innovative ideas around 3D tours and other things. So, most of the initiatives we talk about, we are looking at where we need the resource and to accelerate our investment. But it's spread across the company. And, I'll just take this moment to say we continue to prioritize, our existing resources as well, to make sure we're making bets on the right thing. But we like the results we're seeing, we like the inputs that we're tracking and look forward to execution. Sure. Thanks, Lloyd. So on growth, yes, in Q1 Premier Agent growth of 38% year-over-year, if you compare it to the underlying growth rates we talked about in Q4 was 27%. And in Q4 2020 was 27% and in Q3 of 2020, was 20%. So we've seen this accelerating underlying growth trend in Premiere Agent. If you look in our Q2 outlook, the underlying growth rate of 38%, at the midpoint, after you adjust for the better together discounts, is a continuation of the inputs that we're seeing. We have a large audience, strong top of the funnel. And when you combine that with a focus on some of the inputs of customer satisfaction and conversion and revenue per lead, we're just seeing very encouraging trends on the inputs. And I think it's all predicated by this focus on helping the customer get through the transaction. In terms of the second half, we are not providing guidance, but what I would call out is that the Premier Agent Q2, two year growth rate of 49%, we pulled out in the shareholder letter, at the midpoint of our range is probably a good way to think about growth, as you look at your models on how to model forward through this weird year that we had in 2020. So hopefully, that helps. With respect to margin, our Q2 IMT margin, we expect to be 41% at the midpoint of our outlook that is down sequentially from the 47% in Q1. As we position ourselves to drive sustainable, profitable long-term growth, we do expect this margin rate to reflect accelerated investments in marketing and staffing and technology to provide innovation on behalf of the customer. And so we do expect that to increase from Q1 levels and we expect further acceleration in Q3. When I think about full year, given your question, what I'd say is, we do expect either dollar growth, but that growth more in line with revenue growth rates, rather than expansion off the 38% margin rate we put it in 2020. So hopefully that helps. That's on a headline basis. It's the 49%, if you just take Q2 2019 for instance, Q2 2021 midpoint, that's 49% growth. And we think that's a good way to pin your models. All right. I'll start and Rich or Brad jump in. But on Zillow brokerage services, we're operating in just a few of the 25 markets. So that's still relatively nascent, it's going well. We're excited about initial results. But there's nothing with respect to attach or any kind of data point yet. Over time, we do believe that's a great way to have a better integrated customer experience. But we still work with partners across all our markets. And we're learning the services that we can provide, but it's still relatively new. And then, our mortgage, I guess, the way I would describe it, as you think about our mortgage strategy coming together. When we purchased mortgage lenders of America way back in 2018, they were really a direct consumer non-conforming origination shop. Our initial strategy was to move to a broader mix of conforming mortgages, while updating and transforming the platform and bringing in new leadership. In 2020, we started to share, our focus on building the factory to bringing in the loan officers and loan processors and building the systems. And we did that off of the strong refinance demand. And we continue to do that in the Q1. I think over time, you'll see that mix normalize more to industry standards. But we want to have a compelling and great customer experience and we're continuing to work with customers and learn. And I think over time, we expect to provide all more good services that a customer may want, whether it be refi our customer, both those that are doing other services within Zillow, as well as refi customers who come looking for refi. So we're very excited about what the team has done and where we are. And we think that mortgage is a very important part of the Zillow 2.0 and we're continuing to expand there. Sure. Yes. So, yes, I mean, I think Rich, hit it pretty well. What I'd say is, if you look at our unit economics and as I mentioned 549 basis points of return on home sold before interest expense, being above our plus or minus 200 basis point guardrails, the driver that's there that has improved from Q4 is home acquisition cost as a percent of the sale. So it's at 87% of homes revenue versus 85.9 in Q4, but still higher than, we would expect and that's reflective of this resale velocity and our selling of homes at rates higher than we would have expected or underwrote to, when we acquired them. And so, this expansion that we're catching up with, there's also a lot of nuance just in the offers and how we present them. That we're also iterating. So I guess what I would describe is, we are continually figuring out how to improve our offer strength in the way we communicate that to our customers, the top of funnel and the interest is strong. We're seeing early trends in Q2 that give us confidence that this is something that we are going to be able to do. The guide that I provided in Q2 is reflective of the lag as we purchased those homes, renovate them and then we sell them, as well as the Q1, kind of overperformance. But we're very confident that we have a compelling offer that high-buying is something customers want even in this market. And the early signs give us confidence that we can continue to grow and scale this business. So hopefully that helps. 46% year-over-year growth rate is fantastic. We're really pleased with our rentals business. It comes from and it's driven by a lot of the decisions we've made to invest in a fairly good streamline set of product innovations. And I think we're starting to see the benefit of some of those over the last few years that we've made. A lot of those are integrated services like one click applications, payments, listings and these services are all kind of coming together. In fact, as we talked about, Zillow, 2.0, getting closer to the transactions, I believe we're seeing that in the rental space. It's also assisted though by this continued strength in top of funnel and our large audience. And even some of the demographics we talked about on the housing market, the broader, the great reshuffling and these demographic trail wins are also helping our rentals business. So we're excited with the progress. The growth has been strong. And we're excited about the products and services that we're able to deliver both to our customers and to our property managers. I don't know, Rich, if you want to add anything. Yes. I guess what I'd say is, we're now taking feeds as we're MLS, there's some puts and takes across that there's I would say that we continue to invest to make that a great experience. And there is some costs that come with that. Whereas there's also some costs that are reduced from some of the other data acquisition costs that we may have had in the future. But it's not a big enough call, I think where we've disclosed one way or the other, what the savings are, what we really think it's a great customer experience. And it's just really consistent with our ability to have great information on the site and to provide a great experience to our customers. So that's the real win, I think on the IDX side. Yes. I do mortgage, I'll start ZO and you can jump on. So Mark, thanks for the question. On mortgage, EBITDA margin what we see and what's reflected in the guide is that a significant portion of the revenue downtick in our guide compared to Q1 is related to the gain on sales spreads in our guidance. And so that kind of falls through we still are very excited about the platform we're building and we're continuing to build the factory. And so when you see that downtick, it has an effect, that kind of falls straight through the EBITDA versus Q1 performance. And so that's what's driving the majority of that downtick Q1 to Q2 on the mortgage margin rates. And on ZO, sorry, I think you hit it right on the head, what I'd say is, we still provided long-term targets, of 400, 500 basis points return before interest, but current period and in near term, our guidance that we provided is no -- this plus or minus 200 basis points because of the size of the opportunity and because it's important to get out there and provide a great experience as we learn. We're willing to invest in as plus or minus 200 as we learn the business. I'd say we see opportunities across all areas, we have improved 280 basis points, primarily across renovations and selling costs versus last year. You can imagine renovations, as you have more density in the area for your renovations. And as you get better and smarter about what needs to be done and what the customer is willing to pay for. Who is repurchasing the home that you'll see benefits in that area, right now is about 3% costs of revenue. Holding costs are reflected with a lot of things but there are definitely many things we can do to improve that's a relatively small cost. And then selling costs over time as we as we grow Zillow brokerage services. And as we reduce through automation and technology, some of these non-value added costs that currently happen in the world today, we expect that number to come down. And we expect acquisition costs to be to be reflective of a fair offer, as Rich mentioned, but solid cost structure. Our decision to be plus or minus 200 basis points is reflective of us reinvesting any improvements we make right now to be at this plus or minus 200, because of the size of the opportunity. And as we've mentioned several times, the fact that we're 549 is just saying that we're still working, you know, to catch up. Yes. Thanks, Maria. This is Allen. What I'd say is, our revenue growth in Q1 of 38% and compared to that underlying growth statistics, I gave a 27 in Q4 of 2020 and 20% in 3Q, obviously accelerating. There aren't any significant, there are no changes in revenue accounting or revenue recognition to call out in Q1. So that is the underlying growth rate and we've talked about the guide of 38%, adjusted in Q2 at the midpoint. That is a combination of both MVP and flex programs working together as two monetization tools that we have and they're both performing well. And again, if you go to the inputs of improving CSAT, driving more and more of our customers through our connections program and delivering high intent customers to high performing agents, those are all things -- the input dials that we're driving go across both flex and our MVP model and we're seeing results. We are continuing to look at and we expect to increase the flex representation across our pool. There's not any particular market, it requires us understanding and identifying agents that are willing to grow with us. And so, there's not really any particular attribute to call out or metric to give I think our growth rate is reflected last optimizing the process, the monetization models we have available and the inputs that we're driving around the customer and customer experience to help close transactions."

With that, I will now turn the call over to Rich.\nRich Barton: Thank you, Brad. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you dialing in to hear about our fourth quarter and full year results and our excitement about the progress we're making on our growth strategy. 2022 was an extraordinarily difficult and transformative year for Zillow, one that I believe the team navigated courageously. In late 2021, after living through unprecedented volatility in the housing market, we made the hard decision to make a rapid and orderly exit from our iBuying operation, judging it too risky for Zillow given the breadth and profitability of our hard earned core business and our category leadership. We began 2022 with 10,000 homes on our balance sheet and ended the year with zero. Unfortunately, this also necessitated a workforce reduction of approximately 2,000 valued employees. When we spoke to you this time last year, we unveiled a new growth strategy oriented around driving our customer transaction share from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025 with a focus on increasing engagement, increasing customer transactions and increasing revenue per transaction. As we quickly shed our iBuying inventory and embarked on our new journey more nimbly, the unprecedented housing macro volatility continued this time to the downside, the scenario we had feared could happen. 30-year mortgage interest rates nearly doubled over the course of the first six months of 2022, meaningfully slowing turnover and home price appreciation in the housing market. Despite these significant changes for our company and the housing market at large, our team remains focused on innovation with our eyes forward. We are working on building solutions and delivering products for our customers, our agent partners and the industry that make it easier for people to transact in real estate and ultimately transact with Zillow. We're rapidly releasing products and improving both the customer and agent experience to ensure that when customers come to Zillow, they choose to stay and explore our other offerings. We released products at a rapid pace and service to our integrated transaction strategy, including the launch of natural language search, listing media services through Showing Time Plus, our partnership with Opendoor and real-time touring among many other product releases. The result of these efforts have put the company on solid ground heading into 2023. Our traffic and brand are extremely strong with average monthly unique users of 198 million during Q4, and roughly 65% of mobile app users for the real estate marketplaces category. Additionally, 2022 was a year where Zillow regained its spot as the number one most visited rentals platform according to comScore, putting us in a great position for future growth. Despite a challenging operating environment in 2022, when we attempted to normalize for COVID volatility, we have a go-forward business that has grown consolidated revenue by 12% on an annualized basis since 2019, and while our IMT segment grew EBITDA by 30% on an annualized basis over that same time frame. Equally important, we exited 2022 with a solid balance sheet of $3.4 billion in cash and investments, up more than $200 million versus a year ago, even after executing $947 million worth of share repurchases at a weighted average price of $42.63 throughout the year. Most importantly, we exit 2022 with our employee base in a far more stable place than where we started the year. Just under three years ago, we took advantage of our position as a primarily digital business with a heavy mix of engineering and product talent and committed to location flexibility permanently. That decision brought us more stability during the pandemic, and we continue to feel very good in our position as a cloud headquartered company which we define as having the flexibility of choosing where to live with the understanding that many jobs require periodic on-site gatherings, inter and intra team. We've been able to dramatically broaden our candidate pool and attract top talent from all over the country. Voluntary attrition declined steadily across the organization in 2022, down more than half in Q4 compared to Q1 and our workforce is more dispersed, more diverse and more engaged with 93% of our employees saying they clearly understand how their work is contributing to our mission. Further, our data shows that we're attracting talent at a much greater rate than before the pandemic four times more applicants per job posting versus 2019. Last and most important, we are seeing increases in productivity in critical areas of our business. Our Premier Agent sales team is more productive today than it was before the pandemic. Again, our software development and product teams are creating services faster today as well. So that was a little back in reflection on 2022. What about 2023? We are focused on our vision of building a housing super app, a single digital experience to help customers across all their real estate needs. Our goal is to increase engagement, increased customer transactions and increased revenue per transaction by investing across five growth pillars: touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services. The expected output of this strategy is to grow our share of consumer transactions from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025. Critical to achieving our aspirations is building an integrated experience for customers and partners. We spent much of last year creating products and services across our five growth pillars and introducing them into our test markets as they became available. In 2023, we are ready to take the best of our learnings and roll them out market-by-market together across Raleigh, Denver, Atlanta and Phoenix in service of an integrated experience. With that as a backdrop, our first product road map update is touring. You've heard from us many times now that touring is a critical piece of the moving experience. It's the point-of-sale, where shoppers turn into transactors. And we know from all the data we see on a daily basis across our entire business that movers who request a tour convert to transactors at three times the rate of other actions on Zillow. Further, we believe improving the touring process is integral to building the seamless connected experience we envision. In late 2022, we rolled out real-time touring in Atlanta. Real-time touring is designed to make booking a home tour as easy as making a restaurant reservation online, a convenience that modern on-demand consumers certainly expect. We're excited about the early signs coming out of Atlanta, which show real-time touring enables higher connection rates and higher customer propensity to work with our Premier Agent partners, which we expect to drive benefits up and down the funnel, delivering high-intent customers to our partners. As a result of the early data we are seeing, we expanded this offering across Atlanta and are rolling out the product to our other three test markets. Of course, we have our eye on integration as well. Alongside the product improvements we are making every day to real-time touring, we've made it much easier for agents to transfer customers who are interested in financing to Zillow Home Loans loan officers as part of the touring experience. In Harmony, with state-of-the-art digital products and services, enhancing our partner network is critical to bringing our housing super app vision to live, which will be the focus of my second update. For years, we have driven increased lead volumes to our high-performing partner agents. We have done this in a variety of ways with an eye towards those who treat our customers best, who convert leads into transactions best and those that are excited about growing their businesses alongside us. We have taken our most aggressive steps in enhancing the network by meaningfully consolidating our partner network across all four test markets. We increasingly believe that a tighter set of partners allows us to deliver a better customer experience and allows us to test new products and services rapidly along the way in service of integration. One early success we've seen has come in Raleigh, North Carolina. Last quarter, we told you that in Raleigh, we were seeing approximately 15% customer adoption of Zillow Home Loans. We are happy to report that we are now seeing closer to 20% adoption just three months later. Based on our early successes in Raleigh, we have expanded our Zillow Home Loans adoption playbook to the rest of our test markets. Speaking of Zillow Home Loans, our next product road map update is on financing. We said many times before that we believe financing is crucial to the buyer's experience and merging financing at strategic points in the buyer's journey is critical to the end-to-end customer experience we envision. So in 2022, we turned our efforts towards building the foundation for a substantial direct-to-consumer purchase mortgage origination business. Last quarter, we spoke about the critical work streams we've deployed to bolster our mortgage business. In 2023, we have four key areas of focus. First, we are simplifying the entry points into our funnel and are building overall awareness of Zillow Home Loans. Second, we are building a better digital mortgage experience on Zillow to meet customers where they are in their buying journey. As a reminder, even with relatively low awareness for Zillow Home Loans, millions of customers on Zillow raised their hands for financing help last year, a testament to our brand and audience scale. Our focus is on improving our processes to better identify high intent customers and creating easy-to-use digital tools on our apps and sites to help our customers be ready-to-buy well before they tour homes. Third, we are bolstering our loan officer tools and capabilities so they can effectively handle our volume while providing a best-in-class customer experience. And finally, we're working closely with our Premier Agent partner base to build integrated processes with Zillow Home Loans, which I touched on a moment ago. As a reminder, we are building out two primary ways for customers to connect with Zillow Home Loans. The first way is financing first. It is when a customer starts their moving journey with financing to get pre-qualified before they are connected to an agent. We're investing here because we know approximately 40% of all homebuyers start their journey this way and roughly 80% of our prospective mortgage customers don't have a real estate agent. For many customers, financing is the most opaque and intimidating part of the home buying journey, and we want to help make it easier and more transparent on Zillow. We also know how valuable it is for our Premier Agent partners to be connected with the customer who already knows what they can afford. After many, many product changes last year, we are beginning to test connecting pre-qualified customers with Premier Agent partners in multiple markets, including all four test markets. The second way is property first. This is when our Zillow Home Loans lead comes back to us from a Premier Agent partner who was working with a home shopping customer we had previously sent them. Beyond the integration point with real-time touring we discussed earlier, we have integrated Zillow Home Loans into all existing connection processes across our four test markets. Encouragingly, we are already seeing nearly one in five Premier Agent partners sending connections to Zillow Home Loans in these markets and some agents outside of those markets are also proactively choosing to connect customers with us. From our perspective, the inherent value in integrated services has made our partners supportive of these efforts, and we are pleased with the early results. In addition to the investments we're making in improving the buying experience, we're also delivering solutions for sellers and their listing agents, and we have some exciting product roadmap updates this quarter. Enabled by the small acquisition of VRX Media earlier this month, we launched listing Media Services through ShowingTime+, a photography service and comprehensive media package that enables listing agents to seamlessly deliver beautiful, immersive media for the homes they are selling. This service is a critical precursor to our upcoming listing showcase product, which we previewed last quarter. As a reminder, this product will differentiate a listing agent on Zillow through branding and a higher-quality listing that looks unlike anything else that exists on real estate sites today. Our aim with both of these products is to serve more sellers and allow listing agents to win more business. We will be rolling out listing showcase over the summer. We continue to be excited about the work that is happening here. We're also pleased to announce that our partnership with Opendoor is live in Atlanta and Raleigh. Customers who start their selling journey with Zillow can now request a cash offer from Opendoor and simultaneously receive an estimate of their open market home sale price with a local Premier Agent partner. All customers will work with one of Zillow's licensed advisers to determine the best path based on their needs so they can confidently sell their home and get into their next one, whether that's potentially maximizing sale price on the open market with the real estate agent, or being assured of a speedy sale with Opendoor. Regardless of the path, the customer chooses, they will be able to use the service as a stand-alone offering or package it with other Zillow services such as financing through Zillow home loans, working with the premiere agent partner to buy their next home or when it's available, closing with Zillow closing services. This new product experience will launch in additional markets nationwide over the course of 2023. Clearly, we have a lot of work ahead on our product road map. And of course, we are very conscious of the housing market environment while we invest for the future. Housing affordability challenges were of 2022 and remain front and center as we begin 2023. Affordability does impact demand. It also impacts supply. For homeowners, it's simply more expensive to move than to stay put right now, leaving more wood be movers on the sidelines. It's going to take time for these market dynamics to normalize. But as we head into 2023, we are seeing some early signs of stabilization, albeit at a meaningfully subdued level. Mortgage rates have come off their highs Home prices have continued to decelerate from their peak last June, and there is a looming backlog of homes under construction, both for sale homes and rentals, which is likely to give some help on affordability. However, we are not out of the woods yet given high uncertainty in the path of the macro economy and how it may affect the real estate industry. Things continue to be foggy and we can't control what the housing market does. What we can control is how we operate our business. Similar to many times in our history, including 2022, we are closely monitoring the situation and will be prudent in how we invest through this period. As we look back on the last 12 months, it is clear we were simultaneously navigating the past and organizing for the future. Now, however, we are eyes forward and focused. 2023 is a consequential year for us, and it is all about making progress on our initiatives through product launches and market rollouts so that we can further expand and scale into 2024. We see the same headlines you all see about tech companies cutting back their workforces to make up for staffing to unsustainable pandemic level growth that is now normalizing. Our story is different. After a year of significant people-related and other expense reductions in 2022, we are now investing during a very difficult housing market while others retrench as we see real opportunity for growth. We expect that 60 million homes will trade hands over the next 10 years, which reflects a much more natural and healthy mover rate. And given all the product and service innovation opportunities we have discussed, our aim is to be an increasing and meaningful share of those customer transactions. This will drive value for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders. We will continue to share our progress and learnings along the way, and we appreciate your partnership with us on this journey. I will now hand the line over to Allen. Allen?\nAllen Parker: Thanks, Rich. In Q4, we delivered consolidated results above our outlook for both revenue and EBITDA. IMT segment revenue was $417 million, down 14% year-over-year, above the high end of our outlook range, driven primarily by better-than-expected performance in Premier Agent. Premier Agent revenue outperformed both our expectations and the industry decline of 31%, decreasing 20% year-over-year. A significant contributor to the Premier Agent outperformance was improvement in the mix of first-time homebuyers during the second half of the year, trending back towards historical norms. Given our Premier Agent customers are overweighted to first-time homebuyers versus the overall industry, we believe this was a tailwind in the second half of the year compared to the headwind we faced in the first half of 2022, when cash buyers were winning a higher mix of homes in the hypercompetitive market. We plan to provide full year 2022 customer transaction share data in a future quarter as lagged county property records become available. We believe our Q4 Premier Agent revenue results also demonstrate the benefit of our continued focus and years of investments in our brand, customer experience and partner network, all things that we can control. We continually iterate and optimize our apps and sites on behalf of our customers and partners, and that became even more of a focus as teams have been freed up from iBuying. While each of the new features may seem small individually, over time, they add up and differentiate us. Our relative traffic growth has outperformed the next top 15 real estate sites combined as defined by comScore over the last several months. This has contributed to our overall relative outperformance in revenue when compared to the industry. Additionally, over the years, we have worked to refine our partner base by growing and rewarding high-performing agent partners. Rentals revenue was up 13% year-over-year as rentals traffic on Zillow grew 20% year-over-year to 26 million average monthly unique users in Q4 for comScore. Our industry-leading rentals traffic help us grow the number of multifamily properties on our platform despite an industry-wide decline in multifamily apartment renter searches and move rates. We believe macroeconomic factors, including both rental affordability and for-sale affordability challenges have pressured move rates and renter searches. This is partially offset by occupancy rates, which have continued to drift lower from historically high levels and continue to be a tailwind to the rental industry demand for advertising. IMT segment EBITDA was $113 million for Q4 or 27% of revenue, exceeding the high end of our outlook range of $100 million and 25% of revenue. The outperformance was primarily driven by better-than-expected Premier Agent revenue. Mortgages segment revenue of $18 million was near the midpoint of our outlook range as we continue to make progress building our Zillow Home Loans purchased mortgage business. Mortgages segment EBITDA was a loss of $32 million, near the high end of our outlook, as we continue to invest in building a better consumer-facing origination experience, efficient and scalable internal loan officer tools and back-end systems and integration with our Premier Agent business. We believe these investments lay the foundation for Zillow Home Loans to serve a much broader set of customers, many of whom we currently send to third-party lenders today. We expect financing will be a key driver behind growing our share of customer transactions and revenue per customer transaction. Total select operating expenses and cost of revenue, excluding share based compensation and depreciation and amortization were $362 million in Q4, up from $353 million in Q3. Consistent with our expectations implied in our outlook for the quarter. As we discussed on our Q3 earnings call, we are maintaining our planned investments in our key growth initiatives, partly offset by reductions from letting go a set of employees in October as well as other discretionary and non-people-related cost actions. We ended Q4 with $3.4 billion of cash and investments, down slightly from $3.5 billion in Q3, which includes the benefit from operating cash flow as well as the impact of $174 million in share repurchases during Q4 at an average price of $35 a share. We repurchased a total of 22 million shares for $947 million in 2022, which translates to an average share price of approximately $43 per share. Although the macro backdrop has been choppy, we continue to focus on the inputs we can control, adding value to our customers and shipping great products while prudently managing costs. We feel good about the progress we are making across our growth pillars and believe investing against our targets while managing costs is the right thing to do across this business cycle to drive share growth. Our relative brand strength at the top of the funnel, along with our balance sheet and focused growth strategy, enable us to continue to invest prudently. To align with our growth strategy and to better reflect the integrated platform of digitized solutions we are building, beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we plan to report our financial results as a single reportable segment. Within this framework, we plan to report revenue categories of residential, rentals, mortgages and other. These revenue categories are consistent with how we measure success against their respective industry total addressable markets. The new residential revenue category will primarily include revenue for Premier Agent and new construction marketplaces as well as StreetEasy for sale product offerings, Zillow Closing Services and ShowingTime+. Our rentals and mortgages revenue categories will remain consistent with historical presentation and other revenue will primarily include revenue generated from display advertising. Our cost will be reported in one consolidated segment, and we will report a single consolidated EBITDA, consistent with how we are operating the business. Silos have been broken down across lines of business teams to integrate towards providing customers and our partners' end-to-end solutions. Operations and investments across the business are intended to optimize consolidated revenue and consolidated EBITDA. We have provided a downloadable Excel version of select historical revenue data under this new presentation on our website within the supplemental financial tables and our interactive analyst center to help with modeling. These changes have no impact on historical consolidated total revenue or consolidated EBITDA. Turning to our outlook. Going forward, we are aligning our guidance with our new reporting structure and plan to provide outlook for residential revenue, total revenue and consolidated EBITDA, to help you transition to our new revenue categories, we also plan to provide Premier Agent revenue growth rates, and revenue growth rate outlook as we report over the next four quarters. For Q1, we expect total revenue to be $404 million to $437 million, implying a year-over-year decline of 22% at the midpoint of our outlook range. We expect residential revenue to be in the range of $313 million to $338 million. For Premier Agent, we estimate revenues will decline in the range of 23% to 28% year-over-year as compared to our estimate for an industry transaction dollar decline between 25% and 35% year-over-year in Q1. We expect consolidated EBITDA to be in the range of $48 million to $63 million, implying a 13% margin at the midpoint of our outlook rates. We continue to balance investments for future growth while managing discretionary costs during this challenging and uncertain macro environment. We have a high incremental margin business that should see leverage when the environment improves, which we demonstrated in both Q3 and Q4. Our Q1 EBITDA outlook assumes that from Q4 to Q1, we expect a modest increase in total operating expenses and cost of revenue. We expect this to be primarily driven by investments to support our recent acquisition of VRX Media and our new ShowingTime+ products. Our recent VRX Media acquisition has enabled us to accelerate our distribution plans for listing media services. In closing, entering 2023, we remain in a strong position to invest against our strategy to better serve more customers to drive customer transaction share and more revenue per customer transaction. As we look forward, our priorities remain focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners, and we plan to grow our customer engagement through a compelling dream and shop experience, deliver a more integrated customer transactional experience to drive customers to choose to transact with us and our partners, invest in sustainable top line growth opportunities across the company, including new integrated services that are more scalable, less subject to earnings volatility and more capital efficient and manage our cost structure and improve productivity, including continued prioritization of our investments that we expect will drive a profitable, scalable and positive cash flow company. And with that operator, we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. You may proceed.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Two, if I can. First, just on the product side. Can you help us understand the listings showcase product? It seems like kind of the beginning of effectively monetizing placement on the site. How do you plan to go to market? Like are we right to think that of all the new products, that's one that could contribute and scale and contribute to revenue fairly quickly? And then second, kind of higher level, can you just talk to how you see the potential entry of CoStar deeper into the residential side of the space impacting the ecosystem? And do you think this kind of fits in with the potential unbundling of buying sell-side commissions and the notion of just a national MLS? Can you just give us your sense of that and how Zillow would be positioned if the industry moves in that direction. Thanks.\nRich Barton: Okay. Thanks for the question, Lloyd. This is Rich. I think let's send the first one over to Jeremy and then maybe come back to me for the second one.\nJeremy Wacksman: Sure. Thanks, Lloyd. On listing, media services and listing showcase. As Rich said, we are excited that we just launched Listing Media Services after closing the acquisition of VRX Media, and that's solving a real problem for listing agents, which is helping them get high-quality media, photography, videos, our rich media experience, our interactive floor plans for their listings. And that really sets the groundwork for listing showcase, which is coming later this year. And listing showcase is really about helping a listing agent differentiate themselves and win more business, while also helping a seller really showcase their home because we know that super-immersive interactive listing is something buyers want and buyers crave and we'll spend more time with. So it's a little too early for us to talk about how it might land in the P&L, given we haven't even launched it yet, and we talking to you all about that in future quarters.\nRich Barton: Okay. And I'll jump on the second one and basically say, our formula has been our formula from the beginning, Lloyd, and that is focus on the mover consumer and what they want and engaging them and building audience around them and building really magic things for them. And that started all the way back when we launched this estimate Brazil. So we really truly believe that all goodness for us downstream in business model and partnerships, et cetera, flows from initially captivating and capturing the attention of the consumer. And that has worked really well for us as evidenced by a couple of hundred million unique users a month and 65% app share. I think Allen in his prepared remarks said that even though we're the leader, we outgrew the next 15 competitors according to comScore over the last several quarters. This comes from our focus on that consumer. And it also has led us to taking a big bet on the transaction and the super app vision that we have of addressing these consumer pain points and integrating the process and making it more seamless and may be more joyful and fewer tiers. And we like -- as you've heard, we really like where we are on that. I guess I'll say another thing in that is building great consumer products and brands is really hard. It requires kind of ninja-level skills on multiple dimensions, not the least of which is software engineering skills. And software engineering is in our DNA in this company. We -- many of us date back to finding Expedia at Microsoft. We were all -- many of us were Microsoft people and many of us engineers at Microsoft. And so we couldn't -- we can't shake that kind of engineering DNA that we have. So anyway, we like our position. I know that's a roundabout way answering it, but it does basically give us great comfort that no matter what comes to pass from a competitive perspective or from a regulatory perspective or even from this kind of DOJ lawsuits perspective, it is -- our position in power and confidence is derived from the fact that we have this great relationship with this giant audience and through by our trusted brand.\nLloyd Walmsley: Got it. Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks, Rich.\nRich Barton: Thanks Lloyd.\nOperator: Thank you. The following question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. You may proceed.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. A couple of questions, please. You talked about seeing early signs of stabilization in 2023. Any more color on what those are, and does your crystal ball tell you that things are troughing in this March quarter? And then secondly, this disclosure, this commentary about how your PA customers are more over-weighted to first-time homebuyers than the market as a whole. Is there any quantification of that? And just talk through a little bit about what the implication of that is? So I think what that means is that you've got a pretty good brand set up with younger buyers, millennials and people are just entering the home buying stages of their lives. And just so that's \u2013 so what from that. So just spend a little bit more time on what the -- if you can quantify it and what you think the so what of that is? Thanks a lot.\nRich Barton: Okay. Thanks Mark. Maybe I'll attack the e-com question of your first part, and then maybe pitch it over to Jeremy again for the second part, is that cool Jeremy? Okay, thumbs up on Zoom. And Brad, of course, jump in if I don't get the macro stuff, I'm not the Chief Economist and they report to you now. So you're probably in a better position to comment. I think the crystal ball is hard as you all know better than most and the crystal balls, no matter what you're trying to predict right now are particularly foggy and volatile still, given the stream of conflicting data that we're getting every day. And is the real estate market troughing? I certainly hope so, but we're certainly not counting on it. I said -- I did say mortgage rates have pulled back a bit, and you guys have seen that, but they are still pretty volatile. Other inputs into this equation look pretty good in terms of just buyer demand, and we do have some supply constraints, just look at our unique users and you can see people do want to move. So that is -- we see lots of decent buyer signal ready -- wanting and ready to buy. Maybe if you want, maybe offline, Brad can give you more data on the specifics of the macroeconomic buildup. But because the overall macro is just so cloudy, it's hard to make a call that this is the bottom and the things are just going to get better. It's just the overall macro is certainly going to affect the housing. As I said in the prepared remarks, we are confident that a much more natural and healthy mover rate is more like six million or more home transactions a year, which gave -- which led us to say 60 million transactions over the next 10 years is what we can count on. I guess, I'd finally make the point that it is not what the macro does or doesn't do that drives the growth for this company. However, it really is the fact that we have almost -- we have most all of the audience coming in using us and yet, we still have this measly low transaction share. And so the big lever is going to be driving our transaction share from 3% to 6%, and that's what's really going to move the needle for us. We have some good early signs. I love the pace and the quality of the product and service innovations that we're launching right now. It gives us good confidence to prudently invest through this kind of foggy choppy market. We've already been through it. You all have seen us go through this last year, and the year before, but last year with a lot of prudent \u2013 difficult and prudent decisions that we have made. So we kind of got an early jump on the stuff we're seeing across the tech economy right now. Anyway, long-winded way, we're not really calling a bottom because of the fogginess, but we do feel really good about our position. Okay, Wacks \u2013 Jeremy?\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. And I think you actually started on the second one, too, which is, we think about the share opportunity coming from really all types of buyers. And that first-time homebuyer mix is, I think, intended to give a bit of color on the stabilization off of some more extreme, but Allen painted in terms of where the market was with cash buyers. But our first home buyer mix is actually pretty consistent with the mortgage market overall. And as Rich said, our growth pillars and our growth strategies really are there not just for first-time homebuyers, but for all buyers, right, but all types of buyers need touring and be able to get into the home. They need to line up financing, repeat buyers need to sell their home into the seller services we offer and all of them need to get in the hands of a great agent if they don't have one already. So the growth pillars that we are working on we really think are what drive our share growth across all segments, both first-time homebuyers and repeat home buyers.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nAllen Parker: Yeah, maybe Rich, and Jeremy, I'll just add on the this, somewhat for Mark, in terms of our comments, we wanted to indicate that as first-time homebuyers normalized we were seeing a little bit of a tailwind. But that tailwind is more temporal than permanent, I think. And so we just wanted to call that out in transparency. And we believe that the things we're executing around the growth strategy, as Jeremy called out, are what's going to be driving our growth longer term.\nRich Barton: And in conclusion, before we go to the next question, most all of you on the call already know this, but Brad and Mary Allen have a really terrific team that does deep dive on forecasting the housing market, and we publish it. and offline connect with them, we can provide you with our economists' view of the housing market.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks, Rich. Thanks, Allen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with RBC. You may proceed.\nBrad Erickson: Hi. Thanks. This is Brad Erickson with RBC. Two questions, I guess, one for Jeremy, probably one for Allen. Just on the touring stuff you called out related to Atlanta and integration that you've rolled out there with the instant booking and all. It sounds like it's going at least as well as the old sort of legacy touring product. Maybe if you could just expand on sort of what the early successes are going on there? And what do you think is driving hopefully maybe a better experience in terms of conversion and what have you? And then second, for Allen, just a clarification. I think you said you're going to start reporting transactions at some point, not to like front run that disclosure, but maybe just how do you expect to sort of define that? Like is it all transactions you touch with PA conversions, or is it just transaction-oriented revenue streams, maybe just a little clarity there? And what are you looking for before you start from that? Thanks.\nAllen Parker: Yeah, Allen, why don't I start. So I'm touring a reminder for all of us on the call. Touring is so important to us because that a touring customer converts at three times the rate of customers that come in other ways on Zillow. And so it's a high intent customer, someone who, as Rich said, it's the point-of-sale. But even with the general touring experience, as you alluded to, there's a lot of friction in that process, right? You have to \u2013 your really requesting a tour, you and your buyer's agents have to coordinate with the seller's agent than the seller on the calendar. And what ends up happening is a minority of the time, the buyer actually gets to go, see the home when they wanted to when they initially make their request. So we have launched something called real-time touring, which is really intended to remove that friction, right, to make as Rich said, scheduling or going to see a home as easy as booking our restaurants online. And that is what's live in Atlanta, and we're now taking to the rest of our test markets. And the early signal that we're seeing there is really positive from partner feedback as well as customer feedback and in our data. We are seeing higher connection rates and higher likelihood of the customer working with that agent. And so those are great leading indicators for us of transaction conversion. It's obviously very early to see actual transaction data in one market on a lag basis. But those early indicators are what give us confidence and that plus the partner and customer feedback is why we expanded it across all of Atlanta and are now taking it to the rest of our test markets.\nRich Barton: Great. Thanks, Jeremy. And Brad, I'll try to clarify for your question. So I think in my prepared remarks, I talked about we're going to share our transaction share data -- and so this is really just to provide where we are in terms of our share performance. So if you think back to the targets we provided, we went through the transactions or the size, the total transaction is the number of sites and what percentage we participated in either on the buy side, the sell side or through mortgage. And so you can kind of think about this as share percentage share data is what we would plan to share. And we would think of share on sell side, buy side, participate in mortgage for a transaction. If we had a mortgage and a buy side transaction integrated, that would just be one transaction, not two. And so we're -- due to the latency of records, we won't be prepared to share that until later in the future, but we believe at least on an annual basis, we want to share our progress on that 3% to 6%.\nBrad Erickson: Got it. That\u2019s great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan McKeveny with Zelman & Associates. You may proceed.\nRyan McKeveny: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I appreciate the detail on the two ways of connecting with home loans with the financing first or property first approaches. I guess I'm curious if there's anything you could share on how your current origination volume skews between those two approaches? And then maybe specifically on the on the Raleigh example with mortgage adoption going from 15% to 20%. Is that an improvement there because there's more traction with the PA partners sending customers back through that property first approach, or maybe just generally, you could elaborate on kind of the drivers of the mortgage adoption in Raleigh? Thank you.\nRich Barton: Thanks, Ryan. Jeremy, maybe you -- we have a few things that we're sharing here about this. Maybe you want to take a stab on them?\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. Yes. I mean I don't think we're giving a mix out on the types of property versus finance first. That's something that they're both small, and we're trying a bunch of programs and we expect them to change over time. So I think giving any sort of guidance or color on where we expect that to end up.\nRich Barton: Although, we did say in my prepared remarks, if you go to the very top of the funnel Ryan that 40% of people enter their home shopping processing via financial first that\u2019s not be confused with your question exactly whether that gives you some indication of the overall volume. It\u2019s a pretty big number, 60% the normal way. But there you go.\nAllen Parker: Yeah, that's where I was headed. So I don\u2019t want you to confuse transaction volume with customer interest, but that's a pretty good proxy for how we think about the customer and why we're investing in both is that, we know those are the two main questions a customer has, they either want to go see a home 40% to 60% of the time, or they want to ask to find in question, depending on the situation. And so that's why we're investing in both. So stay tuned on how those things ultimately scale over time at the bottom of the funnel. And then on the adoption gains in Raleigh, that is just -- it's a function of being in the market a little longer. There's a big piece that's agent and partner training and adoption. There's a big piece that's customer experience. As Rich said, we're continuing to build and innovate the product itself while we're rolling it out and trying it, that's why we're calling these test markets because these are V1 and the V2 experiences that we improve. So we're excited about the early signal and the tick up in that adoption, which is why we are bringing that program to more of our test markets. But it is still early, and we are still, in many ways, trying these things for the first time.\nRyan McKeveny: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Thank you for the answer there. Another high-level one on the ShowingTime+. So as you bring that offering together, I assume there's some overlap with customers, of course, that are also Premier Agents. But I also assume the opportunity set of potential agent customers is much wider than only PAs. So I know aspects like listing showcase are still yet to come, but I'm curious, just big picture, if you can talk about how you think of the addressable market opportunity for ShowingTime+? And ultimately, is that something that proves to be more transaction based over time, or could that be a channel that's more of a maybe subscription or recurring revenue type of business that flows into things? Thank you very much.\nAllen Parker: Yes. Rich, why don't I start? And anything you want to add. I mean, I\u2019m going to sound like a broken record on early, but it's early. We just launched listing these services, and we haven't even launched listing showcase yet. So in terms of how we might price and package the product, I would say stay tuned on the specific mechanics, but more broadly on your question, we absolutely think about ShowingTime+ as a much broader TAM of agents. And we've talked about that, I think, before, where if we can help the industry acquire, operate and convert listings more effectively any agent, whether that agent is choosing to work with our shared Zillow customer, that benefit Zillow, that benefits everyone who uses that in that set of industry software tools. So that's really the strategy behind ShowingTime+, and why so many -- so much of what we offer in showing ShowingTime+ today is really about all segments of agents, whether they have one listing, whether they have a team that has many listings or a few buyers or many. So that is the strategy has helped all agents be more effective and productive. And of course, that benefits the Zillow brands customers and the Premier Agents that work with those Zillow brand customers.\nRich Barton: Yeah. I don't know how much I have to add, but just to be -- to give some examples there, Ryan, just so that everybody that we have ShowingTime, which is scheduling tours. We have DotLoop, which is trafficking documents for closing and signatures. We have RMX, Rich Media Experiences, which is a lot of the \u2013 of the backbone of the cool stuff that's going in to the listing showcase product. We have all of these that we are slowly but surely assembling into a package of, you could think of it as a software platform that increasingly more and more with a more and more feature-rich set of features, the industry is adopting and we hope we'll adopt. And we \u2013 we believe there is a really big, long-term business opportunity for us there. It's early -- very early days, but that is an interesting kind of way down the road next potential growth business for us in an industry that has not had a lot of the massive R&D investment in the residential real estate industry has not been huge for lots of reasons. And we see a real business opportunity there on a stand-alone basis as well.\nRyan McKeveny: Very helpful. Thank you, Rich.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Colantuoni with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nJohn Colantuoni: Thanks for taking my question. So Rich, the teams rolled out sort of a blend of new products across test markets. If you look out, if you sort of step back and look out five years, can you just sort of talk about the role you envision Zillow playing across the housing market ecosystem? And related to that, do you see Zillow offering sort of the full suite of products across every market, or do you envision taking sort of a more tailored approach that keeps the product offerings to what's most appropriate to each market? And second on guidance. The first quarter guidance for Premier Agent implies sort of the third quarter in a row of outperformance compared to the underlying housing market. Can you just walk through some of the drivers of this outperformance and how you're thinking about levers to drive continued outperformance for the remainder of the year? Thanks. \nRich Barton: Thanks for the question, John. Maybe we'll start with the second part, Allen. And then we can \u2013 if we have time, we'll do another, but maybe land the plane on the first question.\nAllen Parker: Sure. Thanks for the question, John. Our PA relative revenue performance in Q3, Q4 and as you mentioned, implied in our Q1 outlook. I'd say it's reflective of 3 elements. Our focus on the customer search experience, we talked about the mix of first-time homebuyers normalizing and continued efforts to work with better partners. And in Q4, this showed up as PA revenue growth down 20% year-over-year as compared to industry down 31% and according to the data from NAR. So our focus on customer engagement is to drive higher-intent customers to higher-performing Premier Agent partners. And we've seen consumers tend to flock towards the industry-leading brands during some uncertain times. So at the top of the funnel, we've been really pleased with the engagement and traffic we continue to get, and we continue to invest in improving our customer search experience. And we're seeing that show up as brand preference, which we believe is very important. As a result, as we called out, traffic growth for us outperformed the next top 15 real estate sites combined over the last several months for comScore. Deeper in the funnel, I won't spend too much time on it was the normalization of mix first-time high homebuyers. We talked about that. And then lastly, was this focus also on improving customer engagement by working with better partners. And we're continuing to test consolidating our partner base, we believe working with the best partners has been extremely supportive of conversions even in this tough macro environment. And this combination of high-intent customers from the top of the funnel to working with higher-quality agents has resulted in higher work with rates for us over the last few quarters, which we're seeing as a positive. Kind of with respect to going forward, we'll continue to focus on these things. I did want to call out that our current performance is not yet reflective of the investments in our growth strategies. They're still in test, they're relatively small. So we're going to continue to focus on growing our share from 3% to 6% as we test, iterate, launch and then scale these offerings and these strategies. And over time, we'd expect to see share gaining growth over this, but it won't be linear from here to there. So hopefully, that helps provide a little color.\nRich Barton: And that's a good -- it's a good segue, Allen, thanks in the answer to John's first question, which is the 3% to 6% will provide a lot of a good growth profile for the company. But it would still only be 6% transaction share, which, to me, seems modest, especially given the length of the shadow that we cast here, the size of the audience that we have here. We do -- more specifically on the question, we do believe that mover customers really want this magic application that integrates all of these disparate pieces of the move, all of these difficult and coordinated things that people have to track and do in order to move. And it seems very logical to us that we ought to be able to bring that all into a single application experience where we plug partners and services into that app in order to make that move much, much easier and more efficient and more enjoyable. Exactly what form that will take by each local market in terms of the configuration of the types of partners we choose, where we have partners versus where we do it ourselves. I think it's too early to tell, but we are really focused on building out what I would call a reference platform of sorts in these test markets to get it working so that we can prepare to really scale it out nationwide. So stay tuned. We like the pace and the quality of the products and the services that we're shipping. It feels like we're building momentum. The company is in a terrific balance sheet position for investment and has good medium-term and long-term growth prospects. So we're feeling good about our position, despite the fact -- but I guess I'll end with despite the fact that macro and housing market are pretty foggy and pretty choppy right now. So we do have or Allen at least has his hands on the cost levers and our hands on the wheel. So we'll be prudent. All right. Thank you all for tuning in today. We really thank you for coming along on this journey with us, and we look forward to reporting our progress to you next quarter. All right. Have a nice evening.\nOperator: This concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rich Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you dialing in to hear about our fourth quarter and full year results and our excitement about the progress we're making on our growth strategy. 2022 was an extraordinarily difficult and transformative year for Zillow, one that I believe the team navigated courageously. In late 2021, after living through unprecedented volatility in the housing market, we made the hard decision to make a rapid and orderly exit from our iBuying operation, judging it too risky for Zillow given the breadth and profitability of our hard earned core business and our category leadership. We began 2022 with 10,000 homes on our balance sheet and ended the year with zero. Unfortunately, this also necessitated a workforce reduction of approximately 2,000 valued employees. When we spoke to you this time last year, we unveiled a new growth strategy oriented around driving our customer transaction share from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025 with a focus on increasing engagement, increasing customer transactions and increasing revenue per transaction. As we quickly shed our iBuying inventory and embarked on our new journey more nimbly, the unprecedented housing macro volatility continued this time to the downside, the scenario we had feared could happen. 30-year mortgage interest rates nearly doubled over the course of the first six months of 2022, meaningfully slowing turnover and home price appreciation in the housing market. Despite these significant changes for our company and the housing market at large, our team remains focused on innovation with our eyes forward. We are working on building solutions and delivering products for our customers, our agent partners and the industry that make it easier for people to transact in real estate and ultimately transact with Zillow. We're rapidly releasing products and improving both the customer and agent experience to ensure that when customers come to Zillow, they choose to stay and explore our other offerings. We released products at a rapid pace and service to our integrated transaction strategy, including the launch of natural language search, listing media services through Showing Time Plus, our partnership with Opendoor and real-time touring among many other product releases. The result of these efforts have put the company on solid ground heading into 2023. Our traffic and brand are extremely strong with average monthly unique users of 198 million during Q4, and roughly 65% of mobile app users for the real estate marketplaces category. Additionally, 2022 was a year where Zillow regained its spot as the number one most visited rentals platform according to comScore, putting us in a great position for future growth. Despite a challenging operating environment in 2022, when we attempted to normalize for COVID volatility, we have a go-forward business that has grown consolidated revenue by 12% on an annualized basis since 2019, and while our IMT segment grew EBITDA by 30% on an annualized basis over that same time frame. Equally important, we exited 2022 with a solid balance sheet of $3.4 billion in cash and investments, up more than $200 million versus a year ago, even after executing $947 million worth of share repurchases at a weighted average price of $42.63 throughout the year. Most importantly, we exit 2022 with our employee base in a far more stable place than where we started the year. Just under three years ago, we took advantage of our position as a primarily digital business with a heavy mix of engineering and product talent and committed to location flexibility permanently. That decision brought us more stability during the pandemic, and we continue to feel very good in our position as a cloud headquartered company which we define as having the flexibility of choosing where to live with the understanding that many jobs require periodic on-site gatherings, inter and intra team. We've been able to dramatically broaden our candidate pool and attract top talent from all over the country. Voluntary attrition declined steadily across the organization in 2022, down more than half in Q4 compared to Q1 and our workforce is more dispersed, more diverse and more engaged with 93% of our employees saying they clearly understand how their work is contributing to our mission. Further, our data shows that we're attracting talent at a much greater rate than before the pandemic four times more applicants per job posting versus 2019. Last and most important, we are seeing increases in productivity in critical areas of our business. Our Premier Agent sales team is more productive today than it was before the pandemic. Again, our software development and product teams are creating services faster today as well. So that was a little back in reflection on 2022. What about 2023? We are focused on our vision of building a housing super app, a single digital experience to help customers across all their real estate needs. Our goal is to increase engagement, increased customer transactions and increased revenue per transaction by investing across five growth pillars: touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services. The expected output of this strategy is to grow our share of consumer transactions from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025. Critical to achieving our aspirations is building an integrated experience for customers and partners. We spent much of last year creating products and services across our five growth pillars and introducing them into our test markets as they became available. In 2023, we are ready to take the best of our learnings and roll them out market-by-market together across Raleigh, Denver, Atlanta and Phoenix in service of an integrated experience. With that as a backdrop, our first product road map update is touring. You've heard from us many times now that touring is a critical piece of the moving experience. It's the point-of-sale, where shoppers turn into transactors. And we know from all the data we see on a daily basis across our entire business that movers who request a tour convert to transactors at three times the rate of other actions on Zillow. Further, we believe improving the touring process is integral to building the seamless connected experience we envision. In late 2022, we rolled out real-time touring in Atlanta. Real-time touring is designed to make booking a home tour as easy as making a restaurant reservation online, a convenience that modern on-demand consumers certainly expect. We're excited about the early signs coming out of Atlanta, which show real-time touring enables higher connection rates and higher customer propensity to work with our Premier Agent partners, which we expect to drive benefits up and down the funnel, delivering high-intent customers to our partners. As a result of the early data we are seeing, we expanded this offering across Atlanta and are rolling out the product to our other three test markets. Of course, we have our eye on integration as well. Alongside the product improvements we are making every day to real-time touring, we've made it much easier for agents to transfer customers who are interested in financing to Zillow Home Loans loan officers as part of the touring experience. In Harmony, with state-of-the-art digital products and services, enhancing our partner network is critical to bringing our housing super app vision to live, which will be the focus of my second update. For years, we have driven increased lead volumes to our high-performing partner agents. We have done this in a variety of ways with an eye towards those who treat our customers best, who convert leads into transactions best and those that are excited about growing their businesses alongside us. We have taken our most aggressive steps in enhancing the network by meaningfully consolidating our partner network across all four test markets. We increasingly believe that a tighter set of partners allows us to deliver a better customer experience and allows us to test new products and services rapidly along the way in service of integration. One early success we've seen has come in Raleigh, North Carolina. Last quarter, we told you that in Raleigh, we were seeing approximately 15% customer adoption of Zillow Home Loans. We are happy to report that we are now seeing closer to 20% adoption just three months later. Based on our early successes in Raleigh, we have expanded our Zillow Home Loans adoption playbook to the rest of our test markets. Speaking of Zillow Home Loans, our next product road map update is on financing. We said many times before that we believe financing is crucial to the buyer's experience and merging financing at strategic points in the buyer's journey is critical to the end-to-end customer experience we envision. So in 2022, we turned our efforts towards building the foundation for a substantial direct-to-consumer purchase mortgage origination business. Last quarter, we spoke about the critical work streams we've deployed to bolster our mortgage business. In 2023, we have four key areas of focus. First, we are simplifying the entry points into our funnel and are building overall awareness of Zillow Home Loans. Second, we are building a better digital mortgage experience on Zillow to meet customers where they are in their buying journey. As a reminder, even with relatively low awareness for Zillow Home Loans, millions of customers on Zillow raised their hands for financing help last year, a testament to our brand and audience scale. Our focus is on improving our processes to better identify high intent customers and creating easy-to-use digital tools on our apps and sites to help our customers be ready-to-buy well before they tour homes. Third, we are bolstering our loan officer tools and capabilities so they can effectively handle our volume while providing a best-in-class customer experience. And finally, we're working closely with our Premier Agent partner base to build integrated processes with Zillow Home Loans, which I touched on a moment ago. As a reminder, we are building out two primary ways for customers to connect with Zillow Home Loans. The first way is financing first. It is when a customer starts their moving journey with financing to get pre-qualified before they are connected to an agent. We're investing here because we know approximately 40% of all homebuyers start their journey this way and roughly 80% of our prospective mortgage customers don't have a real estate agent. For many customers, financing is the most opaque and intimidating part of the home buying journey, and we want to help make it easier and more transparent on Zillow. We also know how valuable it is for our Premier Agent partners to be connected with the customer who already knows what they can afford. After many, many product changes last year, we are beginning to test connecting pre-qualified customers with Premier Agent partners in multiple markets, including all four test markets. The second way is property first. This is when our Zillow Home Loans lead comes back to us from a Premier Agent partner who was working with a home shopping customer we had previously sent them. Beyond the integration point with real-time touring we discussed earlier, we have integrated Zillow Home Loans into all existing connection processes across our four test markets. Encouragingly, we are already seeing nearly one in five Premier Agent partners sending connections to Zillow Home Loans in these markets and some agents outside of those markets are also proactively choosing to connect customers with us. From our perspective, the inherent value in integrated services has made our partners supportive of these efforts, and we are pleased with the early results. In addition to the investments we're making in improving the buying experience, we're also delivering solutions for sellers and their listing agents, and we have some exciting product roadmap updates this quarter. Enabled by the small acquisition of VRX Media earlier this month, we launched listing Media Services through ShowingTime+, a photography service and comprehensive media package that enables listing agents to seamlessly deliver beautiful, immersive media for the homes they are selling. This service is a critical precursor to our upcoming listing showcase product, which we previewed last quarter. As a reminder, this product will differentiate a listing agent on Zillow through branding and a higher-quality listing that looks unlike anything else that exists on real estate sites today. Our aim with both of these products is to serve more sellers and allow listing agents to win more business. We will be rolling out listing showcase over the summer. We continue to be excited about the work that is happening here. We're also pleased to announce that our partnership with Opendoor is live in Atlanta and Raleigh. Customers who start their selling journey with Zillow can now request a cash offer from Opendoor and simultaneously receive an estimate of their open market home sale price with a local Premier Agent partner. All customers will work with one of Zillow's licensed advisers to determine the best path based on their needs so they can confidently sell their home and get into their next one, whether that's potentially maximizing sale price on the open market with the real estate agent, or being assured of a speedy sale with Opendoor. Regardless of the path, the customer chooses, they will be able to use the service as a stand-alone offering or package it with other Zillow services such as financing through Zillow home loans, working with the premiere agent partner to buy their next home or when it's available, closing with Zillow closing services. This new product experience will launch in additional markets nationwide over the course of 2023. Clearly, we have a lot of work ahead on our product road map. And of course, we are very conscious of the housing market environment while we invest for the future. Housing affordability challenges were of 2022 and remain front and center as we begin 2023. Affordability does impact demand. It also impacts supply. For homeowners, it's simply more expensive to move than to stay put right now, leaving more wood be movers on the sidelines. It's going to take time for these market dynamics to normalize. But as we head into 2023, we are seeing some early signs of stabilization, albeit at a meaningfully subdued level. Mortgage rates have come off their highs Home prices have continued to decelerate from their peak last June, and there is a looming backlog of homes under construction, both for sale homes and rentals, which is likely to give some help on affordability. However, we are not out of the woods yet given high uncertainty in the path of the macro economy and how it may affect the real estate industry. Things continue to be foggy and we can't control what the housing market does. What we can control is how we operate our business. Similar to many times in our history, including 2022, we are closely monitoring the situation and will be prudent in how we invest through this period. As we look back on the last 12 months, it is clear we were simultaneously navigating the past and organizing for the future. Now, however, we are eyes forward and focused. 2023 is a consequential year for us, and it is all about making progress on our initiatives through product launches and market rollouts so that we can further expand and scale into 2024. We see the same headlines you all see about tech companies cutting back their workforces to make up for staffing to unsustainable pandemic level growth that is now normalizing. Our story is different. After a year of significant people-related and other expense reductions in 2022, we are now investing during a very difficult housing market while others retrench as we see real opportunity for growth. We expect that 60 million homes will trade hands over the next 10 years, which reflects a much more natural and healthy mover rate. And given all the product and service innovation opportunities we have discussed, our aim is to be an increasing and meaningful share of those customer transactions. This will drive value for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders. We will continue to share our progress and learnings along the way, and we appreciate your partnership with us on this journey. I will now hand the line over to Allen. Allen? Okay. Thanks for the question, Lloyd. This is Rich. I think let's send the first one over to Jeremy and then maybe come back to me for the second one. Okay. And I'll jump on the second one and basically say, our formula has been our formula from the beginning, Lloyd, and that is focus on the mover consumer and what they want and engaging them and building audience around them and building really magic things for them. And that started all the way back when we launched this estimate Brazil. So we really truly believe that all goodness for us downstream in business model and partnerships, et cetera, flows from initially captivating and capturing the attention of the consumer. And that has worked really well for us as evidenced by a couple of hundred million unique users a month and 65% app share. I think Allen in his prepared remarks said that even though we're the leader, we outgrew the next 15 competitors according to comScore over the last several quarters. This comes from our focus on that consumer. And it also has led us to taking a big bet on the transaction and the super app vision that we have of addressing these consumer pain points and integrating the process and making it more seamless and may be more joyful and fewer tiers. And we like -- as you've heard, we really like where we are on that. I guess I'll say another thing in that is building great consumer products and brands is really hard. It requires kind of ninja-level skills on multiple dimensions, not the least of which is software engineering skills. And software engineering is in our DNA in this company. We -- many of us date back to finding Expedia at Microsoft. We were all -- many of us were Microsoft people and many of us engineers at Microsoft. And so we couldn't -- we can't shake that kind of engineering DNA that we have. So anyway, we like our position. I know that's a roundabout way answering it, but it does basically give us great comfort that no matter what comes to pass from a competitive perspective or from a regulatory perspective or even from this kind of DOJ lawsuits perspective, it is -- our position in power and confidence is derived from the fact that we have this great relationship with this giant audience and through by our trusted brand. Thanks Lloyd. Okay. Thanks Mark. Maybe I'll attack the e-com question of your first part, and then maybe pitch it over to Jeremy again for the second part, is that cool Jeremy? Okay, thumbs up on Zoom. And Brad, of course, jump in if I don't get the macro stuff, I'm not the Chief Economist and they report to you now. So you're probably in a better position to comment. I think the crystal ball is hard as you all know better than most and the crystal balls, no matter what you're trying to predict right now are particularly foggy and volatile still, given the stream of conflicting data that we're getting every day. And is the real estate market troughing? I certainly hope so, but we're certainly not counting on it. I said -- I did say mortgage rates have pulled back a bit, and you guys have seen that, but they are still pretty volatile. Other inputs into this equation look pretty good in terms of just buyer demand, and we do have some supply constraints, just look at our unique users and you can see people do want to move. So that is -- we see lots of decent buyer signal ready -- wanting and ready to buy. Maybe if you want, maybe offline, Brad can give you more data on the specifics of the macroeconomic buildup. But because the overall macro is just so cloudy, it's hard to make a call that this is the bottom and the things are just going to get better. It's just the overall macro is certainly going to affect the housing. As I said in the prepared remarks, we are confident that a much more natural and healthy mover rate is more like six million or more home transactions a year, which gave -- which led us to say 60 million transactions over the next 10 years is what we can count on. I guess, I'd finally make the point that it is not what the macro does or doesn't do that drives the growth for this company. However, it really is the fact that we have almost -- we have most all of the audience coming in using us and yet, we still have this measly low transaction share. And so the big lever is going to be driving our transaction share from 3% to 6%, and that's what's really going to move the needle for us. We have some good early signs. I love the pace and the quality of the product and service innovations that we're launching right now. It gives us good confidence to prudently invest through this kind of foggy choppy market. We've already been through it. You all have seen us go through this last year, and the year before, but last year with a lot of prudent \u2013 difficult and prudent decisions that we have made. So we kind of got an early jump on the stuff we're seeing across the tech economy right now. Anyway, long-winded way, we're not really calling a bottom because of the fogginess, but we do feel really good about our position. Okay, Wacks \u2013 Jeremy? And in conclusion, before we go to the next question, most all of you on the call already know this, but Brad and Mary Allen have a really terrific team that does deep dive on forecasting the housing market, and we publish it. and offline connect with them, we can provide you with our economists' view of the housing market. Great. Thanks, Jeremy. And Brad, I'll try to clarify for your question. So I think in my prepared remarks, I talked about we're going to share our transaction share data -- and so this is really just to provide where we are in terms of our share performance. So if you think back to the targets we provided, we went through the transactions or the size, the total transaction is the number of sites and what percentage we participated in either on the buy side, the sell side or through mortgage. And so you can kind of think about this as share percentage share data is what we would plan to share. And we would think of share on sell side, buy side, participate in mortgage for a transaction. If we had a mortgage and a buy side transaction integrated, that would just be one transaction, not two. And so we're -- due to the latency of records, we won't be prepared to share that until later in the future, but we believe at least on an annual basis, we want to share our progress on that 3% to 6%. Thanks, Ryan. Jeremy, maybe you -- we have a few things that we're sharing here about this. Maybe you want to take a stab on them? Although, we did say in my prepared remarks, if you go to the very top of the funnel Ryan that 40% of people enter their home shopping processing via financial first that's not be confused with your question exactly whether that gives you some indication of the overall volume. It's a pretty big number, 60% the normal way. But there you go. Yeah. I don't know how much I have to add, but just to be -- to give some examples there, Ryan, just so that everybody that we have ShowingTime, which is scheduling tours. We have DotLoop, which is trafficking documents for closing and signatures. We have RMX, Rich Media Experiences, which is a lot of the \u2013 of the backbone of the cool stuff that's going in to the listing showcase product. We have all of these that we are slowly but surely assembling into a package of, you could think of it as a software platform that increasingly more and more with a more and more feature-rich set of features, the industry is adopting and we hope we'll adopt. And we \u2013 we believe there is a really big, long-term business opportunity for us there. It's early -- very early days, but that is an interesting kind of way down the road next potential growth business for us in an industry that has not had a lot of the massive R&D investment in the residential real estate industry has not been huge for lots of reasons. And we see a real business opportunity there on a stand-alone basis as well. Thanks for the question, John. Maybe we'll start with the second part, Allen. And then we can \u2013 if we have time, we'll do another, but maybe land the plane on the first question. And that's a good -- it's a good segue, Allen, thanks in the answer to John's first question, which is the 3% to 6% will provide a lot of a good growth profile for the company. But it would still only be 6% transaction share, which, to me, seems modest, especially given the length of the shadow that we cast here, the size of the audience that we have here. We do -- more specifically on the question, we do believe that mover customers really want this magic application that integrates all of these disparate pieces of the move, all of these difficult and coordinated things that people have to track and do in order to move. And it seems very logical to us that we ought to be able to bring that all into a single application experience where we plug partners and services into that app in order to make that move much, much easier and more efficient and more enjoyable. Exactly what form that will take by each local market in terms of the configuration of the types of partners we choose, where we have partners versus where we do it ourselves. I think it's too early to tell, but we are really focused on building out what I would call a reference platform of sorts in these test markets to get it working so that we can prepare to really scale it out nationwide. So stay tuned. We like the pace and the quality of the products and the services that we're shipping. It feels like we're building momentum. The company is in a terrific balance sheet position for investment and has good medium-term and long-term growth prospects. So we're feeling good about our position, despite the fact -- but I guess I'll end with despite the fact that macro and housing market are pretty foggy and pretty choppy right now. So we do have or Allen at least has his hands on the cost levers and our hands on the wheel. So we'll be prudent. All right. Thank you all for tuning in today. We really thank you for coming along on this journey with us, and we look forward to reporting our progress to you next quarter. All right. Have a nice evening."

            "name": "Allen Parker",
            "content": "Thanks, Rich. In Q4, we delivered consolidated results above our outlook for both revenue and EBITDA. IMT segment revenue was $417 million, down 14% year-over-year, above the high end of our outlook range, driven primarily by better-than-expected performance in Premier Agent. Premier Agent revenue outperformed both our expectations and the industry decline of 31%, decreasing 20% year-over-year. A significant contributor to the Premier Agent outperformance was improvement in the mix of first-time homebuyers during the second half of the year, trending back towards historical norms. Given our Premier Agent customers are overweighted to first-time homebuyers versus the overall industry, we believe this was a tailwind in the second half of the year compared to the headwind we faced in the first half of 2022, when cash buyers were winning a higher mix of homes in the hypercompetitive market. We plan to provide full year 2022 customer transaction share data in a future quarter as lagged county property records become available. We believe our Q4 Premier Agent revenue results also demonstrate the benefit of our continued focus and years of investments in our brand, customer experience and partner network, all things that we can control. We continually iterate and optimize our apps and sites on behalf of our customers and partners, and that became even more of a focus as teams have been freed up from iBuying. While each of the new features may seem small individually, over time, they add up and differentiate us. Our relative traffic growth has outperformed the next top 15 real estate sites combined as defined by comScore over the last several months. This has contributed to our overall relative outperformance in revenue when compared to the industry. Additionally, over the years, we have worked to refine our partner base by growing and rewarding high-performing agent partners. Rentals revenue was up 13% year-over-year as rentals traffic on Zillow grew 20% year-over-year to 26 million average monthly unique users in Q4 for comScore. Our industry-leading rentals traffic help us grow the number of multifamily properties on our platform despite an industry-wide decline in multifamily apartment renter searches and move rates. We believe macroeconomic factors, including both rental affordability and for-sale affordability challenges have pressured move rates and renter searches. This is partially offset by occupancy rates, which have continued to drift lower from historically high levels and continue to be a tailwind to the rental industry demand for advertising. IMT segment EBITDA was $113 million for Q4 or 27% of revenue, exceeding the high end of our outlook range of $100 million and 25% of revenue. The outperformance was primarily driven by better-than-expected Premier Agent revenue. Mortgages segment revenue of $18 million was near the midpoint of our outlook range as we continue to make progress building our Zillow Home Loans purchased mortgage business. Mortgages segment EBITDA was a loss of $32 million, near the high end of our outlook, as we continue to invest in building a better consumer-facing origination experience, efficient and scalable internal loan officer tools and back-end systems and integration with our Premier Agent business. We believe these investments lay the foundation for Zillow Home Loans to serve a much broader set of customers, many of whom we currently send to third-party lenders today. We expect financing will be a key driver behind growing our share of customer transactions and revenue per customer transaction. Total select operating expenses and cost of revenue, excluding share based compensation and depreciation and amortization were $362 million in Q4, up from $353 million in Q3. Consistent with our expectations implied in our outlook for the quarter. As we discussed on our Q3 earnings call, we are maintaining our planned investments in our key growth initiatives, partly offset by reductions from letting go a set of employees in October as well as other discretionary and non-people-related cost actions. We ended Q4 with $3.4 billion of cash and investments, down slightly from $3.5 billion in Q3, which includes the benefit from operating cash flow as well as the impact of $174 million in share repurchases during Q4 at an average price of $35 a share. We repurchased a total of 22 million shares for $947 million in 2022, which translates to an average share price of approximately $43 per share. Although the macro backdrop has been choppy, we continue to focus on the inputs we can control, adding value to our customers and shipping great products while prudently managing costs. We feel good about the progress we are making across our growth pillars and believe investing against our targets while managing costs is the right thing to do across this business cycle to drive share growth. Our relative brand strength at the top of the funnel, along with our balance sheet and focused growth strategy, enable us to continue to invest prudently. To align with our growth strategy and to better reflect the integrated platform of digitized solutions we are building, beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we plan to report our financial results as a single reportable segment. Within this framework, we plan to report revenue categories of residential, rentals, mortgages and other. These revenue categories are consistent with how we measure success against their respective industry total addressable markets. The new residential revenue category will primarily include revenue for Premier Agent and new construction marketplaces as well as StreetEasy for sale product offerings, Zillow Closing Services and ShowingTime+. Our rentals and mortgages revenue categories will remain consistent with historical presentation and other revenue will primarily include revenue generated from display advertising. Our cost will be reported in one consolidated segment, and we will report a single consolidated EBITDA, consistent with how we are operating the business. Silos have been broken down across lines of business teams to integrate towards providing customers and our partners' end-to-end solutions. Operations and investments across the business are intended to optimize consolidated revenue and consolidated EBITDA. We have provided a downloadable Excel version of select historical revenue data under this new presentation on our website within the supplemental financial tables and our interactive analyst center to help with modeling. These changes have no impact on historical consolidated total revenue or consolidated EBITDA. Turning to our outlook. Going forward, we are aligning our guidance with our new reporting structure and plan to provide outlook for residential revenue, total revenue and consolidated EBITDA, to help you transition to our new revenue categories, we also plan to provide Premier Agent revenue growth rates, and revenue growth rate outlook as we report over the next four quarters. For Q1, we expect total revenue to be $404 million to $437 million, implying a year-over-year decline of 22% at the midpoint of our outlook range. We expect residential revenue to be in the range of $313 million to $338 million. For Premier Agent, we estimate revenues will decline in the range of 23% to 28% year-over-year as compared to our estimate for an industry transaction dollar decline between 25% and 35% year-over-year in Q1. We expect consolidated EBITDA to be in the range of $48 million to $63 million, implying a 13% margin at the midpoint of our outlook rates. We continue to balance investments for future growth while managing discretionary costs during this challenging and uncertain macro environment. We have a high incremental margin business that should see leverage when the environment improves, which we demonstrated in both Q3 and Q4. Our Q1 EBITDA outlook assumes that from Q4 to Q1, we expect a modest increase in total operating expenses and cost of revenue. We expect this to be primarily driven by investments to support our recent acquisition of VRX Media and our new ShowingTime+ products. Our recent VRX Media acquisition has enabled us to accelerate our distribution plans for listing media services. In closing, entering 2023, we remain in a strong position to invest against our strategy to better serve more customers to drive customer transaction share and more revenue per customer transaction. As we look forward, our priorities remain focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners, and we plan to grow our customer engagement through a compelling dream and shop experience, deliver a more integrated customer transactional experience to drive customers to choose to transact with us and our partners, invest in sustainable top line growth opportunities across the company, including new integrated services that are more scalable, less subject to earnings volatility and more capital efficient and manage our cost structure and improve productivity, including continued prioritization of our investments that we expect will drive a profitable, scalable and positive cash flow company. And with that operator, we'll open the line for questions. Yeah, maybe Rich, and Jeremy, I'll just add on the this, somewhat for Mark, in terms of our comments, we wanted to indicate that as first-time homebuyers normalized we were seeing a little bit of a tailwind. But that tailwind is more temporal than permanent, I think. And so we just wanted to call that out in transparency. And we believe that the things we're executing around the growth strategy, as Jeremy called out, are what's going to be driving our growth longer term. Yeah, Allen, why don't I start. So I'm touring a reminder for all of us on the call. Touring is so important to us because that a touring customer converts at three times the rate of customers that come in other ways on Zillow. And so it's a high intent customer, someone who, as Rich said, it's the point-of-sale. But even with the general touring experience, as you alluded to, there's a lot of friction in that process, right? You have to \u2013 your really requesting a tour, you and your buyer's agents have to coordinate with the seller's agent than the seller on the calendar. And what ends up happening is a minority of the time, the buyer actually gets to go, see the home when they wanted to when they initially make their request. So we have launched something called real-time touring, which is really intended to remove that friction, right, to make as Rich said, scheduling or going to see a home as easy as booking our restaurants online. And that is what's live in Atlanta, and we're now taking to the rest of our test markets. And the early signal that we're seeing there is really positive from partner feedback as well as customer feedback and in our data. We are seeing higher connection rates and higher likelihood of the customer working with that agent. And so those are great leading indicators for us of transaction conversion. It's obviously very early to see actual transaction data in one market on a lag basis. But those early indicators are what give us confidence and that plus the partner and customer feedback is why we expanded it across all of Atlanta and are now taking it to the rest of our test markets. Yeah, that's where I was headed. So I don't want you to confuse transaction volume with customer interest, but that's a pretty good proxy for how we think about the customer and why we're investing in both is that, we know those are the two main questions a customer has, they either want to go see a home 40% to 60% of the time, or they want to ask to find in question, depending on the situation. And so that's why we're investing in both. So stay tuned on how those things ultimately scale over time at the bottom of the funnel. And then on the adoption gains in Raleigh, that is just -- it's a function of being in the market a little longer. There's a big piece that's agent and partner training and adoption. There's a big piece that's customer experience. As Rich said, we're continuing to build and innovate the product itself while we're rolling it out and trying it, that's why we're calling these test markets because these are V1 and the V2 experiences that we improve. So we're excited about the early signal and the tick up in that adoption, which is why we are bringing that program to more of our test markets. But it is still early, and we are still, in many ways, trying these things for the first time. Yes. Rich, why don't I start? And anything you want to add. I mean, I'm going to sound like a broken record on early, but it's early. We just launched listing these services, and we haven't even launched listing showcase yet. So in terms of how we might price and package the product, I would say stay tuned on the specific mechanics, but more broadly on your question, we absolutely think about ShowingTime+ as a much broader TAM of agents. And we've talked about that, I think, before, where if we can help the industry acquire, operate and convert listings more effectively any agent, whether that agent is choosing to work with our shared Zillow customer, that benefit Zillow, that benefits everyone who uses that in that set of industry software tools. So that's really the strategy behind ShowingTime+, and why so many -- so much of what we offer in showing ShowingTime+ today is really about all segments of agents, whether they have one listing, whether they have a team that has many listings or a few buyers or many. So that is the strategy has helped all agents be more effective and productive. And of course, that benefits the Zillow brands customers and the Premier Agents that work with those Zillow brand customers. Sure. Thanks for the question, John. Our PA relative revenue performance in Q3, Q4 and as you mentioned, implied in our Q1 outlook. I'd say it's reflective of 3 elements. Our focus on the customer search experience, we talked about the mix of first-time homebuyers normalizing and continued efforts to work with better partners. And in Q4, this showed up as PA revenue growth down 20% year-over-year as compared to industry down 31% and according to the data from NAR. So our focus on customer engagement is to drive higher-intent customers to higher-performing Premier Agent partners. And we've seen consumers tend to flock towards the industry-leading brands during some uncertain times. So at the top of the funnel, we've been really pleased with the engagement and traffic we continue to get, and we continue to invest in improving our customer search experience. And we're seeing that show up as brand preference, which we believe is very important. As a result, as we called out, traffic growth for us outperformed the next top 15 real estate sites combined over the last several months for comScore. Deeper in the funnel, I won't spend too much time on it was the normalization of mix first-time high homebuyers. We talked about that. And then lastly, was this focus also on improving customer engagement by working with better partners. And we're continuing to test consolidating our partner base, we believe working with the best partners has been extremely supportive of conversions even in this tough macro environment. And this combination of high-intent customers from the top of the funnel to working with higher-quality agents has resulted in higher work with rates for us over the last few quarters, which we're seeing as a positive. Kind of with respect to going forward, we'll continue to focus on these things. I did want to call out that our current performance is not yet reflective of the investments in our growth strategies. They're still in test, they're relatively small. So we're going to continue to focus on growing our share from 3% to 6% as we test, iterate, launch and then scale these offerings and these strategies. And over time, we'd expect to see share gaining growth over this, but it won't be linear from here to there. So hopefully, that helps provide a little color."

            "name": "Jeremy Wacksman",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Lloyd. On listing, media services and listing showcase. As Rich said, we are excited that we just launched Listing Media Services after closing the acquisition of VRX Media, and that's solving a real problem for listing agents, which is helping them get high-quality media, photography, videos, our rich media experience, our interactive floor plans for their listings. And that really sets the groundwork for listing showcase, which is coming later this year. And listing showcase is really about helping a listing agent differentiate themselves and win more business, while also helping a seller really showcase their home because we know that super-immersive interactive listing is something buyers want and buyers crave and we'll spend more time with. So it's a little too early for us to talk about how it might land in the P&L, given we haven't even launched it yet, and we talking to you all about that in future quarters. Yes. And I think you actually started on the second one, too, which is, we think about the share opportunity coming from really all types of buyers. And that first-time homebuyer mix is, I think, intended to give a bit of color on the stabilization off of some more extreme, but Allen painted in terms of where the market was with cash buyers. But our first home buyer mix is actually pretty consistent with the mortgage market overall. And as Rich said, our growth pillars and our growth strategies really are there not just for first-time homebuyers, but for all buyers, right, but all types of buyers need touring and be able to get into the home. They need to line up financing, repeat buyers need to sell their home into the seller services we offer and all of them need to get in the hands of a great agent if they don't have one already. So the growth pillars that we are working on we really think are what drive our share growth across all segments, both first-time homebuyers and repeat home buyers. Yes. Yes. I mean I don't think we're giving a mix out on the types of property versus finance first. That's something that they're both small, and we're trying a bunch of programs and we expect them to change over time. So I think giving any sort of guidance or color on where we expect that to end up."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Berning, Vice President, Strategic Affairs and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nBrad Berning: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Zillow Group\u2019s third quarter 2022 conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Zillow Group\u2019s Co-Founder and CEO, Rich Barton; CFO, Allen Parker; COO, Jeremy Wacksman. During today\u2019s call, we will be making forward-looking statements about our future performance and operating plans and housing market based on current expectations and assumptions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and we encourage you to consider the risk factors described in our SEC filings for additional information. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events, except as required by law. This call is being broadcast on the Internet and is accessible on our Investor Relations website. Recording the call will be available later today. During the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, which we will refer to as EBITDA. We encourage you to read our shareholder letter and our earnings release, which can be found on our Investor Relations website, as they contain important information about our GAAP and non-GAAP results, including reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, please note that we will refer to our Internet, Media & Technology segment as our IMT segment. Beginning in Q3, the financial results of Zillow Offers have been presented as discontinued operations, and are therefore excluded from the discussion of the results of our continuing operations. We will now open the call with remarks followed by live Q&A. With that, I will now turn the call over to Rich.\nRich Barton: Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. A brief programming note before we get going. Allen and I will talk through results from the quarter like we normally do. And then, as Brad just mentioned, our COO, Jeremy Wacksman will join us for Q&A. As Chief Operating Officer, Jeremy is an integral part of delivering on our strategy and, therefore, an important resource for you all, especially with respect to the progress we're making against our growth pillars. I'm excited for you to have the chance to hear from him directly once again. Now to our results. We exceeded our guidance ranges for total revenue and EBITDA in the third quarter through a combination of better than expected revenue growth, coupled with active cost management. Of note, our IMT segment EBITDA for the quarter came in at $164 million, which was $43 million higher than the high end of our guidance range. IMT segment EBITDA margin was 36%, demonstrating the incremental margin leverage our core business exhibits when revenues grow beyond our expectations, with much of that revenue flowing directly to profit for us. Alongside strong financial results, this last quarter has been an important one for our product road map on our journey to our midterm targets that we introduced nine months ago. As a reminder, we introduced a goal to grow our share of customer transactions from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025, oriented around increasing engagement, increasing transactions and increasing revenue per transaction. The path to achieving those targets involves product initiatives within five growth pillars: touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services. As you've heard us talk about, Zillow's vision of a housing super app is to create a single digital experience to help customers across all of their real estate needs, including buying, selling, financing and renting, serving as one ecosystem of connected solutions for all the tasks and services related to moving. Customers want this super app. It's a very large business opportunity. And given Zillow's brand strength, audience and technology capabilities, we are in an advantaged position to deliver. We've heard loud and clear from you all that it is critical to understand what metrics and milestones we are most focused on internally as you evaluate the company amid a housing market that is as choppy as it has been in decades. I'll spend some time going through what we are seeing in our early data, what I'm expecting our team to deliver through the rest of this year and into next year and why I am confident that our strategy is the right one to grow share as we keep a careful eye on the housing macro. The first growth pillar on our product road map is touring. Touring is important because we, along with our customers and Premier Agent partners, know that the tour is the point-of-sale moment for the customer in the buying journey. We acquired ShowingTime, the leader in centralized software and phone-based real estate tour reservation services, just over a year ago to make the touring process more seamless compared to what it is today. As many agents will tell you, arranging tours can evolve into a painful game of phone tag coordinating multiple different schedules, juggling availability for the seller, the listing agent, the buyer and the buyer's agent just to step foot in the house. Our integration road map started with going out to all ShowingTime users across agents, brokers and MLSs and enabling them to enter availability into ShowingTime, so that we have real-time availability of sellers and/or listing agents running through our software. Our bet was that this was a no-brainer feature that would reduce a good chunk of the administrative scheduling phone tag. And so far, we've been correct with this application of software. Already across more than 300 markets, nearly 90% of ShowingTime industry users have enabled this feature for themselves and their sellers. From there, we told you our next step was to expose this availability on Zillow to reduce the friction that currently exists for our mover customers in touring homes through Zillow so they're booking a home tour for a home shopper is as seamless as booking a restaurant reservation online. I'm pleased to announce that in September, we launched what we call real-time touring capability in Atlanta. It is early days, but the feedback from both customers and Premier Agent partners alike is encouragingly positive with early data showing increased intent to transact and increased conversion rates. We feel confident in the results we are seeing in Atlanta, and we are planning to expand to additional markets throughout 2023. I'll share with you one example of the excitement we are hearing from our Premier Agent partners in the program. Ross Hester and Barbara Meek of the Hester Group in Atlanta said, 'This was the most seamless pilot Zillow was launched from a tech user interface perspective that we have ever been involved with, and we have been waiting for a long time for leads of this quality to come in. Rollout of real-time touring will be a market-by-market operation. Educating our partners on using the system and ensuring that our shared mover customers have a great experience is important. So it will take some time. But given the signal we have seen out of Atlanta, we will press forward with intensity. Adoption of this product enables a better experience, which we believe will drive more transactions. Given the size of our brand, audience and engagement throughout the industry, we are well-positioned to deliver this feature at scale in a way that will benefit the entire industry, because ultimately helping the whole industry be more efficient in removing friction for agents and customers is a win for all. The key to having real-time touring drive share gains here will be facilitating more successful tours. Our current non-real-time tour enabled successful tour rate on Zillow is roughly 30%. This means that 30% of buyers on Zillow get to see the house at the time they requested and 70% do not. If we are able to increase that successful tour rate, we will see share gains emerge because our data shows that successful tours convert to transactions at approximately three times the rate of other actions on Zillow today. The next growth pillar update for this quarter is on enhancing our partner network. For those of you that have followed us for a long time, you know that we have consistently innovated on our partner network and pricing models to create the best experience for our customers, for our Premier Agent partners and for Zillow. The most recent evolution of our partner network is in flight in one of our key test markets, Raleigh, North Carolina. We did a few things here earlier this year. First, we significantly consolidated the number of partners we work with to enable scalable testing to send more customers to our top-performing partners and to offer our shared customers and improved mortgage product experience. Second, we have a partner that has created a team solely built to serve Zillow customers in order to provide a much more integrated customer experience. Now with roughly 15% customer adoption rate of Zillow Home Loans in Raleigh, our new approach is to serving Zillow customers in this market give us increased confidence in our strategy of integrating and improving our mortgage product experience. That 15% ZHL adoption rate metric in Raleigh leads us nicely to our next update on the growth pillar product road map, which is financing. We've said it many times before, but it's worth reiterating that we believe financing is core to a buyer's experience, all the way from first dreaming about a home and what one can afford through to the close of the contract. We see integration of financing as critical to the end-to-end customer experience we envision. Our previous swings at creating a mortgage business were focused on providing financing for our iBuying customers and using ZHL for refi, neither of which turned out to be durable sources of loan volume. This year, we've turned our focus towards building the foundation for a substantial direct-to-consumer purchase mortgage operation. In addition to improvement of the customer experience when a mortgage is integrated, we see a real business opportunity in a large and fragmented market where we are well-positioned to take share over time. We know that 87% of homebuyers get a purchase mortgage, that the top 25 lenders in the country have only about one-third market share of purchase originations combined, that industry customer acquisition costs are on average 25% of origination revenue, and that the total addressable market for purchase mortgages is about $50 billion in origination revenue annually. We believe the fragmentation in this space exists for a few reasons. First, because of the highly-regulated nature of the product, manufacturing alone is a commodity. Additionally, there are a few nationally-recognized brands, making customer acquisition expensive for most. And finally, distribution requires both meaningful brand power and a network of real estate agents in local communities throughout the country. Against that backdrop, we see a significant opportunity for Zillow. We know that roughly 67% of actual home buyers use Zillow today. We also know that roughly 40% of all homebuyers begin their journey with financing. Despite fairly limited investment on our apps and sites and in our marketing efforts, millions of prospective Zillow Home Loans customers raised their hand for financing help and were sent to third-party lenders for lead generation in the last 12 months, which provides us ample customer acquisition on small dollar investments. And we have found that roughly 80% of those prospective mortgage customers do not have a real estate agent when they look to us for financing advice. Beyond the built-in brand and distribution we have from being Zillow, we also have a fantastic national network of Premier Agent partners that provides us with a potential distribution channel for Zillow Home Loans as we deliver on behalf of our shared customers. Of course, we know this big opportunity is merely theoretical without solid execution. For us to capture share in this market, we are embarking on a few critical work streams. First, we need to overhaul and transition our current mortgage funnels away from third-party lead generation towards being powered by Zillow Home Loans. Today, we have multiple entry points for customers who need financing on our apps and sites, and those customers are then sent to a wide variety of lenders in our mortgage marketplace. Those lenders then work with their real estate agent relationships to serve our customers. Our product road map starts with simplifying the entry points in our funnel and being much more explicit that Zillow provides financing through Zillow Home Loans. From there, we have 4 key areas that we have to execute on from now through 2023 to start to capture share. First, we have to make sure more of our customers are aware we offer home loans through Zillow Home Loans. The term Zillow is more often Googled than the term real estate, so our overall brand awareness is quite high. But once again, the majority of people on our apps and sites don't know that they can get a mortgage through Zillow Home Loans. The combination of the funnel work I outlined before, alongside using our mobile and web platforms to better explain ZHL to customers, should help solve this challenge. Next, we have to build a better digital mortgage experience on Zillow so we are meeting customers wherever they are in their journey. As I said before, millions of people per year contact us about financing help. In a lead generation model, volume is the name of the game. But for a transaction model, we have to get far better at filtering those customers so the customers that have the highest intent are speaking with our loan officers, while those that are years away from purchasing a home are offered nurture services so they stay in our ecosystem until they are ready to buy a home. Alongside better serving our customer base, we have to bolster our loan officer tools and capabilities so our loan officers can handle the volume and do their jobs more efficiently while we manufacture loans more effectively. And last, but certainly not least, we need our Premier Agent partner base to understand the value Zillow Home Loans can provide their customers. This is a combination of technology, service model and providing to our best partners who are most invested in Zillow that Zillow Home Loans can provide the best financing experience for our mutual customers. Our future state is one where customers that start with Zillow Home Loans work with the Premier Agent partner we've connected them to and customers that start with a Premier Agent partner through a touring product are also choosing Zillow Home Loans as their mortgage provider. Ultimately, the metrics we are measuring ourselves against are number of purchased loans, loans per loan officer and Zillow Home Loans customer adoption rate. Of course, beyond all the product improvements we are making to the buying experience, we are also innovating rapidly on behalf of sellers and listing agents. We announced our strategic partnership with Opendoor last quarter, and teams at both companies are working hard to launch the product in Q1 of 2023 with expansion plans outlined throughout next year. While it will take time to scale the partnership, we believe the combination of the customer signal we saw when operating our iBuying business, along with Opendoor's nationwide presence should allow us to serve a significant number of sellers through a suite of seller services that includes the option of a cash offer or a traditional listing when at scale. Additionally, we are investing in solutions that better equip the more than one million real estate agents that use ShowingTime today. We've recently reorganized our real estate software offerings under one umbrella brand called ShowingTime+, which has it\u2019s ShowingTime, DotLoop, Bridge Interactive and Rich Media technology, which includes our homegrown AI-powered interactive floor plans and 3D home tours. The ShowingTime+ software suite is designed to help agents and brokers operate their businesses more efficiently, win more customers and elevate the listing experience for themselves and their clients. The long-term problem we are looking to solve is to make the listing process simpler for listing agents. Listing agents have many jobs to do on behalf of their customers. They need to win the new listing, then manage and market those listings; then coordinate showings, offer management and transaction management, all before selling the home. We start this journey with a number of beloved and broadly licensed assets in the real estate community with the ShowingTime+ portfolio I mentioned a moment ago. And in 2023, we plan to launch Listing Media Services and Listing Showcase, two new listing agent marketing tools from ShowingTime+ to help agents win their next listing. First is Listing Media Services, which is a photography service and comprehensive media package that captures all aspects of a home for agents and gives potential buyers an immersive digital home shopping experience. Alongside Listing Media Services is Listing Showcase, which is a complete media and placement package that will showcase the seller's home with the most cutting-edge interactive, immersive listing presentations on the Internet. And importantly, we'll put the listing agents' brand front and center. The combination of ShowingTime+'s software capabilities and Zillow's audience reach and proprietary technologies should allow us to access listing agent wallet share through both software and marketing spend, further broadening our reach within the addressable market that we are going after. We will begin launching the products in early 2023 with additional launches throughout the remainder of the year. Positive feedback from early demos to agents and investors alike has us excited about the opportunity in front of us, though, once again, it is early days. Okay. I've spent a lot of time going through all of the reasons I'm excited about what we are building, the stuff that we have control over. Of course, the elephant in the virtual room is the state of the housing market and just how significant the gyrations are to those involved in helping customers move. 12 months later, we feel we made the right decision to wind down our iBuying operations, particularly given how this year has played out. And I am pleased that as of September 30, we have no more inventory on our balance sheet. That said, we are not immune to the challenges in the housing market right now. We've seen 30-year mortgage rates spike over the last few months to more than 7%, a level that hasn't been reached in 20 years. Big weekly swings in rates continue to occur as well. What this means is that buyers are recalculating what they can afford on the fly and are uncertain about their ability to purchase and afford a home. This volatility has impacted our funnel as our connections suffer while buyers decide whether or not they want to be on or off the sidelines in this current market. When coupled with persistently low inventory and continued lackluster flow of new listings, the setup to begin 2023 and housing looks challenged. With that in mind, we made the difficult but necessary decision to let go of a set of employees after having let go of about 25% of the company earlier this year during the wind-down of our iBuying operations. This decision and the impact it has on people is not taken lightly by any of us. That said, we have to be clear-eyed about the market we find ourselves in. So we've taken cost actions to streamline our operations and to prioritize investments through a combination of this reduction in force a decrease in committed marketing dollars and further tightening of discretionary spend. While we are actively managing our cost structure, we are still investing against our product road map and growth pillars. We have made the decision not to cut into our product and technology investments, including continued hiring in these areas because of the confidence we have in our go-forward product road map. While the housing market is challenged right now, if long-term average turnover rates persist, we would expect that 60 million homes will trade hands over the next 10 years, and that's the basis of the long-term opportunity in front of us. Additionally, we expect to continue to be active in our repurchase program given our go-forward opportunity. We have the benefit of a well-capitalized business that produces operating cash flow, and we are going to use those benefits to our and your advantage. Having led Expedia through 9/11, Zillow through the financial crisis in 2008 and early COVID in 2020, we have experience staying relatively steady on the gas when others are slamming on the brakes. We are well aware of the dangers on the road, but our vehicle is charged up and handling well, and we see opportunity on the road ahead. We appreciate your partnership through these volatile times and look forward to connecting with many of you in the days and weeks ahead. And with that, I'll turn it over to Allen. Allen? Allen, you're on mute.\nAllen Parker: Yes, I'm sorry. Got it. Thank you, Rich. And hello, everyone. As we continue to focus on executing against our growth strategy, we are increasingly becoming more confident in our opportunity to create an end-to-end real estate transactional experience for our customers. We believe the strategic investments we are making in our five growth pillars will allow us to better serve more customers and, in turn, drive more transactions and more revenue per transaction. We have our eyes wide open and are confident in our ability to navigate through the current environment by balancing investments to drive future growth with active cost management. Turning to our results. We delivered consolidated results above our outlook for both revenue and EBITDA. IMT segment revenue was $457 million, down 5% year-over-year and above the high end of our outlook range, driven by better than expected performance in Premier Agent and growth in rentals. Premier Agent revenue decreased 13% year-over-year and outperformed both our expectations and our estimated industry decline of 15%. Better than expected conversion rates, customer connections and retention rates during the quarter were the primary driver behind our slight revenue outperformance relative to the industry. Lead volumes continued to be volatile throughout the quarter with August being a positive outlier as we experienced a brief rebound in demand that coincided with interest rates declining from their previous high in June. Rentals revenue was up 10% year-over-year returning to positive year-over-year growth and outperformed our expectations. Rentals traffic on Zillow grew 30% year-over-year to 27 million average monthly unique users in Q3 per comScore data. Occupancy rates have continued to drift lower from the historically high levels of the past couple of years, which increased overall rental -- which will increase overall rental industry demand for advertising. With our industry leading rentals traffic, combined with investments in our sales force, our team grew the number of multifamily properties on our platform in Q3. IMT segment EBITDA was $164 million for Q3 or 36% of revenue, exceeding the high end of our outlook range for IMT segment EBITDA of $121 million and 28% of revenue. The outperformance was driven by a combination of better than expected revenue, which has an outsized impact on our high incremental margin business, the timing related to hiring that pushed some positions into Q4 and active cost management to drive operating efficiencies, including lower than anticipated advertising and marketing costs. Mortgages segment revenue of $26 million was near the high end of our outlook range. While deteriorating affordability negatively impacted customer demand for financing in the quarter, we continue to make progress building our Zillow Home Loans purchase mortgage business. Purchase loan origination volume was up 24% sequentially in Q3. Mortgages segment EBITDA was a loss of $27 million as we operate at subscale while continuing to invest in building a better customer facing origination experience, efficient and scalable internal loan officer tools and back in systems and integration with our Premier Agent business. We believe these investments lay the foundation for Zillow Home Loans to serve a much broader set of customers, many of whom we currently send to third-party lenders today. We expect financing will be a key driver behind the step function changes we are targeting to grow our share of customer transactions and revenue per transaction. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of cash and investments on the balance sheet, flat from Q2, which includes the benefit from operating cash flow from continuing operations, the full wind-down of iBuying inventory as well as the impact of $176 million in share repurchases during Q3. While our results this quarter were better than expected, trends deteriorated at the end of September and into October as we've seen another rapid increase in interest rates. This has pushed the median US household as a new buyer into the realm often considered housing burden, which occurs once household spend more than one-third of their income on housing. As a result, the industry is continuing to decelerate, bringing towards a decline of 25% to 35% year-over-year in Q4. As we pointed out last quarter, we suggest that investors pay close attention to the directional trends in the MBA mortgage purchase application index and the average purchase loan amount, which would multiply to become a leading indicator for total transaction dollar volume growth. In recent weeks, this has trended to down more than 40% year-over-year. These macro factors continue to weigh on our Premier Agent business, which has seen a similar change in trend for lead volume as we start Q4. While we expect the macro environment to remain under pressure for the foreseeable future, our cash position, cash generating business and now less capital-intensive operations give us the flexibility to continue to invest against our growth strategy as we look to navigate through the current macro environment. We continue to believe we are making the right investments to drive share growth across the business cycle. We remain in control of our cost levers and the pace of our investments. Last week, we took cost actions to streamline our operations and prioritize investments. We have also identified other discretionary and non-people cost actions, we expect to take over the next year to help offset planned investments. Looking ahead, we continue to be focused on cash flow generation rather than a defined margin rate for a specific quarter. Before I turn to our outlook for Q4, I would like to note that the wind-down of our iBuying business was complete as of September 30, 2022, and the financial results are now being reported as discontinued operations. In our IMT segment, we expect a 19% year-over-year revenue decline in Q4 at the midpoint of our outlook range. Within the IMT segment, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be between $250 million to $270 million, down 27% year-over-year at the midpoint of the outlook range, relatively in line with our expectations for industry performance in Q4. In rentals, we are seeing more multifamily properties on our platform, and we continue to see signs that low rental vacancies are subsiding, which we expect to drive increased demand for rentals advertising. We expect Q4 IMT segment EBITDA margin to be 24% at the midpoint of our outlook. Q3 IMT segment operating costs came in lower than previously expected. And given this, we now expect Q4 IMT segment operating costs to be flat to slightly up from Q3 and below our prior expectations we discussed on the Q2 call. We expect Mortgages segment revenue to be between $15 million and $20 million in Q4, which is down sequentially from Q3. Our Q4 outlook reflects continued softening demand for our marketplace business. It also assumes sequential growth in purchase loan originations despite macro headwinds and seasonality and as we continue to make progress on building our purchase mortgage platform. We expect Mortgages segment EBITDA to be between a loss of $36 million and a loss of $31 million, given we are holding our investment levels relatively flat from Q3 as we experienced macro and seasonal pressures in revenue. As we sit here today, we believe the trends we are seeing in Q4 will continue as we start 2023. That being said, we are excited about the progress against our five growth pillars, positive signals from our test markets and planned product launches in 2023. In closing, we believe we have the right strategy to better serve more customers resulting in share growth and more revenue per transaction, and employees are aligned to execute to drive shareholder value. As we look forward, our priorities remain focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners, and we plan to grow our customer engagement through a compelling dream in shop experience, deliver a more integrated customer transactional experience to drive customers to choose to transact with us and our partners, invest in sustainable top line growth opportunities across the company, including new integrated services that are more scalable, less subject to earnings volatility and more capital efficient and manage our cost structure and improve productivity, including continued prioritization of our investments that we expect will drive a profitable, scalable and positive cash flow comps. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Colantuoni with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nJohn Colantuoni: Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe you could just start by giving us a sense for when you expect progress on your growth pillars to begin impacting the business? And then second, based on recent mortgage applications, it seems like the housing market hasn't quite found a floor yet. What are you hearing from brokers and agents regarding how they're thinking about the approach to digital advertising in a softening market? Thanks.\nRich Barton: Okay. John, this is Rich. Thanks for your question. I actually think we should hand the microphone over to Jeremy Wacksman, our COO, to dig a little deeper on the growth pillars.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yeah, happy to. Thanks, John, for the question. I mean as you heard from Rich earlier, we're already seeing progress against our growth pillars, and that progress is increasing our confidence that we have the right strategy to help drive share in the long-term. On touring, we talked about real-time availability through ShowingTime now being available in more than 300 markets by more than 90% of our ShowingTime users. And recently launching this real-time touring consumer experience, this OpenTable-like reservation system, one market, early data, but really positive partner and customer signals there. On financing, you heard Allen talk about growing purchases sequentially. Yes, that's very small end. But as you point out, it's in a very challenged macro environment. And the 15% customer adoption rate we're seeing on home loans in our test markets, that's an early progress indicator that the strategy of having the right agent and the right mortgage to the right customer is the right strategy there. And then as Rich talked about seller services, launching the Opendoor partnership in Q1, and rolling it out through additional markets throughout 2023, and then launching those new ShowingTime+ products starting early next year. Those are great product road map proof points for you to think about the growth pillars. We're going to continue rolling out those innovations and market by market as we begin to launch those service and new ways of working with our partners, and the early customer and partner reactions keep giving us confidence. So you'll see more come from us throughout 2023. And as those gain traction, that's then what you'll see drive the outputs and drive the revenue and the path towards that 6% share we talk about.\nRich Barton: And as to the second bit, John, maybe Allen, just as a reminder, what he asked was how are we viewing agent and broker advertising, given the forecasted decline that we're seeing, Can you address a little bit of...\nAllen Parker: John, thanks for the question. This is Allen. I'll take it. So I guess I think the question was what are we hearing and what we're hearing and seeing is, I mean, obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty and volatility out there, but we're seeing our best-performing agents kind of move to a flight to quality. And so we continue to see our demand, customer demand, slightly stronger than industry, and we're seeing our lead transaction rates from that demand improve, and they're slightly higher than our expectations. And so as Premier Agents look to obtain quality leads in a challenging market, what we're seeing is that our best-performing agents are relying on our platform, and we continue to take actions to ensure we're working to align with their needs as well as our customers, and so we're seeing retention that is pretty strong around our best partners.\nJohn Colantuoni: Great. Thanks for the detail.\nRich Barton: Next question. Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I have two. The first is just on the macro environment. It was really helpful to hear your views, Rich, on the industry housing backdrop. I was just wondering if you could expand on those views a little bit more and tie them back to the impact to Zillow's businesses, and then I'll follow up with the second one. Thanks.\nRich Barton: Okay. Thanks, Michael. Thanks. Yes, I mean it is super challenging to predict right now. From a broader -- it's part and up in the broader macro sense to predict what's going on as evidenced by just take a look at the market today. But in housing, it's even stormier and more difficult. Yes. I won't tick through all the factors that I did before, but you know them well around affordability and volatility and such. But what we want to communicate to you guys is to make sure you understand that we, as Allen likes to say we have our hands on the wheel. I like to say, we know where the accelerator and where the break is. And we've -- you've seen us make tough decisions around cost control. Unfortunately, we, last week, did a meaningful reduction in force, and Allen talked about some other cost controls we implemented. You all saw us at the end of last year and early this year do a major reduction in force around the -- exiting the iBuying business that we obviously, now feel really good about. It took us a while to land the plane, but we did it really gracefully. I'm glad that we're now at zero homes on the balance sheet. Again, the -- Allen just talked about the immediate macro, but zooming out for a sack, we are privileged because we have a good balance sheet with a lot of cash and we produce cash. So we can lean -- we can continue to lean forward, and we are doing that. Many companies in our industry are not in that position. So we are relatively advantaged. You heard us talk a lot about -- Jeremy just talked about the seeds we have planted for our growth pillars and the progress we're seeing. We expect to see more progress on those growth pillars next year, and we're excited to report out to you all as we see that progress. Maybe -- I know you had another bit of the question, yeah. Why don't I wrap it there and hear what your next part is?\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you Rich. That was helpful. I wanted to ask a little bit more about Premier Agent. Obviously, revenue declines track the overall housing market. This quarter and your guidance for 4Q implies the same. Should we continue with that framework throughout 2023, Premier Agent revenue declines along with the broader market, or at what point does Premier Agent revenue outperform, presumably driven by the road map traction and share gains? Thank you.\nRich Barton: Yeah. Maybe I'll kick that that\u2019s an expansion on your last one, Allen.\nAllen Parker: Yeah, and I'll try not to be redundant. It talks a little bit about it. But listen, as we look at navigating the current macro environment, for Q3, we had previously guided for results to be in line to slightly worse than the industry leading indicators we saw, and we came out slightly better. As we look to our Q4 guide, we expect to perform a little bit better than the leading indicator data that we see going into Q4. We're confident we can outgrow the industry over the long-term based on our product improvements and our expectation to increase transaction rates and revenue per transaction. But in the short-term, there's just a lot of volatility and uncertainty surrounding affordability and housing availability, and so it's really hard to put two points into a trend for any individual quarter. So with that said, as we come out of Q3 and we look to Q4, if you want to try to glean something, we have seen our customer demand performed slightly better than the industry, and we expect our continued investment in the customer journey and experience is going to maintain this performance. Our traffic is strong. Visits and unique users in Q3 both were up 4% year-over-year despite macro headwinds. We view that as a fantastic asset that we have, and we've built it up over time. But people's interest in dreaming and moving persists, and we have that relationship with people while they dream. Our customer lead to transaction rate also has performed better than expected. Touring is one of the growth drivers that we believe is going to improve that in the long-term. We also suspect that more serious buyers in this tough environment are clicking the box to connect. And then as I mentioned, and sorry I don't want to be redundant, but our Premier Agents are valuing our platform. There's a flight to quality in advertising broadly across all industries. And we're seeing that, too, and we'll continue to work with our partners. And as I mentioned, what we're seeing is our best partners valuing our platform for the quality of leads that we're providing even though the quantity of leads in this macro is declining and going down. Hopefully, that helps.\nMichael Ng: Thank you, Allen. Thanks, Rich.\nRich Barton: Thank you. Next one?\nOperator: The next question is from Brad Erickson with RBC. Please proceed.\nBrad Erickson: \u2026enhancement partnering that you talk about. You gave some deep -- try that again. I get to be that guy.\nRich Barton: Maybe we'll circle back to Brad and take the next one first.\nOperator: Of course. Next question.\nRich Barton: You're coming in and out, Brad. Let's take another one, and then we'll come back to you. Hopefully, you can get your connection worked out.\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan McKeveny with Zelman. Please proceed.\nRyan McKeveny: Hey, thank you very much. One on the mortgage business. So you mentioned financing is core to the buyers' experience, and I think you called it a must in terms of the integrated end-to-end experience. At the same time, there's obviously some level of skepticism across the mortgage industry, looking at the public mortgage companies or just generally on the ability to transition that to a meaningful profitability. So I guess when we include the 4Q guide, it looks like something like a $90 million adjusted EBITDA loss this year. So just hoping, Rich or Allen, maybe you can share some thoughts on how, I guess, your comfort level with the trajectory of the financials within that segment, or just more generally, your comfort level, continuing to invest within mortgage, kind of going after that bigger opportunity to ideally reach longer-term returns.\nRich Barton: Hey, Ryan, this is Rich. You have heard me make a pretty detailed case in the script for why I think this is such an important and large opportunity. But maybe I'll throw it over to Jeremy to talk a little bit more about that and just remind Jeremy maybe having one of the emphasis be on how we view ourselves as having a meaningful cost advantage in this business.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes, happy to. Yes, I mean I'll echo a little bit about what you said in our prepared remarks. This is a business that can and should benefit from digitization and centralization, and it's one we want to build and own because it's such an interesting TAM. As Rich said earlier, it's what the customer wants. And we think for us, it can be a great business because of our CAC and distribution advantage. And so I'll just tick through each of those, right? Rich talked about the sort of 60 million transactions over 10 years. That would mean $50 million purchase mortgages and at $9,000 in revenue on mortgage. That's a $50 billion annual TAM opportunity that is currently sitting in a highly fragmented local, geographically-distributed business. That has a lot of characteristics to be centralized because, ultimately, it's manufacturing as a set of commodity. And therefore, a lot of the money spent to make that business go as standalone businesses in CAC. And as Rich pointed out, there are millions of customers on Zillow asking for financing help and getting connected to a lender today. So we like the business profile. And as we talk about a lot, it is what the customer wants. It's a business problem we want to solve because it also solves what our customer needs to buy the house. They need a great agent and they need a mortgage to buy the house, and having that integrated and digitized is what their asking for and going to expect in real estate 2.0. And then the last part on why will this eventually be a great business? Well, that CAC advantage, for us to have the brand and have the audience and have the customers already raising their hands and to have that national partner network for distribution and integration of the mortgage that creates a really great margin potential business for us when we're at scale. So you're right, we're currently investing to build that significant purchase mortgage business. And we're currently sub-scale, especially in a challenged macro environment. So while we talk about growing share sequentially, it's still relatively small. But we're really excited about the potential ROI of that investment as we hit scale. And as we talked about today, when you see our loans, our loans per loan officer and our adoption rate of our customers through our partners grow, that's when you'll see the ROI on those investments that we're really excited about.\nRyan McKeveny: Yeah, that's great. Super helpful. Thank you. And then just one other question. I guess Flex wasn't really much -- I don't think it was hit on. Just curious, any updates on the Flex program or some of the markets where that's been rolling out? Thank you.\nRich Barton: Maybe, Allen, do you want to hit that one?\nAllen Parker: Yeah, and nothing really significant to call out. We talked about, we had moved some of our test markets to a Flex position primarily to ensure alignment with our partners as we work through some of these integration products and services. And we did that in Q2, but there's no significant thing to call out for Flex. And again, just to remind everyone that we operate with two primary monetization models, the prepaid and postpaid. We find both to be very valuable to us. We do believe Flex could offer a stronger alignment with our partners, but we expect going forward that we will continue in order to optimize for our customers, both of those monetization models. And that a lot of the things we create or develop, we will look for opportunities to distribute across both.\nRyan McKeveny: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Brad Erickson with RBC. Please proceed.\nBrad Erickson: Thanks. Let's try this one more time. So just following up on the last one, I guess, maybe if you can speak to Raleigh as an example or elsewhere. Can you talk about how the Flex model might work alongside the traditional MVP model? Is that something that can even work? And just curious if you have any evidence out there of the net effect it can have maybe on your market share, say, in a particular market? And then second, I guess, for Allen, is there a level where you draw a line in the sand around margins, where you try and hold firm relative to the, I guess, 24% you just guided to? Just curious if you manage the business to some specific level in the event that the macro worsened, I guess. And just maybe any guardrails as to how to think about that in terms of either margin or cash generation or both? Thanks.\nRich Barton: Thanks, Brad. Glad the mic is working. Maybe Jeremy, you take the first bit on that and then pass it over to Allen.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yeah. Happy to. Thanks, Brad. I mean, as Allen said earlier, I think, we think about it as enhanced partners regardless of monetization model. And there's a nuance there that in these test markets we have consolidated, and so we can work more closely in a scaled way with partners to test a bunch of these ingredients that we're building. And so those are all on the post-pay model, where the economics are directly aligned as we test those things. But ultimately, our aim is to have these growth pillars be able to be scaled across our enhanced partner network that we'll end up with, and so that's why you always hear us talk about it. It's not really about monetization model, it's about trying to get to the right set of enhanced partners and ultimately getting these growth pillars in touring and working with our new touring customers in new ways, financing and working with Zillow Home Loans as our loan operators and eventually sell their services through both our Opendoor partnership and our ShowingTime plus software, having that enhanced partner network, wanting to and helping and helping it drive their business as long as it drives ours. That's our goal, and monetization model is just kind of a tool in there.\nAllen Parker: Great. And Brad, I'll try to touch on your second. So the degradation we see from 36% in Q3 for IMT margins to 24% at the midpoint is attributable to, as we talked about, the macro impacts on our revenue. We're keeping our cost structure relatively the same. So I guess when you think about what we're willing to absorb, we do kind of look at our investments, in prioritizing our investments on a return what we believe will be a future return basis, either in driving revenue transaction or additional share value over time. And that's kind of the starting point for what investment levels we feel are prudent to drive this opportunity given the TAM. We're not managing to a near-term margin rate, especially not over a quarter or two, but we are very cognizant of it. And as we called out before, we also are very cognizant of our business model producing cash flow. So we do continue to look at both the macro long-term and investment levels at ROIs is as we pull those levers, and we're actively managing costs and, in some cases, to prioritize or to reinvest in the investments that we feel like are going to drive our opportunity for share growth. In other cases, letting that fall through because it's the prudent thing to do in the environment. So my takeaway would be we're going to continue to actively manage costs. We're going to continue to monitor and hold accountable our investments for a strong return in that share growth, but we're not going to be managing that on a specific quarter basis, and we view cash flow to be also important. And that's really cash flow over a period of time, not one to the quarter as well, but I guess that's the takeaway.\nBrad Erickson: Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc. Please proceed.\nJustin Patterson: Great. Thank you very much and good afternoon. Thinking about just kind of the moving parts here, there's a lot of encouraging micro level trends at the product level that you've been investing into. At the same time, affordability is quite the challenge to say the least. When you kind of step back and think of other periods where interest rates have spiked to some degree, how have agents really responded to that? Is this something that could be, call it, a blessing in disguise? As we come out of this, agents become more reliant on Zillow for future leads? Thank you.\nRich Barton: Brad, you correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks for the question, Justin. But we haven't seen this kind of market in a couple of decades, this kind of a spike. Am I -- you know more about the history of the rates in this business than I do.\nBrad Berning: Yes. I mean from a rates perspective, you're going to go back to 82, 84, right, to see this kind of incremental increase in rates.\nJustin Patterson: So hard for us to say from experience, yeah. But there have been prior periods like 2018 or so were granted much smaller levels, but you could see some shocks coming to the business to a degree. But just juxtaposing against that\u2026?\nRich Barton: Yeah, I mean. Sure. So the affordability has been -- has moved against the home buyer dramatically and suddenly. And in a jagged volatile way, which does -- we as humans tend to freeze in that situation. And so we're seeing a lot of wait and see. And we think, therefore, this is going to take some time to rationalize and adjust and renormalize. There is a big demographic -- human and demographic pressure coming from the demand side to get it on stock at some point, however. And we think that is -- it is very reasonable to expect that in the medium-term, we're going to see the market revert to a more normal volume of transactions. In terms of the other part of your question, yeah, I mean, I think that -- I think it was Allen who said it in a previous answer. In times of turmoil, sometimes, marketing partners become more important to marketers to the folks doing the marketing, and we're maybe seeing some of that effect right now as well as a concentration of effort against the bigger brands. And I think we're probably seeing some of that, too. So there is a bit of a silver lining there. But once again, while we see these things as near to mid-term headwinds, we do stepping back and looking down the road a bit, we think we're setting up really nicely to be investing smartly through the storm and come out on the other side in a position to really take transaction share. So we're excited about that. I thank you for commending us on some of the more micro progress we're making that we're talking a lot about. We're feeling it happening. I wish we had even more results to show you guys. But hopefully, over the next several quarters, we will come back to you with more and more.\nJustin Patterson: Great. Thank you.\nRich Barton: Brad, we're heading the end of the hour.\nBrad Berning: Go ahead, operator.\nOperator: This concludes the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Rich Barton for any closing remarks.\nRich Barton: Well, just thank you guys for taking time and giving your attention to us this afternoon. I know it's a crazy time for all of us. We look forward to chatting with you real soon. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rich Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. A brief programming note before we get going. Allen and I will talk through results from the quarter like we normally do. And then, as Brad just mentioned, our COO, Jeremy Wacksman will join us for Q&A. As Chief Operating Officer, Jeremy is an integral part of delivering on our strategy and, therefore, an important resource for you all, especially with respect to the progress we're making against our growth pillars. I'm excited for you to have the chance to hear from him directly once again. Now to our results. We exceeded our guidance ranges for total revenue and EBITDA in the third quarter through a combination of better than expected revenue growth, coupled with active cost management. Of note, our IMT segment EBITDA for the quarter came in at $164 million, which was $43 million higher than the high end of our guidance range. IMT segment EBITDA margin was 36%, demonstrating the incremental margin leverage our core business exhibits when revenues grow beyond our expectations, with much of that revenue flowing directly to profit for us. Alongside strong financial results, this last quarter has been an important one for our product road map on our journey to our midterm targets that we introduced nine months ago. As a reminder, we introduced a goal to grow our share of customer transactions from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025, oriented around increasing engagement, increasing transactions and increasing revenue per transaction. The path to achieving those targets involves product initiatives within five growth pillars: touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services. As you've heard us talk about, Zillow's vision of a housing super app is to create a single digital experience to help customers across all of their real estate needs, including buying, selling, financing and renting, serving as one ecosystem of connected solutions for all the tasks and services related to moving. Customers want this super app. It's a very large business opportunity. And given Zillow's brand strength, audience and technology capabilities, we are in an advantaged position to deliver. We've heard loud and clear from you all that it is critical to understand what metrics and milestones we are most focused on internally as you evaluate the company amid a housing market that is as choppy as it has been in decades. I'll spend some time going through what we are seeing in our early data, what I'm expecting our team to deliver through the rest of this year and into next year and why I am confident that our strategy is the right one to grow share as we keep a careful eye on the housing macro. The first growth pillar on our product road map is touring. Touring is important because we, along with our customers and Premier Agent partners, know that the tour is the point-of-sale moment for the customer in the buying journey. We acquired ShowingTime, the leader in centralized software and phone-based real estate tour reservation services, just over a year ago to make the touring process more seamless compared to what it is today. As many agents will tell you, arranging tours can evolve into a painful game of phone tag coordinating multiple different schedules, juggling availability for the seller, the listing agent, the buyer and the buyer's agent just to step foot in the house. Our integration road map started with going out to all ShowingTime users across agents, brokers and MLSs and enabling them to enter availability into ShowingTime, so that we have real-time availability of sellers and/or listing agents running through our software. Our bet was that this was a no-brainer feature that would reduce a good chunk of the administrative scheduling phone tag. And so far, we've been correct with this application of software. Already across more than 300 markets, nearly 90% of ShowingTime industry users have enabled this feature for themselves and their sellers. From there, we told you our next step was to expose this availability on Zillow to reduce the friction that currently exists for our mover customers in touring homes through Zillow so they're booking a home tour for a home shopper is as seamless as booking a restaurant reservation online. I'm pleased to announce that in September, we launched what we call real-time touring capability in Atlanta. It is early days, but the feedback from both customers and Premier Agent partners alike is encouragingly positive with early data showing increased intent to transact and increased conversion rates. We feel confident in the results we are seeing in Atlanta, and we are planning to expand to additional markets throughout 2023. I'll share with you one example of the excitement we are hearing from our Premier Agent partners in the program. Ross Hester and Barbara Meek of the Hester Group in Atlanta said, 'This was the most seamless pilot Zillow was launched from a tech user interface perspective that we have ever been involved with, and we have been waiting for a long time for leads of this quality to come in. Rollout of real-time touring will be a market-by-market operation. Educating our partners on using the system and ensuring that our shared mover customers have a great experience is important. So it will take some time. But given the signal we have seen out of Atlanta, we will press forward with intensity. Adoption of this product enables a better experience, which we believe will drive more transactions. Given the size of our brand, audience and engagement throughout the industry, we are well-positioned to deliver this feature at scale in a way that will benefit the entire industry, because ultimately helping the whole industry be more efficient in removing friction for agents and customers is a win for all. The key to having real-time touring drive share gains here will be facilitating more successful tours. Our current non-real-time tour enabled successful tour rate on Zillow is roughly 30%. This means that 30% of buyers on Zillow get to see the house at the time they requested and 70% do not. If we are able to increase that successful tour rate, we will see share gains emerge because our data shows that successful tours convert to transactions at approximately three times the rate of other actions on Zillow today. The next growth pillar update for this quarter is on enhancing our partner network. For those of you that have followed us for a long time, you know that we have consistently innovated on our partner network and pricing models to create the best experience for our customers, for our Premier Agent partners and for Zillow. The most recent evolution of our partner network is in flight in one of our key test markets, Raleigh, North Carolina. We did a few things here earlier this year. First, we significantly consolidated the number of partners we work with to enable scalable testing to send more customers to our top-performing partners and to offer our shared customers and improved mortgage product experience. Second, we have a partner that has created a team solely built to serve Zillow customers in order to provide a much more integrated customer experience. Now with roughly 15% customer adoption rate of Zillow Home Loans in Raleigh, our new approach is to serving Zillow customers in this market give us increased confidence in our strategy of integrating and improving our mortgage product experience. That 15% ZHL adoption rate metric in Raleigh leads us nicely to our next update on the growth pillar product road map, which is financing. We've said it many times before, but it's worth reiterating that we believe financing is core to a buyer's experience, all the way from first dreaming about a home and what one can afford through to the close of the contract. We see integration of financing as critical to the end-to-end customer experience we envision. Our previous swings at creating a mortgage business were focused on providing financing for our iBuying customers and using ZHL for refi, neither of which turned out to be durable sources of loan volume. This year, we've turned our focus towards building the foundation for a substantial direct-to-consumer purchase mortgage operation. In addition to improvement of the customer experience when a mortgage is integrated, we see a real business opportunity in a large and fragmented market where we are well-positioned to take share over time. We know that 87% of homebuyers get a purchase mortgage, that the top 25 lenders in the country have only about one-third market share of purchase originations combined, that industry customer acquisition costs are on average 25% of origination revenue, and that the total addressable market for purchase mortgages is about $50 billion in origination revenue annually. We believe the fragmentation in this space exists for a few reasons. First, because of the highly-regulated nature of the product, manufacturing alone is a commodity. Additionally, there are a few nationally-recognized brands, making customer acquisition expensive for most. And finally, distribution requires both meaningful brand power and a network of real estate agents in local communities throughout the country. Against that backdrop, we see a significant opportunity for Zillow. We know that roughly 67% of actual home buyers use Zillow today. We also know that roughly 40% of all homebuyers begin their journey with financing. Despite fairly limited investment on our apps and sites and in our marketing efforts, millions of prospective Zillow Home Loans customers raised their hand for financing help and were sent to third-party lenders for lead generation in the last 12 months, which provides us ample customer acquisition on small dollar investments. And we have found that roughly 80% of those prospective mortgage customers do not have a real estate agent when they look to us for financing advice. Beyond the built-in brand and distribution we have from being Zillow, we also have a fantastic national network of Premier Agent partners that provides us with a potential distribution channel for Zillow Home Loans as we deliver on behalf of our shared customers. Of course, we know this big opportunity is merely theoretical without solid execution. For us to capture share in this market, we are embarking on a few critical work streams. First, we need to overhaul and transition our current mortgage funnels away from third-party lead generation towards being powered by Zillow Home Loans. Today, we have multiple entry points for customers who need financing on our apps and sites, and those customers are then sent to a wide variety of lenders in our mortgage marketplace. Those lenders then work with their real estate agent relationships to serve our customers. Our product road map starts with simplifying the entry points in our funnel and being much more explicit that Zillow provides financing through Zillow Home Loans. From there, we have 4 key areas that we have to execute on from now through 2023 to start to capture share. First, we have to make sure more of our customers are aware we offer home loans through Zillow Home Loans. The term Zillow is more often Googled than the term real estate, so our overall brand awareness is quite high. But once again, the majority of people on our apps and sites don't know that they can get a mortgage through Zillow Home Loans. The combination of the funnel work I outlined before, alongside using our mobile and web platforms to better explain ZHL to customers, should help solve this challenge. Next, we have to build a better digital mortgage experience on Zillow so we are meeting customers wherever they are in their journey. As I said before, millions of people per year contact us about financing help. In a lead generation model, volume is the name of the game. But for a transaction model, we have to get far better at filtering those customers so the customers that have the highest intent are speaking with our loan officers, while those that are years away from purchasing a home are offered nurture services so they stay in our ecosystem until they are ready to buy a home. Alongside better serving our customer base, we have to bolster our loan officer tools and capabilities so our loan officers can handle the volume and do their jobs more efficiently while we manufacture loans more effectively. And last, but certainly not least, we need our Premier Agent partner base to understand the value Zillow Home Loans can provide their customers. This is a combination of technology, service model and providing to our best partners who are most invested in Zillow that Zillow Home Loans can provide the best financing experience for our mutual customers. Our future state is one where customers that start with Zillow Home Loans work with the Premier Agent partner we've connected them to and customers that start with a Premier Agent partner through a touring product are also choosing Zillow Home Loans as their mortgage provider. Ultimately, the metrics we are measuring ourselves against are number of purchased loans, loans per loan officer and Zillow Home Loans customer adoption rate. Of course, beyond all the product improvements we are making to the buying experience, we are also innovating rapidly on behalf of sellers and listing agents. We announced our strategic partnership with Opendoor last quarter, and teams at both companies are working hard to launch the product in Q1 of 2023 with expansion plans outlined throughout next year. While it will take time to scale the partnership, we believe the combination of the customer signal we saw when operating our iBuying business, along with Opendoor's nationwide presence should allow us to serve a significant number of sellers through a suite of seller services that includes the option of a cash offer or a traditional listing when at scale. Additionally, we are investing in solutions that better equip the more than one million real estate agents that use ShowingTime today. We've recently reorganized our real estate software offerings under one umbrella brand called ShowingTime+, which has it's ShowingTime, DotLoop, Bridge Interactive and Rich Media technology, which includes our homegrown AI-powered interactive floor plans and 3D home tours. The ShowingTime+ software suite is designed to help agents and brokers operate their businesses more efficiently, win more customers and elevate the listing experience for themselves and their clients. The long-term problem we are looking to solve is to make the listing process simpler for listing agents. Listing agents have many jobs to do on behalf of their customers. They need to win the new listing, then manage and market those listings; then coordinate showings, offer management and transaction management, all before selling the home. We start this journey with a number of beloved and broadly licensed assets in the real estate community with the ShowingTime+ portfolio I mentioned a moment ago. And in 2023, we plan to launch Listing Media Services and Listing Showcase, two new listing agent marketing tools from ShowingTime+ to help agents win their next listing. First is Listing Media Services, which is a photography service and comprehensive media package that captures all aspects of a home for agents and gives potential buyers an immersive digital home shopping experience. Alongside Listing Media Services is Listing Showcase, which is a complete media and placement package that will showcase the seller's home with the most cutting-edge interactive, immersive listing presentations on the Internet. And importantly, we'll put the listing agents' brand front and center. The combination of ShowingTime+'s software capabilities and Zillow's audience reach and proprietary technologies should allow us to access listing agent wallet share through both software and marketing spend, further broadening our reach within the addressable market that we are going after. We will begin launching the products in early 2023 with additional launches throughout the remainder of the year. Positive feedback from early demos to agents and investors alike has us excited about the opportunity in front of us, though, once again, it is early days. Okay. I've spent a lot of time going through all of the reasons I'm excited about what we are building, the stuff that we have control over. Of course, the elephant in the virtual room is the state of the housing market and just how significant the gyrations are to those involved in helping customers move. 12 months later, we feel we made the right decision to wind down our iBuying operations, particularly given how this year has played out. And I am pleased that as of September 30, we have no more inventory on our balance sheet. That said, we are not immune to the challenges in the housing market right now. We've seen 30-year mortgage rates spike over the last few months to more than 7%, a level that hasn't been reached in 20 years. Big weekly swings in rates continue to occur as well. What this means is that buyers are recalculating what they can afford on the fly and are uncertain about their ability to purchase and afford a home. This volatility has impacted our funnel as our connections suffer while buyers decide whether or not they want to be on or off the sidelines in this current market. When coupled with persistently low inventory and continued lackluster flow of new listings, the setup to begin 2023 and housing looks challenged. With that in mind, we made the difficult but necessary decision to let go of a set of employees after having let go of about 25% of the company earlier this year during the wind-down of our iBuying operations. This decision and the impact it has on people is not taken lightly by any of us. That said, we have to be clear-eyed about the market we find ourselves in. So we've taken cost actions to streamline our operations and to prioritize investments through a combination of this reduction in force a decrease in committed marketing dollars and further tightening of discretionary spend. While we are actively managing our cost structure, we are still investing against our product road map and growth pillars. We have made the decision not to cut into our product and technology investments, including continued hiring in these areas because of the confidence we have in our go-forward product road map. While the housing market is challenged right now, if long-term average turnover rates persist, we would expect that 60 million homes will trade hands over the next 10 years, and that's the basis of the long-term opportunity in front of us. Additionally, we expect to continue to be active in our repurchase program given our go-forward opportunity. We have the benefit of a well-capitalized business that produces operating cash flow, and we are going to use those benefits to our and your advantage. Having led Expedia through 9/11, Zillow through the financial crisis in 2008 and early COVID in 2020, we have experience staying relatively steady on the gas when others are slamming on the brakes. We are well aware of the dangers on the road, but our vehicle is charged up and handling well, and we see opportunity on the road ahead. We appreciate your partnership through these volatile times and look forward to connecting with many of you in the days and weeks ahead. And with that, I'll turn it over to Allen. Allen? Allen, you're on mute. Okay. John, this is Rich. Thanks for your question. I actually think we should hand the microphone over to Jeremy Wacksman, our COO, to dig a little deeper on the growth pillars. And as to the second bit, John, maybe Allen, just as a reminder, what he asked was how are we viewing agent and broker advertising, given the forecasted decline that we're seeing, Can you address a little bit of... Next question. Yes. Okay. Thanks, Michael. Thanks. Yes, I mean it is super challenging to predict right now. From a broader -- it's part and up in the broader macro sense to predict what's going on as evidenced by just take a look at the market today. But in housing, it's even stormier and more difficult. Yes. I won't tick through all the factors that I did before, but you know them well around affordability and volatility and such. But what we want to communicate to you guys is to make sure you understand that we, as Allen likes to say we have our hands on the wheel. I like to say, we know where the accelerator and where the break is. And we've -- you've seen us make tough decisions around cost control. Unfortunately, we, last week, did a meaningful reduction in force, and Allen talked about some other cost controls we implemented. You all saw us at the end of last year and early this year do a major reduction in force around the -- exiting the iBuying business that we obviously, now feel really good about. It took us a while to land the plane, but we did it really gracefully. I'm glad that we're now at zero homes on the balance sheet. Again, the -- Allen just talked about the immediate macro, but zooming out for a sack, we are privileged because we have a good balance sheet with a lot of cash and we produce cash. So we can lean -- we can continue to lean forward, and we are doing that. Many companies in our industry are not in that position. So we are relatively advantaged. You heard us talk a lot about -- Jeremy just talked about the seeds we have planted for our growth pillars and the progress we're seeing. We expect to see more progress on those growth pillars next year, and we're excited to report out to you all as we see that progress. Maybe -- I know you had another bit of the question, yeah. Why don't I wrap it there and hear what your next part is? Yeah. Maybe I'll kick that that's an expansion on your last one, Allen. Thank you. Next one? Maybe we'll circle back to Brad and take the next one first. You're coming in and out, Brad. Let's take another one, and then we'll come back to you. Hopefully, you can get your connection worked out. Hey, Ryan, this is Rich. You have heard me make a pretty detailed case in the script for why I think this is such an important and large opportunity. But maybe I'll throw it over to Jeremy to talk a little bit more about that and just remind Jeremy maybe having one of the emphasis be on how we view ourselves as having a meaningful cost advantage in this business. Maybe, Allen, do you want to hit that one? Thanks, Brad. Glad the mic is working. Maybe Jeremy, you take the first bit on that and then pass it over to Allen. Brad, you correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks for the question, Justin. But we haven't seen this kind of market in a couple of decades, this kind of a spike. Am I -- you know more about the history of the rates in this business than I do. Yeah, I mean. Sure. So the affordability has been -- has moved against the home buyer dramatically and suddenly. And in a jagged volatile way, which does -- we as humans tend to freeze in that situation. And so we're seeing a lot of wait and see. And we think, therefore, this is going to take some time to rationalize and adjust and renormalize. There is a big demographic -- human and demographic pressure coming from the demand side to get it on stock at some point, however.

            "name": "Allen Parker",
            "content": "Yes, I'm sorry. Got it. Thank you, Rich. And hello, everyone. As we continue to focus on executing against our growth strategy, we are increasingly becoming more confident in our opportunity to create an end-to-end real estate transactional experience for our customers. We believe the strategic investments we are making in our five growth pillars will allow us to better serve more customers and, in turn, drive more transactions and more revenue per transaction. We have our eyes wide open and are confident in our ability to navigate through the current environment by balancing investments to drive future growth with active cost management. Turning to our results. We delivered consolidated results above our outlook for both revenue and EBITDA. IMT segment revenue was $457 million, down 5% year-over-year and above the high end of our outlook range, driven by better than expected performance in Premier Agent and growth in rentals. Premier Agent revenue decreased 13% year-over-year and outperformed both our expectations and our estimated industry decline of 15%. Better than expected conversion rates, customer connections and retention rates during the quarter were the primary driver behind our slight revenue outperformance relative to the industry. Lead volumes continued to be volatile throughout the quarter with August being a positive outlier as we experienced a brief rebound in demand that coincided with interest rates declining from their previous high in June. Rentals revenue was up 10% year-over-year returning to positive year-over-year growth and outperformed our expectations. Rentals traffic on Zillow grew 30% year-over-year to 27 million average monthly unique users in Q3 per comScore data. Occupancy rates have continued to drift lower from the historically high levels of the past couple of years, which increased overall rental -- which will increase overall rental industry demand for advertising. With our industry leading rentals traffic, combined with investments in our sales force, our team grew the number of multifamily properties on our platform in Q3. IMT segment EBITDA was $164 million for Q3 or 36% of revenue, exceeding the high end of our outlook range for IMT segment EBITDA of $121 million and 28% of revenue. The outperformance was driven by a combination of better than expected revenue, which has an outsized impact on our high incremental margin business, the timing related to hiring that pushed some positions into Q4 and active cost management to drive operating efficiencies, including lower than anticipated advertising and marketing costs. Mortgages segment revenue of $26 million was near the high end of our outlook range. While deteriorating affordability negatively impacted customer demand for financing in the quarter, we continue to make progress building our Zillow Home Loans purchase mortgage business. Purchase loan origination volume was up 24% sequentially in Q3. Mortgages segment EBITDA was a loss of $27 million as we operate at subscale while continuing to invest in building a better customer facing origination experience, efficient and scalable internal loan officer tools and back in systems and integration with our Premier Agent business. We believe these investments lay the foundation for Zillow Home Loans to serve a much broader set of customers, many of whom we currently send to third-party lenders today. We expect financing will be a key driver behind the step function changes we are targeting to grow our share of customer transactions and revenue per transaction. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of cash and investments on the balance sheet, flat from Q2, which includes the benefit from operating cash flow from continuing operations, the full wind-down of iBuying inventory as well as the impact of $176 million in share repurchases during Q3. While our results this quarter were better than expected, trends deteriorated at the end of September and into October as we've seen another rapid increase in interest rates. This has pushed the median US household as a new buyer into the realm often considered housing burden, which occurs once household spend more than one-third of their income on housing. As a result, the industry is continuing to decelerate, bringing towards a decline of 25% to 35% year-over-year in Q4. As we pointed out last quarter, we suggest that investors pay close attention to the directional trends in the MBA mortgage purchase application index and the average purchase loan amount, which would multiply to become a leading indicator for total transaction dollar volume growth. In recent weeks, this has trended to down more than 40% year-over-year. These macro factors continue to weigh on our Premier Agent business, which has seen a similar change in trend for lead volume as we start Q4. While we expect the macro environment to remain under pressure for the foreseeable future, our cash position, cash generating business and now less capital-intensive operations give us the flexibility to continue to invest against our growth strategy as we look to navigate through the current macro environment. We continue to believe we are making the right investments to drive share growth across the business cycle. We remain in control of our cost levers and the pace of our investments. Last week, we took cost actions to streamline our operations and prioritize investments. We have also identified other discretionary and non-people cost actions, we expect to take over the next year to help offset planned investments. Looking ahead, we continue to be focused on cash flow generation rather than a defined margin rate for a specific quarter. Before I turn to our outlook for Q4, I would like to note that the wind-down of our iBuying business was complete as of September 30, 2022, and the financial results are now being reported as discontinued operations. In our IMT segment, we expect a 19% year-over-year revenue decline in Q4 at the midpoint of our outlook range. Within the IMT segment, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be between $250 million to $270 million, down 27% year-over-year at the midpoint of the outlook range, relatively in line with our expectations for industry performance in Q4. In rentals, we are seeing more multifamily properties on our platform, and we continue to see signs that low rental vacancies are subsiding, which we expect to drive increased demand for rentals advertising. We expect Q4 IMT segment EBITDA margin to be 24% at the midpoint of our outlook. Q3 IMT segment operating costs came in lower than previously expected. And given this, we now expect Q4 IMT segment operating costs to be flat to slightly up from Q3 and below our prior expectations we discussed on the Q2 call. We expect Mortgages segment revenue to be between $15 million and $20 million in Q4, which is down sequentially from Q3. Our Q4 outlook reflects continued softening demand for our marketplace business. It also assumes sequential growth in purchase loan originations despite macro headwinds and seasonality and as we continue to make progress on building our purchase mortgage platform. We expect Mortgages segment EBITDA to be between a loss of $36 million and a loss of $31 million, given we are holding our investment levels relatively flat from Q3 as we experienced macro and seasonal pressures in revenue. As we sit here today, we believe the trends we are seeing in Q4 will continue as we start 2023. That being said, we are excited about the progress against our five growth pillars, positive signals from our test markets and planned product launches in 2023. In closing, we believe we have the right strategy to better serve more customers resulting in share growth and more revenue per transaction, and employees are aligned to execute to drive shareholder value. As we look forward, our priorities remain focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners, and we plan to grow our customer engagement through a compelling dream in shop experience, deliver a more integrated customer transactional experience to drive customers to choose to transact with us and our partners, invest in sustainable top line growth opportunities across the company, including new integrated services that are more scalable, less subject to earnings volatility and more capital efficient and manage our cost structure and improve productivity, including continued prioritization of our investments that we expect will drive a profitable, scalable and positive cash flow comps. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. John, thanks for the question. This is Allen. I'll take it. So I guess I think the question was what are we hearing and what we're hearing and seeing is, I mean, obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty and volatility out there, but we're seeing our best-performing agents kind of move to a flight to quality. And so we continue to see our demand, customer demand, slightly stronger than industry, and we're seeing our lead transaction rates from that demand improve, and they're slightly higher than our expectations. And so as Premier Agents look to obtain quality leads in a challenging market, what we're seeing is that our best-performing agents are relying on our platform, and we continue to take actions to ensure we're working to align with their needs as well as our customers, and so we're seeing retention that is pretty strong around our best partners. Yeah, and I'll try not to be redundant. It talks a little bit about it. But listen, as we look at navigating the current macro environment, for Q3, we had previously guided for results to be in line to slightly worse than the industry leading indicators we saw, and we came out slightly better. As we look to our Q4 guide, we expect to perform a little bit better than the leading indicator data that we see going into Q4. We're confident we can outgrow the industry over the long-term based on our product improvements and our expectation to increase transaction rates and revenue per transaction. But in the short-term, there's just a lot of volatility and uncertainty surrounding affordability and housing availability, and so it's really hard to put two points into a trend for any individual quarter. So with that said, as we come out of Q3 and we look to Q4, if you want to try to glean something, we have seen our customer demand performed slightly better than the industry, and we expect our continued investment in the customer journey and experience is going to maintain this performance. Our traffic is strong. Visits and unique users in Q3 both were up 4% year-over-year despite macro headwinds. We view that as a fantastic asset that we have, and we've built it up over time. But people's interest in dreaming and moving persists, and we have that relationship with people while they dream. Our customer lead to transaction rate also has performed better than expected. Touring is one of the growth drivers that we believe is going to improve that in the long-term. We also suspect that more serious buyers in this tough environment are clicking the box to connect. And then as I mentioned, and sorry I don't want to be redundant, but our Premier Agents are valuing our platform. There's a flight to quality in advertising broadly across all industries. And we're seeing that, too, and we'll continue to work with our partners. And as I mentioned, what we're seeing is our best partners valuing our platform for the quality of leads that we're providing even though the quantity of leads in this macro is declining and going down. Hopefully, that helps. Yeah, and nothing really significant to call out. We talked about, we had moved some of our test markets to a Flex position primarily to ensure alignment with our partners as we work through some of these integration products and services. And we did that in Q2, but there's no significant thing to call out for Flex. And again, just to remind everyone that we operate with two primary monetization models, the prepaid and postpaid. We find both to be very valuable to us. We do believe Flex could offer a stronger alignment with our partners, but we expect going forward that we will continue in order to optimize for our customers, both of those monetization models. And that a lot of the things we create or develop, we will look for opportunities to distribute across both. Great. And Brad, I'll try to touch on your second. So the degradation we see from 36% in Q3 for IMT margins to 24% at the midpoint is attributable to, as we talked about, the macro impacts on our revenue. We're keeping our cost structure relatively the same. So I guess when you think about what we're willing to absorb, we do kind of look at our investments, in prioritizing our investments on a return what we believe will be a future return basis, either in driving revenue transaction or additional share value over time. And that's kind of the starting point for what investment levels we feel are prudent to drive this opportunity given the TAM. We're not managing to a near-term margin rate, especially not over a quarter or two, but we are very cognizant of it. And as we called out before, we also are very cognizant of our business model producing cash flow. So we do continue to look at both the macro long-term and investment levels at ROIs is as we pull those levers, and we're actively managing costs and, in some cases, to prioritize or to reinvest in the investments that we feel like are going to drive our opportunity for share growth. In other cases, letting that fall through because it's the prudent thing to do in the environment. So my takeaway would be we're going to continue to actively manage costs. We're going to continue to monitor and hold accountable our investments for a strong return in that share growth, but we're not going to be managing that on a specific quarter basis, and we view cash flow to be also important. And that's really cash flow over a period of time, not one to the quarter as well, but I guess that's the takeaway."

            "name": "Jeremy Wacksman",
            "content": "Yeah, happy to. Thanks, John, for the question. I mean as you heard from Rich earlier, we're already seeing progress against our growth pillars, and that progress is increasing our confidence that we have the right strategy to help drive share in the long-term. On touring, we talked about real-time availability through ShowingTime now being available in more than 300 markets by more than 90% of our ShowingTime users. And recently launching this real-time touring consumer experience, this OpenTable-like reservation system, one market, early data, but really positive partner and customer signals there. On financing, you heard Allen talk about growing purchases sequentially. Yes, that's very small end. But as you point out, it's in a very challenged macro environment. And the 15% customer adoption rate we're seeing on home loans in our test markets, that's an early progress indicator that the strategy of having the right agent and the right mortgage to the right customer is the right strategy there. And then as Rich talked about seller services, launching the Opendoor partnership in Q1, and rolling it out through additional markets throughout 2023, and then launching those new ShowingTime+ products starting early next year. Those are great product road map proof points for you to think about the growth pillars. We're going to continue rolling out those innovations and market by market as we begin to launch those service and new ways of working with our partners, and the early customer and partner reactions keep giving us confidence. So you'll see more come from us throughout 2023. And as those gain traction, that's then what you'll see drive the outputs and drive the revenue and the path towards that 6% share we talk about. Yes, happy to. Yes, I mean I'll echo a little bit about what you said in our prepared remarks. This is a business that can and should benefit from digitization and centralization, and it's one we want to build and own because it's such an interesting TAM. As Rich said earlier, it's what the customer wants. And we think for us, it can be a great business because of our CAC and distribution advantage. And so I'll just tick through each of those, right? Rich talked about the sort of 60 million transactions over 10 years. That would mean $50 million purchase mortgages and at $9,000 in revenue on mortgage. That's a $50 billion annual TAM opportunity that is currently sitting in a highly fragmented local, geographically-distributed business. That has a lot of characteristics to be centralized because, ultimately, it's manufacturing as a set of commodity. And therefore, a lot of the money spent to make that business go as standalone businesses in CAC. And as Rich pointed out, there are millions of customers on Zillow asking for financing help and getting connected to a lender today. So we like the business profile. And as we talk about a lot, it is what the customer wants. It's a business problem we want to solve because it also solves what our customer needs to buy the house. They need a great agent and they need a mortgage to buy the house, and having that integrated and digitized is what their asking for and going to expect in real estate 2.0. And then the last part on why will this eventually be a great business? Well, that CAC advantage, for us to have the brand and have the audience and have the customers already raising their hands and to have that national partner network for distribution and integration of the mortgage that creates a really great margin potential business for us when we're at scale. So you're right, we're currently investing to build that significant purchase mortgage business. And we're currently sub-scale, especially in a challenged macro environment. So while we talk about growing share sequentially, it's still relatively small. But we're really excited about the potential ROI of that investment as we hit scale. And as we talked about today, when you see our loans, our loans per loan officer and our adoption rate of our customers through our partners grow, that's when you'll see the ROI on those investments that we're really excited about. Yeah. Happy to. Thanks, Brad. I mean, as Allen said earlier, I think, we think about it as enhanced partners regardless of monetization model. And there's a nuance there that in these test markets we have consolidated, and so we can work more closely in a scaled way with partners to test a bunch of these ingredients that we're building. And so those are all on the post-pay model, where the economics are directly aligned as we test those things. But ultimately, our aim is to have these growth pillars be able to be scaled across our enhanced partner network that we'll end up with, and so that's why you always hear us talk about it. It's not really about monetization model, it's about trying to get to the right set of enhanced partners and ultimately getting these growth pillars in touring and working with our new touring customers in new ways, financing and working with Zillow Home Loans as our loan operators and eventually sell their services through both our Opendoor partnership and our ShowingTime plus software, having that enhanced partner network, wanting to and helping and helping it drive their business as long as it drives ours. That's our goal, and monetization model is just kind of a tool in there."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Sam and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Zillow Group Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Berning, Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.\nBrad Berning: Thank you, Sam. Good afternoon and welcome to Zillow Group's second quarter 2022 conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Zillow Group's Co-Founder and CEO, Rich Barton; and CFO, Allen Parker.  During today's call, we'll make forward-looking statements about our future performance and operating plans based on current expectations and assumptions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and we encourage you to consider the risk factors described in our SEC filings for additional information. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events, except as required by law. This call is being broadcast on the Internet and is accessible on our Investor Relations website. Recording the call will be available later today. During the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA which we will refer to as EBITDA. We encourage you to read our shareholder letter and our earnings release which can be found on our Investor Relations website, as they contain important information about our GAAP and non-GAAP results, including reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, please note, we will refer to our Internet, Media & Technology segment as our IMT segment.  We will now open the call with remarks followed by live Q&A. And with that, I turn the call over to you, Rich.\nRich Barton: Thank you, Brad. Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you and your families are enjoying some summer, along with your work. The Blue Angels are tearing holes in the sky here around Seattle today in preparation for the Indy 500 of Jet hydrofoil races on Lake Washington. I know you all know it, seafair. That's this weekend, so they're practicing. If it gets loud in the background, it's not because I'm watching Top Gun. Anyway, thanks for joining us on this busy, busy earnings day. I'm happy to have the opportunity to share Zillow's progress with you. But first, I'd like to zoom out and examine the state of the housing market.  As we previewed last quarter, the housing market is rebalancing after a pandemic-fueled couple of years that were characterized by low interest rates, strong customer demand and historically low inventory levels. We are in a very different market today. Affordability has become very challenging for buyers. The compounding of unprecedented home price appreciation over the past few years and a rapid increase in mortgage rates has resulted in new mortgage payments relative to income spiking back to near 2006 peak levels. This rapidly changing affordability picture has impacted home shoppers' ability to find an affordable and an acceptable option, driving buyer sentiment to a 20-year low. Reduced buyer demand has cooled the previously red hot sellers\u2019 market.  Across the industry, we are seeing price growth meaningfully soften on pending sales and new mortgage applications with for-sale inventory levels rising as homes spend more time on the market. Ultimately, when combining all of these factors, the housing industry total transaction dollar volume was flat year-over-year in Q2, while various leading indicators deteriorated. Despite demand indicators stabilizing in July compared to June, we expect second half 2022 total industry transaction volume to meaningfully contract year-over-year.  Despite a challenging housing environment that we cannot control, we are as confident as ever in what we can control, executing on a strategy and a product road map that we believe will drive outsized transaction share gains, outsized revenue per transaction and profitable growth over time. Earlier this year, we introduced a product road map in a set of 2025 financial targets that are oriented around increasing engagement, increasing transactions and increasing revenue per transaction. The path to achieving those targets and beginning to build out our vision involves product initiatives within 5 growth pillars: financing, touring, seller solutions, integrating our services and enhancing our partner network.  Today, we are reporting in line consolidated results that demonstrate Zillow is on firm ground and well positioned for long-term growth. Our core IMT segment met the low end of our revenue expectations while exceeding the midpoint of our EBITDA guidance as we effectively invested in our growth pillars while actively managing costs. Our solid footing is underpinned by a cash balance of $3.5 billion as of the end of Q2, an increase from $3.1 billion at the end of 2021, even after nearly $600 million in stock repurchases over the first half of this year.  Our balance sheet is healthy and we produce operating cash. We are well equipped for the challenges an uncertain macro environment can throw at us and have the ability to invest in our long-term vision and strategy. On top of that, we are a leader in a huge industry. We have a big, strong, trusted brand and we have a large, passionate and engaged audience.  Apartment and house hunting is aspirational and entertaining as well as practical. Just last week, Google Play named Zillow one of the \"10 apps that defined a generation\" alongside such iconic app brands as Uber, Venmo, Instagram and Zoom. This recognition complements what we observe in the traffic numbers, that our brand is a part of people's everyday lives. Dreaming and shopping on Zillow, Trulia and StreetEasy doesn't stop because of a poor housing macro outlook. Our business model is ultimately driven by transactions, yes. But it is our relationship with our customers between transactions that is and always has been our advantage.  Given the macro outlook, I am relieved we are no longer carrying the capital and asset risk of iBuying on our balance sheet. The wind down of this business exceeded our expectations in terms of both the speed of home sales on our small remaining inventory and the profit outcomes for these sales. We paid down all outstanding iBuying debt in Q2 and substantially completed the associated workforce reduction and are now at the tail end of the wind down. Allen will provide more details later in the call but I'd like to briefly speak about how we are shoring up our employee base, given what's happening in the macro and labor market for tech talent.  The drop in stock price which we've all felt has resulted in actual compensation being much lower than planned and on-hire compensation for the many Zillow employees who receive a meaningful portion of their compensation in equity. And despite what you may hear, it is a highly competitive job market for tech and product talent which means it's unsettlingly easy for a skilled employee to get a significant compensation bump and an equity reset simply by switching jobs. Our people create the great products and services that have grown a huge successful brand and will fuel our future growth. Practically speaking, it would be more expensive to recruit and replace valuable employees tomorrow than it will be to retain folks today.  Attrition and churn is an insidious barrier to growth and by minimizing avoidable barriers, we are in a better position to achieve our goals. With that considered, we have made the decision to issue an off-cycle RSU grant to partially top up total compensation, particularly for those in the most competitive job categories. We will also reprice a small portion of the total outstanding stock options, those that are far out of the money. Allen will get into how we expect this off-cycle comp action to impact our financials but it will likely result in about 2% dilution spread over a couple of years.  Most of us on this call have felt the pain of a rapid and large stock drop in our stock price. Obviously, I am a large shareholder personally and have felt this first-hand. And we'll note that neither I nor our Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, Lloyd Frink, nor our Board of Directors is included in this special comp action. The Board and I have approved these equity initiatives because it is smart business and it recognizes the importance of retaining talent and aligning their compensation with the long-term interest of shareholders and I hope you'll agree with and understand our decision. Allen will talk more about capital management but I'll note here that we will repurchase shares under our existing share buyback program in the near term to cover the potential future dilution from this comp action, all while continuing to be opportunistic about additional potential share repurchases.  Now on to future growth and what we're doing to fuel our go-forward business and our vision for the Housing Super App. We have turned the page strategically and operationally to focus our efforts on building a single platform of integrated digital solutions that will serve more customers in our funnel. And we are making investments in these future growth initiatives. Why? Because we see big opportunity.  While almost everyone starts their real estate journey using Zillow products and services, we monetize only about 3% of real estate transactions. That gap represents huge potential energy, potential growth opportunity for us to expand share. And our strategy to get there is sound. Each pillar in our product road map, financing, touring, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services is important to building the ecosystem we envision and sets us up to reach our goals of increasing engagement, increasing transactions and increasing revenue per transaction.  Implicit in execution of this strategy is a healthy top of funnel which we are growing even in this unpredictable housing market. In Q2, Zillow Group apps and sites had 234 million average monthly unique users, up 2% year-over-year, with visits up 5% year-over-year. The number of monthly active users on our Zillow mobile app remains 3x the size of our closest competitor. And this quarter, our rentals traffic has once again grown, up 31% year-over-year with 27 million average monthly unique users per com score. The health at the top of the funnel is a powerful differentiator that comes from years of building great products for our customers and it gives us confidence in our long-term growth thesis, regardless of the short-term challenges that arise from the uncertain housing market.  We're also making strides towards providing a suite of seller services in our ecosystem. Today, we are announcing we struck an exclusive multiyear partnership with Opendoor. This partnership gives Zillow customers the ability to get a cash offer on their home, connecting the Premier real estate brand and audience with the Premier iBuyer brand and operation.  In addition to the direct economic opportunities associated with this partnership, there are numerous strategic benefits for us. First, when fully rolled out, we will be able to service sellers across more than 50 markets in the U.S. This expands our addressable market and allows us to create a suite of seller services over time to complement Opendoor's cash offer program.  Second, as we build out complementary seller offerings, we will be able to connect Premier Agents with interested sellers that are looking to sell their home in the traditional way. Third, we will be able to offer a bundle for sellers who are also buyers which opens up meaningful opportunities for us across agent transactions and adjacent services like mortgage and title and escrow.  Now I'll get more specific on how we expect the customer experience to work as we roll out the partnership. We'll offer customers the ability to get a cash offer on their home details page on Zillow which we know is a compelling call to action and provides us a high-intent seller signal. Once a customer shows interest in getting a cash offer, a licensed Zillow adviser will be available to talk each customer through a variety of selling options, including the cash offer from Opendoor.  For customers who choose to sell directly to Opendoor, Zillow will receive a referral fee. For customers who decide they want to sell, traditionally, we will connect to them with the Zillow Premier Agent partner. For customers looking to sell their existing home and buy a new home, we will offer a package where they can buy their next home with the Zillow Premier Agent, finance with Zillow Home Loans and close with Zillow Closing Services while selling their existing home to Opendoor.  Throughout this future customer experience, Zillow will be the primary -- be in the primary advisory role, helping our customers choose the best option for them while growing our business in the capital-light manner we described when we exited being an iBuyer primary. Offering more products and services to more of our customers is a core tenet of our long-term strategy and this partnership is a significant step in that direction.  Finally, as we have said before, solutions within the Zillow ecosystem will be a combination of ones we build, partner on or buy, focusing on solutions that meet our high standards and serve our customers with products and services they need. This partnership with Opendoor is a great example of the many opportunities available to us in building out an ecosystem of end-to-end customer solutions and our commitment to making it easier for customers to transact in real estate. We see this partnership as a significant win for customers, for Zillow and for Opendoor. And we are excited to roll out the experience in the coming months.  Next up on our road map is touring which is a key moment in the real estate process that is historically logistically challenging for buyers, sellers and their agents. It also indicates high customer intent and is the point of sale for buyers' agents. We discussed last quarter that we are beginning to enable real-time availability of tours through ShowingTime for our agent-facing interfaces and the early adoption signals were positive.  Today, we are happy to say that we rolled out this capability across the country with more than 250 markets now enabled with real-time availability of tours on ShowingTime, including a new integration on StreetEasy that allows agents to access ShowingTime directly on New York City sales listings. Now, 4 months after introducing real-time availability, 74% of listings in markets where it's enabled are participating. This means that for all participating homes, the true calendar for buyer tours will soon be available on ShowingTime partner websites. The ease that real-time availability has brought to tour scheduling to date is a win for all involved and it enables agents to quickly help high-intent customers find and win their next home.  Separately, many incremental improvements we've made to Zillow's apps and sites have contributed to driving growth in the share of connections that come from tour requests to nearly 50%, up from less than 33% this time last year. Our future goal is to create a frictionless touring experience for buyers and sellers themselves, not only for their agents by integrating the ShowingTime functionality on our customer-facing apps and sites, making it as easy for a shopper to book a home tour as it is to book a restaurant reservation online.  Last on our product road map for this quarter is financing. We believe we have an opportunity to be a substantial purchase mortgage originator, given the many millions of customers who inquire about financing on Zillow on an annual basis. We have major work to do up and down the stack and out towards partners. But at the top of the funnel, we have begun to make the changes to our apps and sites, designed to capture and convert a portion of the huge mortgage shopping signal we have into Zillow Home Loans. As a result, pre-approvals for purchase mortgages doubled from January to June and our purchase origination volume grew 58% sequentially in Q2. The absolute numbers are still small but these are good signals for the opportunity in front of us as we build out our digital mortgage offering.  Importantly, when we lead with mortgage as our initial customer offering, we have found that a vast majority of customers do not yet have an agent. This gives us confidence that we can offer our customers both a great mortgage experience on Zillow and introduce them to a trusted Premier Agent partner who is happy to meet a buyer who already has financing lined up and understands what she can afford.  Of course, we are early in our journey from a small call center-focused mortgage business originally built to support the financing needs for iBuying customers, to a large digital purchase originator serving millions of customers. As we transition, we need to build digital tools for customers that are native in our asset sites, technology to support customers across our platform as well as efficient tools for loan officers and agents to serve these customers with a high level of transparency and integration between all parties.  The early indicators are promising but we won't scale without having the key foundational components in place to enable us to scale profitably on the margin. We are making a significant investment in our financing growth pillar by Zillow Home Loans. As it is a critical enabler for the integrated transaction experience, we believe future movers will demand and get. Customers are already coming to Zillow for mortgage advice. They inherently trust our brand and are looking to understand what they can afford before they take a tour and meet their Premier Agent.  As you can tell, I am excited about our current initiatives but I'm also excited about the new products, features and services yet to be announced during the remainder of 2022. We will continue to update you all as we progress.  Before I hand it over to Allen, I recognize the past few years in housing has been unpredictable, uncertain and unlike anything we've seen before. But we are making progress on our growth investments. And when I look at the strength of our brand, our audience, our proven profitable business model and cash flow, I am confident we can alter the way people transact in real estate across the U.S. for the better which we expect will deliver outstanding long-term results for our company, our employees and our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn it over to Allen.\nAllen Parker: Thank you, Rich and hello, everyone. We are making progress against our 5 growth pillars and believe we are well positioned to continue building innovative products and integrated services to help our broader set of customers navigate finding and winning their next home. We believe our continued focus on executing on what we can control, delivering better customer experiences as well as driving improved partner efficiency and productivity will drive increased transaction share, increase revenue per transaction and shareholder value. Moving on to our financial results. The housing market performed at the lower end of the range we expected during Q2, with flat year-over-year estimated total industry transaction dollar volumes. Despite this macro pressure, we delivered IMT segment and consolidated results in line with our outlook for both revenue and EBITDA.  IMT segment revenue was $475 million, flat year-over-year. Premier Agent revenue decreased 5% year-over-year, impacted by macro housing market factors, including interest rates and home price increases as well as tight inventory levels. Rentals revenue was down 3% year-over-year and up 16% sequentially from Q1, better than our expectations. We continue to see pressure from high occupancy rates which dampened overall demand for rentals advertising. However, we did see signs of improvement in the rentals market with occupancy rates easing and customer demand remaining healthy.  IMT segment EBITDA was $186 million for Q2 or 39% of revenue, exceeding the midpoint of our outlook range of $182 million and 38% of revenue. The outperformance was driven by a combination of active cost management to drive operating efficiencies as well as lower advertising and marketing costs. Mortgages segment revenue of $29 million was slightly below the low end of our outlook range of $31 million as rapid increases in interest rates negatively impacted refinancing loan originations and demand in our mortgages marketplace more than expected.  As Rich mentioned, purchase financing is a key pillar of our 5 growth initiatives. We are moving from a captive audience with the former iBuying funnel to building a consumer-facing experience across the Zillow platform which requires additional tools and integration across our offerings. Our purchased loan origination volume grew 58% sequentially in Q2 as we make this transition. Mortgages segment EBITDA was a loss of $21 million, below the low end of our outlook for a loss of $18 million as we continue to invest in building the consumer-facing origination experience, internal tools and integration in the face of a really tough mortgage macro environment.  We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of cash and investments on the balance sheet, down slightly from $3.6 billion at the end of Q1 which includes the benefit from core operating cash flow and the continued wind down of iBuyer inventory and the impact of $249 million in share repurchases during Q2. Debt decreased to $1.7 billion from $2.5 billion at the end of Q1 after paying down all remaining iBuying debt for the quarter. Our cash position, core operating cash flow and now less capital-intensive operations give us the flexibility to continue to invest against our growth strategy as we look to efficiently navigate through the current macro environment.  Before I turn to our outlook for Q3, I would like to note that the resale of inventory from our iBuying business is nearly complete. We ended Q2 with 71 homes remaining in inventory. And currently, only 25 are not yet under contract to sell. We expect to substantially complete the wind down during Q3 and to report Zillow Offers as a discontinued operation beginning in Q3. As a result, the residual Zillow Offers revenue and noncontinuing costs are not reflected in our guidance ranges.  Turning to our outlook. In our IMT segment, we expect a 12% year -- expect a 12% year-over-year revenue decline in Q3 at the midpoint of our outlook range. Within the IMT segment, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be between $275 million to $295 million, down 21% year-over-year at the midpoint of our outlook range. While we continue to focus on connecting high-intent customers to all our partners, our Q3 Premier Agent revenue outlook is largely informed by the following macro housing trends that we believe are making it harder for customers to transact and also affect our partner network. Lower purchase demand driven by recent increases in interest rates which has made home purchases less affordable and is impacting our overall Premier Agent connection lead volume as well as lower home price appreciation driven by softening demand and inventory levels that are growing but still lower than before the pandemic.  Given tougher Q3 comparisons and demand trends stabilizing in July compared to June, we now expect industry growth to be down mid- to high teens year-over-year in Q3. Besides our own internal leading indicators, there are a few publicly available data sources we can point to that also suggest this.  The Mortgage Bankers Association's purchase mortgage application index is running down high teens year-over-year in the last several weeks, a deceleration from high single-digit percentage annual decline fell through most of Q1 and early Q2. The year-over-year growth in the average loan size of purchase mortgage originations, as published by the Mortgage Bankers Association, has also decelerated meaningfully in recent weeks to low single digits from double digits earlier in the quarter. This has historically been a directionally good leading indicator for existing average home price sales growth and the deceleration suggests we could see home price appreciation decelerate meaningfully in the second half of the year.  Also, the National Association of Realtors measure of June pending home sales, a leading indicator for July and August, was down 20% year-over-year. In Q3, we expect Premier Agent to be in line to slightly worse than the industry as we saw in Q2. Our monetization of leads and agent behavior tend to pace ahead of industry trends for closed transactions during periods of disruption. When the macro moves this quickly, agents buying advertising through our market-based pricing program tend to slow down spend as they see demand wane which shows up ahead of closed transactions and the resulting industry growth metrics. Flex revenue is recognized at the time of delivery of customer connections to Premier Agent Partners which also leads the timing of closed transactions and industry growth metrics.  In Rentals, we are expecting to return to positive year-over-year growth as we continue to see signs that low rental vacancies may be subsided. We expect Q3 IMT segment EBITDA margin to be 28% at the midpoint of our outlook. We believe our Q3 investment level is appropriate despite the headwinds in the market, given the significant growth opportunities ahead. The positive signals we are seeing in testing and the now accelerated seller solutions opportunity with the announcement of our partnership with Openbook.  We expect our Mortgage segment revenue to be between $22 million and $27 million in Q3 which is down sequentially from Q2. Our Q3 outlook reflects the higher mortgage rate environment that impacts refinance mortgage volumes as well as demand in our marketplace business. Our Q3 outlook also reflects sequential growth in purchase mortgages and flat to lower gain on sale spreads due to the competitive industry environment. We expect Mortgages segment EBITDA to be between a loss of $31 million and a loss of $26 million based on expected market conditions and additional investments to build tools and technology for both customers and agents as we integrate mortgages with our other products and services.  We are focused on being a growth company, driving outsized transaction share gains and increasing revenue per transaction. Our early learnings reinforce our confidence in our strategy. That said, we are fully aware of the macro-driven headwinds impacting our near-term revenue outlook and are carefully evaluating every dollar that we choose to invest. As we've done under previous times of dislocation, such as the start of the pandemic and as we wound down our iBuying operations, we will be vigilant and decisive as we control the levers of our operating costs and pace of investments. Our strong growth margin profile and the nature of our business enables us to manage cost dynamically through periods like this and we will continue to assess as we see fit with an eye towards profitable growth.  For Q3, the sequential increase in costs reflect an increase in spend across our key pillars, offset by cost savings of an estimated $15 million of operational costs from our prior Q3 plan. Again, I want to be really clear here. We are continuing to lean in on product development for our key growth pillars because we are seeing strong early signs of success on customers needing and desiring to work with Zillow and our partners on transactions. Our confidence is reflected in our willingness to run hard at these opportunities. We want to note that we do not expect a further acceleration of our investment levels in Q4 as we expect the costs assumed in our Q3 consolidated outlook to be reflective of our investment levels throughout the second half of 2022. We continue to control the levers and we will react accordingly.  And of course, we are always looking for cost efficiencies while running the business. For example, while our vision for a flexible workforce still involves holding office space across the country, we believe there are continued opportunities to reduce our facility square footage as we gain experience on what a more normalized Cloud HQ environment requires. We have reduced our square footage by nearly 30% compared to pre-pandemic levels and have another nearly 30% that we are currently not using, with a portion of that already on the market for potential sublease.  Lastly, I want to take a moment to briefly discuss some additional details regarding the employee retention plan that was also announced today and that will take effect on August 8. We expect this action will be dilutive on a net basis by about 2%, resulting in the issuance of an estimated 4.5 million to 6.5 million RSUs. We will also reprice approximately 7.5 million stock options. We estimate that this retention action will result in the recognition of an incremental $180 million to $190 million in share-based compensation expense in total. We estimate that this will contribute an additional $45 million to $50 million of share-based compensation in Q3. The remaining expense for the retention action will normalize in Q4 and be recognized largely over the next 2-year period with a small portion in year 3.  We believe a strong balance sheet and operating cash flow are what drive a sustainable growth business across cycles and give us the ability to invest and capture opportunities during periods of market weakness. Looking forward, we are more focused on cash flow generation.  With respect to capital structure, we have $850 million in our share buyback authorization. As Rich discussed, we will be active in the near term to cover the dilution from the additional RSUs related to the employee retention plan that we expect will vest over the next couple of years. We will also continue to be opportunistic with capital investment opportunities, including share repurchases.  As we look forward, our priorities remain focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners and we plan to grow our customer engagement through a compelling dream and shop experience; deliver a more integrated customer transactional experience to drive customers who choose to transact with us and our partners; invest in sustainable top line growth opportunities across the company including new integrated services that are more scalable, less subject to earnings volatility and more capital efficient; and manage our cost structure and improve productivity to drive a profitable, scalable and positive operating cash flow company.  And with that, operator, I'll turn it over to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] [Technical Difficulty]\nUnidentified Analyst: Share gains from the 3% to 6% you guys have in your 2025 plan. Can you guys share any evidence to date of incremental gains there either on the Flex side or on the MVP side? And then second, just as it relates to Opendoor, any sort of learnings you can bring from iBuying to that new partnership? And any sort of commentary there on the partnership?\nRich Barton: Do you want to start, Allen, with the market share stuff? And maybe I'll finish with the Open.\nAllen Parker: Yes. Logan, thanks for the question. Listen, I think it's impossible for us to make any predictions or estimates on market share gains given the dislocation and volatility in the market and the fact that these cohorts take a while to play out. What I would say is that when you think about the targets that we provided earlier in the year and our 2025 vision to move from 3% market segment share transactions to 6%, we feel really good based on the early signs across our 5 growth pillars that we have an opportunity to continue to drive purchase originations and financing and leveraging our agent partner network and the integration between those 2. And so we feel really good about market share, as we discussed at our targets. It's just impossible to predict market share in this near term.\nRich Barton: And Logan, it is difficult even historically to get a handle our market share right now because the metrics are moving around a lot as well. But as I said, I'll pile on Allen a little bit. And as I said in my remarks, what we're looking at are the kind of inputs and early signs that we can get our growth initiatives working for us and driving up our transaction share. And the results we're seeing from our touring integration right now lighting up real-time tour availability is a precursor to transaction share gains. I was talking about how we've gone from basically 0 to 250 markets on real-time availability with ShowingTime here in the last 4 months. Connections are representing 50% of our -- sorry, tour requests representing 50%, 5-0 percent of our tour request now. That's another good one. On the financing side, pre-approvals double for purchase mortgages. Purchase originations are up 58% sequentially. The pre-approvals was doubling over the last 6 months. Small numbers but these are really good early signals for us that give us confidence.  On the Opendoor and iBuying thing, yes, of course, we invested quite a bit of time and treasure and IQ in figuring out how to integrate the cash offer into our home details page and our user flow to attract sellers to interact with us. And all of those learnings can be brought to bear on this Opendoor partnership that we're really excited about which is interesting because it involves deep integration of the Opendoor offering into our set of services that gives us the opportunity to kind of quarterback the process and introduce our customers who request an Opendoor cash offer, introduce them to Premier Agents, mortgages, Zillow closing service is a myriad of other things that we have our hands on. So we're excited about controlling this, what we call multiple selling option interface, with the customer because this is what sellers sit down and they are faced with multiple different selling options. And our ability to control and influence and advise at that really important point in the move is key.\nAllen Parker: And maybe I'll just close, Logan, just finally on the color. First question. I said I'll close, Logan, on your first question, that our revenue guidance is really driven by the current macro volatility and variability and we feel really good about our opportunities long term across our growth strategies.\nOperator: I'm going to go back to Ryan McKeveny of Zelman. Ryan?\nRyan McKeveny: Yes. Can you guys hear me now?\nRich Barton: Yes.\nRyan McKeveny: Can you guys hear me now?\nRich Barton: Yes.\nRyan McKeveny: Can you guys hear me now?\nRich Barton: Yes, yes, Ryan. Yes, yes.\nRyan McKeveny: I'm so sorry. So sorry. I did not have a Blue Angel going by. I'm just having phone issues, so I apologize about that. So I cut out and redialled, so I apologize if I missed this but I heard the answer you gave about the confidence in the market share outlook going forward. If I think about the margin side of things and the levers that you control on the cost side and, ultimately, the margin profile. When we think about that longer-term vision and the opportunity for just company-wide margin improvement, obviously, the macro has changed. But if you could just give us a sense, big picture of how much is the margin profile dependent on the macro environment? Or are there enough just levers in the business. And ultimately, you invest today, you get the returns in the future that the longer-term outlook, even under a more challenging macro environment, it would still be one of ultimately getting to solid margin improvement going forward?\nAllen Parker: Yes. Yes, I'll take that. Thanks, Ryan. Yes. I mean I think if you think about long term, our outlook of the margin profile, I mean, we're very excited about where we're positioned and having a business model that has high gross margin. And so the share gain and increasing revenue per share, we believe, is a very leveraged model over time as that happens. So -- and we believe, given the traffic and the number of customers who start with our site and the low share we have now, that over time, even as macro contracts and expand, we participate and can grow into that as we build these processes and get financing these 5 pillars going. So we're very bullish on the return these investments can deliver as we grow share in revenue per transaction because our model is built to be a high-margin model.\nRyan McKeveny: That's great. Sorry about the phone issues.\nOperator: Thank you, Ryan. The next question comes from John Colantuoni with Jefferies. John, your line is open.\nJohn Colantuoni: Can you just start by giving us a bit more detail on how agents are reacting to the changing housing market so far in terms of making changes to their advertising strategy more broadly and specific to the Premier Agent program. On the one hand, they have less deals happening, so maybe that's making it harder for agents to find new clients. But agents are also closing less transactions, so they have less cash coming in to spend on advertising. So I'm just curious how to get your perspective on how those 2 countervailing factors are impacting the Premier Agent business? And I have a follow-up.\nAllen Parker: Do you want me to take that, Rich?\nRich Barton: I think so, Allen. Yes.\nAllen Parker: Okay. I mean I think how I would describe it as we look out into our agent population, our goal is to continue to connect high-intent customers with high-performing agents. And as we called out in our touring metric and the increase, we believe we're continuing to take actions and invest in doing so to get the agent and the customer connected at the right time. And that's why we also are so bullish on financing because having a preapproved customer is actually also very positive for the agent connection. In today's macro, what we're seeing, I think, as we saw the macro deteriorate relatively rapidly is that transactions -- and as affordability issues increased, we saw customer demand go down. So as agents saw demand go down and longer cycles for their customers to close, we saw them start to react by cutting spend. And so we still have a very strong population of agents in our network and we probably saw the tail reduce quicker than some of those agents that are performing really well for us and our customers. But their natural reaction at a time like this is to reduce their advertising spend somewhat as a protection. And then as we continue to show that we can provide high-intent customers that can convert, we expect that to increase again.\nJohn Colantuoni: Okay, great. And I wanted to ask one on the Opendoor partnership. Is there any way you can give us a sense for how quickly you expect to ramp the partnership? And how we should think about the pathway to scaling the product over time, what sort of investments you need to make to get that partnership where you want it in the long run? And if possible, is there any chance you can give us a bit more detail on the economic sharing of the partnership how any referrals work or anything like that? Any details you can provide would be helpful.\nRich Barton: You want me to start, Allen?\nAllen Parker: Yes.\nRich Barton: Yes, we're not -- okay. So John, we're not disclosing the economics of -- the specific economics of that. Obviously, it's based in a referral fee at its simplest but this relationship and partnership goes way deeper than that. This isn't just a lead gen distribution deal. This is going to be a deep integration. And given the -- what we envision from an integration perspective, it will take a minute to get fully up and running. Brad, I don't know if we're saying anything about timing?\nBrad Berning: No, not specific, because obviously, it's going to take us a little bit of time for the integration, as you said.\nRich Barton: Yes, it will take some time. But we're really focused on getting the customer experience right. And then, I guess, just stay tuned to this channel.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Jack [ph] on for Deepak. Two quick ones, if I may. Given the traffic and visits to the site are growing even in 2Q, how should we think about the factors that are impacting our Premier Agent revenue growth? And then kind of second lien related on the Opendoor partnership, I think it's super interesting and makes a lot of sense. Are you guys worried at all about this partnership maybe cannibalizing the Premiere Agent sell-side revenue as well. I think this kind of go hand in hand.\nRich Barton: I didn't quite hear the first one, Allen, did you get it?\nAllen Parker: The first one was related to with traffic and visits growing, I think it was how do you square that with the Premier Agent revenue forecast of down 21% for the quarter.\nRich Barton: You want to go that?\nAllen Parker: I mean -- and again, a thanks for the question. I think, one, we clearly -- people still are very interested and we believe there is demand for people to move but affordability and high interest rate has had a near-term impact on transactions, along with the fact that we had very steep home price appreciation for a period of time. And so affordability was a problem. And so we have a lot of people coming to shop and Dream and we called out that we also have growing rentals traffic even in light of the high occupancy rates which, again, just shows very strong demand. And in fact, a lot of renters are also looking to buy, so that's a helpful effect as well. So we believe that having that engagement and traffic and people coming to our sites on a regular basis is -- puts us in a great position as we think about ways to improve our transaction share and drive higher-intent customers to our agents. But this is really just a dislocation driven by a lot of macro features that we've just seen a very volatile market environment over the last few years and we've got to work through that. But I would say it's a positive on the traffic and engagement but the macro is what's driving the revenue guide that we've provided for Q3.\nRich Barton: And Jack, on your question about worried about cannibalization, absolutely not. We're not worried about cannibalization at all, putting the Opendoor partnership in place and getting a whole lot more hands raised on the seller side from our home details pages to start the process quite the opposite. It will increase. We anticipate it will increase Premier Agent business as well as Mortgage business and others. We have some experience with that already, as you may or may not remember, with our own iBuying operations. So that is our expectation.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless with Wedbush.\nJay McCanless: The first one I had, when mortgage rates were moving up earlier this year, was there a point when you passed, say, 4%, 4.5% where you really saw a drop-off in activity and interest level from customers. Just wondering if we're on the reverse of this now and rates are coming back down is there a rate or area of rates we should keep in mind where demand might pick up.\nRich Barton: Yes, Allen, go ahead.\nAllen Parker: I'll start with it. I mean I think with respect to our marketplace business and the refinancing that we were doing, there is obviously a parity level where rates are higher than as such level that refinancing no longer makes sense. And obviously, that demand saw a big tick down. With respect to purchase, I think right now that the customers are trying to understand what may happen. And I think we do have so either hesitation or kind of sidelines waiting to see what will be a sustaining rate. And I think once we get to a point where it's kind of a normalized or sustaining rate, we're going to see volume pick back up because it will become the new normal. And then depending on where it got to, we may see additional refi volume as it kicks back down. So I don't think there's a magic number. Affordability, as Rich called out, the average mortgage monthly payment is -- has grown but it was off of historically low rates. So I do think it will normalize. And when it stabilizes and we get a little more certainty as to what the interest rate environment looks like going forward, we'll start to see more people come in because they'll be more comfortable with the stabilized rates.\nJay McCanless: Okay, that's great. The second question I had -- just you talked about how in some of these markets inventory is starting to grow again. And do you have any kind of color as to whether or not this inventory is at or below median price for a given market? Or is it much more expensive than the local median price. Just wondering if -- we know the rates aren't helping but if the product coming back to market is more first time, first move reasonably priced product, that's something else that might be a tailwind that people aren't thinking about right now.\nBrad Berning: Let me start on that one, Rich. Yes. I think -- this is Brad. We're seeing on the higher price points and higher price point markets that there's been more of a deceleration and more of a deterioration in home prices as inventory is moving up. So I think the lower end and medium kind of price points, we're still seeing fairly rapid relative to historical norms -- price as we with price and velocity.\nJay McCanless: In terms of the inventory coming back to market at those lower and medium ones or just the prices on those going on?\nBrad Berning: Yes, the lower median price -- yes, exactly. On the lower median price points, you're seeing still pretty rapid from listing to pending sale.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of John Campbell with Stephens Inc.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is A.J. stepping in for John Campbell. First set here, just a couple on ShowingTime. Just wanted to see kind of what the underlying ShowingTime revenues looking like since the acquisition. Are they still in a fast-growth mode there? And secondly, can you talk to how far along you are in the integration journey was ShowingTime and just how tightly that's integrated along Premier Agent at this point?\nRich Barton: Do you want to start with revenue?\nAllen Parker: Yes. Yes. So what I would say is that ShowingTime is a critical part of our integration and development of touring for our customers. Rich can talk about the integration. With respect to revenues, what we're really looking at is coverage. And since we've acquired ShowingTime, we have been relatively consistent in the number of listings that we've been able to cover. It's vastly a little bit. There's some competitive elements out there but we've been relatively successful at proving the value of ShowingTime. But ShowingTime, we don't disclose selling times revenue in total but it's not -- the revenue itself is not over the driving factor of our strategic acquisition of ShowingTime. It's the ability to have coverage of all listings or as many listings as possible in any given market.\nRich Barton: Yes. I'll pile on and say I'm really pleased with the way ShowingTime has held its coverage and the way it's rapidly shipped new product and feature sets. Specifically impressive is this real-time availability that I chatted about in the script but it basically enables agents to use ShowingTime to see -- to schedule home tours digitally so they can actually see what touring times are available while avoiding a whole bunch of the kind of phone tag snarl that existed prior to real-time availability. It's only been rolled out a short period of time, just maybe 4 months. And we have 74% of the listings that are eligible for this have signed up to enable it which is a really -- the snowball is rolling down the hill on this one which I'm super excited about. That's the beginning. The big dream really is to now turn it into OpenTable for home tours, right? So to crack open that home tour reservation interface directly to consumers and stay tuned for that. We'll have more to come in the future but it's an important product initiative. So, I'm really pleased overall with the integration. I'll also lob a little -- shine a little spotlight on a terrific rich media product we have at Zillow as well that's doing quite well which enables 3D tours and robotically -- mostly robotically generated floor plans to create an amazing virtual touring experience which we think will be table stakes in the relatively near future for listing. So we have a fantastic platform product that we offer the industry at large and a lot of ShowingTime partners as well. I hope that answers your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, that's great. Secondly, here, on the rental business, you spoke to improving conditions there. So the clarity is much appreciated. But -- maybe touching on StreetEasy. How do you guys feel your position relative to CoStar's new City Snap offering?\nRich Barton: We feel really good. StreetEasy is really the brand in New York City. It has incredibly high customer engagement. But maybe even more interestingly, it is the platform that most brokers in New York City use to manage their inventory. And so we're in an incredibly strong position there, have a really rich and mature feature set there. So feel terrific competitively in New York.\nOperator: This completes the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Rich Barton for any closing remarks.\nRich Barton: All right. Thank you guys for joining us. Try to get back to your summers. I'm going to turn and watch the Blue Angels. We'll talk to you again soon.\nOperator: That concludes the Zillow Group second quarter 2022 earnings call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rich Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad. Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you and your families are enjoying some summer, along with your work. The Blue Angels are tearing holes in the sky here around Seattle today in preparation for the Indy 500 of Jet hydrofoil races on Lake Washington. I know you all know it, seafair. That's this weekend, so they're practicing. If it gets loud in the background, it's not because I'm watching Top Gun. Anyway, thanks for joining us on this busy, busy earnings day. I'm happy to have the opportunity to share Zillow's progress with you. But first, I'd like to zoom out and examine the state of the housing market.  As we previewed last quarter, the housing market is rebalancing after a pandemic-fueled couple of years that were characterized by low interest rates, strong customer demand and historically low inventory levels. We are in a very different market today. Affordability has become very challenging for buyers. The compounding of unprecedented home price appreciation over the past few years and a rapid increase in mortgage rates has resulted in new mortgage payments relative to income spiking back to near 2006 peak levels. This rapidly changing affordability picture has impacted home shoppers' ability to find an affordable and an acceptable option, driving buyer sentiment to a 20-year low. Reduced buyer demand has cooled the previously red hot sellers' market.  Across the industry, we are seeing price growth meaningfully soften on pending sales and new mortgage applications with for-sale inventory levels rising as homes spend more time on the market. Ultimately, when combining all of these factors, the housing industry total transaction dollar volume was flat year-over-year in Q2, while various leading indicators deteriorated. Despite demand indicators stabilizing in July compared to June, we expect second half 2022 total industry transaction volume to meaningfully contract year-over-year.  Despite a challenging housing environment that we cannot control, we are as confident as ever in what we can control, executing on a strategy and a product road map that we believe will drive outsized transaction share gains, outsized revenue per transaction and profitable growth over time. Earlier this year, we introduced a product road map in a set of 2025 financial targets that are oriented around increasing engagement, increasing transactions and increasing revenue per transaction. The path to achieving those targets and beginning to build out our vision involves product initiatives within 5 growth pillars: financing, touring, seller solutions, integrating our services and enhancing our partner network.  Today, we are reporting in line consolidated results that demonstrate Zillow is on firm ground and well positioned for long-term growth. Our core IMT segment met the low end of our revenue expectations while exceeding the midpoint of our EBITDA guidance as we effectively invested in our growth pillars while actively managing costs. Our solid footing is underpinned by a cash balance of $3.5 billion as of the end of Q2, an increase from $3.1 billion at the end of 2021, even after nearly $600 million in stock repurchases over the first half of this year.  Our balance sheet is healthy and we produce operating cash. We are well equipped for the challenges an uncertain macro environment can throw at us and have the ability to invest in our long-term vision and strategy. On top of that, we are a leader in a huge industry. We have a big, strong, trusted brand and we have a large, passionate and engaged audience.  Apartment and house hunting is aspirational and entertaining as well as practical. Just last week, Google Play named Zillow one of the \"10 apps that defined a generation\" alongside such iconic app brands as Uber, Venmo, Instagram and Zoom. This recognition complements what we observe in the traffic numbers, that our brand is a part of people's everyday lives. Dreaming and shopping on Zillow, Trulia and StreetEasy doesn't stop because of a poor housing macro outlook. Our business model is ultimately driven by transactions, yes. But it is our relationship with our customers between transactions that is and always has been our advantage.  Given the macro outlook, I am relieved we are no longer carrying the capital and asset risk of iBuying on our balance sheet. The wind down of this business exceeded our expectations in terms of both the speed of home sales on our small remaining inventory and the profit outcomes for these sales. We paid down all outstanding iBuying debt in Q2 and substantially completed the associated workforce reduction and are now at the tail end of the wind down. Allen will provide more details later in the call but I'd like to briefly speak about how we are shoring up our employee base, given what's happening in the macro and labor market for tech talent.  The drop in stock price which we've all felt has resulted in actual compensation being much lower than planned and on-hire compensation for the many Zillow employees who receive a meaningful portion of their compensation in equity. And despite what you may hear, it is a highly competitive job market for tech and product talent which means it's unsettlingly easy for a skilled employee to get a significant compensation bump and an equity reset simply by switching jobs. Our people create the great products and services that have grown a huge successful brand and will fuel our future growth. Practically speaking, it would be more expensive to recruit and replace valuable employees tomorrow than it will be to retain folks today.  Attrition and churn is an insidious barrier to growth and by minimizing avoidable barriers, we are in a better position to achieve our goals. With that considered, we have made the decision to issue an off-cycle RSU grant to partially top up total compensation, particularly for those in the most competitive job categories. We will also reprice a small portion of the total outstanding stock options, those that are far out of the money. Allen will get into how we expect this off-cycle comp action to impact our financials but it will likely result in about 2% dilution spread over a couple of years.  Most of us on this call have felt the pain of a rapid and large stock drop in our stock price. Obviously, I am a large shareholder personally and have felt this first-hand. And we'll note that neither I nor our Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, Lloyd Frink, nor our Board of Directors is included in this special comp action. The Board and I have approved these equity initiatives because it is smart business and it recognizes the importance of retaining talent and aligning their compensation with the long-term interest of shareholders and I hope you'll agree with and understand our decision. Allen will talk more about capital management but I'll note here that we will repurchase shares under our existing share buyback program in the near term to cover the potential future dilution from this comp action, all while continuing to be opportunistic about additional potential share repurchases.  Now on to future growth and what we're doing to fuel our go-forward business and our vision for the Housing Super App. We have turned the page strategically and operationally to focus our efforts on building a single platform of integrated digital solutions that will serve more customers in our funnel. And we are making investments in these future growth initiatives. Why? Because we see big opportunity.  While almost everyone starts their real estate journey using Zillow products and services, we monetize only about 3% of real estate transactions. That gap represents huge potential energy, potential growth opportunity for us to expand share. And our strategy to get there is sound. Each pillar in our product road map, financing, touring, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services is important to building the ecosystem we envision and sets us up to reach our goals of increasing engagement, increasing transactions and increasing revenue per transaction.  Implicit in execution of this strategy is a healthy top of funnel which we are growing even in this unpredictable housing market. In Q2, Zillow Group apps and sites had 234 million average monthly unique users, up 2% year-over-year, with visits up 5% year-over-year. The number of monthly active users on our Zillow mobile app remains 3x the size of our closest competitor. And this quarter, our rentals traffic has once again grown, up 31% year-over-year with 27 million average monthly unique users per com score. The health at the top of the funnel is a powerful differentiator that comes from years of building great products for our customers and it gives us confidence in our long-term growth thesis, regardless of the short-term challenges that arise from the uncertain housing market.  We're also making strides towards providing a suite of seller services in our ecosystem. Today, we are announcing we struck an exclusive multiyear partnership with Opendoor. This partnership gives Zillow customers the ability to get a cash offer on their home, connecting the Premier real estate brand and audience with the Premier iBuyer brand and operation.  In addition to the direct economic opportunities associated with this partnership, there are numerous strategic benefits for us. First, when fully rolled out, we will be able to service sellers across more than 50 markets in the U.S. This expands our addressable market and allows us to create a suite of seller services over time to complement Opendoor's cash offer program.  Second, as we build out complementary seller offerings, we will be able to connect Premier Agents with interested sellers that are looking to sell their home in the traditional way. Third, we will be able to offer a bundle for sellers who are also buyers which opens up meaningful opportunities for us across agent transactions and adjacent services like mortgage and title and escrow.  Now I'll get more specific on how we expect the customer experience to work as we roll out the partnership. We'll offer customers the ability to get a cash offer on their home details page on Zillow which we know is a compelling call to action and provides us a high-intent seller signal. Once a customer shows interest in getting a cash offer, a licensed Zillow adviser will be available to talk each customer through a variety of selling options, including the cash offer from Opendoor.  For customers who choose to sell directly to Opendoor, Zillow will receive a referral fee. For customers who decide they want to sell, traditionally, we will connect to them with the Zillow Premier Agent partner. For customers looking to sell their existing home and buy a new home, we will offer a package where they can buy their next home with the Zillow Premier Agent, finance with Zillow Home Loans and close with Zillow Closing Services while selling their existing home to Opendoor.  Throughout this future customer experience, Zillow will be the primary -- be in the primary advisory role, helping our customers choose the best option for them while growing our business in the capital-light manner we described when we exited being an iBuyer primary. Offering more products and services to more of our customers is a core tenet of our long-term strategy and this partnership is a significant step in that direction.  Finally, as we have said before, solutions within the Zillow ecosystem will be a combination of ones we build, partner on or buy, focusing on solutions that meet our high standards and serve our customers with products and services they need. This partnership with Opendoor is a great example of the many opportunities available to us in building out an ecosystem of end-to-end customer solutions and our commitment to making it easier for customers to transact in real estate. We see this partnership as a significant win for customers, for Zillow and for Opendoor. And we are excited to roll out the experience in the coming months.  Next up on our road map is touring which is a key moment in the real estate process that is historically logistically challenging for buyers, sellers and their agents. It also indicates high customer intent and is the point of sale for buyers' agents. We discussed last quarter that we are beginning to enable real-time availability of tours through ShowingTime for our agent-facing interfaces and the early adoption signals were positive.  Today, we are happy to say that we rolled out this capability across the country with more than 250 markets now enabled with real-time availability of tours on ShowingTime, including a new integration on StreetEasy that allows agents to access ShowingTime directly on New York City sales listings. Now, 4 months after introducing real-time availability, 74% of listings in markets where it's enabled are participating. This means that for all participating homes, the true calendar for buyer tours will soon be available on ShowingTime partner websites. The ease that real-time availability has brought to tour scheduling to date is a win for all involved and it enables agents to quickly help high-intent customers find and win their next home.  Separately, many incremental improvements we've made to Zillow's apps and sites have contributed to driving growth in the share of connections that come from tour requests to nearly 50%, up from less than 33% this time last year. Our future goal is to create a frictionless touring experience for buyers and sellers themselves, not only for their agents by integrating the ShowingTime functionality on our customer-facing apps and sites, making it as easy for a shopper to book a home tour as it is to book a restaurant reservation online.  Last on our product road map for this quarter is financing. We believe we have an opportunity to be a substantial purchase mortgage originator, given the many millions of customers who inquire about financing on Zillow on an annual basis. We have major work to do up and down the stack and out towards partners. But at the top of the funnel, we have begun to make the changes to our apps and sites, designed to capture and convert a portion of the huge mortgage shopping signal we have into Zillow Home Loans. As a result, pre-approvals for purchase mortgages doubled from January to June and our purchase origination volume grew 58% sequentially in Q2. The absolute numbers are still small but these are good signals for the opportunity in front of us as we build out our digital mortgage offering.  Importantly, when we lead with mortgage as our initial customer offering, we have found that a vast majority of customers do not yet have an agent. This gives us confidence that we can offer our customers both a great mortgage experience on Zillow and introduce them to a trusted Premier Agent partner who is happy to meet a buyer who already has financing lined up and understands what she can afford.  Of course, we are early in our journey from a small call center-focused mortgage business originally built to support the financing needs for iBuying customers, to a large digital purchase originator serving millions of customers. As we transition, we need to build digital tools for customers that are native in our asset sites, technology to support customers across our platform as well as efficient tools for loan officers and agents to serve these customers with a high level of transparency and integration between all parties.  The early indicators are promising but we won't scale without having the key foundational components in place to enable us to scale profitably on the margin. We are making a significant investment in our financing growth pillar by Zillow Home Loans. As it is a critical enabler for the integrated transaction experience, we believe future movers will demand and get. Customers are already coming to Zillow for mortgage advice. They inherently trust our brand and are looking to understand what they can afford before they take a tour and meet their Premier Agent.  As you can tell, I am excited about our current initiatives but I'm also excited about the new products, features and services yet to be announced during the remainder of 2022. We will continue to update you all as we progress.  Before I hand it over to Allen, I recognize the past few years in housing has been unpredictable, uncertain and unlike anything we've seen before. But we are making progress on our growth investments. And when I look at the strength of our brand, our audience, our proven profitable business model and cash flow, I am confident we can alter the way people transact in real estate across the U.S. for the better which we expect will deliver outstanding long-term results for our company, our employees and our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn it over to Allen. Do you want to start, Allen, with the market share stuff? And maybe I'll finish with the Open. And Logan, it is difficult even historically to get a handle our market share right now because the metrics are moving around a lot as well. But as I said, I'll pile on Allen a little bit. And as I said in my remarks, what we're looking at are the kind of inputs and early signs that we can get our growth initiatives working for us and driving up our transaction share. And the results we're seeing from our touring integration right now lighting up real-time tour availability is a precursor to transaction share gains. I was talking about how we've gone from basically 0 to 250 markets on real-time availability with ShowingTime here in the last 4 months. Connections are representing 50% of our -- sorry, tour requests representing 50%, 5-0 percent of our tour request now. That's another good one. On the financing side, pre-approvals double for purchase mortgages. Purchase originations are up 58% sequentially. The pre-approvals was doubling over the last 6 months. Small numbers but these are really good early signals for us that give us confidence.  On the Opendoor and iBuying thing, yes, of course, we invested quite a bit of time and treasure and IQ in figuring out how to integrate the cash offer into our home details page and our user flow to attract sellers to interact with us. And all of those learnings can be brought to bear on this Opendoor partnership that we're really excited about which is interesting because it involves deep integration of the Opendoor offering into our set of services that gives us the opportunity to kind of quarterback the process and introduce our customers who request an Opendoor cash offer, introduce them to Premier Agents, mortgages, Zillow closing service is a myriad of other things that we have our hands on. So we're excited about controlling this, what we call multiple selling option interface, with the customer because this is what sellers sit down and they are faced with multiple different selling options. And our ability to control and influence and advise at that really important point in the move is key. Yes. Yes. Yes, yes, Ryan. Yes, yes. I think so, Allen. Yes. You want me to start, Allen? Yes, we're not -- okay. So John, we're not disclosing the economics of -- the specific economics of that. Obviously, it's based in a referral fee at its simplest but this relationship and partnership goes way deeper than that. This isn't just a lead gen distribution deal. This is going to be a deep integration. And given the -- what we envision from an integration perspective, it will take a minute to get fully up and running. Brad, I don't know if we're saying anything about timing? Yes, it will take some time. But we're really focused on getting the customer experience right. And then, I guess, just stay tuned to this channel. I didn't quite hear the first one, Allen, did you get it? You want to go that? And Jack, on your question about worried about cannibalization, absolutely not. We're not worried about cannibalization at all, putting the Opendoor partnership in place and getting a whole lot more hands raised on the seller side from our home details pages to start the process quite the opposite. It will increase. We anticipate it will increase Premier Agent business as well as Mortgage business and others. We have some experience with that already, as you may or may not remember, with our own iBuying operations. So that is our expectation. Yes, Allen, go ahead. Do you want to start with revenue? Yes. I'll pile on and say I'm really pleased with the way ShowingTime has held its coverage and the way it's rapidly shipped new product and feature sets. Specifically impressive is this real-time availability that I chatted about in the script but it basically enables agents to use ShowingTime to see -- to schedule home tours digitally so they can actually see what touring times are available while avoiding a whole bunch of the kind of phone tag snarl that existed prior to real-time availability. It's only been rolled out a short period of time, just maybe 4 months. And we have 74% of the listings that are eligible for this have signed up to enable it which is a really -- the snowball is rolling down the hill on this one which I'm super excited about. That's the beginning. The big dream really is to now turn it into OpenTable for home tours, right? So to crack open that home tour reservation interface directly to consumers and stay tuned for that. We'll have more to come in the future but it's an important product initiative. So, I'm really pleased overall with the integration. I'll also lob a little -- shine a little spotlight on a terrific rich media product we have at Zillow as well that's doing quite well which enables 3D tours and robotically -- mostly robotically generated floor plans to create an amazing virtual touring experience which we think will be table stakes in the relatively near future for listing. So we have a fantastic platform product that we offer the industry at large and a lot of ShowingTime partners as well. I hope that answers your question. We feel really good. StreetEasy is really the brand in New York City. It has incredibly high customer engagement. But maybe even more interestingly, it is the platform that most brokers in New York City use to manage their inventory. And so we're in an incredibly strong position there, have a really rich and mature feature set there. So feel terrific competitively in New York. All right. Thank you guys for joining us. Try to get back to your summers. I'm going to turn and watch the Blue Angels. We'll talk to you again soon."

            "name": "Allen Parker",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich and hello, everyone. We are making progress against our 5 growth pillars and believe we are well positioned to continue building innovative products and integrated services to help our broader set of customers navigate finding and winning their next home. We believe our continued focus on executing on what we can control, delivering better customer experiences as well as driving improved partner efficiency and productivity will drive increased transaction share, increase revenue per transaction and shareholder value. Moving on to our financial results. The housing market performed at the lower end of the range we expected during Q2, with flat year-over-year estimated total industry transaction dollar volumes. Despite this macro pressure, we delivered IMT segment and consolidated results in line with our outlook for both revenue and EBITDA.  IMT segment revenue was $475 million, flat year-over-year. Premier Agent revenue decreased 5% year-over-year, impacted by macro housing market factors, including interest rates and home price increases as well as tight inventory levels. Rentals revenue was down 3% year-over-year and up 16% sequentially from Q1, better than our expectations. We continue to see pressure from high occupancy rates which dampened overall demand for rentals advertising. However, we did see signs of improvement in the rentals market with occupancy rates easing and customer demand remaining healthy.  IMT segment EBITDA was $186 million for Q2 or 39% of revenue, exceeding the midpoint of our outlook range of $182 million and 38% of revenue. The outperformance was driven by a combination of active cost management to drive operating efficiencies as well as lower advertising and marketing costs. Mortgages segment revenue of $29 million was slightly below the low end of our outlook range of $31 million as rapid increases in interest rates negatively impacted refinancing loan originations and demand in our mortgages marketplace more than expected.  As Rich mentioned, purchase financing is a key pillar of our 5 growth initiatives. We are moving from a captive audience with the former iBuying funnel to building a consumer-facing experience across the Zillow platform which requires additional tools and integration across our offerings. Our purchased loan origination volume grew 58% sequentially in Q2 as we make this transition. Mortgages segment EBITDA was a loss of $21 million, below the low end of our outlook for a loss of $18 million as we continue to invest in building the consumer-facing origination experience, internal tools and integration in the face of a really tough mortgage macro environment.  We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of cash and investments on the balance sheet, down slightly from $3.6 billion at the end of Q1 which includes the benefit from core operating cash flow and the continued wind down of iBuyer inventory and the impact of $249 million in share repurchases during Q2. Debt decreased to $1.7 billion from $2.5 billion at the end of Q1 after paying down all remaining iBuying debt for the quarter. Our cash position, core operating cash flow and now less capital-intensive operations give us the flexibility to continue to invest against our growth strategy as we look to efficiently navigate through the current macro environment.  Before I turn to our outlook for Q3, I would like to note that the resale of inventory from our iBuying business is nearly complete. We ended Q2 with 71 homes remaining in inventory. And currently, only 25 are not yet under contract to sell. We expect to substantially complete the wind down during Q3 and to report Zillow Offers as a discontinued operation beginning in Q3. As a result, the residual Zillow Offers revenue and noncontinuing costs are not reflected in our guidance ranges.  Turning to our outlook. In our IMT segment, we expect a 12% year -- expect a 12% year-over-year revenue decline in Q3 at the midpoint of our outlook range. Within the IMT segment, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be between $275 million to $295 million, down 21% year-over-year at the midpoint of our outlook range. While we continue to focus on connecting high-intent customers to all our partners, our Q3 Premier Agent revenue outlook is largely informed by the following macro housing trends that we believe are making it harder for customers to transact and also affect our partner network. Lower purchase demand driven by recent increases in interest rates which has made home purchases less affordable and is impacting our overall Premier Agent connection lead volume as well as lower home price appreciation driven by softening demand and inventory levels that are growing but still lower than before the pandemic.  Given tougher Q3 comparisons and demand trends stabilizing in July compared to June, we now expect industry growth to be down mid- to high teens year-over-year in Q3. Besides our own internal leading indicators, there are a few publicly available data sources we can point to that also suggest this.  The Mortgage Bankers Association's purchase mortgage application index is running down high teens year-over-year in the last several weeks, a deceleration from high single-digit percentage annual decline fell through most of Q1 and early Q2. The year-over-year growth in the average loan size of purchase mortgage originations, as published by the Mortgage Bankers Association, has also decelerated meaningfully in recent weeks to low single digits from double digits earlier in the quarter. This has historically been a directionally good leading indicator for existing average home price sales growth and the deceleration suggests we could see home price appreciation decelerate meaningfully in the second half of the year.  Also, the National Association of Realtors measure of June pending home sales, a leading indicator for July and August, was down 20% year-over-year. In Q3, we expect Premier Agent to be in line to slightly worse than the industry as we saw in Q2. Our monetization of leads and agent behavior tend to pace ahead of industry trends for closed transactions during periods of disruption. When the macro moves this quickly, agents buying advertising through our market-based pricing program tend to slow down spend as they see demand wane which shows up ahead of closed transactions and the resulting industry growth metrics. Flex revenue is recognized at the time of delivery of customer connections to Premier Agent Partners which also leads the timing of closed transactions and industry growth metrics.  In Rentals, we are expecting to return to positive year-over-year growth as we continue to see signs that low rental vacancies may be subsided. We expect Q3 IMT segment EBITDA margin to be 28% at the midpoint of our outlook. We believe our Q3 investment level is appropriate despite the headwinds in the market, given the significant growth opportunities ahead. The positive signals we are seeing in testing and the now accelerated seller solutions opportunity with the announcement of our partnership with Openbook.  We expect our Mortgage segment revenue to be between $22 million and $27 million in Q3 which is down sequentially from Q2. Our Q3 outlook reflects the higher mortgage rate environment that impacts refinance mortgage volumes as well as demand in our marketplace business. Our Q3 outlook also reflects sequential growth in purchase mortgages and flat to lower gain on sale spreads due to the competitive industry environment. We expect Mortgages segment EBITDA to be between a loss of $31 million and a loss of $26 million based on expected market conditions and additional investments to build tools and technology for both customers and agents as we integrate mortgages with our other products and services.  We are focused on being a growth company, driving outsized transaction share gains and increasing revenue per transaction. Our early learnings reinforce our confidence in our strategy. That said, we are fully aware of the macro-driven headwinds impacting our near-term revenue outlook and are carefully evaluating every dollar that we choose to invest. As we've done under previous times of dislocation, such as the start of the pandemic and as we wound down our iBuying operations, we will be vigilant and decisive as we control the levers of our operating costs and pace of investments. Our strong growth margin profile and the nature of our business enables us to manage cost dynamically through periods like this and we will continue to assess as we see fit with an eye towards profitable growth.  For Q3, the sequential increase in costs reflect an increase in spend across our key pillars, offset by cost savings of an estimated $15 million of operational costs from our prior Q3 plan. Again, I want to be really clear here. We are continuing to lean in on product development for our key growth pillars because we are seeing strong early signs of success on customers needing and desiring to work with Zillow and our partners on transactions. Our confidence is reflected in our willingness to run hard at these opportunities. We want to note that we do not expect a further acceleration of our investment levels in Q4 as we expect the costs assumed in our Q3 consolidated outlook to be reflective of our investment levels throughout the second half of 2022. We continue to control the levers and we will react accordingly.  And of course, we are always looking for cost efficiencies while running the business. For example, while our vision for a flexible workforce still involves holding office space across the country, we believe there are continued opportunities to reduce our facility square footage as we gain experience on what a more normalized Cloud HQ environment requires. We have reduced our square footage by nearly 30% compared to pre-pandemic levels and have another nearly 30% that we are currently not using, with a portion of that already on the market for potential sublease.  Lastly, I want to take a moment to briefly discuss some additional details regarding the employee retention plan that was also announced today and that will take effect on August 8. We expect this action will be dilutive on a net basis by about 2%, resulting in the issuance of an estimated 4.5 million to 6.5 million RSUs. We will also reprice approximately 7.5 million stock options. We estimate that this retention action will result in the recognition of an incremental $180 million to $190 million in share-based compensation expense in total. We estimate that this will contribute an additional $45 million to $50 million of share-based compensation in Q3. The remaining expense for the retention action will normalize in Q4 and be recognized largely over the next 2-year period with a small portion in year 3.  We believe a strong balance sheet and operating cash flow are what drive a sustainable growth business across cycles and give us the ability to invest and capture opportunities during periods of market weakness. Looking forward, we are more focused on cash flow generation.  With respect to capital structure, we have $850 million in our share buyback authorization. As Rich discussed, we will be active in the near term to cover the dilution from the additional RSUs related to the employee retention plan that we expect will vest over the next couple of years. We will also continue to be opportunistic with capital investment opportunities, including share repurchases.  As we look forward, our priorities remain focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners and we plan to grow our customer engagement through a compelling dream and shop experience; deliver a more integrated customer transactional experience to drive customers who choose to transact with us and our partners; invest in sustainable top line growth opportunities across the company including new integrated services that are more scalable, less subject to earnings volatility and more capital efficient; and manage our cost structure and improve productivity to drive a profitable, scalable and positive operating cash flow company.  And with that, operator, I'll turn it over to questions. Yes. Logan, thanks for the question. Listen, I think it's impossible for us to make any predictions or estimates on market share gains given the dislocation and volatility in the market and the fact that these cohorts take a while to play out. What I would say is that when you think about the targets that we provided earlier in the year and our 2025 vision to move from 3% market segment share transactions to 6%, we feel really good based on the early signs across our 5 growth pillars that we have an opportunity to continue to drive purchase originations and financing and leveraging our agent partner network and the integration between those 2. And so we feel really good about market share, as we discussed at our targets. It's just impossible to predict market share in this near term. And maybe I'll just close, Logan, just finally on the color. First question. I said I'll close, Logan, on your first question, that our revenue guidance is really driven by the current macro volatility and variability and we feel really good about our opportunities long term across our growth strategies. Yes. Yes, I'll take that. Thanks, Ryan. Yes. I mean I think if you think about long term, our outlook of the margin profile, I mean, we're very excited about where we're positioned and having a business model that has high gross margin. And so the share gain and increasing revenue per share, we believe, is a very leveraged model over time as that happens. So -- and we believe, given the traffic and the number of customers who start with our site and the low share we have now, that over time, even as macro contracts and expand, we participate and can grow into that as we build these processes and get financing these 5 pillars going. So we're very bullish on the return these investments can deliver as we grow share in revenue per transaction because our model is built to be a high-margin model. Do you want me to take that, Rich? Okay. I mean I think how I would describe it as we look out into our agent population, our goal is to continue to connect high-intent customers with high-performing agents. And as we called out in our touring metric and the increase, we believe we're continuing to take actions and invest in doing so to get the agent and the customer connected at the right time. And that's why we also are so bullish on financing because having a preapproved customer is actually also very positive for the agent connection. In today's macro, what we're seeing, I think, as we saw the macro deteriorate relatively rapidly is that transactions -- and as affordability issues increased, we saw customer demand go down. So as agents saw demand go down and longer cycles for their customers to close, we saw them start to react by cutting spend. And so we still have a very strong population of agents in our network and we probably saw the tail reduce quicker than some of those agents that are performing really well for us and our customers. But their natural reaction at a time like this is to reduce their advertising spend somewhat as a protection. And then as we continue to show that we can provide high-intent customers that can convert, we expect that to increase again. Yes. The first one was related to with traffic and visits growing, I think it was how do you square that with the Premier Agent revenue forecast of down 21% for the quarter. I mean -- and again, a thanks for the question. I think, one, we clearly -- people still are very interested and we believe there is demand for people to move but affordability and high interest rate has had a near-term impact on transactions, along with the fact that we had very steep home price appreciation for a period of time. And so affordability was a problem. And so we have a lot of people coming to shop and Dream and we called out that we also have growing rentals traffic even in light of the high occupancy rates which, again, just shows very strong demand. And in fact, a lot of renters are also looking to buy, so that's a helpful effect as well. So we believe that having that engagement and traffic and people coming to our sites on a regular basis is -- puts us in a great position as we think about ways to improve our transaction share and drive higher-intent customers to our agents. But this is really just a dislocation driven by a lot of macro features that we've just seen a very volatile market environment over the last few years and we've got to work through that. But I would say it's a positive on the traffic and engagement but the macro is what's driving the revenue guide that we've provided for Q3. I'll start with it. I mean I think with respect to our marketplace business and the refinancing that we were doing, there is obviously a parity level where rates are higher than as such level that refinancing no longer makes sense. And obviously, that demand saw a big tick down. With respect to purchase, I think right now that the customers are trying to understand what may happen. And I think we do have so either hesitation or kind of sidelines waiting to see what will be a sustaining rate. And I think once we get to a point where it's kind of a normalized or sustaining rate, we're going to see volume pick back up because it will become the new normal. And then depending on where it got to, we may see additional refi volume as it kicks back down. So I don't think there's a magic number. Affordability, as Rich called out, the average mortgage monthly payment is -- has grown but it was off of historically low rates. So I do think it will normalize. And when it stabilizes and we get a little more certainty as to what the interest rate environment looks like going forward, we'll start to see more people come in because they'll be more comfortable with the stabilized rates. Yes. Yes. So what I would say is that ShowingTime is a critical part of our integration and development of touring for our customers. Rich can talk about the integration. With respect to revenues, what we're really looking at is coverage. And since we've acquired ShowingTime, we have been relatively consistent in the number of listings that we've been able to cover. It's vastly a little bit. There's some competitive elements out there but we've been relatively successful at proving the value of ShowingTime. But ShowingTime, we don't disclose selling times revenue in total but it's not -- the revenue itself is not over the driving factor of our strategic acquisition of ShowingTime. It's the ability to have coverage of all listings or as many listings as possible in any given market."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Zillow Group First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Berning, Vice President, Investor Relations. Brad, please go ahead.\nBrad Berning: Thank you.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich.\nRich Barton: Thank you, Brad, and hello to everyone joining today. There is a lot going on out there financially, politically, emotionally. In these volatile times, we are especially proud of our company and brand, one that helps people find their home, a place of comfort and safety. Before we get into our results for the quarter, I'd like to spend a little time talking about the housing market given it's on everyone's mind. There is a dispersion of real estate forecasts among publishing economists that range from 5.5 million to 6.5 million existing home sales for 2022 compared to 6.1 million in 2021. This results in a transaction growth rate range of negative 10% to positive 7%. The common thread across these forecasts is uncertainty for the housing market. We continue to see low levels of inventory down 23% year-over-year in March. New for-sale listings were less strained in March, up 36% from February levels, but still down 9% year-over-year.  Average page views per listing were at a record high in Q1, which results from low inventory, yes, but also signals a strong intent to move. These dynamics drove home values up an astonishing 21% year-over-year in March despite rising interest rates, which, of course, exacerbate affordability challenges. So while we know people are still eager to move, market conditions are making it increasingly difficult. The net result of all of these factors is that total consumer transaction value growth trends are meaningfully softening and even the most respected prognosticators have disparate views of what will happen next. Despite this turbulent housing market, Zillow is positioned as the leader at the top of the real estate funnel stands firm with 2.6 billion visits in Q1, including a 38% unique visitor growth year-over-year in rentals according to comScore. And as for results in Q1, we delivered revenue and EBITDA within or above our outlook across our business. Further, with the rapid and successful wind down of homes inventory, Zillow has become a company with a nimble balance sheet, a large cash position and a core business that produces strong positive cash flow. We reduced our exposure to housing inventory risk on our balance sheet to approximately $500 million and reduced related asset-backed debt by $2.6 billion in the quarter. Of the approximately 20,000 homes we needed to sell when we first announced the wind down, we are down to approximately 100 homes that are not under contract today. We've also recognized better sales prices than anticipated as a result of the aforementioned high home price appreciation. While home price volatility was to the upside during this wind down period, we are mindful of what might have resulted from unanticipated moves to the downside. We felt confident in November, and we feel more confident today that no longer being a principal in the iBuying business with the right decision for Zillow given our desire to serve the full breadth of our audience and the attractive margin profile of our core business. We ended the first quarter with $3.6 billion in cash, $500 million higher than the previous quarter, including the impact of a $348 million share repurchase throughout Q1. We will exit Q2 with no asset-backed debt related to our iBuying business and an expected net cash position of approximately $2 billion before considering potential cash use towards a new $1 billion share buyback, which our board has just authorized. We move forward with confidence knowing that Zillow is well capitalized to navigate through this market cycle and return excess capital, which was originally built up for a capital consumptive eye-buying business, while simultaneously maintaining the flexibility to innovate on the attractive growth opportunities we see for the long term. Before I dive further into our first quarter highlights, I would like to take a moment to appreciate the magnitude of change that has occurred at Zillow over the past six months and how well our team has operated through this transitional period. We have nearly fully wound down the iBuying business we had built up over the previous three years, and we have reoriented the company around our broader housing super app vision, all while generating strong cash flows from the core business. We have also been innovating our products, services and business models as we drive towards our 2025 targets of $5 billion in revenue and 45% EBITDA margin. To achieve those targets, we are executing on a product road map that is oriented around increasing engagement, increasing transactions and increasing revenue per transaction. As we talked about last quarter, the path to achieve those targets and begin to build out the housing super app vision involves product initiatives within five growth pillars, touring, financing, expanding seller services, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services. We are working with a sense of urgency on innovating and integrating products within these pillars, testing and driving our key input metrics. And while we know the revenue and profit outputs won't manifest right away, we are seeing early traction in the initiatives we've launched this quarter. First, touring is central to both increasing engagement on Zillow and increasing the number of transactions that we drive. We've made some key business and product improvements since you last heard us in February. As a reminder, we believe touring is the key point-of-sale moment in real estate and an action that converts at three times the level of any other action buyers take on Zillow. And interestingly, with touring there are major innovations ahead in both the virtual home tour and the physical home tour. Our goal is to marry these experiences over time on Zillow and throughout the real estate industry. Let's first talk about the virtual touring experience we are creating with our 3D home tours. I'm sure most people here have experienced the frustration of swiping through a carousel of pictures on a for-sale home and feeling lost trying to stitch everything together into a mental model of that home in your mind's eye. With our new 3D home tour floor plan technology, customers can travel through an entire home as if they were touring the home in person. This new tool turns on the lights for our customers and partners by contextualizing all the disjointed information about a home, photos, floor plans, spatial perspective into one interactive and immersive digital touring experience. Outside of how incredibly cool this feature is, it's also a powerful mechanism to help us identify high-intent movers in our funnel. It's great for buyers, sellers and agents. Agents using Zillow's 3D home tour benefit from a cost-effective way to showcase and share listings and generate more leads. Internal data has shown that homes on Zillow with a 3D tour were saved by buyers, 53% more frequently than homes without. And listings on Zillow with Zillow 3D home tour got on average 81% more views than listings without. We believe this is the kind of content customers want, and we are leading the way. Transitioning to the physical world, our pursuit of making the home buying process easier touches the IRL in real life tour as well. Like many other aspects of the process, the experienced a scheduling an in-person tour has historically been fragmented and cumbersome. We bought showing time the leading online scheduling platform for home showings last fall to improve this process, both for Zillow and for the broader real estate industry with our goal to make scheduling a home tour as easy as making a restaurant reservation online. This quarter, in four markets, we enabled a new feature called real-time availability, which lays the groundwork for exposing the availability for home tours for all agents using our showing time platform. We have unsurprisingly seen strong support from the industry for this feature with nearly 100% of brokerages enabling real-time availability in the markets we've launched. At first blush, this may feel like a simple feat. But up until now, know where the company has been able to tackle this nagging industry-wide problem. Of course, now that we have enabled the feature, we will need agents and homeowners to upload their schedules to make showing times real-time availability complete. But you can see how the feature becomes a key building block to make scheduling and taking a home to are far easier than today's manual coordination of four different calendars across the seller, the seller's agent, the prospective buyer and the buyer's agent. Beyond our product improvements in virtual and physical touring during the quarter, we made progress on moving more of our overall mix of connections on Zillow towards touring, driving an increase of approximately 400 basis points of tours as a percentage of overall connections. As I said before, we believe touring is the key point-of-sale moment in real estate. So this shift helps improve conversion rates by allowing us to see the higher intent fire signal that comes when someone requests a tour. This quarter, we announced that we are also upgrading StreetEasy, our leading real estate shopping and rental lab in New York City. As with our work on tours, one of the new features on StreetEasy will focus on marrying the virtual and physical experience in real estate shopping. To cater to the way that New Yorkers apartment hunt and their desire for on-demand experiences in every aspect of their lives, we just announced that we will soon launch Streetscape, a new feature that uses augmented reality to place StreetEasy's comprehensive listing data into a home shoppers real physical space on the streets of the city. Using the StreetEasy app, New Yorkers will be able to use the camera on their phone to scan a street to reveal floating icons in front of residential buildings then click on the icons to quickly learn more about the building and amenities, discover available units, view photos, floor plans, take virtual tours of the buildings units. It's sort of like a QR code for a building. There will no longer be a need to search out of buildings address or its available listings. The answers will be right at a home shoppers fingertips in real time with StreetEasy's streetscape. We are pleased with the progress we are seeing on our key growth pillars and are hard at work on our product road map across each pillar, touring, financing, expanding our seller services, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services. As we move forward, we will continue to highlight key business and product innovations we are making to begin to fulfill our housing super vision, an ecosystem of connected virtual and physical solutions designed to empower customers and partners throughout the real estate process, start to finish. Fulfillment of this vision will not happen right away, but we are on our way. Stepping back, as we said last quarter, our evolved strategy has an increased focus on our mid-funnel efforts as we look for opportunities to increase engagement transactions and revenue transaction from where we are today. It's important to note that our strategy and 2025 targets are grounded in the opportunity in the U.S. housing market, which we shared last quarter. As with pressure, we know that in 2021, 6.1 million existing homes exchanged hands in the country. For every home exchange, there are twp customer transactions, one on the buy side and one on the sell side, which results in $12.2 million customer transaction TAM. Of the $6.1 million buy-side customer transactions that occurred last year, we estimate that 4.1 million of those actual buyers were on our sites and apps, which accounts for about two thirds of all buyers in the U.S. Of that, we estimate that roughly 1.4 million actual home buyers asked to connect with the Zillow Premier Agent last year. That means about one quarter of all buyers in the U.S. last year, like a button to connect with us. This tells us that - the place for high-intent movers to find their next home . Of those 1.4 million high-intent movers, we estimate that about 360,000 customers ended up transacting with Zillow partners. Overall, we estimate that our buy-side 2021 market share was roughly 5%, and our overall customer transaction share was roughly 3%. This is a meaningful share but not in the context of our audience engagement and brands. As part of our targets laid out last year, we have set our sights on increasing our share of customer transactions from 3% to 6% by 2025, with lots of runway beyond that. Helping this large subset of our audience move from one home to the next represents a significant opportunity for Zillow. We intend to grow engagement with the roughly 4.1 million home buyers who use Zillow by leveraging our tech and product innovation and investment to deliver personalized, immersive content and curated experiences like our 3D tours and floor plan experience and intuitive tools to understand affordability early in a customer's journey. At the same time, we expect to continue to improve our core experience of search and find. We also plan to grow both the roughly 1.4 million homebuyers who clicked the button to connect with us last year and roughly 360,000 home buyers and sellers who transacted with us. We expect to do this by continued focus on touring and an increased focus on preparing these customers to be transaction-ready through intuitive and digitized financing offerings. And we are also developing seller solutions by leveraging learnings from our experience as an iBuyer to stand up new asset-light services. We expect to increase the number of people who raise their hand to transact with Zillow and increase penetration on the 6.1 million sell-side customer transactions that mirror the 6.1 million buy-side transactions that we've been focused on to date. Our Zillow Housing super app vision is central to this strategy, a place for all of these connected experiences to come together. In the Housing super app ecosystem, we will empower customers with data, a network of best-in-class partners and a suite of connected solutions so that transacting with Zillow will be an easy choice. The solutions within it will be a combination of services and data that we build, buy and partner with, high-quality solutions that integrate easily within the app. Our solutions will target high-intent movers who are signaling they're ready to take the next step in their shopping journey, transitioning from dreamers to transactors. It will also help bring these high-intent customers to our partners to help them scale their business, all while serving our mutual customers with the services they need. As Allen will dive into, Zillow is well positioned than we are on the balls of our feet with our knees bent, playing through this uncertain macro environment. We see a great deal of opportunity in front of us, which asks for investment. But we also recognize that we control the levers of our investment spend should adjustments become necessary in the future. We have meaningfully derisked the business and are moving forward with an ironclad balance sheet, a healthy cash flow generative core business and the industry-leading brand and audience. This gives us the confidence and flexibility to navigate whatever choppiness the short term may bring with our eyes up on the long-term growth opportunity, which is large and exciting given how lightly we monetize our traffic brand and engagement today. We love our mission to give people the power to unlock life's next chapter. We are in the midst of unlocking our own exciting next chapter for Zillow. We are really grateful to everyone who is on this journey with us, employees, partners, customers and shareholders. Thank you. I will now pass the mic over to Allen, who is feeling a bit under the weather, so give him a little space today. Thanks. Allen?\nAllen Parker: Thank you, Rich, and hello, everyone. We continue to be excited about the prospects of our strategic direction. We believe building innovative products and services to help a broader set of customers navigate buying and selling homes will deliver better customer experiences, help our partners work with higher-intent customers to grow their businesses and drive sustainable, long-term shareholder value. I'm going to take a brief moment to provide an update on the progress of winding down our iBuying operations, and then I'll discuss our quarterly results and Q2 outlook. We remain focused on executing on our plans to wind down our iBuying operations and despite some choppiness in the macro environment, we exceeded both our internal expectations and external outlook for the Home segment. We reported Home segment revenue of $3.7 billion for Q1, exceeding our outlook range of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion provided in early February. The revenue outperformance benefited primarily from higher resell velocity. Better-than-expected pricing drove Q1 Home segment EBITDA of $23 million, better than our outlook of a loss of $20 million at the high end of our range. There were approximately 1,280 homes in inventory at the end of the quarter and approximately 100 homes that are currently not yet under contract to be sold. We expect the sale of our remaining inventory to be substantially complete in Q2 with operations and a small amount of inventory extending into Q3. We now believe that the total cash flow generated from the wind-down process of our iBuying inventory and operations will be approximately $450 million after considering selling the inventory, paying off the asset-backed related debt, including financing costs, losses on inventory, gains realized or expected, wind down costs and net operating EBITDA losses. The faster-than-expected wind-down resulted in us paying off our iBuying buying asset-backed debt completely at the end of April, and the note holders will be repaid fully in mid-May. The better-than-expected cash from the wind-down process compared to our initial expectations of breakeven contributed to our excess capital to be able to return to shareholders and our $1 billion share buyback. Now moving to our core business results. Despite the ongoing turbulent housing market that Rich discussed, we again delivered results in line or above our outlook ranges on revenue and EBITDA as we focus on executing against our 2025 target. IMT segment revenue was $490 million, growing 10% year-over-year. Our IMT segment revenue was slightly above the $487 million midpoint of our outlook range. Premier Agent revenue grew 9% year-over-year and outperformed industry growth of 4% in Q1 as we continued our focus on making better connections between high-intent customers and high-performing agents. While we are clearly not immune from the macro in the near term, our work on discovering higher-intent customers and working with an increasing mix of higher-performing agents has led to higher lead conversion rates. This gives us confidence that we can offset some of the housing market headwinds as they develop. As Rich discussed earlier, in Q1, we made progress on moving towards a higher mix of touring, which helps improve conversion rates by allowing us to see the higher intent buyer signal. We expect the planned integration with showing time to further improve the touring customer experience and meet more customers doing requests. We are also investing to improve the showing time experience for the entire industry. As we mentioned in our Q1 outlook, we saw a wider range of potential outcomes for Premier Agent revenue from the slower housing activity late in Q4. This trend largely played through in Q1 with new for-sale inventory listings down double digits on a year-over-year basis. Despite that, our customer and agent activity levels continue to indicate they remain strong underlying customer demand that drove continued strong home price appreciation. Rentals revenue was down 5% year-over-year and flat sequentially, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to see pressure from high occupancy rates, which dampened demand for rentals advertising. IMT segment EBITDA was $209 million for Q1 or 43% of revenue, exceeding our outlook of $201 million and 40% - 41% of revenue at the midpoint. The outperformance was driven by a combination of better-than-expected operating efficiency, as well as lower-than-anticipated advertising and marketing spend. Mortgages segment revenue of $46 million was near the midpoint of our Q1 outlook range, as refinancing loan originations slowed following the rapid increase in interest rates during the quarter. Gain on sale margins compressed more than expectations as the drop in demand for refinance loans resulted in excess industry capacity. Mortgages segment adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $12 million, at the upper end of our outlook, as we manage operating expenses as purchase origination volumes dropped sequentially in connection with the wind-down of our iBuying operations. Before I turn to our outlook for Q2, I would like to reiterate that the resale of inventory from our capital-intensive iBuying business is nearly complete, and we believe that Zillow is in a strong position to pursue our 2025 initiatives. We feel confident that our traffic, brand, balance sheet and positive cash flow generating core business will provide us the flexibility to navigate the challenging housing market. We ended Q1 with $3.6 billion in cash and investments, an increase of $500 million from 3.1 at the end of Q4, inclusive of the impact of $348 million in share repurchases during Q1. We have approximately $100 million remaining under the current $750 million share repurchase authorization. And our Board of Directors has approved an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization. This reflects our belief that under various ranges of housing market scenarios, we expect to remain profitable and positive cash flow - with positive cash flow. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. In our IMT segment, we expect flat year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 at the midpoint of our outlook range. Within the IMT segment, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be between $335 million and $350 million, down 2% year-over-year at the midpoint of the outlook range. While we continue to focus on connecting high-intent customers to all of our partners, our Q2 Premier Agent revenue outlook is largely informed by the macro trends that we are seeing with lower year-over-year growth in new for-sale listings, home appreciation at an increasing average transaction prices, but also contributing to affordability challenges along with higher mortgage rates. We realize these macro issues are making it harder for customers to transact and may also affect our partner network. Within the overall IMT revenue outlook, we note that in rentals, while we are not guiding to specific revenue figures, we are expecting sequential revenue growth in Q2 due to seasonality. Additionally, we are also seeing early signs that low rental vacancies may be subsiding. We expect Q2 IMT segment EBITDA margin to be 38% at the midpoint of our outlook. While we have taken some costs out of our initial Q2 plan, we are making a strategic decision to continue to invest in our key initiatives in Q2 as planned despite the deceleration in real estate industry growth trends. We are continuing to monitor the macro environment, and we control the levers on our core business and pace of investments to enable us to prudently manage costs. We expect our Mortgages segment revenue to be between $31 million and $39 million in Q2, which is down sequentially from Q1. Our Q2 outlook reflects slower refinance activity due to higher mortgage rates and lower gain on sale spreads due to the competitive industry environment, partially offset by sequential growth in purchase mortgages as we redirect the focus of our operations. As we are now past the impact of the iBuying wind-down on purchased mortgage leads, we have started to rebuild our pipeline and expect modest purchase mortgage growth in Q2. We expect Mortgages segment adjusted EBITDA to be between a loss of $18 million and a loss of $13 million based upon current capacity, expected market conditions and additional investments in operations to integrate mortgages with our other products and services. In Q2, we expect our Home segment revenue to be $450 million and adjusted EBITDA to be a loss of $15 million at the midpoint of our outlook range. We also expect to complete the wind down of our iBuying operations during the second half of this year. So as we look forward, our priorities remain focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners. We plan to grow our customer engagement through a compelling dream in-shop experience, deliver a more integrated customer transactional experience to drive customers to choose to transact with us and our partners, invest in sustainable top line growth opportunities across the company, including new integrated services that are more scalable, less subject to earnings volatility and more capital efficient and lastly, manage our cost structure to improve productivity to drive a profitable, scalable and positive cash flow company. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from John Colantuoni of Jefferies. John, your line is open.\nJohn Colantuoni: Thanks for taking my questions. So I just wanted to start with the second half or second quarter guidance for Premier Agent. So the underlying assumption is that there are some headwinds from a low for-sale inventory and affordability challenges because of rising mortgage rates, which all makes sense, of course. But given both of those are likely to remain challenges for at least the remainder of 2022, should we assume that Premier Agent revenue growth should be more muted for the remainder of the year? Or are there some transitory headwinds that you'd point to in the second quarter?\nRich Barton: You want to at least start with that...\nAllen Parker: You can jump in. So what I'd say is you're right that when you look to our guide, which is at the midpoint, down about 2% year-over-year, and it's about at the midpoint, 6% down sequentially from Q1. It reflects what we're seeing in the macro and how that is affecting our customers and how we would work with our partner agents. So this is really a macro story. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. We're not guiding past Q2. There's a lot - our goal, as we think to the 2025 is to obviously do things to continue to attract high intent customers and get them with high-performing agents, and we're continuing to make progress on those things, but they're likely to arrive new features are likely to arrive over time. So I would just say, based on our visibility, which is Q2, these macro headwinds are affecting our revenue given the guidance range, they're all factored into the guidance range that we're giving, which is the negative 2% growth midpoint.\nJohn Colantuoni: Okay, great.\nRich Barton: To add anything on that, Brad, Go ahead...\nJohn Colantuoni: Sure. Okay. Just also just wanted to hit on second quarter IMT EBITDA margin guidance. It looks like coming down around 500 basis points sequentially from the first quarter. Just wanted to ask whether that's a function of some upfront spending to kind of build the infrastructure and tech behind the super-app experience that should moderate over time. And maybe you could kind of just talk about directionally how we should think about the spending that you'll be doing behind that initiative over time? Thanks.\nRich Barton: Yes, I'll start with that. What I would say is that if you look at the guide and the margin rates that comes down to about 38%, this is in line - expenses are in line with our plan. In fact, we've taken them down slightly from our initial plan. So there's not anything in it that's an increase or a surprise from our initial guidance. We've actually bought it down slightly. But it does incorporate us continuing with the investments that we think we need to make progress on the initiatives to build for the 2025 targets. We don't see a significant increase in those rates. Are those expense trends as we look to the full year, there's going to be some vacillation [ph] as we build the team, but we believe that the expenses incorporated in the guide are consistent with what we need to drive for our 2025 targets. We continue to monitor the macro and we control the levers. But for now, there's a lot of near-term chop that is causing our guide on the revenue to be down, but we still have high conviction on the thesis that's driving our 2025 targets. And for now, we expect our spend incorporated in that Q2 guide to be consistent with us achieving those targets.\nJohn Colantuoni: Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you, John. Our next question is from Ygal Arounian of Wedbush. Ygal, your line is open.\nYgal Arounian: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Sticking with Premier Agent, I wanted - maybe we could just talk a little fundamentally about how agents think about ROI in times and more tougher times. And with the guidance and then tying that together to the comments last quarter about the goals to take incremental share. It feels like that's not happening in 2Q when you think about the overall market, which is a challenge, but maybe when you take transactions plus HPA in that quarter in to. Just how to think about that? And then I have one more follow-up on TA.\nRich Barton: You were breaking up a little bit, but I think your question is how do we think about ROI?\nYgal Arounian: Yeah, how agents think about ROI...\nRich Barton: In the tough...\nYgal Arounian: In these times, in these kind of times.\nRich Barton: Yeah. I mean I guess we did outperform the market in terms of PA revenue in Q1. And as we've talked about, the macro, that as we described, has an impact not only on our customers but on our agents. But we're very aware of this impact, and we continually monitor it to consumer optimizing and managing to the best outcome for our customers, our partner agents and for ourselves. We have experience in managing through this volatility. We still have extremely strong traffic and brand. And we are, as we've mentioned, continuing to make progress on driving higher-intent customers and connecting them with high-performing partners. So what I would just say is that the Q2 guide reflects the macro impacts on our business and incorporate the way we think about managing that business and optimizing it to support our agent partners and to continue to drive those customers who want to transact to high-performing agents.\nYgal Arounian: Okay. That's helpful. And sorry if I missed this on the prepared comments, but during the quarter, you guys made a move in - was it Denver and Charlotte right to go fully flex. Anything you could share on why you made that decision, why those markets? And then how you think about doing that? Is that something you would do in other markets, in all markets, just the kind of plans around that? Thanks.\nAllen Parker: Yeah. Why don't I start - thank you for the question. Why don't I start, Richard, you could jump in.\nRich Barton: Raise your hand if you want to break down and I'm happy to...\nAllen Parker: So the markets that we made adjustments in that came out with Raleigh in Denver. So I just want to correct that. But we are extremely and firmly focused on this vision to build the Super App for a mass market of movers. And we've talked about the five pillars that we consider driving in how we get there. So launching Raleigh and Denver as two dedicated test markets allows us to have this clean slate for research and development to test and iterate. This is a targeted approach to help us get a read on what works and what doesn't. And to figure out what effectively scales while minimizing disruptions across our entire partner network. These were flipped to a flex model because this post paid model works better for this testing environment because we have more visibility into our partners' processes, and it minimizes their financial risk as we introduce and test and refine our new experiences. So what we learned from these markets, we're going to - we expect to use across all of our markets across a broad set of customers, across both monetization models. So this is really just our ability to test, iterate and learn. It's - we expect and intend to have kind of a hybrid mix of monetization models going forward. And this wasn't any kind of indication about Flex versus MPP. So our focus is delivering high intent movers that drives more value to our partners regardless of the monetization model. This just set us up to have two great test environments, along with the other markets.\nAllen Parker: Let me jump in, Ygal, and editorialize a little bit. Yes, it's ironic. I was kind of chuckling that Raleigh in Denver is R&D. But that is what's going on here. What you're seeing, unfortunately, you broke into the public and it's created some questions like you're asking. Normally, this wouldn't have broken into the public, but of course, it involves partners, so things do get out. This, I think, you and our investors should take as a sign of us making progress against the five pillars. We're really working hard to enhance our partner network and to try out all kinds of new stuff in order to get to the Super App and integrate this transaction. And having a post paid model in these test markets enable - it lowers the barrier to participation on the part of partners. It makes it a lot easier to participate and lets us lets us iterate rapidly. So really, I wouldn't get too hung up on this being Flex or MBP or whatever. This is us basically working hard against the five growth pillars to enhance the partner network, integrate finance, come up with interesting solutions and to integrate all these services. That is what's going on here. And it will - we will continue to run and as we push towards the super app and experiment with these models, we will continue to run interesting experiments into different cities. So you will see more of this. And anyway, I take it as a good sign of progress.\nYgal Arounian: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you, Ygal. The next question is from Tom Champion of Piper Sandler. Tom, your line is open.\nTom Champion: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Just want to pick up on the last question. How are these markets different from Phoenix and Atlanta? I thought those markets were 100% Flex. And just because of the sensitivity, how are you managing the legacy MVP relationships in those markets, Denver and Raleigh. And then maybe just one more. Rich, if you could talk a little bit about integrating showing time and increasing the amount of touring activity going forward, what you're doing to facilitate that given the benefit to transaction throughput. Any comments on that would be really helpful. Thank you.\nRich Barton: Yeah. Hey, Tom, you guys want me to start on this one? Yeah. Nothing to do with Phoenix and Atlanta and only incidentally has anything to do with Flex, as I described last time, Tom. And you described MVP as legacy, it's just - we run multiple business models and with an eye towards optimization and getting to the customer solutions that we want and the solutions that are great for our partners, too. So I want to try to walk back a perception that MVP is legacy et cetera. And so as I said before, the Raleigh and Denver testing has to do with building out the Super App and integrating the services, okay, and having a clean slate from which we can do that. Of course, running the markets with revenues and profits in mind as well, okay? So they really aren't connected to each other. Although, as I said before, you will see us do more things in more markets and it may look different. It may look the same, it may look different depending on the outcome of the experiments we're running, right. In terms of selling time and touring, like we're working hard. I cited one sparkler in my script around a movement - a mix shift of, I think, 400 basis points I said, towards touring as the Andres activity to call that action for - amongst our connections, which is a real positive because we know those customers convert at a much higher rate into transactions and revenues for us. And so what we're doing is lots of little things on the site with calls to action and design and functionality with the touring functionality that is encouraging people to reach out via a tour on Zillow app and our other consumer customer services.\nTom Champion: Okay. Thanks very much for the comments.\nRich Barton: We hope with - yes, I talked a bit about real-time availability, which is early days, but it's -- that's a really exciting one. That one could be something long term that is sort of a game changer for physical home touring. That is really good. And it's linked, I didn't really say it in my script, but the virtual tour with the new floorplan tech and the 380 homes technology that we have that is super cool is not only awesome for customers because it acts as a good filter because people can visualize what a home is much more richly and accurately in the virtual space on their smartphone or at their computer, which means we get a higher signal to noise on the tour itself because people are self filtering because of better virtual attack. Anyway, these things are interrelated, and we love that we're pushing hard on both of these fronts.\nOperator: Thank you, Tom. The next question is from Naved Khan of Truist. Naved, your line is open.\nNaved Khan: Yeah, hi. So not too harp on this topic, but just on the move to sort of 100% flags in Raleigh and Denver. I think last time you guys did this back in I think, like 2.5 years ago, it was like an impact to revenue in the next quarter because of the accounting. I guess this time around, there's probably not going to be an impact because you changed the accounting is then. Is that a fair assumption?\nRich Barton: Yeah. So the impact on Q2 revenue related to Raleigh and Denver is immaterial. We recognize revenue as leads are delivered in Raleigh and Denver. And so there's not the same impact as when we flipped in Phoenix and Atlanta.\nNaved Khan: Great. The other question I had is just on the 2025 target. And can you just sort of give us your thoughts on how much does the target rely on market performance versus the low just sort of citing better and increasing its share of the overall product?\nRich Barton: I want me to go first, Allen.\nAllen Parker: Yeah.\nRich Barton: Within current anticipated market headwinds, it shouldn't affect us, Naved. Of course, if there's a terrible storm that blows in the market brands to a halt and goes on for a long time, we could change our views. But the fundamentals behind kind of the fundamentals behind our 2025 target to $5 billion in revenue and 45% EBITDA margins really revolve around converting more connections into transactions and increasing our basket size, our dollars for transactions by integrating more and more services into that transaction. And the biggest lever is moving from 3% of transaction penetration today to about 6% by 2025. That is the really big mover. The denominator matters, of course, but in most scenarios, it is really the penetration that is the big lever, not the denominator.\nNaved Khan: Understood. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you, Naved. The next question is from John Campbell of Stephens. John, your line is open.\nJohn Campbell: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Just got a quick question here. I don't know if you guys are willing to share this quite yet, but roughly just how much of Premier Agent is tied to Flex now? And then based on the 2025 targets, I'm thinking Flex likely grows as a percent of the mix. So maybe if you can talk about maybe broadly what you're expecting that mix to look like over time?\nAllen Parker: Yeah. This is Allan. I'll answer that, John. Yes, we're not providing, as Rich said, these are two monetization models that both result in us allowing high-intent customers to get to high-performing agents, and we participate in doing that either in adjusting the prices over time in MP through the auction process or the success fee with the Flex model. We have grown Flex over the last year as we've expanded that across more ZIP codes. But - and we do believe that Flex is an alignment tool, not necessarily a step function improvement in profitability or conversion across our best performers. But it's an alignment tool. So it's likely our Flex partners will be participating more in other products and services. That's a lot of what we're going to learn. We believe that to the extent we innovate and on behalf of our customers and make a delightful experience, even some of our MVP partners will find it useful to leverage our loans and our closing services and other services. But we're not at this time. There's no fixed number. There's not anything out there that says this is where we need to be in flex in order to hit our targets. We believe both monetization models work, both include great performing agents. Most of what we're focusing on is building the integrated Super App platform that allows these services to work well together, and we expect that both partners in Flex and MEP will want to utilize those services as that value prop to their customers and to their ability to close improves. \nJohn Campbell: Okay. That\u2019s good color. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, John. We have time for one final question, and it comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan of Wolfe Research. Deepak, your line is open. Deepak, please proceed with your question.\nQ \u2013Unidentified Analyst: Sorry about that. I was on mute. Frank Fibe [ph] here for Deepak. So first thing I wanted to ask was whether the recent headwinds to growth are making you rethink product development and kind of what investment plans are necessary to reach your long-term targets? And then beyond that, I was just curious on the feedback you're hearing from brokerage partners and agents currently on the summer season. And any expectations for kind of the broader market over the back half of the year? Thank you.\nRich Barton: Maybe I'll start with the growth one. In Turitea [ph] as we look at the Q2 guide, the growth in our Premier Agent revenue is really about this low inventory listing, this imbalance in supply and demand and how that is impacting affordability for some of our customers. We do believe that, that is temporary. This is not about our traffic or our customers that are on our sites intend to try to buy a home. There's just not that much out there. And that's affecting - that macro factor is affecting our ability to help customers transact. So when you look at the macro and how it affects our revenue, that informs our decision also to say that we're not slowing down on some of our investments. We're tracking this closely and we're going to continue to monitor it. We're well positioned as a profitable company that delivers strong free cash flow. And we - that's important to us. But it doesn't change the thesis or our conviction for the thesis on how we can drive more transactions through technology and innovation across a broader set of services, generating higher revenue transaction. So we view this as temporal. It's uncertain how long it will exist. It's affecting our revenue, but we still see the demand and it doesn't change our growth trajectory or how we think about the 2025 targets. We'll continue to monitor it and track it. But right now, we believe touring, financing, seller services, enhancing our partner network and integrating across the Super App platform are the right five pillars that are going to drive the 2025 success.\nAllen Parker: Like we're excited about and excited but we're prudent as well. You've seen us lean in and out of things aggressively and aggressively prudently in the past. And we continue to have that attitude. But we do see a lot of upside. And just an indicator for you. I'll just hit it, but we did just - our Board did just authorize $1 billion share repurchase, which is a nod to how much cash we're generating, how much cash we raised in order to fund a kind of capital hungry eye buying business and how we want to return that capital now. But it's also expresses the confidence in the kind of nimbleness and inherent profitability in our current business. So that should give you an indicator. In terms of the summer season selling summer season signals, I'd say they're mixed. I actually just came from an industry conference in San Antonio with a bunch of big brokers and industry players. And I would say it's just - it's mixed. People are in kind of wait-and-see mode. Everybody's kind of commenting on just what a weird market it is with such a high supply demand or demand supply imbalance that hasn't actually writhed itself for quite some time. The industry is expecting it to do so, but the underlying dynamics, the demographics supporting more and more demand coming online are strong. And so it's - it continues to be a weird market. I would say people don't exactly know what to expect. It isn't all doom and gloom, but it's foggy, I guess, is what I would say.\nQ \u2013Unidentified Analyst: Understood. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for that question. We see a lot of time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Rich Barton for any closing remarks.\nRich Barton: Okay. Thank you. I know it's a really super busy day and a kind of a crazy day. It is times like this when you all and we all turn from looking at revenues and income statements and we look at balance sheets, what boats are seaworthy if we're sailing into some choppy waters overall. I know you're doing that across your portfolios. We're really happy here at Zillow that we have a strong balance sheet. We're quite see where the - we're looking down - down through the storm, and we feel good about our opportunity and the vehicle that's going to get us there. So anyway, thank you for taking the time, and we will talk to you all again real soon. Have a good day.\nOperator: That concludes the Zillow Group first quarter earnings call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rich Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and hello to everyone joining today. There is a lot going on out there financially, politically, emotionally. In these volatile times, we are especially proud of our company and brand, one that helps people find their home, a place of comfort and safety. Before we get into our results for the quarter, I'd like to spend a little time talking about the housing market given it's on everyone's mind. There is a dispersion of real estate forecasts among publishing economists that range from 5.5 million to 6.5 million existing home sales for 2022 compared to 6.1 million in 2021. This results in a transaction growth rate range of negative 10% to positive 7%. The common thread across these forecasts is uncertainty for the housing market. We continue to see low levels of inventory down 23% year-over-year in March. New for-sale listings were less strained in March, up 36% from February levels, but still down 9% year-over-year.  Average page views per listing were at a record high in Q1, which results from low inventory, yes, but also signals a strong intent to move. These dynamics drove home values up an astonishing 21% year-over-year in March despite rising interest rates, which, of course, exacerbate affordability challenges. So while we know people are still eager to move, market conditions are making it increasingly difficult. The net result of all of these factors is that total consumer transaction value growth trends are meaningfully softening and even the most respected prognosticators have disparate views of what will happen next. Despite this turbulent housing market, Zillow is positioned as the leader at the top of the real estate funnel stands firm with 2.6 billion visits in Q1, including a 38% unique visitor growth year-over-year in rentals according to comScore. And as for results in Q1, we delivered revenue and EBITDA within or above our outlook across our business. Further, with the rapid and successful wind down of homes inventory, Zillow has become a company with a nimble balance sheet, a large cash position and a core business that produces strong positive cash flow. We reduced our exposure to housing inventory risk on our balance sheet to approximately $500 million and reduced related asset-backed debt by $2.6 billion in the quarter. Of the approximately 20,000 homes we needed to sell when we first announced the wind down, we are down to approximately 100 homes that are not under contract today. We've also recognized better sales prices than anticipated as a result of the aforementioned high home price appreciation. While home price volatility was to the upside during this wind down period, we are mindful of what might have resulted from unanticipated moves to the downside. We felt confident in November, and we feel more confident today that no longer being a principal in the iBuying business with the right decision for Zillow given our desire to serve the full breadth of our audience and the attractive margin profile of our core business. We ended the first quarter with $3.6 billion in cash, $500 million higher than the previous quarter, including the impact of a $348 million share repurchase throughout Q1. We will exit Q2 with no asset-backed debt related to our iBuying business and an expected net cash position of approximately $2 billion before considering potential cash use towards a new $1 billion share buyback, which our board has just authorized. We move forward with confidence knowing that Zillow is well capitalized to navigate through this market cycle and return excess capital, which was originally built up for a capital consumptive eye-buying business, while simultaneously maintaining the flexibility to innovate on the attractive growth opportunities we see for the long term. Before I dive further into our first quarter highlights, I would like to take a moment to appreciate the magnitude of change that has occurred at Zillow over the past six months and how well our team has operated through this transitional period. We have nearly fully wound down the iBuying business we had built up over the previous three years, and we have reoriented the company around our broader housing super app vision, all while generating strong cash flows from the core business. We have also been innovating our products, services and business models as we drive towards our 2025 targets of $5 billion in revenue and 45% EBITDA margin. To achieve those targets, we are executing on a product road map that is oriented around increasing engagement, increasing transactions and increasing revenue per transaction. As we talked about last quarter, the path to achieve those targets and begin to build out the housing super app vision involves product initiatives within five growth pillars, touring, financing, expanding seller services, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services. We are working with a sense of urgency on innovating and integrating products within these pillars, testing and driving our key input metrics. And while we know the revenue and profit outputs won't manifest right away, we are seeing early traction in the initiatives we've launched this quarter. First, touring is central to both increasing engagement on Zillow and increasing the number of transactions that we drive. We've made some key business and product improvements since you last heard us in February. As a reminder, we believe touring is the key point-of-sale moment in real estate and an action that converts at three times the level of any other action buyers take on Zillow. And interestingly, with touring there are major innovations ahead in both the virtual home tour and the physical home tour. Our goal is to marry these experiences over time on Zillow and throughout the real estate industry. Let's first talk about the virtual touring experience we are creating with our 3D home tours. I'm sure most people here have experienced the frustration of swiping through a carousel of pictures on a for-sale home and feeling lost trying to stitch everything together into a mental model of that home in your mind's eye. With our new 3D home tour floor plan technology, customers can travel through an entire home as if they were touring the home in person. This new tool turns on the lights for our customers and partners by contextualizing all the disjointed information about a home, photos, floor plans, spatial perspective into one interactive and immersive digital touring experience. Outside of how incredibly cool this feature is, it's also a powerful mechanism to help us identify high-intent movers in our funnel. It's great for buyers, sellers and agents. Agents using Zillow's 3D home tour benefit from a cost-effective way to showcase and share listings and generate more leads. Internal data has shown that homes on Zillow with a 3D tour were saved by buyers, 53% more frequently than homes without. And listings on Zillow with Zillow 3D home tour got on average 81% more views than listings without. We believe this is the kind of content customers want, and we are leading the way. Transitioning to the physical world, our pursuit of making the home buying process easier touches the IRL in real life tour as well. Like many other aspects of the process, the experienced a scheduling an in-person tour has historically been fragmented and cumbersome. We bought showing time the leading online scheduling platform for home showings last fall to improve this process, both for Zillow and for the broader real estate industry with our goal to make scheduling a home tour as easy as making a restaurant reservation online. This quarter, in four markets, we enabled a new feature called real-time availability, which lays the groundwork for exposing the availability for home tours for all agents using our showing time platform. We have unsurprisingly seen strong support from the industry for this feature with nearly 100% of brokerages enabling real-time availability in the markets we've launched. At first blush, this may feel like a simple feat. But up until now, know where the company has been able to tackle this nagging industry-wide problem. Of course, now that we have enabled the feature, we will need agents and homeowners to upload their schedules to make showing times real-time availability complete. But you can see how the feature becomes a key building block to make scheduling and taking a home to are far easier than today's manual coordination of four different calendars across the seller, the seller's agent, the prospective buyer and the buyer's agent. Beyond our product improvements in virtual and physical touring during the quarter, we made progress on moving more of our overall mix of connections on Zillow towards touring, driving an increase of approximately 400 basis points of tours as a percentage of overall connections. As I said before, we believe touring is the key point-of-sale moment in real estate. So this shift helps improve conversion rates by allowing us to see the higher intent fire signal that comes when someone requests a tour. This quarter, we announced that we are also upgrading StreetEasy, our leading real estate shopping and rental lab in New York City. As with our work on tours, one of the new features on StreetEasy will focus on marrying the virtual and physical experience in real estate shopping. To cater to the way that New Yorkers apartment hunt and their desire for on-demand experiences in every aspect of their lives, we just announced that we will soon launch Streetscape, a new feature that uses augmented reality to place StreetEasy's comprehensive listing data into a home shoppers real physical space on the streets of the city. Using the StreetEasy app, New Yorkers will be able to use the camera on their phone to scan a street to reveal floating icons in front of residential buildings then click on the icons to quickly learn more about the building and amenities, discover available units, view photos, floor plans, take virtual tours of the buildings units. It's sort of like a QR code for a building. There will no longer be a need to search out of buildings address or its available listings. The answers will be right at a home shoppers fingertips in real time with StreetEasy's streetscape. We are pleased with the progress we are seeing on our key growth pillars and are hard at work on our product road map across each pillar, touring, financing, expanding our seller services, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services. As we move forward, we will continue to highlight key business and product innovations we are making to begin to fulfill our housing super vision, an ecosystem of connected virtual and physical solutions designed to empower customers and partners throughout the real estate process, start to finish. Fulfillment of this vision will not happen right away, but we are on our way. Stepping back, as we said last quarter, our evolved strategy has an increased focus on our mid-funnel efforts as we look for opportunities to increase engagement transactions and revenue transaction from where we are today. It's important to note that our strategy and 2025 targets are grounded in the opportunity in the U.S. housing market, which we shared last quarter. As with pressure, we know that in 2021, 6.1 million existing homes exchanged hands in the country. For every home exchange, there are twp customer transactions, one on the buy side and one on the sell side, which results in $12.2 million customer transaction TAM. Of the $6.1 million buy-side customer transactions that occurred last year, we estimate that 4.1 million of those actual buyers were on our sites and apps, which accounts for about two thirds of all buyers in the U.S. Of that, we estimate that roughly 1.4 million actual home buyers asked to connect with the Zillow Premier Agent last year. That means about one quarter of all buyers in the U.S. last year, like a button to connect with us. This tells us that - the place for high-intent movers to find their next home . Of those 1.4 million high-intent movers, we estimate that about 360,000 customers ended up transacting with Zillow partners. Overall, we estimate that our buy-side 2021 market share was roughly 5%, and our overall customer transaction share was roughly 3%. This is a meaningful share but not in the context of our audience engagement and brands. As part of our targets laid out last year, we have set our sights on increasing our share of customer transactions from 3% to 6% by 2025, with lots of runway beyond that. Helping this large subset of our audience move from one home to the next represents a significant opportunity for Zillow. We intend to grow engagement with the roughly 4.1 million home buyers who use Zillow by leveraging our tech and product innovation and investment to deliver personalized, immersive content and curated experiences like our 3D tours and floor plan experience and intuitive tools to understand affordability early in a customer's journey. At the same time, we expect to continue to improve our core experience of search and find. We also plan to grow both the roughly 1.4 million homebuyers who clicked the button to connect with us last year and roughly 360,000 home buyers and sellers who transacted with us. We expect to do this by continued focus on touring and an increased focus on preparing these customers to be transaction-ready through intuitive and digitized financing offerings. And we are also developing seller solutions by leveraging learnings from our experience as an iBuyer to stand up new asset-light services. We expect to increase the number of people who raise their hand to transact with Zillow and increase penetration on the 6.1 million sell-side customer transactions that mirror the 6.1 million buy-side transactions that we've been focused on to date. Our Zillow Housing super app vision is central to this strategy, a place for all of these connected experiences to come together. In the Housing super app ecosystem, we will empower customers with data, a network of best-in-class partners and a suite of connected solutions so that transacting with Zillow will be an easy choice. The solutions within it will be a combination of services and data that we build, buy and partner with, high-quality solutions that integrate easily within the app. Our solutions will target high-intent movers who are signaling they're ready to take the next step in their shopping journey, transitioning from dreamers to transactors. It will also help bring these high-intent customers to our partners to help them scale their business, all while serving our mutual customers with the services they need. As Allen will dive into, Zillow is well positioned than we are on the balls of our feet with our knees bent, playing through this uncertain macro environment. We see a great deal of opportunity in front of us, which asks for investment. But we also recognize that we control the levers of our investment spend should adjustments become necessary in the future. We have meaningfully derisked the business and are moving forward with an ironclad balance sheet, a healthy cash flow generative core business and the industry-leading brand and audience. This gives us the confidence and flexibility to navigate whatever choppiness the short term may bring with our eyes up on the long-term growth opportunity, which is large and exciting given how lightly we monetize our traffic brand and engagement today. We love our mission to give people the power to unlock life's next chapter. We are in the midst of unlocking our own exciting next chapter for Zillow. We are really grateful to everyone who is on this journey with us, employees, partners, customers and shareholders. Thank you. I will now pass the mic over to Allen, who is feeling a bit under the weather, so give him a little space today. Thanks. Allen? You want to at least start with that... To add anything on that, Brad, Go ahead... Yes, I'll start with that. What I would say is that if you look at the guide and the margin rates that comes down to about 38%, this is in line - expenses are in line with our plan. In fact, we've taken them down slightly from our initial plan. So there's not anything in it that's an increase or a surprise from our initial guidance. We've actually bought it down slightly. But it does incorporate us continuing with the investments that we think we need to make progress on the initiatives to build for the 2025 targets. We don't see a significant increase in those rates. Are those expense trends as we look to the full year, there's going to be some vacillation [ph] as we build the team, but we believe that the expenses incorporated in the guide are consistent with what we need to drive for our 2025 targets. We continue to monitor the macro and we control the levers. But for now, there's a lot of near-term chop that is causing our guide on the revenue to be down, but we still have high conviction on the thesis that's driving our 2025 targets. And for now, we expect our spend incorporated in that Q2 guide to be consistent with us achieving those targets. You were breaking up a little bit, but I think your question is how do we think about ROI? In the tough... Yeah. I mean I guess we did outperform the market in terms of PA revenue in Q1. And as we've talked about, the macro, that as we described, has an impact not only on our customers but on our agents. But we're very aware of this impact, and we continually monitor it to consumer optimizing and managing to the best outcome for our customers, our partner agents and for ourselves. We have experience in managing through this volatility. We still have extremely strong traffic and brand. And we are, as we've mentioned, continuing to make progress on driving higher-intent customers and connecting them with high-performing partners. So what I would just say is that the Q2 guide reflects the macro impacts on our business and incorporate the way we think about managing that business and optimizing it to support our agent partners and to continue to drive those customers who want to transact to high-performing agents. Raise your hand if you want to break down and I'm happy to... Yeah. Hey, Tom, you guys want me to start on this one? Yeah. Nothing to do with Phoenix and Atlanta and only incidentally has anything to do with Flex, as I described last time, Tom. And you described MVP as legacy, it's just - we run multiple business models and with an eye towards optimization and getting to the customer solutions that we want and the solutions that are great for our partners, too. So I want to try to walk back a perception that MVP is legacy et cetera. And so as I said before, the Raleigh and Denver testing has to do with building out the Super App and integrating the services, okay, and having a clean slate from which we can do that. Of course, running the markets with revenues and profits in mind as well, okay? So they really aren't connected to each other. Although, as I said before, you will see us do more things in more markets and it may look different. It may look the same, it may look different depending on the outcome of the experiments we're running, right. In terms of selling time and touring, like we're working hard. I cited one sparkler in my script around a movement - a mix shift of, I think, 400 basis points I said, towards touring as the Andres activity to call that action for - amongst our connections, which is a real positive because we know those customers convert at a much higher rate into transactions and revenues for us. And so what we're doing is lots of little things on the site with calls to action and design and functionality with the touring functionality that is encouraging people to reach out via a tour on Zillow app and our other consumer customer services. We hope with - yes, I talked a bit about real-time availability, which is early days, but it's -- that's a really exciting one. That one could be something long term that is sort of a game changer for physical home touring. That is really good. And it's linked, I didn't really say it in my script, but the virtual tour with the new floorplan tech and the 380 homes technology that we have that is super cool is not only awesome for customers because it acts as a good filter because people can visualize what a home is much more richly and accurately in the virtual space on their smartphone or at their computer, which means we get a higher signal to noise on the tour itself because people are self filtering because of better virtual attack. Anyway, these things are interrelated, and we love that we're pushing hard on both of these fronts. Yeah. So the impact on Q2 revenue related to Raleigh and Denver is immaterial. We recognize revenue as leads are delivered in Raleigh and Denver. And so there's not the same impact as when we flipped in Phoenix and Atlanta. I want me to go first, Allen. Within current anticipated market headwinds, it shouldn't affect us, Naved. Of course, if there's a terrible storm that blows in the market brands to a halt and goes on for a long time, we could change our views. But the fundamentals behind kind of the fundamentals behind our 2025 target to $5 billion in revenue and 45% EBITDA margins really revolve around converting more connections into transactions and increasing our basket size, our dollars for transactions by integrating more and more services into that transaction. And the biggest lever is moving from 3% of transaction penetration today to about 6% by 2025. That is the really big mover. The denominator matters, of course, but in most scenarios, it is really the penetration that is the big lever, not the denominator. Maybe I'll start with the growth one. In Turitea [ph] as we look at the Q2 guide, the growth in our Premier Agent revenue is really about this low inventory listing, this imbalance in supply and demand and how that is impacting affordability for some of our customers. We do believe that, that is temporary. This is not about our traffic or our customers that are on our sites intend to try to buy a home. There's just not that much out there. And that's affecting - that macro factor is affecting our ability to help customers transact. So when you look at the macro and how it affects our revenue, that informs our decision also to say that we're not slowing down on some of our investments. We're tracking this closely and we're going to continue to monitor it. We're well positioned as a profitable company that delivers strong free cash flow. And we - that's important to us. But it doesn't change the thesis or our conviction for the thesis on how we can drive more transactions through technology and innovation across a broader set of services, generating higher revenue transaction.

It's affecting our revenue, but we still see the demand and it doesn't change our growth trajectory or how we think about the 2025 targets. We'll continue to monitor it and track it. But right now, we believe touring, financing, seller services, enhancing our partner network and integrating across the Super App platform are the right five pillars that are going to drive the 2025 success. Okay. Thank you. I know it's a really super busy day and a kind of a crazy day. It is times like this when you all and we all turn from looking at revenues and income statements and we look at balance sheets, what boats are seaworthy if we're sailing into some choppy waters overall.

            "name": "Allen Parker",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich, and hello, everyone. We continue to be excited about the prospects of our strategic direction. We believe building innovative products and services to help a broader set of customers navigate buying and selling homes will deliver better customer experiences, help our partners work with higher-intent customers to grow their businesses and drive sustainable, long-term shareholder value. I'm going to take a brief moment to provide an update on the progress of winding down our iBuying operations, and then I'll discuss our quarterly results and Q2 outlook. We remain focused on executing on our plans to wind down our iBuying operations and despite some choppiness in the macro environment, we exceeded both our internal expectations and external outlook for the Home segment. We reported Home segment revenue of $3.7 billion for Q1, exceeding our outlook range of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion provided in early February. The revenue outperformance benefited primarily from higher resell velocity. Better-than-expected pricing drove Q1 Home segment EBITDA of $23 million, better than our outlook of a loss of $20 million at the high end of our range. There were approximately 1,280 homes in inventory at the end of the quarter and approximately 100 homes that are currently not yet under contract to be sold. We expect the sale of our remaining inventory to be substantially complete in Q2 with operations and a small amount of inventory extending into Q3. We now believe that the total cash flow generated from the wind-down process of our iBuying inventory and operations will be approximately $450 million after considering selling the inventory, paying off the asset-backed related debt, including financing costs, losses on inventory, gains realized or expected, wind down costs and net operating EBITDA losses. The faster-than-expected wind-down resulted in us paying off our iBuying buying asset-backed debt completely at the end of April, and the note holders will be repaid fully in mid-May. The better-than-expected cash from the wind-down process compared to our initial expectations of breakeven contributed to our excess capital to be able to return to shareholders and our $1 billion share buyback. Now moving to our core business results. Despite the ongoing turbulent housing market that Rich discussed, we again delivered results in line or above our outlook ranges on revenue and EBITDA as we focus on executing against our 2025 target. IMT segment revenue was $490 million, growing 10% year-over-year. Our IMT segment revenue was slightly above the $487 million midpoint of our outlook range. Premier Agent revenue grew 9% year-over-year and outperformed industry growth of 4% in Q1 as we continued our focus on making better connections between high-intent customers and high-performing agents. While we are clearly not immune from the macro in the near term, our work on discovering higher-intent customers and working with an increasing mix of higher-performing agents has led to higher lead conversion rates. This gives us confidence that we can offset some of the housing market headwinds as they develop. As Rich discussed earlier, in Q1, we made progress on moving towards a higher mix of touring, which helps improve conversion rates by allowing us to see the higher intent buyer signal. We expect the planned integration with showing time to further improve the touring customer experience and meet more customers doing requests. We are also investing to improve the showing time experience for the entire industry. As we mentioned in our Q1 outlook, we saw a wider range of potential outcomes for Premier Agent revenue from the slower housing activity late in Q4. This trend largely played through in Q1 with new for-sale inventory listings down double digits on a year-over-year basis. Despite that, our customer and agent activity levels continue to indicate they remain strong underlying customer demand that drove continued strong home price appreciation. Rentals revenue was down 5% year-over-year and flat sequentially, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to see pressure from high occupancy rates, which dampened demand for rentals advertising. IMT segment EBITDA was $209 million for Q1 or 43% of revenue, exceeding our outlook of $201 million and 40% - 41% of revenue at the midpoint. The outperformance was driven by a combination of better-than-expected operating efficiency, as well as lower-than-anticipated advertising and marketing spend. Mortgages segment revenue of $46 million was near the midpoint of our Q1 outlook range, as refinancing loan originations slowed following the rapid increase in interest rates during the quarter. Gain on sale margins compressed more than expectations as the drop in demand for refinance loans resulted in excess industry capacity. Mortgages segment adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $12 million, at the upper end of our outlook, as we manage operating expenses as purchase origination volumes dropped sequentially in connection with the wind-down of our iBuying operations. Before I turn to our outlook for Q2, I would like to reiterate that the resale of inventory from our capital-intensive iBuying business is nearly complete, and we believe that Zillow is in a strong position to pursue our 2025 initiatives. We feel confident that our traffic, brand, balance sheet and positive cash flow generating core business will provide us the flexibility to navigate the challenging housing market. We ended Q1 with $3.6 billion in cash and investments, an increase of $500 million from 3.1 at the end of Q4, inclusive of the impact of $348 million in share repurchases during Q1. We have approximately $100 million remaining under the current $750 million share repurchase authorization. And our Board of Directors has approved an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization. This reflects our belief that under various ranges of housing market scenarios, we expect to remain profitable and positive cash flow - with positive cash flow. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. In our IMT segment, we expect flat year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 at the midpoint of our outlook range. Within the IMT segment, we expect Premier Agent revenue to be between $335 million and $350 million, down 2% year-over-year at the midpoint of the outlook range. While we continue to focus on connecting high-intent customers to all of our partners, our Q2 Premier Agent revenue outlook is largely informed by the macro trends that we are seeing with lower year-over-year growth in new for-sale listings, home appreciation at an increasing average transaction prices, but also contributing to affordability challenges along with higher mortgage rates. We realize these macro issues are making it harder for customers to transact and may also affect our partner network. Within the overall IMT revenue outlook, we note that in rentals, while we are not guiding to specific revenue figures, we are expecting sequential revenue growth in Q2 due to seasonality. Additionally, we are also seeing early signs that low rental vacancies may be subsiding. We expect Q2 IMT segment EBITDA margin to be 38% at the midpoint of our outlook. While we have taken some costs out of our initial Q2 plan, we are making a strategic decision to continue to invest in our key initiatives in Q2 as planned despite the deceleration in real estate industry growth trends. We are continuing to monitor the macro environment, and we control the levers on our core business and pace of investments to enable us to prudently manage costs. We expect our Mortgages segment revenue to be between $31 million and $39 million in Q2, which is down sequentially from Q1. Our Q2 outlook reflects slower refinance activity due to higher mortgage rates and lower gain on sale spreads due to the competitive industry environment, partially offset by sequential growth in purchase mortgages as we redirect the focus of our operations. As we are now past the impact of the iBuying wind-down on purchased mortgage leads, we have started to rebuild our pipeline and expect modest purchase mortgage growth in Q2. We expect Mortgages segment adjusted EBITDA to be between a loss of $18 million and a loss of $13 million based upon current capacity, expected market conditions and additional investments in operations to integrate mortgages with our other products and services. In Q2, we expect our Home segment revenue to be $450 million and adjusted EBITDA to be a loss of $15 million at the midpoint of our outlook range. We also expect to complete the wind down of our iBuying operations during the second half of this year. So as we look forward, our priorities remain focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners. We plan to grow our customer engagement through a compelling dream in-shop experience, deliver a more integrated customer transactional experience to drive customers to choose to transact with us and our partners, invest in sustainable top line growth opportunities across the company, including new integrated services that are more scalable, less subject to earnings volatility and more capital efficient and lastly, manage our cost structure to improve productivity to drive a profitable, scalable and positive cash flow company. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. You can jump in. So what I'd say is you're right that when you look to our guide, which is at the midpoint, down about 2% year-over-year, and it's about at the midpoint, 6% down sequentially from Q1. It reflects what we're seeing in the macro and how that is affecting our customers and how we would work with our partner agents. So this is really a macro story. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. We're not guiding past Q2. There's a lot - our goal, as we think to the 2025 is to obviously do things to continue to attract high intent customers and get them with high-performing agents, and we're continuing to make progress on those things, but they're likely to arrive new features are likely to arrive over time. So I would just say, based on our visibility, which is Q2, these macro headwinds are affecting our revenue given the guidance range, they're all factored into the guidance range that we're giving, which is the negative 2% growth midpoint. Yeah. Why don't I start - thank you for the question. Why don't I start, Richard, you could jump in. So the markets that we made adjustments in that came out with Raleigh in Denver. So I just want to correct that. But we are extremely and firmly focused on this vision to build the Super App for a mass market of movers. And we've talked about the five pillars that we consider driving in how we get there. So launching Raleigh and Denver as two dedicated test markets allows us to have this clean slate for research and development to test and iterate. This is a targeted approach to help us get a read on what works and what doesn't. And to figure out what effectively scales while minimizing disruptions across our entire partner network. These were flipped to a flex model because this post paid model works better for this testing environment because we have more visibility into our partners' processes, and it minimizes their financial risk as we introduce and test and refine our new experiences. So what we learned from these markets, we're going to - we expect to use across all of our markets across a broad set of customers, across both monetization models. So this is really just our ability to test, iterate and learn. It's - we expect and intend to have kind of a hybrid mix of monetization models going forward. And this wasn't any kind of indication about Flex versus MPP. So our focus is delivering high intent movers that drives more value to our partners regardless of the monetization model. This just set us up to have two great test environments, along with the other markets. Let me jump in, Ygal, and editorialize a little bit. Yes, it's ironic. I was kind of chuckling that Raleigh in Denver is R&D. But that is what's going on here. What you're seeing, unfortunately, you broke into the public and it's created some questions like you're asking. Normally, this wouldn't have broken into the public, but of course, it involves partners, so things do get out. This, I think, you and our investors should take as a sign of us making progress against the five pillars. We're really working hard to enhance our partner network and to try out all kinds of new stuff in order to get to the Super App and integrate this transaction. And having a post paid model in these test markets enable - it lowers the barrier to participation on the part of partners. It makes it a lot easier to participate and lets us lets us iterate rapidly. So really, I wouldn't get too hung up on this being Flex or MBP or whatever. This is us basically working hard against the five growth pillars to enhance the partner network, integrate finance, come up with interesting solutions and to integrate all these services. That is what's going on here. And it will - we will continue to run and as we push towards the super app and experiment with these models, we will continue to run interesting experiments into different cities. So you will see more of this. And anyway, I take it as a good sign of progress. Yeah. Yeah. This is Allan. I'll answer that, John. Yes, we're not providing, as Rich said, these are two monetization models that both result in us allowing high-intent customers to get to high-performing agents, and we participate in doing that either in adjusting the prices over time in MP through the auction process or the success fee with the Flex model. We have grown Flex over the last year as we've expanded that across more ZIP codes. But - and we do believe that Flex is an alignment tool, not necessarily a step function improvement in profitability or conversion across our best performers. But it's an alignment tool. So it's likely our Flex partners will be participating more in other products and services. That's a lot of what we're going to learn. We believe that to the extent we innovate and on behalf of our customers and make a delightful experience, even some of our MVP partners will find it useful to leverage our loans and our closing services and other services. But we're not at this time. There's no fixed number. There's not anything out there that says this is where we need to be in flex in order to hit our targets. We believe both monetization models work, both include great performing agents. Most of what we're focusing on is building the integrated Super App platform that allows these services to work well together, and we expect that both partners in Flex and MEP will want to utilize those services as that value prop to their customers and to their ability to close improves. Like we're excited about and excited but we're prudent as well. You've seen us lean in and out of things aggressively and aggressively prudently in the past. And we continue to have that attitude. But we do see a lot of upside. And just an indicator for you. I'll just hit it, but we did just - our Board did just authorize $1 billion share repurchase, which is a nod to how much cash we're generating, how much cash we raised in order to fund a kind of capital hungry eye buying business and how we want to return that capital now. But it's also expresses the confidence in the kind of nimbleness and inherent profitability in our current business. So that should give you an indicator. In terms of the summer season selling summer season signals, I'd say they're mixed. I actually just came from an industry conference in San Antonio with a bunch of big brokers and industry players. And I would say it's just - it's mixed. People are in kind of wait-and-see mode. Everybody's kind of commenting on just what a weird market it is with such a high supply demand or demand supply imbalance that hasn't actually writhed itself for quite some time. The industry is expecting it to do so, but the underlying dynamics, the demographics supporting more and more demand coming online are strong. And so it's - it continues to be a weird market. I would say people don't exactly know what to expect. It isn't all doom and gloom, but it's foggy, I guess, is what I would say.\nQ \u2013Unidentified Analyst: Understood. Thanks."

Thanks for dialing-in for our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. We are posting great revenue numbers across the whole of our increasingly diversified and growing businesses. Our early cohort of enhanced markets are working. So we are pressing the accelerator on expansion in 2024. I'm also pleased to share that we released an updated investor presentation available on our Investor Relations website to bring them all up to speed on the progress we've made on our growth pillars. We'll kick off the discussion today by walking you through our quarterly results, briefly addressing what's happening in the broader real estate industry, highlighting the opportunity in front of Zillow and then take you through the exciting progress we're making on our journey to innovate and transform the way people buy, sell, finance and rent homes. Starting with our quarterly results, we reported better than expected and accelerated revenue growth with Q4 total revenue of $474 million, up 9% year-over-year. Residential revenue of $349 million increased 3% year-over-year, returning to positive year-over-year growth. During the same timeframe, the broader real estate industry declined by 4%, meaning Zillow's residential revenue outperformed the industry by 700 basis points. As I said, Q4 now marks the sixth consecutive quarter of meaningful outperformance versus the industry. Our ongoing efforts to improve our customer funnel, capture more demand, connect more of that demand to our partner network and focus on conversion, continue to drive impressive results. Rentals also had a strong quarter with accelerating revenue growth, up 37% year-over-year to $93 million. This performance was driven by Accelerating Multifamily Property growth with over 37,000 properties listed across Zillow at the end of Q4 2023. We continue to be the number one most visited rentals platform with average monthly rentals, unique users up double digits year-over-year in Q4. We are well-positioned for future rentals revenue growth which Jeremy Wacksman will discuss in more detail later in the call. We're also making excellent progress in our mortgages push, growing our purchase mortgage origination volume by more than 100% year-over-year in Q4 and further integrating Zillow Home Loans with our Premier Agent partners. Before we dive deeper into all the progress we've made over the last two years. I'd like to give our view of the latest real estate industry goings on. We're monitoring the progress of numerous lawsuits facing several organizations within the industry. Zillow is not a named party in these suits. And we are confident in our ability to meaningfully grow our company in this evolving climate. In November, we laid out our marketplace principles that underlie Zillow's position. We continue to advocate for what we believe is best for consumers and the industry as a whole. First, we believe in our real estate marketplace that is transparent and fair in which consumers and agents have easy and equitable access to listings and information. Second, we believe buyers and sellers deserve independent representation. And finally, we believe consumers should be well-informed on agent compensation and their rights to negotiate. Recently we elaborated on these views on a new webpage advocacy.zillowgroup.com that outlines consumers real estate rights and how we are working to elevate industry standards on their behalf. This includes efforts to allow better integrated search experiences that can include all listing types in one view, be there for sale by agent, for sale by owner, new construction or for rent, as well as to educate consumers on the potential pitfalls of double citing with dual agency among others. We recently supported legislation in our home state of Washington that requires buyer's agent agreements so that consumers are aware of the services, they are buying and who pays. In New York, our Street Easy and Zillow teams are working with lawmakers and advocates to create much needed transparency for consumers, ensure agents are fairly compensated and open the door for more access and affordability in New York's rental market. Those are just a few examples, but the key takeaway is that we have found a louder and crisper voice championing what's good for mover consumers, agents and the industry as a whole given legacy practices are being actively debated and negotiated right now. Settlements and court ordered equitable relief may provide some near-term direction for the industry and some industry practices will likely be improved. For example, it could become more common to use buyer agent agreements to make fees more transparent and negotiable. But ultimately, we continue to expect industry change to play out over many years. Regardless of the industry debates, Zillow is well-positioned for all weather due to our long history and future of technology innovation driving differentiated products and services which has resulted in a large engaged audience a beloved brand and a growing diversified business. We believe all roads lead to Zillow. Zooming out from our quarterly results and the latest state of play in the real estate industry, two years ago, we introduced our new growth strategy and broke down the massive TAM opportunity for Zillow. This quarter, we released a refined and better way to size that opportunity, resulting in a $30 billion accessible TAM of customers already in our funnel and raising their hands to connect. I'll do the math to arrive at this number in a moment and then pass it over to Jeremy Wacksman to talk you through the progress we've made over the last two years. The proof points, the signal, why we are confident in pressing the accelerator on expansion. We are pleased with what we've accomplished since laying out our growth pillars in early 2022. We see this strategy as a continuation of what we've been working on since we founded the company in 2006 with the charge of turning on the lights in real estate. Over the years, we've built engaging and practical products and services designed to empower consumers with data and information, transforming a previously opaque marketplace into the more transparent one we experienced today. But turning on the lights only got Zillow and our large audience so far, to effect real change for consumers and open up a much larger opportunity we needed to focus on digital transformation of the moving experience end-to-end and begin our work on the transaction itself. Every one of those move knows that the process is complicated, time consuming and expensive. The onus is primarily on the consumer to play the role of project managers/systems integrator to research, shop, select, finance, appraise and close, bringing all these disparate pieces together. It's a labyrinth and it's clear that consumers want and need better. And they'll eventually get it, they always do. So, we set out to build the housing Super App and integrated digital experience wherein all the disparate pieces of the [indiscernible] moving process are brought together on one platform, Zillow. Rooted in our original commitment to turn on the lights, Zillow's housing Super App empowers consumers by delivering real estate data and education, a suite of Zillow owned solutions and a network of best-in-class partners at their fingertips. Well, the housing Super App is here today, it's called the Zillow. Zillow is now the container into which we will continually place new features and services that work together seamlessly to solve real customer and partner pain points in their moves. We have tested and iterated the experience over the last two years updating you all along the way. Our growth pillars, which Jeremy Wacksman will talk more about in a moment, serve as a roadmap for the continual upgrades and improvements we are adding to the Zillow experience as we expand our breadth and depth of coverage across more markets. Our opportunity is to take our current small slice of a large total addressable market and grow it into a much bigger piece of the pie. U.S. For Sale Housing represents $2 trillion in total transaction value or TTV. Of that $2 trillion of TTV, there were approximately $162 billion of service fees in 2023 across buy and sell side agent referral fees, mortgage fees and closing fees. Based on survey data, we estimate that 70% of all consumers who transact, visit and use Zillow, resulting in a $113 billion Zillow Visitor TAM. Cutting that down to just shoppers who raised their hands on Zillow, meaning, they proactively request to connect with one or more of our services. We estimate first, a $16 billion opportunity made up of brokerage referral, mortgage, closing and other homebuyer related transaction fees associated with those higher intent buyers. This is low hanging fruit buy side TAM, not just people visiting our site, but actual buyers actively engaged in seeking to do business with us. Additionally, on the sell side we have good line of sight on an estimated $14 billion of sell side TAM derived from our increasing opportunity to capture more sell side referral fees and listing marketing budgets from those agents already actively engaged in our funnel. This adds up to a current accessible $30 billion For Sale revenue opportunity with high intent, hand raising consumers already in Zillow's funnel. Today, we captured $1.5 billion of that $30 billion accessible TAM. That $1.5 billion is our reported 2023 Residential and Mortgages Revenue. Measured as a fraction of TTV we stood at a mere 7 basis points in 2023. Oh, my, so much Blue Ocean. Our position as one of the largest Internet brands in the United States alongside iconic brands such as Facebook, Spotify and Netflix gives us confidence that we have many years of growth into that $30 billion of revenue TAM accessible in our funnel today. Over the last 15 plus years, we've released a constant stream of novel engaging and practical product innovations. We just have great brands are created. Zillow Brand has over 60% unaided brand awareness amongst shoppers which is rare for a brand to achieve in any category. Okay, that is of course internal survey data, but you can see a good impartial proxy for this strength in our Google search activity where Zillow was searched more on Google than the category term \"real estate\". And three times more than our nearest competitors brand. Further evidence of our brand strength is seen in our traffic composition. About 80% of Zilliow's traffic is organic. As well as in our app usage, which is more than three times our nearest competitor. We pioneered mobile real estate shopping with our leading iPhone and Android apps. And when Apple first launch the iPad, the Zillow app was highlighted by Steve Jobs on stage at the launch event. Taking things full circle, this month we partnered with Apple once again for the launch of Zillow Immerse on the new Apple Vision Pro to offer mover consumers and interactive and immersive way to explore listing showcase listings with special technology. Try it. It's early, but it's an extraordinary home touring experience. We have been and will continue to be the company that is on the leading edge of utilizing technology to create magic new consumer and agent experiences. So I've laid out a more refined view of the opportunities as we see it, quite large, quite complex, quite accessible for us. We monetize very little of it today, yet it's in our store. I've also outlined the reasons to believe that Zillow can and will tap this $30 billion accessible TAM. One, we have the leading audience brand and engagement. Two, we have proven technology and product talent that is unrivaled in the real estate industry. Three, we have built an extensive talented and increasingly integrated partner network. And four, we have a strong balance sheet that gives us the flexibility to pursue current and future growth opportunities. For these reasons, we are uniquely well-positioned to transform and re-platform the largest industry in the country. We spent the last two years building the integrated transaction experience and testing it in enhanced markets. Now it's time to press down on the accelerator to increase our breadth of coverage across more markets and our depth of penetration in those markets. We made a great deal of progress in 2023, we will make more in 2024. Okay. I've talked about our opportunity and our vision for the future of real estate. Now, I will pass the microphone over to our COO, Jeremy Wacksman to give you a more detailed progress report and where we are headed.\nJeremy Wacksman: Thank you, Rich. And good afternoon, everyone. As Rich said, Zillow's housing Super App is the container into which we are continually adding upgrades and improvements, guided by five for sale growth pillars, touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services. Our For Sale growth pillars mark the pathway to meeting our goals to grow customer transaction share from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025 and grow our revenue alongside that transaction share growth. You'll note that we've also added rentals as an additional growth pillar this quarter. We're excited about the opportunities here as our rentals marketplace continues to accelerate and accounted for nearly 20% of Zillow's total revenue in 2023. I'll kick off our growth pillar update with touring. The investments we're making here continue to drive our industry outperformance. When a customer raises her hand to look at a home she has been coveting on Zillow, it's a strong signal of serious intend to transact. As we work to convert more visitors on our site into transactors, the home tour remains a critical focus area for us. Touring has historically been painful for both movers and agents. So we've invested in making the process more seamless than it's ever been. Our real-time touring product powered by showing time is meaningfully improving our ability to connect high intent customers to our premier agent partners. We ended Q4 with our real-time touring product delivering approximately 10% of our total connections. We expect to expand our breadth of coverage by launching additional markets and increase our depth by growing real-time touring to account for approximately 20% of connections by the end of 2024. This is driving a better customer and agent experience with less friction. As we see increased successful connections and more customers working with agents. Equally as important as touring is financing. And as a reminder, approximately 40% of all homebuyers start their journey shopping for a mortgage and 80% of those buyers don't yet have an agents. Knowing that almost all of these mortgage seekers use Zillow positions us well to build a substantial direct to consumer purchase mortgage business that is seamlessly integrated with our extensive premier agent partner network. By integrating Zillow Home Loans with our premier agent partner network, we are creating a better customer experience from the start of the homebuying journey on Zillow to when a customer moves into that brand new home. And it's clear that customers and partners are increasingly enjoying this integrated housing Super App experience. Most notably our efforts are driving purchase mortgage growth. In our original four enhanced markets, we saw our customer adoption rates climb from 6% to 15% over the course of 2023. Since Q1 2023, the percentage of purchase mortgages in which a customer works with a premier agent partner increased from 23% to 53%. All of this success translates to $487 million in purchase loan origination volume this quarter, a more than 100% year-over-year increase despite a very challenging mortgage rate environment. We expect continued mortgage growth as we follow our roadmap 2025. Expanding integration with premier agent partners, rolling out more enhanced markets and converting more high intent customers on Zillow. I'll now move on to seller services honing in on listing showcase. Listing showcase elevates agents brand presence on Zillow and helps them win more listings. Our AI powered listing showcase also improved the shopper experience through listings that are powered by our homegrown rich media and floor plan technology. This is a unique differentiator in the marketplace and a significant benefit to buyer engagement and experience. We are in the early days of this product having launched in Q3, but it is clear already there is significant demand from listing agents and significant engagement with consumers. Listing showcase listings received 68% more page views, 66% more saves, 63% more shares. We are actively rolling out listing showcase nationwide with the intermediate term goal of 5% to 10% listing coverage, which represents a $150 million to $300 million annual revenue opportunity. And we believe there is potential future growth beyond that. Moving onto our next growth pillar update, enhancing our partner network. Our mandate here is simple, help the best agents provide better service to more of our shared customers to grow their businesses and our business. And we are doing this in a few ways. First, we're expanding our enhanced market partners. Increasing our depth of coverage in existing markets and our breadth by growing our enhanced market footprint from nine at the end of 2023 to a projected 40 markets by the end of 2024. Second, we're working to deliver the integrated experience between ZHL and premier agent. As a result, one in two premier agent partners in our enhanced markets are now introducing their customers to Zillow Home Loans, and that's up from one in five at the end of 2022. Lastly, we are excited to accelerate improvements to Follow Up Boss and make it available to more agents to increase conversion. With the power of Follow Up Boss, our premier agent partners will be better equipped than ever to deliver the best possible customer experience, whilst supercharging their businesses. We think these efforts across the board will drive transaction conversion to help close the gap on the vast majority of Zillow Connections that transact elsewhere and better tap the $30 billion accessible revenue TAM that Rich walked you through. Moving onto our last For Sale growth pillar update, integrating our services. Doing this requires us to pull together consumer, agent and loan officer technology in one place, Zillow, to create an end-to-end experience that carries the customer through the entire transaction process with more transparency and ease. It's no small feat, but it's what consumers want and we're in the best-positioned to deliver to them. As evidenced by our performance in our earliest two enhanced markets, Phoenix and Atlanta, our integrated strategy is working to drive customer transaction share gains. Since the beginning of 2022, our customer transaction share has grown more than 80%. Additionally, across our entire set of nine enhanced markets, we are seeing consistent outperformance in connections growth versus the industry. This gives us great confidence to further expand our enhanced markets footprint more rapidly in 2024. As we expand to a projected 40 enhanced markets by the end of 2024, our integration within those markets is going to cover 20% of total Zillow connections by the end of the year. We land in each market with a subset of partner and customer coverage and work to expand our product offerings across the market over time. We are seeing share gains that will move the needle as we roll out more enhanced markets throughout the year into 2025. I'll wrap up with a progress update on rentals. Rentals is a fast growing business with a big opportunity in front of it. Nearly every homebuyer starts out as a renter and providing our customers with optionality is as important as ever in a challenging housing market. Today, we have the largest audience of rentals and the most listings in the market with limited marketing spend to date. We're now leveraging our position as traffic leader to grow our multifamily properties, which has accelerated our multifamily revenue growth year-on year from 14% in Q4 2022 to 52% in Q4 2023. As we look to serve more of this market and grow revenue, we plan to expand the number of multifamily properties and deliver a superior experience for our rentals partners. Before handing it over to Jeremy Hofmann, I do want to highlight that while we've been building these past few years, we've meaningfully outperformed a challenged housing market. For full year 2023, Zillow reported over $1.9 billion in revenue, outperforming the real estate industry by 1,600 basis points. I'm grateful to our teams who have been working hard to bring Zillow's housing Super App to life over the last two years, solving real customer pain points with exceptional tech solutions and partners. We are looking forward to continued growth in the years ahead. With that, I will now pass the line over to Jeremy.\nJeremy Hofmann: Thanks, Jeremy. And hello, everyone. As you've heard from Rich and Jeremy, we are pleased with how we've executed on our strategy and we are starting to see those efforts show up in our financial results despite the persistently challenging housing macro backdrop. In my comments today, I will cover our Q4 results, our outlook for Q1, some early thoughts on 2024 to help you all understand how we expect the year to play out, as well as the financial philosophy that underpins how we\u2019ll manage the business moving forward. I will start with our Q4 2023 results, which exceeded expectations across the board. Revenue growth accelerated in Q4, up 9% year-over-year to $474 million, which was more than $31 million above the midpoint of our outlook range. Revenue outperformance was driven by acceleration across each of our revenue lines for residential, mortgages and rentals. On a GAAP basis, Q4 net loss was $73 million, representing 15% of our revenue. EBITDA was $69 million for the quarter. When excluding the impact of a $14 million one-time expense related to the partial lease termination of our Seattle office space, EBITDA would have been $83 million, resulting in an 18% EBITDA margin and marking a return to positive year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion. The combination of our revenue outperformance and effective cost management delivered the improved year-over-year EBITDA results despite a macro housing environment that remains constraint. Going a quick deeper, the partial lease termination option for our Seattle office space, which we previewed on our last earnings call was exercised in December. As a result, we estimate our 2024 facilities costs will decrease by $8 million and we will release an estimated $37 million in EBITDA expenses in total over the remaining life of the Seattle lease, which more than makes up for this one-time expense impacting our Q4 EBITDA. Returning to more details on the quarter, our Q4 residential revenue of $349 million outperformed our outlook range and revenue growth accelerated to 3% year-over-year. Our residential revenue performance was 700 basis points above the industry decline of 4%, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. We believe our Q4 outperformance was primarily driven by our ongoing investments in our top of funnel and mid funnel experiences that continue to drive improvements in our overall lead volumes. Rentals revenue growth accelerated in Q4 with revenue increasing 37% year-over-year to $93 million, primarily driven by our multifamily revenue, which grew 52% year-over-year in Q4. Our rental strategy is working well and our team is executing on growing the number of multifamily properties on our apps and sites, which reached an all-time high of 37,000 multifamily properties as of year-end. Total listings across our entire rentals marketplace were also up 40% year-over-year to an industry leading 1.7 million listings. Mortgages revenue of $22 million in Q4 returned to positive growth, up 22% year-over-year. With purchased loan origination volume growing 105% year-over-year. We are executing on our mortgage strategy to help more of our customers get financing through Zillow Home Loans. The tools and integration capabilities we have built are creating a bridge between premier agent partners, ZHL loan officers and our buyer customers, which is why we are seeing more than 50% of funded loans across all markets coming from customers working with a premier agent partner. This was a critical puzzle for us to solve before expanding more rapidly in 2024 and we are pleased with the progress to date. EBITDA expenses in Q4 totaled $405 million. Excluding the one-time partial lease termination expense I mentioned earlier, EBITDA expenses would have totaled $391 million, roughly flat sequentially from Q3. And at the low end of our outlook range as a result of our ongoing focus on cost management. Cost of revenue increased $26 million or 29% year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in website development costs as we continue to test and release new products. We ended the year with $2.8 billion in cash and investments, down from $3.3 billion at the end of Q3. This includes the benefit of net cash provided by operating activities, the impact of $88 million in share repurchases during Q4. The impact of $56 million towards convertible debt repurchases below par. And the approximately $400 million closing cash purchase price, a Follow Up Boss. Post repurchases of convertible debt in the quarter, we have $1.6 billion of principal outstanding. Before turning the page to 2024, I want to highlight how pleased I am with our execution throughout the entirety of 2023. We accelerated revenue growth from a decrease of 13% year-over-year in Q1 to an increase of 9% year-over-year in Q4. When combining the revenue growth with a disciplined approach to our cost structure, we feel well-positioned entering this year. Turning to our outlook for Q1, I first want to level set on what we expect for existing homes total transaction value. We estimate total transaction value to be between a decline of 4% to up 1% year-over-year in Q1. With that as a backdrop, we expect total company revenue to be between $495 million to $510 million, implying a year-over-year increase of 7% at the midpoint of our outlook range. We expect residential revenue to be between $365 million to $375 million, up 2% year-over-year at the midpoint of our outlook range. Despite the tough macro existing home sales environment, we expect our residential revenue to outperform the industry in Q1 as our growth pillars begin to contribute to revenue and the investments we have made in our overall funnel continue to deliver benefits. We expect rentals revenue to continue to grow more than 30% year-over-year in Q1 as we benefit from the strength of our execution and favorable industry backdrop, driving landlord demand for advertisers. We expect positive growth in mortgages revenue year-over-year in Q1. We plan to expand integration with our premier agent partners in enhanced markets, send more of our mortgage leads to ZHL directly and drive engagement with more consumers on our apps and sites to grow our origination volumes. For Q1, we expect EBITDA to be between $95 million and $105 million, implying a 20% margin at the midpoint of our outlook range. This implies EBITDA expenses will increase from the $391 million in Q4 that excludes the lease termination expense. The increase is being driven by three primary factors. One, we take on a full quarter of operating costs for Follow Up Boss. Two, there is an annual increase in payroll taxes that occurs every Q1. And three, we are staffing up variable head count for sales, given the growth we expect in 2024 from rentals, listing showcase and Zillow Home Loans. Moving onto 2024 as a whole, we want to provide some color for how we expect the year to play out based on the information we have today. First, we are currently assuming that the housing market is relatively flat in aggregate for the year. With that as a backdrop, we expect to drive double digit revenue growth for the full year, implying accelerated year-over-year revenue growth throughout the year from the high single digits in Q1 that I discussed in our outlook. As we increased the breadth and depth of our products and services throughout the year, we expect our growth pillars will drive the vast majority of the revenue growth across our business in 2024. More specifically, in our residential revenue category, we expect continued market outperformance as we expand touring, make top of funnel improvements, integrate Follow Up Boss into our sales motions and expand the rollout of listing showcase. I will note that we expect the revenue contribution from Follow Up Boss to be a low single digit percentage of our total company revenue in 2024. In rentals, we expect continued strong growth as we increase our multifamily properties and total listings. In mortgages, we expect Zillow Home Loans integration with premier agents and our enhanced market expansion to drive meaningful growth. On the cost side, we believe our fixed investments are at the right level, which should result in our fixed costs growing modestly with inflation and our variable cost growing with or slightly ahead of revenue initially as we ramp up new hires to be fully productive. When combining our expected revenue growth and cost discipline, we expect modest EBITDA margin expansion for the full year. Beyond our revenue and EBITDA expenses, share based compensation expense is an area of focus for us. We expect the absolute dollars of 2024, share based compensation expense to be lower than 2023. And we expect to leverage SBC as a percentage of revenue from the combination of lower absolute dollars in SBC expense and projected revenue growth. Stepping back from our Q4 results, Q1 outlook and 2024 early thoughts, I want to discuss the financial philosophy we have as a company as we execute on our go forward strategy. As you heard from both Rich and Jeremy, Zillow today is a much different business from what it was several years ago. Our revenue base has diversified to the point where a majority of our revenue is now derived from sources other than buyside fees. We have growth pillars, we are executing against and are excited about with a $30 billion For Sale revenue opportunity accessible in our funnel today. As we continue to execute on our growth pillars, while controlling fixed costs and gaining leverage on share based compensation expense, we expect to deliver operating leverage resulting in strong GAAP profitability over time. Beyond our organic investments, we have made several acquisitions to accelerate our growth pillars. For example, we acquired showing time in 2021, which accelerated our launch of real-time touring. Since then, we acquired two real estate media businesses. [BRX] (ph) scenario to scale showing time plus as listing showcase product with both first party and third party photographers. We also acquired Spruce, a tech enabled title and closing business to add to our housing Super App experience over time. And most recently we acquired Follow Up Boss to create a best-in-class CRM for our premier agents and the industry. M&A is not our core strategy. However, we will continue to pursue selective opportunities when we find ways to accelerate our growth pillars. Beyond our day-to-day operating philosophy, we have been active in deploying capital over the past several years, returning $1.7 million to shareholders since the beginning of our stock repurchase program in Q4 2021. And we plan to continue to be opportunistic with the program going forward. Last, we remain focused on retiring our outstanding convertible debt. In 2023, we repurchased a total of $58 million in principal of our 2025 notes. We now have $1.6 billion of convertible senior notes which we may opportunistically redeemed if they become callable. To close, I'll reiterate what you have heard from us before. 2022 was a year where we re-strategize and reorganized around our housing Super App vision. 2023 was a year for us to release new products and test in various markets, setting us up for more depth and more breadth in 2024 and 2025. We are clearly executing on our strategy and look forward to sharing more updates throughout 2024. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from John Campbell with Stephens. Please proceed.\nJohn Campbell: Hey, guys. Good afternoon.\nRich Barton: Good afternoon, John.\nJohn Campbell: For the share gains, I just wanted to start -- Hey, maybe if we could start on the share gains. You guys are obviously using total real estate revenue. I guess there's a basis of comparison versus the industry. I know you guys aren't directly reporting on premier agent. But if we can maybe below the surface isolate that for now. But my question is, what the growth initiatives you have in place. And then obviously the flex pricing changes, would you expect to see a similar rate or maybe even greater degree of outperformance versus the national market just over the balance of the year and maybe even in next.\nJeremy Wacksman: Hey, John. This is Jeremy Wacksman. I think the way we think about it is the share gains that we gave out this quarter are the two most mature markets over that two year period helps show the path for what you should expect to see as we roll out more enhanced markets. As a reminder, those were the ones where we had great year-over-year data and enough time for the cohorts to mature. And then as I said earlier, the nine markets that we're now -- we're seeing connections growth that out -- that grows faster in the industry, which is a great leading indicator for share gains. So that's why we're so confident in getting from nine to what will be 40 by the end of 2024. And as we build the depth with more partners to offer the services to more customers in those markets, you should expect to see similar share gains from the set of customers and partners that we're working within those markets.\nJohn Campbell: Okay. That's helpful. And then one quick follow-up. I'm sure you guys are bracing for this question, but on the CoStar media blitz, if you will, obviously, spinning, I guess we'll find out soon how much this year, but it seems like a lot. I think the burning question with lot of investors is, will you guys respond, will this be something that requires you guys maybe up your brand investment spend, maybe if you could talk to that. I know you guys have called out the 80% organic traffic which is pretty important number but maybe if you could just shed some light on that.\nRich Barton: Okay, John. Yeah, this is Rich. So, I guess I'd start off by saying we're not -- we're not currently seeing any impact from this spend, nor the buildup to the spend. As really Jeremy Hofmann discussed, our numbers are great, our progress versus our growth pillars, it's great. And we really like our go forward growth plan to expand our Super App to more markets of Jeremy Wacksman was just talking about. And all of this culminated, we are giving Jeremy -- Jeremy Hofmann gave his 2024 soft guidance on revenue growth to double digits with this -- with the competitive context in mind. And so that's how we feel things are going to develop. To your specific question or do you think we'll need to change anything. We are a company that believe -- as we think about our marketing mix, we think about it very broadly. We are technologists in our DNA, we are product builders, the customer is our north star. We have always believed that the most important part of the marketing mix is the product itself. This has served us really well historically, it is what has put us in a position we are in today being the traffic leader, the brand leader, the engagement leader and it's put us in a strategic position that is highly differentiated from anybody else in the industry, we are really trying to digitize the whole of the transaction. We're trying to re-platform this whole industry, we're trying to integrate it all into the same Zillow housing Super App, this is difficult stuff, it is highly differentiated and we believe this is what ensures that we win long-term.\nJohn Campbell: Makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the time, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brad Erickson with RBC. Please proceed.\nBradley Erickson: Thanks. I guess just first on real-time touring in the markets where you've had time to see how it plays and appreciate the chart on the presentation. What would you say are kind of like the main friction points and then timeframe that like kind of between an agent getting -- starting to get those new higher quality leads and then choosing to lean in with their spend. And then I have a follow-up.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes, Brad. On real-time touring, it is a mix of eligibility with both the consumer and the agent and the listing, it's like all three things. And so, we're really pleased with how real-time touring has gone and I think you heard earlier, we talked about getting from 10% of connections, currently did 20% by the end of 2024 and that's through a mix of going broader into more markets but also going deeper in those markets with both customers and agents. And then on your specific question on the sort of agent partnering with the buyer, what we tend to find as we talked about this enhanced market strategy is when we start to work with these enhanced partners on the whole basket of services real-time touring, Zillow Home Loans, seller services, increasingly Follow Up Boss, this becomes a much broader conversation around how to help them grow and operate their business better, in service of our customers. And so it is one part of the overall playbook we work with. Of course, it's a really important one, because these are incredibly high value, high intent customers who want to go see a house right now. And so, the feedback on the reception continues to be really positive when they get a chance to work with those buyers. But if you remember, we've talked a lot about how this is a new workflow for those agents as well. And many times they have to build new muscle with their teams, with their team leads, with their individual agents to help service those customers to really provide that delightful experience that we're creating for the customers. So when it works, it's really magical because the consumer gets what they want different from anything else in the industry. But to your point, it really is a new training mechanism which is why we've been so methodical in testing and iterating on it in the markets we've been in.\nBradley Erickson: Got it. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on Follow Up Boss. Can you just give a little more detail there, just kind of on the unlock of the synergies you guys are going after within the PA business. And then just any Integration costs for investment embedded there. Any color on that would be great. Thanks.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes, maybe I'll start on the strategy, and Jeremy, you can hit cost. This the strategy for Follow Up Boss as Jeremy Hofmann said, it's really twofold, right? One, it help make what is already one of the best CRMs in the industry, even better, right, give them oxygen and the ability to accelerate the roadmap of features and services that they have. And then secondly, it's to help introduce Follow Up Boss to more customers. So it's already the most popular CRM with our premier agents. But many of our premier agents don't yet use it and obviously many agents industry-wide don't yet use it, so helping them grow and attract more agent customers is the second part. When we do both of those things that rising tide is going to lift all boats, it's going to lift the Zillow transaction boat. Right. And our agents, working with the Zillow customers are going to be able to perform better, be more responsive, satisfy the customer better and convert more, and you'll see that in conversion increases. So that's really the strategy, maybe I'll turn it over to you for costs. I will only just -- the only thing I'll add on costs is we're really excited to help them accelerate the roadmap. They had great plans in place already and the acquisition just closed in December. So we're still early in our planning.\nJeremy Hofmann: Yes, it's Jeremy Hofmann. I'll reiterate what Jeremy Wacksman just said. It is early, right? So, I highlighted in our prepared remarks, we're having -- we're seeing the first quarter of full cost to Follow Up Boss early and integration. I wouldn't say that there's outside investment at this moment, but definitely, really pleased with the product roadmap they have and the opportunity we have to really help them accelerate from here as we integrate them into our sales motions.\nBradley Erickson: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Please proceed.\nMark Mahaney: Okay, two questions please. This sort of outperformance, I think you said it was about 700 bps of outperformance versus the residential market. I think you first guided the 400 bps, so just explain why you think you've been able to outperform, I know you've been doing it for a while, but maybe you outperformed a little bit more than you had expected in the quarter. Just how should we think about or how do you think about how your level of outperformance versus the market goes into this next year into '24. And then, I want to switch and ask you about costs and get back to this question. If you're going to keep fixed cost, fixed -- this $1.1 billion in variable costs, get leverage against it at that $400 million level. And how long do you think you can sustain that for. You've been talking about it for a couple of quarters. It sounds like you're giving in a little bit on the variable cost, showing a little bit of deleverage first before leverage. But just is that framework is still going to hold for you that you can keep that fixed cost of $1.1 billion and variable at $400 million in getting leveraging instead overtime.\nJeremy Hofmann: Yes. So it's Jeremy Hofmann. Mark, I'll take the second one first. On the cost structure we feel -- continue to feel really good. So the fixed cost base, we expect to get leverage on over time, we feel like we're at the right levels right now. It'll grow with inflation a bit, but generally at the right levels. And that's really with an eye towards our year end 2025 targets on customer share gains. And we feel like we're well-invested on the fixed side. And then on the variable side, you're right, over time we will get leverage of course and listing showcase and rentals in ZHL, we see really exciting growth opportunities and we're staffing up sales ahead of that will take a little bit of time to ramp to get people fully productive. But over time, of course, get leverage there and we're looking for efficiencies across the entire cost base always. So feel really good there and then on the outperformance side, I'd say, Q4 was about as expected. And we're really pleased with the outperformance across all of 2023. We don't over focus on quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, just given how fluid macro has been and will continue to be. But I think 2023 was a great year for us. We accelerated revenue from Q1 to Q4, total company revenue outperformed housing by 1600 basis points. And then we've had six straight quarters of outperformance in residential as well. And we expect more of the same in 2024. I alluded to it in my prepared remarks that we expect to grow double digits in 2024 against the flattish housing market and then to double click further into that, we expect acceleration throughout 2024 with a lot of that acceleration coming from our growth pillars as we get into more markets and go deeper into existing markets. And when I look across our enhanced markets are going to go from 9 to 40 covering 20% of all connections, real-time touring we think is going to go from 10% of overall connections to 20% of all connections. Showcase is really starting to sell broadly in January and we expect that revenue to build throughout the course of the year. And then rentals is executing really, really well. We're expecting to see 30% plus growth again in Q1 and ZHL will grow alongside market expansion and more consumption of mortgage leads. So just across the business, it feels like we're really well set up for 2024 as well.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you, Jeremy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ryan McKeveny with Zelman Associates. Please proceed.\nRyan McKeveny: Hey, thanks a lot. Congrats on the progress. Curious if you can talk about listing showcase. I guess just reception to date, between what our premier agents and let's call it non-premier agents. And I asked because, within the slide deck and kind of the opportunity ahead of getting to 5% to 10% share of listings, it seems to suggest plenty of opportunity both for premier agents and kind of cross selling the listing showcase product. And non-premier agents, so anything you can share with us to date, obviously knowing it's small at this point in time, but yeah, how that's going so far and how you think about that balance and opportunity between kind of cross selling in the PA side of things versus new agents that don't currently partner with Zillow.\nRich Barton: Yes, happy to -- I mean, you're right, it is early in listing showcase having just launched in Q3 and we're just now flipping to national. But in the early signal there is lots of signal. And as I talked about the agent response has been really positive. I think folks are seeing it as a tool to market themselves and win more listings, as well as market to listing. And then of course that provides this benefit to our buyer experience. And that results in the higher engagement with page views saves and shares, we shared some of the data on. We are seeing success with both premier agents and non-premier agents in the markets we've been in and as we've continued to take it to more markets and we expect that to continue. And that gets -- that's what gives us excitement for the intermediate-term target we shared with you all going from what is less than 1% of listings today to 5% to 10% of total active listings at some point here in the future. And we think there's growth and opportunity beyond that. Scaling this business is requires solving a bunch of operational complexity of the team has been hard at work doing as Jeremy Hofmann talked about a required a bunch of media investments. It requires a bunch of partner operations that the team has worked hard to get right. And we're now benefiting from the fruits of a lot of that investment as we take this nationwide. So it is still early, we'll share more as we learn from BMO markets with the largest set of partners. But we're really pleased with the response and the progress and the ability to work with just great agents, whether they are existing premier agents or this is their way into working with for the first time. It's an exciting opportunity for listing showcase and that's something we're seeing.\nRyan McKeveny: Thanks. That's helpful. And then one on ZHL. So the purchase volume growth kind of speaks for itself. But I think it implies market share wise in the purchase origination business close to a doubling in just the last two quarters of loan. So obviously, good progress there. I guess I'm curious on the comments you made about going from 23% to 53% of customers they are also working with PA. Is that a combination of the two kind of connection approach as you've talked about in the past being property first and financing first, is that kind of a mix of both PA coming back to you and you going to PA, and just any commentary on whether it's one of those approaches. Meaningfully driving things or if it's a combination of both, moving in the right direction. Thank you.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes, it's a good question. The short answer to your last question is, it's both. And I think the reason why it's both, it's important to remember sort of why mortgage for the customer and for Zillow, right? And yes, we all know 80% of homes are financed with a mortgage, but it is more importantly that 40% of homebuyers start their journey shopping for a mortgage. And so that's why we talk so much about most consumers either want to go see the house and book a tour ideally with real-time touring or they want to figure out what they can afford which Zillow Home Loans can help them with. Ultimately, they need to go through both those experiences and if which whichever door they start with, they need to use a great agent and they need to get a mortgage to get the house done. And so it really is a contribution of both those things that's driving that 23% to 53%. And that's why we're so excited about the opportunity to grow and deliver that integration to more customers in more of these enhanced markets as we scale this recipe. And that really does speak to the strong customer acquisition cost advantage, we think we have at Zillow. The majority of those customers as Rich talked about are already on Zillow and many of them are already going through one of those doors. And so, helping them understand and get what they need to use more of our services to get the house transaction done, right? That's a great business for us. But ultimately, as Rich said, it's what the consumer wants. It's what they need to be able to buy the house. So that's why we're so excited about mortgage. Yes, you're right, we're seeing over 100% year-over-year growth in purchase mortgage origination volume and we expect growth to continue in 2024 as we continue to scale the business.\nRyan McKeveny: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tom Champion with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\nThomas Champion: Hi, good afternoon. Rentals growth is really strong. And it sounds like multifamily is driving a lot of that. The business has been around for a while. I'm just curious kind of the timing and why now that it's become kind of so large and picked up so much momentum. And just curious if there's any comment on the single room initiatives. I think that was announced recently. Thanks.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes, Tom. I'll take both of those. I mean, I think the why now is just the rental strategy we've had in place for a while is working and it's working for us consumers and partners. We've had -- and we have grown and have the largest audience in the category where we have the most renters coming to Zillow Group Properties. Because we have the most listings, we have the most complete set of listings, which is really the number one problem to solve for renters and we're able to leverage that audience growth and engagement to really drive multifamily growth and start to work with more multifamily partners to bring their inventory online onto our properties, and that's why we see a lot of growth potential ahead of us for rentals. That's what's driven the meaningful growth throughout 2023 and as Jeremy Hofmann said, we expect that to continue into 2024. And then you specifically asked about the room for rent, that's again, so for those who didn't see we launched this week a new listing type, which is folks can post rooms for rent rather than entire places for rent, which is something that is increasingly common and prevalent across a lot of our rental markets and we're really pleased with the early results there, we just turned out on the last couple of weeks, but that again speaks to the strategy of trying to organize them provide the most services and experiences for the renter and all renter personas in segments and then help them figure out which door they need to get through and which subset of inventory they want and that drives then the benefit for our partners for the folks who are trying to find the right renter whether that is a big building or an individual single family home.\nOperator: Our last question today comes from Ron Josey with Citigroup. Please proceed.\nRonald Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick follow-up on the rentals question right there. Just when you think about growth coming going forward is that from the multifamily property growth of 37,000 and growing or the mix of single family multifamily and sort of offering everything to everyone, which given your audience, I'm assuming that's the case, but any insights on those two. And then, I think Jeremy, you talked about the staffing in head count for sales. And you mentioned rentals and listing showcase and Zillow Home Loans, talk to us a little bit more about just the maturity of the current sales force and how you -- where you're investing, I guess across those newer areas like rentals showcase in ZHL. Thank you.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes, maybe I'll start, and you can hit the staffing. I mean the short answer is, it's going to be a mix of both. You're seeing I would say over indexing growth from a revenue contribution standpoint in multifamily right now, but back to the strategy of the most complete set of listings, we do have both multifamily growth and longer tail, smaller inventory growth in terms of our rental manager and suite of products and services that our landlords and property managers use on that side. So we're excited about both segments of supply, driving not just audience growth and engagement but the business over time. But obviously in the near-term, you're seeing a faster acceleration ramp on the multifamily side. In Q4, you saw that over index and I think you saw in Q3 as well and you should expect to see that early into next year as well. And then maybe on the various step ups, I don't know if you want --\nJeremy Hofmann: Yes, I can hit that. I mean, I think it's natural at this point, just given the evidence of traction that we have that we should be accelerating growth, and it's across all three of those. They all are doing quite well, but have a lot of opportunity ahead of them and we want to make sure we are well-positioned from a sales staffing perspective to capture that growth.\nRonald Josey: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your questions. This will conclude our Q&A session. So I would like to pass the conference over to Rich for any further remarks.\nRich Barton: Thanks, Sarah. And thanks everybody for your questions. You've heard today about our tremendous progress that we've made over the past two years on our journey to transform and re-platform this largest of industries. As we look ahead we are pressing down on the accelerator, increasing the breadth and depth of our products and services across more markets as we tap into this $30 billion TAM that's already accessible, already raising their hands for help, already inside our store. We'd like to thank you again for being on this journey with us and we look forward to sharing more progress with you in the months ahead. All right. Have a nice evening.\nOperator: That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation, you may now disconnect your line.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeremy Hofmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremy. And hello, everyone. As you've heard from Rich and Jeremy, we are pleased with how we've executed on our strategy and we are starting to see those efforts show up in our financial results despite the persistently challenging housing macro backdrop. In my comments today, I will cover our Q4 results, our outlook for Q1, some early thoughts on 2024 to help you all understand how we expect the year to play out, as well as the financial philosophy that underpins how we'll manage the business moving forward. I will start with our Q4 2023 results, which exceeded expectations across the board. Revenue growth accelerated in Q4, up 9% year-over-year to $474 million, which was more than $31 million above the midpoint of our outlook range. Revenue outperformance was driven by acceleration across each of our revenue lines for residential, mortgages and rentals. On a GAAP basis, Q4 net loss was $73 million, representing 15% of our revenue. EBITDA was $69 million for the quarter. When excluding the impact of a $14 million one-time expense related to the partial lease termination of our Seattle office space, EBITDA would have been $83 million, resulting in an 18% EBITDA margin and marking a return to positive year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion. The combination of our revenue outperformance and effective cost management delivered the improved year-over-year EBITDA results despite a macro housing environment that remains constraint. Going a quick deeper, the partial lease termination option for our Seattle office space, which we previewed on our last earnings call was exercised in December. As a result, we estimate our 2024 facilities costs will decrease by $8 million and we will release an estimated $37 million in EBITDA expenses in total over the remaining life of the Seattle lease, which more than makes up for this one-time expense impacting our Q4 EBITDA. Returning to more details on the quarter, our Q4 residential revenue of $349 million outperformed our outlook range and revenue growth accelerated to 3% year-over-year. Our residential revenue performance was 700 basis points above the industry decline of 4%, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. We believe our Q4 outperformance was primarily driven by our ongoing investments in our top of funnel and mid funnel experiences that continue to drive improvements in our overall lead volumes. Rentals revenue growth accelerated in Q4 with revenue increasing 37% year-over-year to $93 million, primarily driven by our multifamily revenue, which grew 52% year-over-year in Q4. Our rental strategy is working well and our team is executing on growing the number of multifamily properties on our apps and sites, which reached an all-time high of 37,000 multifamily properties as of year-end. Total listings across our entire rentals marketplace were also up 40% year-over-year to an industry leading 1.7 million listings. Mortgages revenue of $22 million in Q4 returned to positive growth, up 22% year-over-year. With purchased loan origination volume growing 105% year-over-year. We are executing on our mortgage strategy to help more of our customers get financing through Zillow Home Loans. The tools and integration capabilities we have built are creating a bridge between premier agent partners, ZHL loan officers and our buyer customers, which is why we are seeing more than 50% of funded loans across all markets coming from customers working with a premier agent partner. This was a critical puzzle for us to solve before expanding more rapidly in 2024 and we are pleased with the progress to date. EBITDA expenses in Q4 totaled $405 million. Excluding the one-time partial lease termination expense I mentioned earlier, EBITDA expenses would have totaled $391 million, roughly flat sequentially from Q3. And at the low end of our outlook range as a result of our ongoing focus on cost management. Cost of revenue increased $26 million or 29% year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in website development costs as we continue to test and release new products. We ended the year with $2.8 billion in cash and investments, down from $3.3 billion at the end of Q3. This includes the benefit of net cash provided by operating activities, the impact of $88 million in share repurchases during Q4. The impact of $56 million towards convertible debt repurchases below par. And the approximately $400 million closing cash purchase price, a Follow Up Boss. Post repurchases of convertible debt in the quarter, we have $1.6 billion of principal outstanding. Before turning the page to 2024, I want to highlight how pleased I am with our execution throughout the entirety of 2023. We accelerated revenue growth from a decrease of 13% year-over-year in Q1 to an increase of 9% year-over-year in Q4. When combining the revenue growth with a disciplined approach to our cost structure, we feel well-positioned entering this year. Turning to our outlook for Q1, I first want to level set on what we expect for existing homes total transaction value. We estimate total transaction value to be between a decline of 4% to up 1% year-over-year in Q1. With that as a backdrop, we expect total company revenue to be between $495 million to $510 million, implying a year-over-year increase of 7% at the midpoint of our outlook range. We expect residential revenue to be between $365 million to $375 million, up 2% year-over-year at the midpoint of our outlook range. Despite the tough macro existing home sales environment, we expect our residential revenue to outperform the industry in Q1 as our growth pillars begin to contribute to revenue and the investments we have made in our overall funnel continue to deliver benefits. We expect rentals revenue to continue to grow more than 30% year-over-year in Q1 as we benefit from the strength of our execution and favorable industry backdrop, driving landlord demand for advertisers. We expect positive growth in mortgages revenue year-over-year in Q1. We plan to expand integration with our premier agent partners in enhanced markets, send more of our mortgage leads to ZHL directly and drive engagement with more consumers on our apps and sites to grow our origination volumes. For Q1, we expect EBITDA to be between $95 million and $105 million, implying a 20% margin at the midpoint of our outlook range. This implies EBITDA expenses will increase from the $391 million in Q4 that excludes the lease termination expense. The increase is being driven by three primary factors. One, we take on a full quarter of operating costs for Follow Up Boss. Two, there is an annual increase in payroll taxes that occurs every Q1. And three, we are staffing up variable head count for sales, given the growth we expect in 2024 from rentals, listing showcase and Zillow Home Loans. Moving onto 2024 as a whole, we want to provide some color for how we expect the year to play out based on the information we have today. First, we are currently assuming that the housing market is relatively flat in aggregate for the year. With that as a backdrop, we expect to drive double digit revenue growth for the full year, implying accelerated year-over-year revenue growth throughout the year from the high single digits in Q1 that I discussed in our outlook. As we increased the breadth and depth of our products and services throughout the year, we expect our growth pillars will drive the vast majority of the revenue growth across our business in 2024. More specifically, in our residential revenue category, we expect continued market outperformance as we expand touring, make top of funnel improvements, integrate Follow Up Boss into our sales motions and expand the rollout of listing showcase. I will note that we expect the revenue contribution from Follow Up Boss to be a low single digit percentage of our total company revenue in 2024. In rentals, we expect continued strong growth as we increase our multifamily properties and total listings. In mortgages, we expect Zillow Home Loans integration with premier agents and our enhanced market expansion to drive meaningful growth. On the cost side, we believe our fixed investments are at the right level, which should result in our fixed costs growing modestly with inflation and our variable cost growing with or slightly ahead of revenue initially as we ramp up new hires to be fully productive. When combining our expected revenue growth and cost discipline, we expect modest EBITDA margin expansion for the full year. Beyond our revenue and EBITDA expenses, share based compensation expense is an area of focus for us. We expect the absolute dollars of 2024, share based compensation expense to be lower than 2023. And we expect to leverage SBC as a percentage of revenue from the combination of lower absolute dollars in SBC expense and projected revenue growth. Stepping back from our Q4 results, Q1 outlook and 2024 early thoughts, I want to discuss the financial philosophy we have as a company as we execute on our go forward strategy. As you heard from both Rich and Jeremy, Zillow today is a much different business from what it was several years ago. Our revenue base has diversified to the point where a majority of our revenue is now derived from sources other than buyside fees. We have growth pillars, we are executing against and are excited about with a $30 billion For Sale revenue opportunity accessible in our funnel today. As we continue to execute on our growth pillars, while controlling fixed costs and gaining leverage on share based compensation expense, we expect to deliver operating leverage resulting in strong GAAP profitability over time. Beyond our organic investments, we have made several acquisitions to accelerate our growth pillars. For example, we acquired showing time in 2021, which accelerated our launch of real-time touring. Since then, we acquired two real estate media businesses. [BRX] (ph) scenario to scale showing time plus as listing showcase product with both first party and third party photographers. We also acquired Spruce, a tech enabled title and closing business to add to our housing Super App experience over time. And most recently we acquired Follow Up Boss to create a best-in-class CRM for our premier agents and the industry. M&A is not our core strategy. However, we will continue to pursue selective opportunities when we find ways to accelerate our growth pillars. Beyond our day-to-day operating philosophy, we have been active in deploying capital over the past several years, returning $1.7 million to shareholders since the beginning of our stock repurchase program in Q4 2021. And we plan to continue to be opportunistic with the program going forward. Last, we remain focused on retiring our outstanding convertible debt. In 2023, we repurchased a total of $58 million in principal of our 2025 notes. We now have $1.6 billion of convertible senior notes which we may opportunistically redeemed if they become callable. To close, I'll reiterate what you have heard from us before. 2022 was a year where we re-strategize and reorganized around our housing Super App vision. 2023 was a year for us to release new products and test in various markets, setting us up for more depth and more breadth in 2024 and 2025. We are clearly executing on our strategy and look forward to sharing more updates throughout 2024. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. Yes, it's Jeremy Hofmann. I'll reiterate what Jeremy Wacksman just said. It is early, right? So, I highlighted in our prepared remarks, we're having -- we're seeing the first quarter of full cost to Follow Up Boss early and integration. I wouldn't say that there's outside investment at this moment, but definitely, really pleased with the product roadmap they have and the opportunity we have to really help them accelerate from here as we integrate them into our sales motions. Yes. So it's Jeremy Hofmann. Mark, I'll take the second one first. On the cost structure we feel -- continue to feel really good. So the fixed cost base, we expect to get leverage on over time, we feel like we're at the right levels right now. It'll grow with inflation a bit, but generally at the right levels. And that's really with an eye towards our year end 2025 targets on customer share gains. And we feel like we're well-invested on the fixed side. And then on the variable side, you're right, over time we will get leverage of course and listing showcase and rentals in ZHL, we see really exciting growth opportunities and we're staffing up sales ahead of that will take a little bit of time to ramp to get people fully productive. But over time, of course, get leverage there and we're looking for efficiencies across the entire cost base always. So feel really good there and then on the outperformance side, I'd say, Q4 was about as expected. And we're really pleased with the outperformance across all of 2023. We don't over focus on quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, just given how fluid macro has been and will continue to be. But I think 2023 was a great year for us. We accelerated revenue from Q1 to Q4, total company revenue outperformed housing by 1600 basis points. And then we've had six straight quarters of outperformance in residential as well. And we expect more of the same in 2024. I alluded to it in my prepared remarks that we expect to grow double digits in 2024 against the flattish housing market and then to double click further into that, we expect acceleration throughout 2024 with a lot of that acceleration coming from our growth pillars as we get into more markets and go deeper into existing markets. And when I look across our enhanced markets are going to go from 9 to 40 covering 20% of all connections, real-time touring we think is going to go from 10% of overall connections to 20% of all connections. Showcase is really starting to sell broadly in January and we expect that revenue to build throughout the course of the year. And then rentals is executing really, really well. We're expecting to see 30% plus growth again in Q1 and ZHL will grow alongside market expansion and more consumption of mortgage leads. So just across the business, it feels like we're really well set up for 2024 as well. Yes, I can hit that. I mean, I think it's natural at this point, just given the evidence of traction that we have that we should be accelerating growth, and it's across all three of those. They all are doing quite well, but have a lot of opportunity ahead of them and we want to make sure we are well-positioned from a sales staffing perspective to capture that growth."

            "name": "Rich Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Siarah. And thanks, Brad. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for dialing-in for our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. We are posting great revenue numbers across the whole of our increasingly diversified and growing businesses. Our early cohort of enhanced markets are working. So we are pressing the accelerator on expansion in 2024. I'm also pleased to share that we released an updated investor presentation available on our Investor Relations website to bring them all up to speed on the progress we've made on our growth pillars. We'll kick off the discussion today by walking you through our quarterly results, briefly addressing what's happening in the broader real estate industry, highlighting the opportunity in front of Zillow and then take you through the exciting progress we're making on our journey to innovate and transform the way people buy, sell, finance and rent homes. Starting with our quarterly results, we reported better than expected and accelerated revenue growth with Q4 total revenue of $474 million, up 9% year-over-year. Residential revenue of $349 million increased 3% year-over-year, returning to positive year-over-year growth. During the same timeframe, the broader real estate industry declined by 4%, meaning Zillow's residential revenue outperformed the industry by 700 basis points. As I said, Q4 now marks the sixth consecutive quarter of meaningful outperformance versus the industry. Our ongoing efforts to improve our customer funnel, capture more demand, connect more of that demand to our partner network and focus on conversion, continue to drive impressive results. Rentals also had a strong quarter with accelerating revenue growth, up 37% year-over-year to $93 million. This performance was driven by Accelerating Multifamily Property growth with over 37,000 properties listed across Zillow at the end of Q4 2023. We continue to be the number one most visited rentals platform with average monthly rentals, unique users up double digits year-over-year in Q4. We are well-positioned for future rentals revenue growth which Jeremy Wacksman will discuss in more detail later in the call. We're also making excellent progress in our mortgages push, growing our purchase mortgage origination volume by more than 100% year-over-year in Q4 and further integrating Zillow Home Loans with our Premier Agent partners. Before we dive deeper into all the progress we've made over the last two years. I'd like to give our view of the latest real estate industry goings on. We're monitoring the progress of numerous lawsuits facing several organizations within the industry. Zillow is not a named party in these suits. And we are confident in our ability to meaningfully grow our company in this evolving climate. In November, we laid out our marketplace principles that underlie Zillow's position. We continue to advocate for what we believe is best for consumers and the industry as a whole. First, we believe in our real estate marketplace that is transparent and fair in which consumers and agents have easy and equitable access to listings and information. Second, we believe buyers and sellers deserve independent representation. And finally, we believe consumers should be well-informed on agent compensation and their rights to negotiate. Recently we elaborated on these views on a new webpage advocacy.zillowgroup.com that outlines consumers real estate rights and how we are working to elevate industry standards on their behalf. This includes efforts to allow better integrated search experiences that can include all listing types in one view, be there for sale by agent, for sale by owner, new construction or for rent, as well as to educate consumers on the potential pitfalls of double citing with dual agency among others. We recently supported legislation in our home state of Washington that requires buyer's agent agreements so that consumers are aware of the services, they are buying and who pays. In New York, our Street Easy and Zillow teams are working with lawmakers and advocates to create much needed transparency for consumers, ensure agents are fairly compensated and open the door for more access and affordability in New York's rental market. Those are just a few examples, but the key takeaway is that we have found a louder and crisper voice championing what's good for mover consumers, agents and the industry as a whole given legacy practices are being actively debated and negotiated right now. Settlements and court ordered equitable relief may provide some near-term direction for the industry and some industry practices will likely be improved. For example, it could become more common to use buyer agent agreements to make fees more transparent and negotiable. But ultimately, we continue to expect industry change to play out over many years. Regardless of the industry debates, Zillow is well-positioned for all weather due to our long history and future of technology innovation driving differentiated products and services which has resulted in a large engaged audience a beloved brand and a growing diversified business. We believe all roads lead to Zillow. Zooming out from our quarterly results and the latest state of play in the real estate industry, two years ago, we introduced our new growth strategy and broke down the massive TAM opportunity for Zillow. This quarter, we released a refined and better way to size that opportunity, resulting in a $30 billion accessible TAM of customers already in our funnel and raising their hands to connect. I'll do the math to arrive at this number in a moment and then pass it over to Jeremy Wacksman to talk you through the progress we've made over the last two years. The proof points, the signal, why we are confident in pressing the accelerator on expansion. We are pleased with what we've accomplished since laying out our growth pillars in early 2022. We see this strategy as a continuation of what we've been working on since we founded the company in 2006 with the charge of turning on the lights in real estate. Over the years, we've built engaging and practical products and services designed to empower consumers with data and information, transforming a previously opaque marketplace into the more transparent one we experienced today. But turning on the lights only got Zillow and our large audience so far, to effect real change for consumers and open up a much larger opportunity we needed to focus on digital transformation of the moving experience end-to-end and begin our work on the transaction itself. Every one of those move knows that the process is complicated, time consuming and expensive. The onus is primarily on the consumer to play the role of project managers/systems integrator to research, shop, select, finance, appraise and close, bringing all these disparate pieces together. It's a labyrinth and it's clear that consumers want and need better. And they'll eventually get it, they always do. So, we set out to build the housing Super App and integrated digital experience wherein all the disparate pieces of the [indiscernible] moving process are brought together on one platform, Zillow. Rooted in our original commitment to turn on the lights, Zillow's housing Super App empowers consumers by delivering real estate data and education, a suite of Zillow owned solutions and a network of best-in-class partners at their fingertips. Well, the housing Super App is here today, it's called the Zillow. Zillow is now the container into which we will continually place new features and services that work together seamlessly to solve real customer and partner pain points in their moves. We have tested and iterated the experience over the last two years updating you all along the way. Our growth pillars, which Jeremy Wacksman will talk more about in a moment, serve as a roadmap for the continual upgrades and improvements we are adding to the Zillow experience as we expand our breadth and depth of coverage across more markets. Our opportunity is to take our current small slice of a large total addressable market and grow it into a much bigger piece of the pie. U.S. For Sale Housing represents $2 trillion in total transaction value or TTV. Of that $2 trillion of TTV, there were approximately $162 billion of service fees in 2023 across buy and sell side agent referral fees, mortgage fees and closing fees. Based on survey data, we estimate that 70% of all consumers who transact, visit and use Zillow, resulting in a $113 billion Zillow Visitor TAM. Cutting that down to just shoppers who raised their hands on Zillow, meaning, they proactively request to connect with one or more of our services. We estimate first, a $16 billion opportunity made up of brokerage referral, mortgage, closing and other homebuyer related transaction fees associated with those higher intent buyers. This is low hanging fruit buy side TAM, not just people visiting our site, but actual buyers actively engaged in seeking to do business with us. Additionally, on the sell side we have good line of sight on an estimated $14 billion of sell side TAM derived from our increasing opportunity to capture more sell side referral fees and listing marketing budgets from those agents already actively engaged in our funnel. This adds up to a current accessible $30 billion For Sale revenue opportunity with high intent, hand raising consumers already in Zillow's funnel. Today, we captured $1.5 billion of that $30 billion accessible TAM. That $1.5 billion is our reported 2023 Residential and Mortgages Revenue. Measured as a fraction of TTV we stood at a mere 7 basis points in 2023. Oh, my, so much Blue Ocean. Our position as one of the largest Internet brands in the United States alongside iconic brands such as Facebook, Spotify and Netflix gives us confidence that we have many years of growth into that $30 billion of revenue TAM accessible in our funnel today. Over the last 15 plus years, we've released a constant stream of novel engaging and practical product innovations. We just have great brands are created. Zillow Brand has over 60% unaided brand awareness amongst shoppers which is rare for a brand to achieve in any category. Okay, that is of course internal survey data, but you can see a good impartial proxy for this strength in our Google search activity where Zillow was searched more on Google than the category term \"real estate\". And three times more than our nearest competitors brand. Further evidence of our brand strength is seen in our traffic composition. About 80% of Zilliow's traffic is organic. As well as in our app usage, which is more than three times our nearest competitor. We pioneered mobile real estate shopping with our leading iPhone and Android apps. And when Apple first launch the iPad, the Zillow app was highlighted by Steve Jobs on stage at the launch event. Taking things full circle, this month we partnered with Apple once again for the launch of Zillow Immerse on the new Apple Vision Pro to offer mover consumers and interactive and immersive way to explore listing showcase listings with special technology. Try it. It's early, but it's an extraordinary home touring experience. We have been and will continue to be the company that is on the leading edge of utilizing technology to create magic new consumer and agent experiences. So I've laid out a more refined view of the opportunities as we see it, quite large, quite complex, quite accessible for us. We monetize very little of it today, yet it's in our store. I've also outlined the reasons to believe that Zillow can and will tap this $30 billion accessible TAM. One, we have the leading audience brand and engagement. Two, we have proven technology and product talent that is unrivaled in the real estate industry. Three, we have built an extensive talented and increasingly integrated partner network. And four, we have a strong balance sheet that gives us the flexibility to pursue current and future growth opportunities. For these reasons, we are uniquely well-positioned to transform and re-platform the largest industry in the country. We spent the last two years building the integrated transaction experience and testing it in enhanced markets. Now it's time to press down on the accelerator to increase our breadth of coverage across more markets and our depth of penetration in those markets. We made a great deal of progress in 2023, we will make more in 2024. Okay. I've talked about our opportunity and our vision for the future of real estate. Now, I will pass the microphone over to our COO, Jeremy Wacksman to give you a more detailed progress report and where we are headed. Good afternoon, John. Okay, John. Yeah, this is Rich. So, I guess I'd start off by saying we're not -- we're not currently seeing any impact from this spend, nor the buildup to the spend. As really Jeremy Hofmann discussed, our numbers are great, our progress versus our growth pillars, it's great. And we really like our go forward growth plan to expand our Super App to more markets of Jeremy Wacksman was just talking about. And all of this culminated, we are giving Jeremy -- Jeremy Hofmann gave his 2024 soft guidance on revenue growth to double digits with this -- with the competitive context in mind. And so that's how we feel things are going to develop. To your specific question or do you think we'll need to change anything. We are a company that believe -- as we think about our marketing mix, we think about it very broadly. We are technologists in our DNA, we are product builders, the customer is our north star. We have always believed that the most important part of the marketing mix is the product itself. This has served us really well historically, it is what has put us in a position we are in today being the traffic leader, the brand leader, the engagement leader and it's put us in a strategic position that is highly differentiated from anybody else in the industry, we are really trying to digitize the whole of the transaction. We're trying to re-platform this whole industry, we're trying to integrate it all into the same Zillow housing Super App, this is difficult stuff, it is highly differentiated and we believe this is what ensures that we win long-term. Yes, happy to -- I mean, you're right, it is early in listing showcase having just launched in Q3 and we're just now flipping to national. But in the early signal there is lots of signal. And as I talked about the agent response has been really positive. I think folks are seeing it as a tool to market themselves and win more listings, as well as market to listing. And then of course that provides this benefit to our buyer experience. And that results in the higher engagement with page views saves and shares, we shared some of the data on. We are seeing success with both premier agents and non-premier agents in the markets we've been in and as we've continued to take it to more markets and we expect that to continue. And that gets -- that's what gives us excitement for the intermediate-term target we shared with you all going from what is less than 1% of listings today to 5% to 10% of total active listings at some point here in the future. And we think there's growth and opportunity beyond that. Scaling this business is requires solving a bunch of operational complexity of the team has been hard at work doing as Jeremy Hofmann talked about a required a bunch of media investments. It requires a bunch of partner operations that the team has worked hard to get right. And we're now benefiting from the fruits of a lot of that investment as we take this nationwide. So it is still early, we'll share more as we learn from BMO markets with the largest set of partners. But we're really pleased with the response and the progress and the ability to work with just great agents, whether they are existing premier agents or this is their way into working with for the first time. It's an exciting opportunity for listing showcase and that's something we're seeing. Thanks, Sarah. And thanks everybody for your questions. You've heard today about our tremendous progress that we've made over the past two years on our journey to transform and re-platform this largest of industries. As we look ahead we are pressing down on the accelerator, increasing the breadth and depth of our products and services across more markets as we tap into this $30 billion TAM that's already accessible, already raising their hands for help, already inside our store. We'd like to thank you again for being on this journey with us and we look forward to sharing more progress with you in the months ahead. All right. Have a nice evening."

            "name": "Jeremy Wacksman",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich. And good afternoon, everyone. As Rich said, Zillow's housing Super App is the container into which we are continually adding upgrades and improvements, guided by five for sale growth pillars, touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services. Our For Sale growth pillars mark the pathway to meeting our goals to grow customer transaction share from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025 and grow our revenue alongside that transaction share growth. You'll note that we've also added rentals as an additional growth pillar this quarter. We're excited about the opportunities here as our rentals marketplace continues to accelerate and accounted for nearly 20% of Zillow's total revenue in 2023. I'll kick off our growth pillar update with touring. The investments we're making here continue to drive our industry outperformance. When a customer raises her hand to look at a home she has been coveting on Zillow, it's a strong signal of serious intend to transact. As we work to convert more visitors on our site into transactors, the home tour remains a critical focus area for us. Touring has historically been painful for both movers and agents. So we've invested in making the process more seamless than it's ever been. Our real-time touring product powered by showing time is meaningfully improving our ability to connect high intent customers to our premier agent partners. We ended Q4 with our real-time touring product delivering approximately 10% of our total connections. We expect to expand our breadth of coverage by launching additional markets and increase our depth by growing real-time touring to account for approximately 20% of connections by the end of 2024. This is driving a better customer and agent experience with less friction. As we see increased successful connections and more customers working with agents. Equally as important as touring is financing. And as a reminder, approximately 40% of all homebuyers start their journey shopping for a mortgage and 80% of those buyers don't yet have an agents. Knowing that almost all of these mortgage seekers use Zillow positions us well to build a substantial direct to consumer purchase mortgage business that is seamlessly integrated with our extensive premier agent partner network. By integrating Zillow Home Loans with our premier agent partner network, we are creating a better customer experience from the start of the homebuying journey on Zillow to when a customer moves into that brand new home. And it's clear that customers and partners are increasingly enjoying this integrated housing Super App experience. Most notably our efforts are driving purchase mortgage growth. In our original four enhanced markets, we saw our customer adoption rates climb from 6% to 15% over the course of 2023. Since Q1 2023, the percentage of purchase mortgages in which a customer works with a premier agent partner increased from 23% to 53%. All of this success translates to $487 million in purchase loan origination volume this quarter, a more than 100% year-over-year increase despite a very challenging mortgage rate environment. We expect continued mortgage growth as we follow our roadmap 2025. Expanding integration with premier agent partners, rolling out more enhanced markets and converting more high intent customers on Zillow. I'll now move on to seller services honing in on listing showcase. Listing showcase elevates agents brand presence on Zillow and helps them win more listings. Our AI powered listing showcase also improved the shopper experience through listings that are powered by our homegrown rich media and floor plan technology. This is a unique differentiator in the marketplace and a significant benefit to buyer engagement and experience. We are in the early days of this product having launched in Q3, but it is clear already there is significant demand from listing agents and significant engagement with consumers. Listing showcase listings received 68% more page views, 66% more saves, 63% more shares. We are actively rolling out listing showcase nationwide with the intermediate term goal of 5% to 10% listing coverage, which represents a $150 million to $300 million annual revenue opportunity. And we believe there is potential future growth beyond that. Moving onto our next growth pillar update, enhancing our partner network. Our mandate here is simple, help the best agents provide better service to more of our shared customers to grow their businesses and our business. And we are doing this in a few ways. First, we're expanding our enhanced market partners. Increasing our depth of coverage in existing markets and our breadth by growing our enhanced market footprint from nine at the end of 2023 to a projected 40 markets by the end of 2024. Second, we're working to deliver the integrated experience between ZHL and premier agent. As a result, one in two premier agent partners in our enhanced markets are now introducing their customers to Zillow Home Loans, and that's up from one in five at the end of 2022. Lastly, we are excited to accelerate improvements to Follow Up Boss and make it available to more agents to increase conversion. With the power of Follow Up Boss, our premier agent partners will be better equipped than ever to deliver the best possible customer experience, whilst supercharging their businesses. We think these efforts across the board will drive transaction conversion to help close the gap on the vast majority of Zillow Connections that transact elsewhere and better tap the $30 billion accessible revenue TAM that Rich walked you through. Moving onto our last For Sale growth pillar update, integrating our services. Doing this requires us to pull together consumer, agent and loan officer technology in one place, Zillow, to create an end-to-end experience that carries the customer through the entire transaction process with more transparency and ease. It's no small feat, but it's what consumers want and we're in the best-positioned to deliver to them. As evidenced by our performance in our earliest two enhanced markets, Phoenix and Atlanta, our integrated strategy is working to drive customer transaction share gains. Since the beginning of 2022, our customer transaction share has grown more than 80%. Additionally, across our entire set of nine enhanced markets, we are seeing consistent outperformance in connections growth versus the industry. This gives us great confidence to further expand our enhanced markets footprint more rapidly in 2024. As we expand to a projected 40 enhanced markets by the end of 2024, our integration within those markets is going to cover 20% of total Zillow connections by the end of the year. We land in each market with a subset of partner and customer coverage and work to expand our product offerings across the market over time. We are seeing share gains that will move the needle as we roll out more enhanced markets throughout the year into 2025. I'll wrap up with a progress update on rentals. Rentals is a fast growing business with a big opportunity in front of it. Nearly every homebuyer starts out as a renter and providing our customers with optionality is as important as ever in a challenging housing market. Today, we have the largest audience of rentals and the most listings in the market with limited marketing spend to date. We're now leveraging our position as traffic leader to grow our multifamily properties, which has accelerated our multifamily revenue growth year-on year from 14% in Q4 2022 to 52% in Q4 2023. As we look to serve more of this market and grow revenue, we plan to expand the number of multifamily properties and deliver a superior experience for our rentals partners. Before handing it over to Jeremy Hofmann, I do want to highlight that while we've been building these past few years, we've meaningfully outperformed a challenged housing market. For full year 2023, Zillow reported over $1.9 billion in revenue, outperforming the real estate industry by 1,600 basis points. I'm grateful to our teams who have been working hard to bring Zillow's housing Super App to life over the last two years, solving real customer pain points with exceptional tech solutions and partners. We are looking forward to continued growth in the years ahead. With that, I will now pass the line over to Jeremy. Hey, John. This is Jeremy Wacksman. I think the way we think about it is the share gains that we gave out this quarter are the two most mature markets over that two year period helps show the path for what you should expect to see as we roll out more enhanced markets. As a reminder, those were the ones where we had great year-over-year data and enough time for the cohorts to mature. And then as I said earlier, the nine markets that we're now -- we're seeing connections growth that out -- that grows faster in the industry, which is a great leading indicator for share gains. So that's why we're so confident in getting from nine to what will be 40 by the end of 2024. And as we build the depth with more partners to offer the services to more customers in those markets, you should expect to see similar share gains from the set of customers and partners that we're working within those markets. Yes, Brad. On real-time touring, it is a mix of eligibility with both the consumer and the agent and the listing, it's like all three things. And so, we're really pleased with how real-time touring has gone and I think you heard earlier, we talked about getting from 10% of connections, currently did 20% by the end of 2024 and that's through a mix of going broader into more markets but also going deeper in those markets with both customers and agents. And then on your specific question on the sort of agent partnering with the buyer, what we tend to find as we talked about this enhanced market strategy is when we start to work with these enhanced partners on the whole basket of services real-time touring, Zillow Home Loans, seller services, increasingly Follow Up Boss, this becomes a much broader conversation around how to help them grow and operate their business better, in service of our customers. And so it is one part of the overall playbook we work with. Of course, it's a really important one, because these are incredibly high value, high intent customers who want to go see a house right now. And so, the feedback on the reception continues to be really positive when they get a chance to work with those buyers. But if you remember, we've talked a lot about how this is a new workflow for those agents as well. And many times they have to build new muscle with their teams, with their team leads, with their individual agents to help service those customers to really provide that delightful experience that we're creating for the customers. So when it works, it's really magical because the consumer gets what they want different from anything else in the industry. But to your point, it really is a new training mechanism which is why we've been so methodical in testing and iterating on it in the markets we've been in. Yes, maybe I'll start on the strategy, and Jeremy, you can hit cost. This the strategy for Follow Up Boss as Jeremy Hofmann said, it's really twofold, right? One, it help make what is already one of the best CRMs in the industry, even better, right, give them oxygen and the ability to accelerate the roadmap of features and services that they have. And then secondly, it's to help introduce Follow Up Boss to more customers. So it's already the most popular CRM with our premier agents. But many of our premier agents don't yet use it and obviously many agents industry-wide don't yet use it, so helping them grow and attract more agent customers is the second part. When we do both of those things that rising tide is going to lift all boats, it's going to lift the Zillow transaction boat. Right. And our agents, working with the Zillow customers are going to be able to perform better, be more responsive, satisfy the customer better and convert more, and you'll see that in conversion increases. So that's really the strategy, maybe I'll turn it over to you for costs. I will only just -- the only thing I'll add on costs is we're really excited to help them accelerate the roadmap. They had great plans in place already and the acquisition just closed in December. So we're still early in our planning. Yes, it's a good question. The short answer to your last question is, it's both. And I think the reason why it's both, it's important to remember sort of why mortgage for the customer and for Zillow, right? And yes, we all know 80% of homes are financed with a mortgage, but it is more importantly that 40% of homebuyers start their journey shopping for a mortgage. And so that's why we talk so much about most consumers either want to go see the house and book a tour ideally with real-time touring or they want to figure out what they can afford which Zillow Home Loans can help them with. Ultimately, they need to go through both those experiences and if which whichever door they start with, they need to use a great agent and they need to get a mortgage to get the house done. And so it really is a contribution of both those things that's driving that 23% to 53%. And that's why we're so excited about the opportunity to grow and deliver that integration to more customers in more of these enhanced markets as we scale this recipe. And that really does speak to the strong customer acquisition cost advantage, we think we have at Zillow. The majority of those customers as Rich talked about are already on Zillow and many of them are already going through one of those doors. And so, helping them understand and get what they need to use more of our services to get the house transaction done, right? That's a great business for us. But ultimately, as Rich said, it's what the consumer wants. It's what they need to be able to buy the house. So that's why we're so excited about mortgage. Yes, you're right, we're seeing over 100% year-over-year growth in purchase mortgage origination volume and we expect growth to continue in 2024 as we continue to scale the business. Yes, Tom. I'll take both of those. I mean, I think the why now is just the rental strategy we've had in place for a while is working and it's working for us consumers and partners. We've had -- and we have grown and have the largest audience in the category where we have the most renters coming to Zillow Group Properties. Because we have the most listings, we have the most complete set of listings, which is really the number one problem to solve for renters and we're able to leverage that audience growth and engagement to really drive multifamily growth and start to work with more multifamily partners to bring their inventory online onto our properties, and that's why we see a lot of growth potential ahead of us for rentals. That's what's driven the meaningful growth throughout 2023 and as Jeremy Hofmann said, we expect that to continue into 2024. And then you specifically asked about the room for rent, that's again, so for those who didn't see we launched this week a new listing type, which is folks can post rooms for rent rather than entire places for rent, which is something that is increasingly common and prevalent across a lot of our rental markets and we're really pleased with the early results there, we just turned out on the last couple of weeks, but that again speaks to the strategy of trying to organize them provide the most services and experiences for the renter and all renter personas in segments and then help them figure out which door they need to get through and which subset of inventory they want and that drives then the benefit for our partners for the folks who are trying to find the right renter whether that is a big building or an individual single family home. Yes, maybe I'll start, and you can hit the staffing. I mean the short answer is, it's going to be a mix of both. You're seeing I would say over indexing growth from a revenue contribution standpoint in multifamily right now, but back to the strategy of the most complete set of listings, we do have both multifamily growth and longer tail, smaller inventory growth in terms of our rental manager and suite of products and services that our landlords and property managers use on that side. So we're excited about both segments of supply, driving not just audience growth and engagement but the business over time. But obviously in the near-term, you're seeing a faster acceleration ramp on the multifamily side. In Q4, you saw that over index and I think you saw in Q3 as well and you should expect to see that early into next year as well. And then maybe on the various step ups, I don't know if you want --"

We appreciate you dialing in today to hear our third quarter 2023 results. I'm looking forward to sharing the progress we've made on our growth strategy as we yet again, meaningfully outperformed the industry by making steady executional progress, converting traffic into transactions.  Before I get to our results, and an update on our five growth pillars, it's important that I address the high level of media attention and speculation surrounding several ongoing industry lawsuits, and what the implications may be for the broader residential real estate industry and for Zillow in particular. The short version is, we strongly believe Zillow is well positioned to thrive regardless of how it all plays out.  I'll explain our logic. But first, let me be clear on the marketplace principles that underlie Zillow\u2019s stance. With respect to free, fair and transparent access to real estate information, we are strong supporters. With respect to the importance of independent representation, we are strong supporters. And finally, with respect to transparent and negotiable agent commissions, we are strong supporters. From where we stand it seems clear that these principles are in the best interest of mover consumers, agents, and the industry as a whole.  Consumers and agents should have access to all listings and consumers should be empowered with information about listings and how agent commissions get paid. We believe this is the best way forward.  Now regarding litigation news, we expect the Sitzer/Burnett lawsuit that made headlines yesterday, in which a jury ruled in favor of plaintiffs and awarded approximately $1.8 billion in damages will likely be tied up in court for years. Defendants in that case such as the National Association of Realtors, and certain real estate franchisors have already indicated that they intend to pursue an appeals process, unless there's some negotiated settlement. As a reminder to you all, Zillow is not a party to this lawsuit nor other similar ones.  Aside from how long this particular case may take to fully play out, we expect industry changes resulting from this lawsuit, or ones like it will involve commission transparency, and negotiability provisions similar to those seen in several of the settlements plaintiffs entered into with other real estate franchisors in advance of the trial. These industry changes would tend to look like good initial steps add more transparency and education for consumers.  In forward leaning markets that have been exploring changes that result in increased transparency and negotiability we believe our business thrives. We also believe complete disruption to the existence of buyer's agents is improbable for a few reasons. Why? Because buyer's agents represent the buyer's interest throughout this complex and often intimidating process of purchasing a home, the biggest purchase most people make in their lifetime, for which most people take on huge debt, and which has ended up being for most homeowners their largest financial asset.  Similar to other infrequent high complexity, high stakes transactions, independent representation in real estate is important. As an analogy, investment bankers don't represent both the buyer and the seller in an M&A deal because it makes no logical sense that one advisor could effectively represent the best interests of both parties. In fact, dual agency where the same individual listing agent represents both parties or double citing is harmful enough in the real estate transaction that it's already been banned or substantially restricted in eight states in the U.S. Buyers deserve and most need their own independent counsel. And for most buyers, this means a dedicated agent.  There is always a DIY or do it yourself segment of any industry. And we fully support DIY inside of Zillow today, while knowing via research and experienced that for most movers, the stakes are too high for DIY.  So I'll remind you that Zillow was founded on the first principle of free and fair access to real estate information and listings, we have not wavered. We continue to adhere to this principle and assert our position by advocating and lobbying in favor of more transparency in real estate. The benefits and durability of independent buyer representation, and the importance of transparent and negotiable commissions. We believe change in the industry has been and will be slow, but will continually bend towards these principles.  However, indulging for a moment a future scenario where buyer's agency does go away, we have high confidence that Zillow will remain in a strong position, potentially even stronger. Why? Because then the U.S market would likely transition to a market structure that we observe in several international geographies where a very large portal or 2, offer a pay to play paid inclusion, digital listings marketplace, sort of a digital classified advertising analogy.  In this scenario, Zillow would be an odds on favorite to become the leading digital listings marketplace given our brand, traffic, engagement, and our unique focus on solving movers\u2019 real pain points with our software anchored housing super app vision. If international classifieds markets are any guide, it is also possible that this leads to a larger and more profitable business model for Zillow. Are we advocating for this to happen? No, because we believe pay to play marketplace is a step backwards for consumers and the industry as a whole. And we very much like our position and growth plan in a market structure that continually evolves towards our principles of access, independence, and transparency.  Let me wrap this section up by reiterating that we have always focused first on delighting the masses with software products that attract users with modest marketing spend. Those who know us well know that over the years, we have exhibited an unusually high degree of business model creativity and innovation, as we have figured out how to monetize our incredible user engagement in ways that are a win win win, a win for consumers, a win for our partners, and a win for Zillow.  This experimentation and innovation has resulted in a revenue roll up today that features a wide variety of lines of business and monetization models to the point where revenue derived from buyer agent activity represented less than 50% of our total revenue in Q3. Today, we are focused on delivering the housing Super App, a tech enabled end to end platform with products and services that make it easier for people to move. Zillow, the trusted brand and marketplace will be here to help buyers, sellers, renters and the industry transact in real estate, regardless of how the dollars flow.  Now that we've covered what's happening in the industry, I'm excited to share our results with you. You've heard me say many times that 2023 is crucial for Zillow, it's a year of execution as we prepare to scale in 2024 and 2025. We're very pleased with what we've accomplished today.  We again delivered strong relative outperformance compared to total industry transaction dollar volumes. We reported better than expected and continued positive revenue growth of $496 million in Q3, up 3% year-over-year. Residential revenue of $362 million declined by only 3% year-over-year while the broader market declined by 14%, meaning Zillow outperformed the industry by 1100 basis points.  This quarter now marks the fourth straight quarter of meaningful outperformance versus the industry. Our ongoing efforts to improve our customer funnel, capture more demand and connect more of that demand to our partner network continue to pay dividends for our performance.  A contributor to our outperformance was a great quarter in our Rentals marketplace. Driven by increased traffic and listing growth in both multi and single family we reported $99 million in revenue in Rentals this quarter, up 34% year-over-year. We remain the number one most visited Rentals platform according to comScore with average monthly Rental unique visitors of double digits\u2019 year-over-year in Q3. We believe this positions us well for future revenue growth. We're also making excellent progress in mortgages, growing our purchase mortgage originations business by 88% year-over-year, even as mortgage rates hit 20 year highs.  Our core business continues to demonstrate healthy top of funnel demand driven by our powerful brand, with $224 million average monthly unique users in the third quarter, our overall leading traffic is double that of our next competitor. And a nod to our broad awareness and trust.  More than 80% of our users come to us organically, directly and for free. And less than 5% of our users come from paid SEM and digital acquisition. Our great product respected brand, and large audience are a meaningful strategic advantage for Zillow. This is the foundation upon which we invest in and build out our growth pillars, all of which are focused on increasing conversion by simplifying, digitizing and integrating the complex, scary and expensive real estate transaction, real customer problems that we're solving with great software and great partners.  Before we get to our road map update, I'm excited to speak about our just signed agreement to acquire Follow Up Boss, an industry leading CRM, customer relationship management system that gives top performing real estate professionals a central hub to organize and engage customers, close deals and build their teams. We're investing in great tech solutions that make it easier for people to move and Follow Up Boss does just that. They have bootstrapped an industry leading CRM platform from the ground up. It's a great product, one that is beloved by agents and teams across the industry, and currently used by many Zillow premier agent partners and showing time plus clients.  We are excited to be able to use Zillow\u2019s resources to help Follow Up Boss grow even faster and to invest in a more integrated software experience for agents and teams across the industry, enabling them to boost productivity and grow their own businesses. Jeremy will speak in more detail about this proposed acquisition shortly.  Zillow\u2019s housing Super App vision is to create a single digital experience to help customers across their real estate needs including buying, selling, financing, and renting, serving as one ecosystem of connected solutions for all the tasks and services related to moving.  We're bringing this vision to life through investments across five growth pillars, touring, financing, seller solutions, integrating our services and enhancing our partner network. These five growth pillars mark the pathway to meeting our goals for increased transaction share and revenue per customer transaction.  This past year we've been focused on launching learning and refining products and services within our growth pillars. As we scale and grow over the coming years. We are making progress as demonstrated by our accelerated product rollouts this quarter. Our efforts are improving our mid funnel conversion. And with that our connection volumes across the business as we focus on driving real value through customer transactions.  We've been encouraged by what we're learning in the geographies where we enroll that are most full featured in integrated housing super app experience, our enhanced markets. Since we last spoke, we launched five more enhanced markets bringing us to a total of nine. As each month passes, we are increasingly confident in the results we are seeing in our enhanced markets and are encouraged by continued strong connections growth and customer transaction share gains. We anticipate launching additional enhanced markets at an accelerated pace in the months ahead and throughout 2024.  Additionally, the investments we're making to improve touring, a key growth pillar will continue to fuel momentum. A home tour is the moment that a dreamed about home as viewed on our Zillow app, becomes a reality for the first time. Raising one's digital hand to take a physical tour is a strong indicator of seriousness and those shoppers who requested to or convert to buyers at three times the rate of other actions on Zillow. Getting ready to buy starts with getting in the door physically.  Powered by showing time. A real time touring product lets a home shopper schedule and confirm a home tour in real time as opposed to simply requesting it. Along with other improvements we've made throughout the conversion funnel, real time touring is meaningfully improving our ability to connect higher intent customers through our premiere agent partners. Wherever real time touring is enabled, we continue to see significant outperformance of our overall connections growth versus the industry.  As a result, we've accelerated the rollout of real time touring independent of our enhanced markets. We are currently live in 57 markets and expect to be in an additional 33 covering approximately 10% of our total connections by the end of 2023. Exciting progress. Another pain point in the customers moving journey is securing financing. The second of our growth pillars. As I've said before, nearly 80% of homes purchased are financed with a mortgage. Approximately 40% of all homebuyers start their journey shopping for a mortgage before deciding on an agent to work with. Knowing that almost all of these mortgage seekers use Zillow sets us up very nicely to build a substantial first party direct to consumer purchase mortgage origination business seamlessly integrated with our extensive premier agent partner network.  We began to show real traction over the last few quarters. That growth continued in Q3 and despite a historically horrendous mortgage origination market, Zillow Home Loans reported an 88% year-over-year increase in purchase loan origination volume. Traditionally, Zillow customers went to our mortgage marketplace to shop for rates. Increasingly, those customers are being offered Zillow Home Loans directly. Those customers along with our work to integrate premier agents with Zillow Home Loans in our enhanced markets are driving the growth of Zillow Home Loans purchase mortgages. We are not yet at scale, but we are making excellent progress with $452 million in purchase loan originations during Q3, even as mortgage rates hit 20 year highs.  I'll now move on to the final growth pillar and our road map update, Seller Solutions. As you know, we are investing here to provide sellers and listing agents with tech enabled products and services that make selling homes easier, a big TAM that we have targeted and been innovating against for quite some time.  Last quarter, we launched Listing Showcase under our ShowingTime+ broad real estate industry software brands. Listing Showcase listings feature rich media like scrolling hero images, room by room photo organization and interactive floor plans giving buyers a deep understanding of the home before they ever stepped inside.  We're providing agents industry wide the tools to highlight a home's best features while also providing them an opportunity to elevate their brand presence on Zillow, which should lead to future business. The response has been quite positive so far. As of today, we are in 17 markets with plans to expand throughout Q4 and beyond.  Additionally, with respect to opening up sell side TAM with Seller Solutions, we've expanded our partnership with our iBuying leader Opendoor to 45 markets as of last week. In these markets home sellers who start their journey on Zillow can simultaneously request a cash offer from Opendoor as well as an estimate of what their home could sell for on the open market with a local Zillow premier agent partner.  The myriad of progress we are reporting against our growth pillar investments and the announcement of an agreement to acquire industry-leading CRM software provider Follow Up Boss paint a picture of a company that has a clear and exciting vision for a digital seamless integrated and efficient transaction in the messy scary land of a regular person who wants or needs to move. Before I pass things over to CFO, Jeremy Hoffman, I want to commend the extended Zillow team for working hard and successfully on solving real-world concrete consumer problems by a great software and great partners. This work requires a high degree of smart, skill and coordination as we roll out our services together and separately to an increasingly broad set of geographies. While industry noise is loud and the macro drag heavy, our team is executing very well, and it is showing up in our continued relative outperformance and the excitement we all feel about the growth opportunity ahead.  With that, I will turn it over to Jeremy.\nJeremy Hofmann: Thanks, Rich, and hello, everyone. I am pleased to discuss details about our Q3 results as well as our outlook for continued total revenue growth in a very tough macro environment. In my comments today, I will also discuss our agreement to acquire Follow Up Boss as well as how we are currently thinking about share-based compensation or SBC within the framework of our overall cost structure. In Q3, we delivered continued positive year-over-year revenue growth, up 3% to $496 million and $24 million above the midpoint of our outlook range. On a GAAP basis, net loss was $28 million, representing 6% of our revenue. Q3 EBITDA of $107 million resulted in a 22% EBITDA margin. Our revenue outperformance combined with effective cost management drove $30 million of EBITDA outperformance above the midpoint of our outlook range, demonstrating the high incremental margin business we have today. Residential revenue was $362 million, outperforming the high end of our outlook range, down 3% year-over-year. Our residential revenue performance was 1100 basis points above the industry decline of 14% according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Our internal calculations, which count the number of residential home sales in every market across the country suggest that the industry was down slightly more in Q3 than even in our numbers indicate. In Q3, we believe our relative outperformance was primarily driven by things that we are doing to grow and less by relative macro factors. Our ongoing investment in our top of funnel and mid-funnel experiences continue to drive improvements in our overall lead volumes when compared to the industry.  Rentals revenue growth accelerated in Q3, with revenue increasing 34% year-over-year to $99 million, primarily driven by our multifamily revenue, which grew 42% year-over-year in Q3. Growth in our Rentals marketplace is being driven by four factors. First, our Rentals team has executed on accelerating the year-over-year growth in the number of multifamily properties on our apps and sites, growing 28% in Q3, up from 21% in Q2 and 14% in Q1. Second, the total active listings across our entire Rentals marketplace was up 45% year-over-year. Third, the increase in active Rentals listings is driving our industry-leading Rentals traffic which was up 11% year-over-year to 30 million average monthly Rentals unique visitors per ComScore. Last, the occupancy rates have declined from historically high levels driving the need for landlords to advertise their vacant rental properties with us. Mortgages revenue was $24 million, with purchased loan origination volume growing 35% sequentially from Q2 and 88% year-over-year. We have made solid progress each quarter this year to help more of our customers get financing through Zillow Home Loans. This is being driven by adding new tools and integration capabilities as a bridge between Premier Agents and our loan officers as well as directing more customer requests to Zillow Home Loans rather than sending them to third parties via our marketplace. EBITDA expenses in Q3 totaled $389 million, slightly better than what was implied by our outlook. With select operating expenses slightly lower, as a result of selective actions we took in Q3 as part of ongoing efforts to streamline the business and prioritize investments. We also shifted $3 million of our advertising expenses from Q3 to Q4. Cost of revenue increased $21 million or 24% year-over-year primarily due to an increase in website development costs as we continue to release and test new products. We ended Q3 with $3.3 billion of cash and investments. Flat compared to the end of Q2, which includes the benefit of net cash provided by operating activities as well as the impact of $100 million in share repurchases during Q3. Convertible debt was $1.7 billion at the end of Q3. Turning to our outlook for Q4. We expect total revenue to be between $430 million and $455 million, implying a year-over-year increase of 2% at the midpoint of our outlook range. This compares to our estimate for an existing home industry transaction dollar decline between 8% and 13% year-over-year in Q4. We expect a total industry decline of 10% at the midpoint of the range to nominally improve compared to the Q3 decline of 14%. Despite these ongoing headwinds, we expect to outperform the industry in Q4 as the investments we have made in our funnel continue to deliver benefits. We expect residential revenue to be between $316 million and $334 million, down 4.5% year-over-year at the midpoint of our outlook range. For Premier Agent, we estimate revenue will decline between 4% to 9% year-over-year. Despite the tough macro existing home sales environment, our customer connections with Premier Agents have outperformed the industry consistently throughout 2023, and we expect this outperformance to continue into Q4. That said, we remain cautious around housing affordability challenges and the low inventory environment. We saw in Q3 and expect to continue to see in Q4, headwinds for prospective buyers who are finding it increasingly difficult to purchase a home. We have factored this into our outlook accordingly. Implied in our guidance for nonresidential revenue, which includes rentals, mortgages and other revenue categories, is 24% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of our outlook range. An acceleration from 21% growth in Q3. We expect rentals revenue to grow more than 30% year-over-year in Q4 as we continue to benefit from the strength of our execution. We also expect positive growth in mortgages revenue year-over-year in Q4 as we lap the refinance activity of a year ago and begin to scale the internalization of our marketplace leads. For Q4, we expect EBITDA to be between $40 million and $60 million, implying an 11% margin at the midpoint of our outlook range. We expect EBITDA to be down sequentially from Q3 due to seasonality of revenue. Excluding the impact of the timing, of $3 million of advertising expenses that moved from Q3 to Q4, we expect EBITDA expenses to be relatively flat sequentially. We have made reductions in fixed costs during Q3 that will flow into Q4 that we are reinvesting into revenue-producing variable head count as we see increased traction across our business. We expect to continue to hire loan officers as we accelerate the pace of our enhanced market roll out into 2024. We also expect to hire salespeople for Listing Showcase as we expand the product to more markets heading into 2024.  One item that we have not included in our outlook for Q4 is a potential onetime charge related to a lease agreement amendment we recently signed to reduce our Seattle office space. We estimate that we will record a onetime charge of $15 million included in EBITDA, if and when the landlord exercises their partial termination option, which we believe likely in either Q4 or Q1 2024. Excluding the impact of that onetime charge, if the partial termination option is exercised in Q4 this year, we estimate that our 2024 facilities costs would decrease by $10 million, and we would release an estimated $39 million in EBITDA expenses in total, over the remaining life of the Seattle lease, which more than makes up for the onetime hit to our EBITDA. Now on to the announcement we made to acquire Follow Up Boss. And industry-leading customer relationship management system for real estate professionals. We are excited about Follow Up Boss for a number of reasons. First, they have been a key integration partner of ours for a long time, and the product is beloved by the broader real estate industry and many of our Zillow Premier Agent. Follow Up Boss has grown its revenue more than 40% on average annually over the last 4 years, primarily by word-of-mouth marketing with no meaningful outbound sales efforts. This type of growth is quite a feat in any market environment and even more impressive in a housing market that is down nearly 20% since 2019. Further, the business has been profitable and growing for the last 11 years and is expected to grow more than 20% in 2023. Similar to our acquisition of ShowingTime in 2021, Follow Up Boss gives agents across the industry, a tech-enabled solution that allows them to focus on what they do best, delivering great experiences to customers. Also similar to ShowingTime, Follow Up Boss will remain an independent brand, serving the broader real estate industry as they've done so well for so many years. The purchase price includes $400 million of cash upon closing and up to $100 million in cash earn out over a 3-year period upon achievement of certain performance metrics. We estimate that we are paying upfront approximately 18 times Follow Up Boss's 2024 cash EBITDA on a stand-alone basis. Once the transaction closes, the Follow Up Boss team will join Zillow as our newest industry offering for real estate agents.  Now I'm going to cover our cost structure. First, I want to reiterate what I walked through on our last earnings call. We evaluate costs in 3 categories: fixed, variable and advertising. For our fixed cost base, I would like to reemphasize that we believe we are around the right levels of fixed cost to execute on the opportunities we see ahead. Similar to what we did in Q3, we are actively seeking to find efficiencies in our fixed costs to offset the inherent inflation in the fixed infrastructure.  While we expect to grow variable costs as we scale our business, we intend to drive operating leverage over time. We will dial our spend up and down for advertising, depending on the environment and opportunities we see to build awareness and drive growth. We will assess advertising levels with that lens, separate and distinct from the rest of the cost base. Before we open up the line for Q&A, I'd like to give you all some additional detail on how we look at share-based compensation and how it fits in our cost structure. Since taking over as CFO in May, I've spent time with many of you on this topic. We understand investors' concerns about the relatively high level of SBC expense, as a percentage of revenue, during this period of time when the macroeconomic environment is pressuring revenue, and we are forward investing to drive future growth. Historically, SBC represents a meaningful portion of compensation for many of our employees, and we give employees the choice of selecting RSUs or option awards each year. However, we see SBC as an expense that should be leverageable on a per employee basis as we grow revenue. Going forward, it is important to note that approximately 90% of our current SBC expense is related to fixed cost employees. If you model our fixed and variable EBITDA costs, that we provided last quarter, plus an assumption for marketing while holding SBC expense flat per head count, you will see we can be a GAAP profitable company over time as we drive revenue growth. In addition to monitoring our SBC expense, we also focused on our share dilution related to employee equity awards. Since 2018, we have granted an average annual net share dilution of 3.2%, while the realized annual net dilution for employee equity awards has averaged 2.5%. More recently, the August 2022 retention grants combined with the annual grant issued in 2022, drove annual granted net dilution of 5.2%. While the realized annual net dilution was just 2%, that same year. With all that said, we want to reiterate that becoming a GAAP profitable company over time is important to us. To get there, we expect to get leverage from our SBC expense as we grow revenue.  To close, I'll reiterate what you have heard from us before. 2022 was a year where we restrategized and reorganized around our Housing Super App vision. 2023 is a year for us to release new products and test in various markets. Setting us up for further scaling in 2024 and 2025. We are 3 quarters through the year and are pleased with how we are progressing.  And with that, operator, we'll open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from Brad Erickson from RBC. Brad, please go ahead.\nBradley Erickson : Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. So one for Rich first, appreciate the thoughts about the lawsuits and potential changes going on in the industry. Maybe if we could talk through an outcome where the buyer's agent remains, but commissions get pressured more significantly, maybe talk about some of the effects and impacts the business might see under that scenario? And then I have a follow up for Jeremy if I could. Thanks.\nRich Barton: Okay. Hey, Brad. Yes, thanks. So kind of the middle path scenario. So why don't I try to do a little bit more freeform restatement of what I said in my script, the comments first, Brad and kind of set the answer up. And then I might toss it over to Jeremy Wacksman to answer your middle path question specifically, which we feel good about our position as in the middle path scenario.  But overall, I just want to reiterate that are kind of the short version of what how we think this plays out. And any changes that might come is that we're positioned really, really well for all weather. Okay, and that is based on some fundamental marketplace principles that we believe in one, free and fair, transparent access to real estate information and listings, that is how we were founded, turned on the lights, we believe a well-lit game is cleaner and more equitable.  The second principle is independent representation. People deserve and need independent representation. We've seen double citing in the industry, which is clearly a conflict, and at certain times more expensive for the - to the transaction. We do support DIY - the people who want to do DIY and we have a pretty healthy DIY FSBO marketplace. But in most instances movers want and need counsel. And we think that takes the form of a buyer's agent.  And then finally, transparency and negotiability of commissions, which some markets have been moving towards and we think other markets are going to begin to move more quickly towards because of these legal actions. So how will this play out? I said this already, it's likely the legal process is likely to take years, it's highly complex, it's politically fraught. There are millions of potential employees and people affected in every state.  As I just said, I think the industry will move quickly towards these more transparent and negotiable rules that we have begun to see in several markets. I think we'll see that more quickly. But I guess, I would say we don't believe that this scenario, the most radical path, the complete disruption of the existence of a buyer's agent, we believe it's improbable. And I guess I would say mostly because consumers really want and need and deserve representation. But I've been through that.  Okay. But entertain the notion where it does happen. All right, we think what happens is listings marketplaces fragment. And we switch to a much more pay to play model like we see in some international geographies, we look more like a pay to play pay for enhanced represent merchandising, kind of like digital classifieds. If you think about that scenario, who set up to do well, it\u2019s who has the biggest audience, the best, most trusted brand, the most information and Zillow is in a really good position there.  We've observed in those international markets, this friction fee on the transaction is actually higher than we see in the commission world in the U.S. It is actually a more opaque, more fragmented and therefore an opportunity for more profit exists. And that is what we've seen in international markets and so it's possible. It could be even better economics, but we don't like that, we think it's bad for consumers. We think it's less efficient. We think it's less fair. We think it's more expensive.  I'll begin my wrap up and hand it over to Wacksman by saying that I made I made a point I don't know if Jeremy Hofmann reiterated but I made a point that we are really well diversified business net business now and getting even more diversified, rentals, mortgages, real estate software, new construction, showcase, these are all growers for Follow Up Boss, we will add to this, these are all growers all big TAMS and now account together for the majority of our revenues.  So I guess, in the end, the consumer is our north star that has served us really, really well so far. Having engaged customers and solving real problems with software and partners means that we are really well insulated, regardless of how the dollars end up flowing. So sorry to bore you with all that again, but I thought I'd get it out. Let's talk about the middle path, though, Jeremy Wacksman, you maybe want to give me a little relief?\nJeremy Wacksman : Yes, happy to. Yes. Thanks, Brad. I mean, in a world where there are fewer dollars to go around. I mean, I think similar to what Rich said, we feel really well positioned, and we love our strategy. And I think the investments that we are making in tech and in the transaction itself and helping more customers becomes even more valuable for the most productive agents. As a reminder, our strategy is to partner with the best teams and agents, and as such, our partner base are those that are likely going to gain share from the part time or the less productive or effective agents and the participants in the marketplace that might find themselves even more challenged in a world like that. And then it's to hand those partners higher-intent customers, Rich talked a lot about our Super App strategy that is about driving higher intent, higher-quality customers, buyers and sellers in the process of transacting to those partners. And so touring, our financing experience, our Seller Services are all doing that and then helping those partners become more productive, close more deals and be able to be more efficient in a world powered by software. So we get pretty excited about the value and services we provide. And if there's a void in the industry because the dollars are challenged and the other providers are challenged, we get excited about our ability to fill that because we feel really confident the partner strategy we have would really grab share here.\nBradley Erickson: Thanks guys. Helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Campbell from Stephens. John, please go ahead.\nJohn Campbell: Hey guys. I just want to echo the last question. I think, Rich, nice job addressing the lawsuits upfront. I've been frankly surprised to hear the level of investor concerns, but I think you did a good job of framing it up, so we agree with your take there. But going forward, I mean, investors are clearly going to still try to size up all these various scenarios. I'm hoping maybe you guys can help in that process specifically around the paid inclusion model, in those overseas markets like maybe what you're seeing on average or maybe a range of revenue per listing? And then I know with your current listing today, Rich did say it's going to be kind of fragmented potentially. But if you look at just your all-in listing today, what that looks like today? I know with the trough kind of inventory environment, it's probably a little bit lighter than it's been in the past. So maybe talk about what it is today? And maybe what it looks like. I don't know 5, 6, 7 years ago?\nRich Barton: Okay. Sure, John. Why don't I, why don't, we help me out Jeremy and Jeremy, if I mess up. Why don't, I start with the second part, the listings question. For all its works and flaws and all the complaints we make, kind of less cooperative, at least the way it's worked in the past, maybe it doesn't work this way going forward. But at least the way it's worked in the past, it's offered up a really good level playing relatively level playing field, equal access transparent marketplace for us to access kind of for sale by agent listings in the marketplace. And so because we're connected to these MLSs, we have a full view of the for-sale inventory in the market. And ever since we have had MLS listings that hasn't changed over time.  On top of all of that, let's call it, commodity listings information that we have, we add to it a whole bunch of non-commodity listings information in the form of for-sale by owners that are oftentimes proprietary to our sites in a different market as well as quite a number, a large number of rental listings that oftentimes are unique to our market place. And so combined, that alloy creates a relatively unique listings asset that is only strengthening over time. In the event that fragments, as I said, the world gets kind of messy and difficult for regular consumers and partners alike. But Zillow, of course, like we've done in the past, will run off and secure the most inventory in the world. We will get it.  Now how the business model works in that situation? Is it, we have several we have a lot of experience with paid inclusion business models, okay? And it will likely move to a paid inclusion business model. I don't know how to answer your specific rate question. You're saying, what would the rate look like in that world versus the rate that the industry is taking now other than to point you with the market cap per capita of the leading real estate portals in the U.S. versus, say, Australia or another market. And you'll see pretty quickly that the amount of value, at least in the form of market cap that's being captured by those companies is meaningfully higher than what we've been able to achieve is the leading portal here in the U.S. We see that as obviously as potential upside. But once again, we want to monetize in this industry in a way that is win- win. We want to win for consumers we want to win for our partners, and we want to win for ourselves. We think the most durable business model is where all three of those parties win. Did I leave anything out?\nJeremy Hofmann: Yes. I mean it's Jeremy Hoffman. I'll just layer on, Rich. The hard part is building the unique content that we've built over time. So that's a combination of for-sale listings, new construction listings, rentals listings for sale by owner listings. That's the really hard part. That's what we've been after for 15, 16, 17 years. Changing business models and doing a paid inclusion business model is not the challenging piece of the puzzle. It's getting all the unique content, getting all the eyeballs, and that's where we've really, really excelled. So in a world in which we go the way of international markets, we feel really well positioned as a result.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from UBS. Lloyd, please go ahead.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks, Two, if I can. First, just sticking with this shifting -- potentially shifting industry structure and the classifieds model potential can you just help us understand maybe the path where the MLS structure evolves setting the stage for that, you think a more middle pass scenario, would sustain the MLS structure such that it doesn't change? Like what specific change of events do you all see breaking that structure to enable this? And then I guess, listing, secondly, listing showcase seems like a pretty good template from where the model could move if the model structurally changes or even if it doesn't, it seems like that's an interesting product with a lot of potential. Can you just give us an update on kind of uptake agent feedback there? And how meaningful could that be maybe in a moderate scenario of change and then a more dramatic scenario like where does that fit in? Thanks.\nRich Barton: Okay. Thanks, Lloyd. Maybe I'll begin, Jeremy Wacksman, and then hand it over to you. Lloyd, I guess what I'd say is we just don't think it's likely that like taking a giant hammer to the hundreds of MLSs around the country and how that legislatively regulatorily or legally would happen would be a pretty difficult thing. And so I guess there's a ton of value provided by having an integrated marketplace where most consumers and partners can see everything on the market. And while many industry participants may have forgotten that benefit, we believe that if, as things begin to fragment, they will remember that benefit. So anyway, we see this as unlikely. So I honestly don't want to give it a ton more airtime other than to say, if it happens, we're really well positioned. On the showcase thing, that is a big giant new TAM that we're going after, and I'll hand it over to Wacksman to chat about how that's going and the potential we see.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. I mean, we continue to receive really great feedback about Listing Showcase from both consumers using the product and agents who have been part of our V1 and kind of early MVP rollout. As Rich mentioned, we're now live in 17 markets, and we're hard at work building out the feature set to enable us to scale. And that includes things like being able to offer it more flexibly different geographies have different density, different teams and agents have bigger and smaller businesses and how do we enable a go-to-market can serve all of them. I think as we talked about earlier this year, a big key to scale is ensuring that agents can bring their own photographers if they want. We provide a fantastic media service that captures all this great rich media. Rich talked about this interactive floor plan that is just such a unique and differentiated listening experience. It takes really well curated and trained media to do that, but enabling those photographers to do that when agents have a great photography workflow. And the acquisition we did at earlier this year is really to help scale that. So building out those capabilities is really the key to scale. You're right that there are some commonalities between agents focusing on how to market their listing for their seller and the international comp conversation. But we really think about Listing Showcase as much about helping listing agents grow their business. What listing agents tell us and what early users of showcase have told us is, this helps them win more listings. And that's how the product is discussed and used is when I'm sitting at the kitchen table, this is something I offer that other agents can't offer. This is why you should list with me. And so that economic value, in addition to helping the seller showcase their home, the best helps the agent showcase themselves, and so we get excited about really helping grow the listing side of our business through tools like that. We'll continue to update you as we make progress, but stay tuned for kind of expansion into more markets into next year.\nLloyd Walmsley: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan McKeveny from Zelman & Associates. Ryan, please go ahead\nRyan McKeveny: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and all the details. Within the commentary you gave in the letter on touring, you mentioned real-time touring is expected to be live and about 10% of or covering about 10% of total connections in the year. I'm curious, are you able to give a similar staff on the share of connections that are happening at the 9 enhanced markets? I assume similarly a small piece of the pie that are enhanced at this point. But any specifics you can share on that?\nJeremy Hofmann: Ryan, just to make sure you, the question you're asking is how much of our enhanced markets is in, the connections are in real-time touring?\nRyan McKeveny: More so just kind of how much coverage do the enhanced markets today of the total pie? You're talking about accelerating the growth opening more enhanced markets in 4Q and into '24. And I'm just trying to think about almost like how low is the base today in terms of the enhanced market to think about the opportunity going forward to expand that.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. Thanks for the clarification. I mean the enhanced markets, the 9 that we're just now in, right? And so prior to this quarter, the 6 that we rolled out, it's a small percentage of overall connections, I want to say, in the teens maybe. And then what Jeremy Hoffman was alluding to is, obviously, a real-time touring experience is not going to be available on 100% of customers. Not every customer requests a tour and then not every customer agent relationship fits the eligibility criteria. So that's a bit why we gave the color that as we ramp into the, I think, 90-odd markets into \u201824 we expect that will cover about 10% of our customers. And again, it's not simple math. Different markets have different eligibility, different density, different ability to serve. We've talked a lot about the reason we're going market by market is because you're rolling out a new workflow for agents and teams and you're training them on a new experience, deliver for the customer ends up being great and we get great feedback from those agents because they're now meeting the customer where they want to be met, that appointment set is really when they want to get versus a request, as Rich talked about. And so the customer is happier and the work with rate, the number of times the agent can work with the customer goes up. And so those are all great indicators of transaction share gains and happier customer agent relationships. But it's not just this linear path of lighting up on more pages on the website, it is kind of market by market.\nRyan McKeveny: Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. And then one question on mortgage. Part of it is just reiterating that, I think you said for 4Q that you'd see or expect to see revenue growth. But is that implying that your origination growth, roughly 90% this quarter. The revenue piece down slightly year-over-year, and you called out the mortgage marketplace declines are kind of the offset there. I guess are we reaching the point where origination growth should similarly translate to revenue growth? Like you said expected to begin in 4Q and then presumably going forward, if origination growth is, or if origination volume is growing, generally, revenue should grow going forward?\nJeremy Hofmann: Yes, Ryan, it's Jeremy Hofmann. I'll take that one. I think it's fair to think about the originations business becoming more and more of the mortgages line item. So it is taking up more revenue at this point and the marketplace is decreasing. With respect \u201824 and beyond yes, our expectation is the mortgage, the VHL originations revenue will be the bigger piece of the pie, but unquestionably, marketplace is still part of the mix. So it's not perfectly direct.\nRyan McKeveny: Got it. Okay, thank you very much. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Colantuoni from Jefferies. John, please go ahead//\nVincent Kardos: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is Vincent Kardos on for John. Sticking on the mortgage topic here. So last quarter, I know you flagged a 50% improvement in loan ops or productivity versus 4Q of last year? And then this quarter, you grew your originations by almost 90%, 35% sequentially, but also hiring a bunch of more loan officers. Maybe you can help us think a little bit about how much of the growth there came from adding officers versus any productivity as you saw in the quarter? And then maybe talk about how much runway you see for opposite productivity given the current housing backdrop and then maybe how that could change once we get a better rate relief going forward? Thanks. \nJeremy Hofmann: Yes. Thanks for the question. It's Jeremy Hofmann. I think we are really pleased with the way that we are growing the purchase mortgage origination business, no question about it, up 88% in a market like this. This challenge is quite impressive. I would say the ramp in loan officers, we still see opportunities for us to get more productive. We're pleased with the productivity today, and we're obviously hiring loan officers as a result, but we think there's more to do as time goes on and we get to scale.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. And maybe just to add to that a bit. I think you should expect to see both, but you should expect to see us grow loan officer count as we scale origination volume into next year, but you should also expect us to see increases in productivity and efficiency, both on the customer experience, we've talked a lot in prior quarters about the huge opportunity we have with all of the customers that are coming to Zillow asking for financing questions and how can we help meet them where they are.  There's those that are ready to get a loan right now. There's those that are not. How do we help get them all an answer? As well as the customers coming from our great Premier Agents who know best when to ask them to get financing questions answered to go right and offer on a home. So lots of potential productivity gains there. And then there's also lots of great factory improvements that we're hard at work building and that's a lot of the investments we've been making to just help our loan officers our processors and our team get more efficient at being ready to handle the scale of volume that we want to bring. So short answer is you should expect to see both from us and both should contribute to growth into next year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Josey from Citigroup. Ron, please go ahead.\nRonald Josey: Great. Thank for taking question appreciate. I wanted to ask on Rentals. We saw Listings grow 45% year-over-year, revenue reaccelerated multifamily traffic is growing. Just talk to us about the change that's happening here in Rentals and the strategy here longer term? And then a quick follow-up for the team just on listing showcase. Are these buyers new to Zillow or existing, meaning I know we're monetizing, call it a newer side of the transaction on the seller side, but are they newer existing? And then any early feedback would be helpful. Thank you, guys.\nJeremy Hofmann: Yes. Thanks, Ron. It's Jeremy Hoffman. I'll start on the Rentals. Yes, we're really pleased, and I'll let Jeremy Wacksman hit more of it, but up 34% year-over-year this quarter, up 42% in multifamily. And yes, it's executing on all cylinders. So multifamily properties were up 28% in Q3. Total active listings across both multifamily and single-family up 45% year-over-year. And then obviously, the traffic continues to be really strong. We're industry leading there and grew double digits there. So we're really, really happy with how we're executing. And like I said in my prepared remarks, we expect 30%-plus growth in Q4 there, too. So Jeremy, anything else you want to add there?\nJeremy Wacksman: No, I think that's right. I think it's you hit it earlier to the largest and most engaged audience using great products and services across both multi- and single-family listings. Some macro helps in terms of occupancy rates decreasing and more supply in the market means the advertisers need our high-quality customers. And so you're seeing the team execute to drive a lot of revenue growth there across the marketplace as a whole. And we get really excited about that growth continuing. And again, the Rentals business, great business, fast-growing business, a bigger part of our business, as Rich talked about, but also incredibly strategic as half of those renters are thinking about buying and half of those renters are some of the most affordability challenge first-time homebuyers that will be ready for VHL and our great PA someday as the macro normalizes there. So incredibly great business, growing really fast, teams executing really well and super strategic for us long term.  And then on Showcase, how many advertisers or agents, I think, was your question, how many agents are incremental. I mean it's a mix and intentionally so. And I think as we scale it beyond the initial markets, we expect to see that, be interesting to learn how that mix pans out. You can imagine, similar to our overall strategy when Listing Showcase helps great agents and teams grow their business, and it's a business grow driver for them.  You find them that look like are great Premier Agents today that want to use it, but you also find new customers who were less interested in the products that Premier Agent has to offer, really interested in using Listing Showcases a way to grow their business. So we're pleased with the early mix. It wasn't, there's not any sort of intentional target there. For us, it's really more about learning with partners this early MVP and V1 as we're building V2 and getting ready for scale.\nRonald Josey:\n. :\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Tom Champion from Piper Sandler. Tom, please go ahead.\nThomas Champion: Good afternoon. Richard, Jeremy, I'm curious if you could talk about any changes or updated thoughts on the competition? How do you think about UV growth@homes.com? And then maybe for Jeremy Hoffman, really appreciate the comments on the cost structure, very helpful. Just curious if you could talk a little bit about your thoughts around head count growth into next year? Thank you.\nRich Barton: Hey, Ron. We're not seeing any impact really from the noise out there other than posting great results and making great progress against our growth pillars as we've been chatting about on this call. I think the way we inoculate ourselves from having to over focus on competition is by really focusing on building awesome software for our users and our customers and our partners and software that solves real customer pain points like the interactive floor plans and 3D virtual walk-throughs and real-time booking and to come out for rental applications and more, and we are actually adding Follow Up Boss now, which is really quite a beloved CRM in the -- with a lot of customers in the agent space. So we believe that the way we win long term really is by creating, integrating seamlessly and creating the Super App for customers and a Super App for our partners. We like that it's hard. We like that it takes kind of mad software skills to do it. It's worked well. Focusing on this has worked well for us so far. We've cited a bunch of data on that, but not only do we have the biggest, most engaged audience, but 80% of it comes to us directly. We anticipate that will continue to work.  Maybe I'll throw to Jeremy Hoffman that last question and then we'll close. \nJeremy Hofmann: Yes. And just on the cost structure, I think just to reiterate what I said before, no specific guidance around 2024, but we do feel like we are at around the right level of fixed cost for the opportunities we see ahead. And then variable costs will grow as we grow revenue, and we'll look for operational efficiencies along the way, but feel really good about what we're investing against and then also the long-term margin profile of the things that we're investing against. And then beyond that, just reiterating that marketing is a different line item for us and one that will assess based on growth opportunities. But overarchingly feeling quite good about the cost structure.\nThomas Champion: Thank you, both. \nOperator: Thank you. That is the end of the Q&A session. I will now hand back over to Rich Barton for closing remarks.\nRich Barton: We really appreciate the thoughtful questions from, and we look forward to updating you as we plan on continuing to make progress along our growth pillars. Thank you very much for your continued trust and investment in Zillow. Talk to you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeremy Hofmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Rich, and hello, everyone. I am pleased to discuss details about our Q3 results as well as our outlook for continued total revenue growth in a very tough macro environment. In my comments today, I will also discuss our agreement to acquire Follow Up Boss as well as how we are currently thinking about share-based compensation or SBC within the framework of our overall cost structure. In Q3, we delivered continued positive year-over-year revenue growth, up 3% to $496 million and $24 million above the midpoint of our outlook range. On a GAAP basis, net loss was $28 million, representing 6% of our revenue. Q3 EBITDA of $107 million resulted in a 22% EBITDA margin. Our revenue outperformance combined with effective cost management drove $30 million of EBITDA outperformance above the midpoint of our outlook range, demonstrating the high incremental margin business we have today. Residential revenue was $362 million, outperforming the high end of our outlook range, down 3% year-over-year. Our residential revenue performance was 1100 basis points above the industry decline of 14% according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Our internal calculations, which count the number of residential home sales in every market across the country suggest that the industry was down slightly more in Q3 than even in our numbers indicate. In Q3, we believe our relative outperformance was primarily driven by things that we are doing to grow and less by relative macro factors. Our ongoing investment in our top of funnel and mid-funnel experiences continue to drive improvements in our overall lead volumes when compared to the industry.  Rentals revenue growth accelerated in Q3, with revenue increasing 34% year-over-year to $99 million, primarily driven by our multifamily revenue, which grew 42% year-over-year in Q3. Growth in our Rentals marketplace is being driven by four factors. First, our Rentals team has executed on accelerating the year-over-year growth in the number of multifamily properties on our apps and sites, growing 28% in Q3, up from 21% in Q2 and 14% in Q1. Second, the total active listings across our entire Rentals marketplace was up 45% year-over-year. Third, the increase in active Rentals listings is driving our industry-leading Rentals traffic which was up 11% year-over-year to 30 million average monthly Rentals unique visitors per ComScore. Last, the occupancy rates have declined from historically high levels driving the need for landlords to advertise their vacant rental properties with us. Mortgages revenue was $24 million, with purchased loan origination volume growing 35% sequentially from Q2 and 88% year-over-year. We have made solid progress each quarter this year to help more of our customers get financing through Zillow Home Loans. This is being driven by adding new tools and integration capabilities as a bridge between Premier Agents and our loan officers as well as directing more customer requests to Zillow Home Loans rather than sending them to third parties via our marketplace. EBITDA expenses in Q3 totaled $389 million, slightly better than what was implied by our outlook. With select operating expenses slightly lower, as a result of selective actions we took in Q3 as part of ongoing efforts to streamline the business and prioritize investments. We also shifted $3 million of our advertising expenses from Q3 to Q4. Cost of revenue increased $21 million or 24% year-over-year primarily due to an increase in website development costs as we continue to release and test new products. We ended Q3 with $3.3 billion of cash and investments. Flat compared to the end of Q2, which includes the benefit of net cash provided by operating activities as well as the impact of $100 million in share repurchases during Q3. Convertible debt was $1.7 billion at the end of Q3. Turning to our outlook for Q4. We expect total revenue to be between $430 million and $455 million, implying a year-over-year increase of 2% at the midpoint of our outlook range. This compares to our estimate for an existing home industry transaction dollar decline between 8% and 13% year-over-year in Q4. We expect a total industry decline of 10% at the midpoint of the range to nominally improve compared to the Q3 decline of 14%. Despite these ongoing headwinds, we expect to outperform the industry in Q4 as the investments we have made in our funnel continue to deliver benefits. We expect residential revenue to be between $316 million and $334 million, down 4.5% year-over-year at the midpoint of our outlook range. For Premier Agent, we estimate revenue will decline between 4% to 9% year-over-year. Despite the tough macro existing home sales environment, our customer connections with Premier Agents have outperformed the industry consistently throughout 2023, and we expect this outperformance to continue into Q4. That said, we remain cautious around housing affordability challenges and the low inventory environment. We saw in Q3 and expect to continue to see in Q4, headwinds for prospective buyers who are finding it increasingly difficult to purchase a home. We have factored this into our outlook accordingly. Implied in our guidance for nonresidential revenue, which includes rentals, mortgages and other revenue categories, is 24% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of our outlook range. An acceleration from 21% growth in Q3. We expect rentals revenue to grow more than 30% year-over-year in Q4 as we continue to benefit from the strength of our execution. We also expect positive growth in mortgages revenue year-over-year in Q4 as we lap the refinance activity of a year ago and begin to scale the internalization of our marketplace leads. For Q4, we expect EBITDA to be between $40 million and $60 million, implying an 11% margin at the midpoint of our outlook range. We expect EBITDA to be down sequentially from Q3 due to seasonality of revenue. Excluding the impact of the timing, of $3 million of advertising expenses that moved from Q3 to Q4, we expect EBITDA expenses to be relatively flat sequentially. We have made reductions in fixed costs during Q3 that will flow into Q4 that we are reinvesting into revenue-producing variable head count as we see increased traction across our business. We expect to continue to hire loan officers as we accelerate the pace of our enhanced market roll out into 2024. We also expect to hire salespeople for Listing Showcase as we expand the product to more markets heading into 2024.  One item that we have not included in our outlook for Q4 is a potential onetime charge related to a lease agreement amendment we recently signed to reduce our Seattle office space. We estimate that we will record a onetime charge of $15 million included in EBITDA, if and when the landlord exercises their partial termination option, which we believe likely in either Q4 or Q1 2024. Excluding the impact of that onetime charge, if the partial termination option is exercised in Q4 this year, we estimate that our 2024 facilities costs would decrease by $10 million, and we would release an estimated $39 million in EBITDA expenses in total, over the remaining life of the Seattle lease, which more than makes up for the onetime hit to our EBITDA. Now on to the announcement we made to acquire Follow Up Boss. And industry-leading customer relationship management system for real estate professionals. We are excited about Follow Up Boss for a number of reasons. First, they have been a key integration partner of ours for a long time, and the product is beloved by the broader real estate industry and many of our Zillow Premier Agent. Follow Up Boss has grown its revenue more than 40% on average annually over the last 4 years, primarily by word-of-mouth marketing with no meaningful outbound sales efforts. This type of growth is quite a feat in any market environment and even more impressive in a housing market that is down nearly 20% since 2019. Further, the business has been profitable and growing for the last 11 years and is expected to grow more than 20% in 2023. Similar to our acquisition of ShowingTime in 2021, Follow Up Boss gives agents across the industry, a tech-enabled solution that allows them to focus on what they do best, delivering great experiences to customers. Also similar to ShowingTime, Follow Up Boss will remain an independent brand, serving the broader real estate industry as they've done so well for so many years. The purchase price includes $400 million of cash upon closing and up to $100 million in cash earn out over a 3-year period upon achievement of certain performance metrics. We estimate that we are paying upfront approximately 18 times Follow Up Boss's 2024 cash EBITDA on a stand-alone basis. Once the transaction closes, the Follow Up Boss team will join Zillow as our newest industry offering for real estate agents.  Now I'm going to cover our cost structure. First, I want to reiterate what I walked through on our last earnings call. We evaluate costs in 3 categories: fixed, variable and advertising. For our fixed cost base, I would like to reemphasize that we believe we are around the right levels of fixed cost to execute on the opportunities we see ahead. Similar to what we did in Q3, we are actively seeking to find efficiencies in our fixed costs to offset the inherent inflation in the fixed infrastructure.  While we expect to grow variable costs as we scale our business, we intend to drive operating leverage over time. We will dial our spend up and down for advertising, depending on the environment and opportunities we see to build awareness and drive growth. We will assess advertising levels with that lens, separate and distinct from the rest of the cost base. Before we open up the line for Q&A, I'd like to give you all some additional detail on how we look at share-based compensation and how it fits in our cost structure. Since taking over as CFO in May, I've spent time with many of you on this topic. We understand investors' concerns about the relatively high level of SBC expense, as a percentage of revenue, during this period of time when the macroeconomic environment is pressuring revenue, and we are forward investing to drive future growth. Historically, SBC represents a meaningful portion of compensation for many of our employees, and we give employees the choice of selecting RSUs or option awards each year. However, we see SBC as an expense that should be leverageable on a per employee basis as we grow revenue. Going forward, it is important to note that approximately 90% of our current SBC expense is related to fixed cost employees. If you model our fixed and variable EBITDA costs, that we provided last quarter, plus an assumption for marketing while holding SBC expense flat per head count, you will see we can be a GAAP profitable company over time as we drive revenue growth. In addition to monitoring our SBC expense, we also focused on our share dilution related to employee equity awards. Since 2018, we have granted an average annual net share dilution of 3.2%, while the realized annual net dilution for employee equity awards has averaged 2.5%. More recently, the August 2022 retention grants combined with the annual grant issued in 2022, drove annual granted net dilution of 5.2%. While the realized annual net dilution was just 2%, that same year. With all that said, we want to reiterate that becoming a GAAP profitable company over time is important to us. To get there, we expect to get leverage from our SBC expense as we grow revenue.  To close, I'll reiterate what you have heard from us before. 2022 was a year where we restrategized and reorganized around our Housing Super App vision. 2023 is a year for us to release new products and test in various markets. Setting us up for further scaling in 2024 and 2025. We are 3 quarters through the year and are pleased with how we are progressing.  And with that, operator, we'll open up the line for questions. Yes. I mean it's Jeremy Hoffman. I'll just layer on, Rich. The hard part is building the unique content that we've built over time. So that's a combination of for-sale listings, new construction listings, rentals listings for sale by owner listings. That's the really hard part. That's what we've been after for 15, 16, 17 years. Changing business models and doing a paid inclusion business model is not the challenging piece of the puzzle. It's getting all the unique content, getting all the eyeballs, and that's where we've really, really excelled. So in a world in which we go the way of international markets, we feel really well positioned as a result. Ryan, just to make sure you, the question you're asking is how much of our enhanced markets is in, the connections are in real-time touring? Yes, Ryan, it's Jeremy Hofmann. I'll take that one. I think it's fair to think about the originations business becoming more and more of the mortgages line item. So it is taking up more revenue at this point and the marketplace is decreasing. With respect \u201824 and beyond yes, our expectation is the mortgage, the VHL originations revenue will be the bigger piece of the pie, but unquestionably, marketplace is still part of the mix. So it's not perfectly direct. Yes. Thanks for the question. It's Jeremy Hofmann. I think we are really pleased with the way that we are growing the purchase mortgage origination business, no question about it, up 88% in a market like this. This challenge is quite impressive. I would say the ramp in loan officers, we still see opportunities for us to get more productive. We're pleased with the productivity today, and we're obviously hiring loan officers as a result, but we think there's more to do as time goes on and we get to scale. Yes. Thanks, Ron. It's Jeremy Hoffman. I'll start on the Rentals. Yes, we're really pleased, and I'll let Jeremy Wacksman hit more of it, but up 34% year-over-year this quarter, up 42% in multifamily. And yes, it's executing on all cylinders. So multifamily properties were up 28% in Q3. Total active listings across both multifamily and single-family up 45% year-over-year. And then obviously, the traffic continues to be really strong. We're industry leading there and grew double digits there. So we're really, really happy with how we're executing. And like I said in my prepared remarks, we expect 30%-plus growth in Q4 there, too. So Jeremy, anything else you want to add there? Yes. And just on the cost structure, I think just to reiterate what I said before, no specific guidance around 2024, but we do feel like we are at around the right level of fixed cost for the opportunities we see ahead. And then variable costs will grow as we grow revenue, and we'll look for operational efficiencies along the way, but feel really good about what we're investing against and then also the long-term margin profile of the things that we're investing against. And then beyond that, just reiterating that marketing is a different line item for us and one that will assess based on growth opportunities. But overarchingly feeling quite good about the cost structure."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Rich Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad. And thanks, Lauren. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you dialing in today to hear our third quarter 2023 results. I'm looking forward to sharing the progress we've made on our growth strategy as we yet again, meaningfully outperformed the industry by making steady executional progress, converting traffic into transactions.  Before I get to our results, and an update on our five growth pillars, it's important that I address the high level of media attention and speculation surrounding several ongoing industry lawsuits, and what the implications may be for the broader residential real estate industry and for Zillow in particular. The short version is, we strongly believe Zillow is well positioned to thrive regardless of how it all plays out.  I'll explain our logic. But first, let me be clear on the marketplace principles that underlie Zillow's stance. With respect to free, fair and transparent access to real estate information, we are strong supporters. With respect to the importance of independent representation, we are strong supporters. And finally, with respect to transparent and negotiable agent commissions, we are strong supporters. From where we stand it seems clear that these principles are in the best interest of mover consumers, agents, and the industry as a whole.  Consumers and agents should have access to all listings and consumers should be empowered with information about listings and how agent commissions get paid. We believe this is the best way forward.  Now regarding litigation news, we expect the Sitzer/Burnett lawsuit that made headlines yesterday, in which a jury ruled in favor of plaintiffs and awarded approximately $1.8 billion in damages will likely be tied up in court for years. Defendants in that case such as the National Association of Realtors, and certain real estate franchisors have already indicated that they intend to pursue an appeals process, unless there's some negotiated settlement. As a reminder to you all, Zillow is not a party to this lawsuit nor other similar ones.  Aside from how long this particular case may take to fully play out, we expect industry changes resulting from this lawsuit, or ones like it will involve commission transparency, and negotiability provisions similar to those seen in several of the settlements plaintiffs entered into with other real estate franchisors in advance of the trial. These industry changes would tend to look like good initial steps add more transparency and education for consumers.  In forward leaning markets that have been exploring changes that result in increased transparency and negotiability we believe our business thrives. We also believe complete disruption to the existence of buyer's agents is improbable for a few reasons. Why? Because buyer's agents represent the buyer's interest throughout this complex and often intimidating process of purchasing a home, the biggest purchase most people make in their lifetime, for which most people take on huge debt, and which has ended up being for most homeowners their largest financial asset.  Similar to other infrequent high complexity, high stakes transactions, independent representation in real estate is important. As an analogy, investment bankers don't represent both the buyer and the seller in an M&A deal because it makes no logical sense that one advisor could effectively represent the best interests of both parties. In fact, dual agency where the same individual listing agent represents both parties or double citing is harmful enough in the real estate transaction that it's already been banned or substantially restricted in eight states in the U.S. Buyers deserve and most need their own independent counsel. And for most buyers, this means a dedicated agent.  There is always a DIY or do it yourself segment of any industry. And we fully support DIY inside of Zillow today, while knowing via research and experienced that for most movers, the stakes are too high for DIY.  So I'll remind you that Zillow was founded on the first principle of free and fair access to real estate information and listings, we have not wavered. We continue to adhere to this principle and assert our position by advocating and lobbying in favor of more transparency in real estate. The benefits and durability of independent buyer representation, and the importance of transparent and negotiable commissions. We believe change in the industry has been and will be slow, but will continually bend towards these principles.  However, indulging for a moment a future scenario where buyer's agency does go away, we have high confidence that Zillow will remain in a strong position, potentially even stronger. Why? Because then the U.S market would likely transition to a market structure that we observe in several international geographies where a very large portal or 2, offer a pay to play paid inclusion, digital listings marketplace, sort of a digital classified advertising analogy.  In this scenario, Zillow would be an odds on favorite to become the leading digital listings marketplace given our brand, traffic, engagement, and our unique focus on solving movers' real pain points with our software anchored housing super app vision. If international classifieds markets are any guide, it is also possible that this leads to a larger and more profitable business model for Zillow. Are we advocating for this to happen? No, because we believe pay to play marketplace is a step backwards for consumers and the industry as a whole. And we very much like our position and growth plan in a market structure that continually evolves towards our principles of access, independence, and transparency.  Let me wrap this section up by reiterating that we have always focused first on delighting the masses with software products that attract users with modest marketing spend. Those who know us well know that over the years, we have exhibited an unusually high degree of business model creativity and innovation, as we have figured out how to monetize our incredible user engagement in ways that are a win win win, a win for consumers, a win for our partners, and a win for Zillow.  This experimentation and innovation has resulted in a revenue roll up today that features a wide variety of lines of business and monetization models to the point where revenue derived from buyer agent activity represented less than 50% of our total revenue in Q3. Today, we are focused on delivering the housing Super App, a tech enabled end to end platform with products and services that make it easier for people to move. Zillow, the trusted brand and marketplace will be here to help buyers, sellers, renters and the industry transact in real estate, regardless of how the dollars flow.  Now that we've covered what's happening in the industry, I'm excited to share our results with you. You've heard me say many times that 2023 is crucial for Zillow, it's a year of execution as we prepare to scale in 2024 and 2025. We're very pleased with what we've accomplished today.  We again delivered strong relative outperformance compared to total industry transaction dollar volumes. We reported better than expected and continued positive revenue growth of $496 million in Q3, up 3% year-over-year. Residential revenue of $362 million declined by only 3% year-over-year while the broader market declined by 14%, meaning Zillow outperformed the industry by 1100 basis points.  This quarter now marks the fourth straight quarter of meaningful outperformance versus the industry. Our ongoing efforts to improve our customer funnel, capture more demand and connect more of that demand to our partner network continue to pay dividends for our performance.  A contributor to our outperformance was a great quarter in our Rentals marketplace. Driven by increased traffic and listing growth in both multi and single family we reported $99 million in revenue in Rentals this quarter, up 34% year-over-year. We remain the number one most visited Rentals platform according to comScore with average monthly Rental unique visitors of double digits' year-over-year in Q3. We believe this positions us well for future revenue growth. We're also making excellent progress in mortgages, growing our purchase mortgage originations business by 88% year-over-year, even as mortgage rates hit 20 year highs.  Our core business continues to demonstrate healthy top of funnel demand driven by our powerful brand, with $224 million average monthly unique users in the third quarter, our overall leading traffic is double that of our next competitor. And a nod to our broad awareness and trust.  More than 80% of our users come to us organically, directly and for free. And less than 5% of our users come from paid SEM and digital acquisition. Our great product respected brand, and large audience are a meaningful strategic advantage for Zillow. This is the foundation upon which we invest in and build out our growth pillars, all of which are focused on increasing conversion by simplifying, digitizing and integrating the complex, scary and expensive real estate transaction, real customer problems that we're solving with great software and great partners.  Before we get to our road map update, I'm excited to speak about our just signed agreement to acquire Follow Up Boss, an industry leading CRM, customer relationship management system that gives top performing real estate professionals a central hub to organize and engage customers, close deals and build their teams. We're investing in great tech solutions that make it easier for people to move and Follow Up Boss does just that. They have bootstrapped an industry leading CRM platform from the ground up. It's a great product, one that is beloved by agents and teams across the industry, and currently used by many Zillow premier agent partners and showing time plus clients.  We are excited to be able to use Zillow's resources to help Follow Up Boss grow even faster and to invest in a more integrated software experience for agents and teams across the industry, enabling them to boost productivity and grow their own businesses. Jeremy will speak in more detail about this proposed acquisition shortly.  Zillow's housing Super App vision is to create a single digital experience to help customers across their real estate needs including buying, selling, financing, and renting, serving as one ecosystem of connected solutions for all the tasks and services related to moving.  We're bringing this vision to life through investments across five growth pillars, touring, financing, seller solutions, integrating our services and enhancing our partner network. These five growth pillars mark the pathway to meeting our goals for increased transaction share and revenue per customer transaction.  This past year we've been focused on launching learning and refining products and services within our growth pillars. As we scale and grow over the coming years. We are making progress as demonstrated by our accelerated product rollouts this quarter. Our efforts are improving our mid funnel conversion. And with that our connection volumes across the business as we focus on driving real value through customer transactions.  We've been encouraged by what we're learning in the geographies where we enroll that are most full featured in integrated housing super app experience, our enhanced markets. Since we last spoke, we launched five more enhanced markets bringing us to a total of nine. As each month passes, we are increasingly confident in the results we are seeing in our enhanced markets and are encouraged by continued strong connections growth and customer transaction share gains. We anticipate launching additional enhanced markets at an accelerated pace in the months ahead and throughout 2024.  Additionally, the investments we're making to improve touring, a key growth pillar will continue to fuel momentum. A home tour is the moment that a dreamed about home as viewed on our Zillow app, becomes a reality for the first time. Raising one's digital hand to take a physical tour is a strong indicator of seriousness and those shoppers who requested to or convert to buyers at three times the rate of other actions on Zillow. Getting ready to buy starts with getting in the door physically.  Powered by showing time. A real time touring product lets a home shopper schedule and confirm a home tour in real time as opposed to simply requesting it. Along with other improvements we've made throughout the conversion funnel, real time touring is meaningfully improving our ability to connect higher intent customers through our premiere agent partners. Wherever real time touring is enabled, we continue to see significant outperformance of our overall connections growth versus the industry.  As a result, we've accelerated the rollout of real time touring independent of our enhanced markets. We are currently live in 57 markets and expect to be in an additional 33 covering approximately 10% of our total connections by the end of 2023. Exciting progress. Another pain point in the customers moving journey is securing financing. The second of our growth pillars. As I've said before, nearly 80% of homes purchased are financed with a mortgage. Approximately 40% of all homebuyers start their journey shopping for a mortgage before deciding on an agent to work with. Knowing that almost all of these mortgage seekers use Zillow sets us up very nicely to build a substantial first party direct to consumer purchase mortgage origination business seamlessly integrated with our extensive premier agent partner network.  We began to show real traction over the last few quarters. That growth continued in Q3 and despite a historically horrendous mortgage origination market, Zillow Home Loans reported an 88% year-over-year increase in purchase loan origination volume. Traditionally, Zillow customers went to our mortgage marketplace to shop for rates. Increasingly, those customers are being offered Zillow Home Loans directly. Those customers along with our work to integrate premier agents with Zillow Home Loans in our enhanced markets are driving the growth of Zillow Home Loans purchase mortgages. We are not yet at scale, but we are making excellent progress with $452 million in purchase loan originations during Q3, even as mortgage rates hit 20 year highs.  I'll now move on to the final growth pillar and our road map update, Seller Solutions. As you know, we are investing here to provide sellers and listing agents with tech enabled products and services that make selling homes easier, a big TAM that we have targeted and been innovating against for quite some time.  Last quarter, we launched Listing Showcase under our ShowingTime+ broad real estate industry software brands. Listing Showcase listings feature rich media like scrolling hero images, room by room photo organization and interactive floor plans giving buyers a deep understanding of the home before they ever stepped inside.  We're providing agents industry wide the tools to highlight a home's best features while also providing them an opportunity to elevate their brand presence on Zillow, which should lead to future business. The response has been quite positive so far. As of today, we are in 17 markets with plans to expand throughout Q4 and beyond.  Additionally, with respect to opening up sell side TAM with Seller Solutions, we've expanded our partnership with our iBuying leader Opendoor to 45 markets as of last week. In these markets home sellers who start their journey on Zillow can simultaneously request a cash offer from Opendoor as well as an estimate of what their home could sell for on the open market with a local Zillow premier agent partner.  The myriad of progress we are reporting against our growth pillar investments and the announcement of an agreement to acquire industry-leading CRM software provider Follow Up Boss paint a picture of a company that has a clear and exciting vision for a digital seamless integrated and efficient transaction in the messy scary land of a regular person who wants or needs to move. Before I pass things over to CFO, Jeremy Hoffman, I want to commend the extended Zillow team for working hard and successfully on solving real-world concrete consumer problems by a great software and great partners. This work requires a high degree of smart, skill and coordination as we roll out our services together and separately to an increasingly broad set of geographies. While industry noise is loud and the macro drag heavy, our team is executing very well, and it is showing up in our continued relative outperformance and the excitement we all feel about the growth opportunity ahead.  With that, I will turn it over to Jeremy. Okay. Hey, Brad. Yes, thanks. So kind of the middle path scenario. So why don't I try to do a little bit more freeform restatement of what I said in my script, the comments first, Brad and kind of set the answer up. And then I might toss it over to Jeremy Wacksman to answer your middle path question specifically, which we feel good about our position as in the middle path scenario.  But overall, I just want to reiterate that are kind of the short version of what how we think this plays out. And any changes that might come is that we're positioned really, really well for all weather. Okay, and that is based on some fundamental marketplace principles that we believe in one, free and fair, transparent access to real estate information and listings, that is how we were founded, turned on the lights, we believe a well-lit game is cleaner and more equitable.  The second principle is independent representation. People deserve and need independent representation. We've seen double citing in the industry, which is clearly a conflict, and at certain times more expensive for the - to the transaction. We do support DIY - the people who want to do DIY and we have a pretty healthy DIY FSBO marketplace. But in most instances movers want and need counsel. And we think that takes the form of a buyer's agent.  And then finally, transparency and negotiability of commissions, which some markets have been moving towards and we think other markets are going to begin to move more quickly towards because of these legal actions. So how will this play out? I said this already, it's likely the legal process is likely to take years, it's highly complex, it's politically fraught. There are millions of potential employees and people affected in every state.  As I just said, I think the industry will move quickly towards these more transparent and negotiable rules that we have begun to see in several markets. I think we'll see that more quickly. But I guess, I would say we don't believe that this scenario, the most radical path, the complete disruption of the existence of a buyer's agent, we believe it's improbable. And I guess I would say mostly because consumers really want and need and deserve representation. But I've been through that.  Okay. But entertain the notion where it does happen. All right, we think what happens is listings marketplaces fragment. And we switch to a much more pay to play model like we see in some international geographies, we look more like a pay to play pay for enhanced represent merchandising, kind of like digital classifieds. If you think about that scenario, who set up to do well, it's who has the biggest audience, the best, most trusted brand, the most information and Zillow is in a really good position there.  We've observed in those international markets, this friction fee on the transaction is actually higher than we see in the commission world in the U.S. It is actually a more opaque, more fragmented and therefore an opportunity for more profit exists. And that is what we've seen in international markets and so it's possible. It could be even better economics, but we don't like that, we think it's bad for consumers. We think it's less efficient. We think it's less fair. We think it's more expensive.  I'll begin my wrap up and hand it over to Wacksman by saying that I made I made a point I don't know if Jeremy Hofmann reiterated but I made a point that we are really well diversified business net business now and getting even more diversified, rentals, mortgages, real estate software, new construction, showcase, these are all growers for Follow Up Boss, we will add to this, these are all growers all big TAMS and now account together for the majority of our revenues.  So I guess, in the end, the consumer is our north star that has served us really, really well so far. Having engaged customers and solving real problems with software and partners means that we are really well insulated, regardless of how the dollars end up flowing. So sorry to bore you with all that again, but I thought I'd get it out. Let's talk about the middle path, though, Jeremy Wacksman, you maybe want to give me a little relief? Okay. Sure, John. Why don't I, why don't, we help me out Jeremy and Jeremy, if I mess up. Why don't, I start with the second part, the listings question. For all its works and flaws and all the complaints we make, kind of less cooperative, at least the way it's worked in the past, maybe it doesn't work this way going forward. But at least the way it's worked in the past, it's offered up a really good level playing relatively level playing field, equal access transparent marketplace for us to access kind of for sale by agent listings in the marketplace. And so because we're connected to these MLSs, we have a full view of the for-sale inventory in the market. And ever since we have had MLS listings that hasn't changed over time.  On top of all of that, let's call it, commodity listings information that we have, we add to it a whole bunch of non-commodity listings information in the form of for-sale by owners that are oftentimes proprietary to our sites in a different market as well as quite a number, a large number of rental listings that oftentimes are unique to our market place. And so combined, that alloy creates a relatively unique listings asset that is only strengthening over time. In the event that fragments, as I said, the world gets kind of messy and difficult for regular consumers and partners alike. But Zillow, of course, like we've done in the past, will run off and secure the most inventory in the world. We will get it.  Now how the business model works in that situation? Is it, we have several we have a lot of experience with paid inclusion business models, okay? And it will likely move to a paid inclusion business model. I don't know how to answer your specific rate question. You're saying, what would the rate look like in that world versus the rate that the industry is taking now other than to point you with the market cap per capita of the leading real estate portals in the U.S. versus, say, Australia or another market. And you'll see pretty quickly that the amount of value, at least in the form of market cap that's being captured by those companies is meaningfully higher than what we've been able to achieve is the leading portal here in the U.S. We see that as obviously as potential upside. But once again, we want to monetize in this industry in a way that is win- win. We want to win for consumers we want to win for our partners, and we want to win for ourselves. We think the most durable business model is where all three of those parties win. Did I leave anything out? Okay. Thanks, Lloyd. Maybe I'll begin, Jeremy Wacksman, and then hand it over to you. Lloyd, I guess what I'd say is we just don't think it's likely that like taking a giant hammer to the hundreds of MLSs around the country and how that legislatively regulatorily or legally would happen would be a pretty difficult thing. And so I guess there's a ton of value provided by having an integrated marketplace where most consumers and partners can see everything on the market. And while many industry participants may have forgotten that benefit, we believe that if, as things begin to fragment, they will remember that benefit. So anyway, we see this as unlikely. So I honestly don't want to give it a ton more airtime other than to say, if it happens, we're really well positioned. On the showcase thing, that is a big giant new TAM that we're going after, and I'll hand it over to Wacksman to chat about how that's going and the potential we see. Hey, Ron. We're not seeing any impact really from the noise out there other than posting great results and making great progress against our growth pillars as we've been chatting about on this call. I think the way we inoculate ourselves from having to over focus on competition is by really focusing on building awesome software for our users and our customers and our partners and software that solves real customer pain points like the interactive floor plans and 3D virtual walk-throughs and real-time booking and to come out for rental applications and more, and we are actually adding Follow Up Boss now, which is really quite a beloved CRM in the -- with a lot of customers in the agent space. So we believe that the way we win long term really is by creating, integrating seamlessly and creating the Super App for customers and a Super App for our partners. We like that it's hard. We like that it takes kind of mad software skills to do it. It's worked well. Focusing on this has worked well for us so far. We've cited a bunch of data on that, but not only do we have the biggest, most engaged audience, but 80% of it comes to us directly. We anticipate that will continue to work.  Maybe I'll throw to Jeremy Hoffman that last question and then we'll close. We really appreciate the thoughtful questions from, and we look forward to updating you as we plan on continuing to make progress along our growth pillars. Thank you very much for your continued trust and investment in Zillow. Talk to you soon."

            "name": "Jeremy Wacksman",
            "content": "Yes, happy to. Yes. Thanks, Brad. I mean, in a world where there are fewer dollars to go around. I mean, I think similar to what Rich said, we feel really well positioned, and we love our strategy. And I think the investments that we are making in tech and in the transaction itself and helping more customers becomes even more valuable for the most productive agents. As a reminder, our strategy is to partner with the best teams and agents, and as such, our partner base are those that are likely going to gain share from the part time or the less productive or effective agents and the participants in the marketplace that might find themselves even more challenged in a world like that. And then it's to hand those partners higher-intent customers, Rich talked a lot about our Super App strategy that is about driving higher intent, higher-quality customers, buyers and sellers in the process of transacting to those partners. And so touring, our financing experience, our Seller Services are all doing that and then helping those partners become more productive, close more deals and be able to be more efficient in a world powered by software. So we get pretty excited about the value and services we provide. And if there's a void in the industry because the dollars are challenged and the other providers are challenged, we get excited about our ability to fill that because we feel really confident the partner strategy we have would really grab share here. Yes. I mean, we continue to receive really great feedback about Listing Showcase from both consumers using the product and agents who have been part of our V1 and kind of early MVP rollout. As Rich mentioned, we're now live in 17 markets, and we're hard at work building out the feature set to enable us to scale. And that includes things like being able to offer it more flexibly different geographies have different density, different teams and agents have bigger and smaller businesses and how do we enable a go-to-market can serve all of them. I think as we talked about earlier this year, a big key to scale is ensuring that agents can bring their own photographers if they want. We provide a fantastic media service that captures all this great rich media. Rich talked about this interactive floor plan that is just such a unique and differentiated listening experience. It takes really well curated and trained media to do that, but enabling those photographers to do that when agents have a great photography workflow. And the acquisition we did at earlier this year is really to help scale that. So building out those capabilities is really the key to scale. You're right that there are some commonalities between agents focusing on how to market their listing for their seller and the international comp conversation. But we really think about Listing Showcase as much about helping listing agents grow their business. What listing agents tell us and what early users of showcase have told us is, this helps them win more listings. And that's how the product is discussed and used is when I'm sitting at the kitchen table, this is something I offer that other agents can't offer. This is why you should list with me. And so that economic value, in addition to helping the seller showcase their home, the best helps the agent showcase themselves, and so we get excited about really helping grow the listing side of our business through tools like that. We'll continue to update you as we make progress, but stay tuned for kind of expansion into more markets into next year. Yes. Thanks for the clarification. I mean the enhanced markets, the 9 that we're just now in, right? And so prior to this quarter, the 6 that we rolled out, it's a small percentage of overall connections, I want to say, in the teens maybe. And then what Jeremy Hoffman was alluding to is, obviously, a real-time touring experience is not going to be available on 100% of customers. Not every customer requests a tour and then not every customer agent relationship fits the eligibility criteria. So that's a bit why we gave the color that as we ramp into the, I think, 90-odd markets into \u201824 we expect that will cover about 10% of our customers. And again, it's not simple math. Different markets have different eligibility, different density, different ability to serve. We've talked a lot about the reason we're going market by market is because you're rolling out a new workflow for agents and teams and you're training them on a new experience, deliver for the customer ends up being great and we get great feedback from those agents because they're now meeting the customer where they want to be met, that appointment set is really when they want to get versus a request, as Rich talked about. And so the customer is happier and the work with rate, the number of times the agent can work with the customer goes up. And so those are all great indicators of transaction share gains and happier customer agent relationships. But it's not just this linear path of lighting up on more pages on the website, it is kind of market by market. Yes. And maybe just to add to that a bit. I think you should expect to see both, but you should expect to see us grow loan officer count as we scale origination volume into next year, but you should also expect us to see increases in productivity and efficiency, both on the customer experience, we've talked a lot in prior quarters about the huge opportunity we have with all of the customers that are coming to Zillow asking for financing questions and how can we help meet them where they are.  There's those that are ready to get a loan right now. There's those that are not. How do we help get them all an answer? As well as the customers coming from our great Premier Agents who know best when to ask them to get financing questions answered to go right and offer on a home. So lots of potential productivity gains there. And then there's also lots of great factory improvements that we're hard at work building and that's a lot of the investments we've been making to just help our loan officers our processors and our team get more efficient at being ready to handle the scale of volume that we want to bring. So short answer is you should expect to see both from us and both should contribute to growth into next year. No, I think that's right. I think it's you hit it earlier to the largest and most engaged audience using great products and services across both multi- and single-family listings. Some macro helps in terms of occupancy rates decreasing and more supply in the market means the advertisers need our high-quality customers. And so you're seeing the team execute to drive a lot of revenue growth there across the marketplace as a whole. And we get really excited about that growth continuing. And again, the Rentals business, great business, fast-growing business, a bigger part of our business, as Rich talked about, but also incredibly strategic as half of those renters are thinking about buying and half of those renters are some of the most affordability challenge first-time homebuyers that will be ready for VHL and our great PA someday as the macro normalizes there. So incredibly great business, growing really fast, teams executing really well and super strategic for us long term.  And then on Showcase, how many advertisers or agents, I think, was your question, how many agents are incremental. I mean it's a mix and intentionally so. And I think as we scale it beyond the initial markets, we expect to see that, be interesting to learn how that mix pans out. You can imagine, similar to our overall strategy when Listing Showcase helps great agents and teams grow their business, and it's a business grow driver for them.  You find them that look like are great Premier Agents today that want to use it, but you also find new customers who were less interested in the products that Premier Agent has to offer, really interested in using Listing Showcases a way to grow their business. So we're pleased with the early mix. It wasn't, there's not any sort of intentional target there. For us, it's really more about learning with partners this early MVP and V1 as we're building V2 and getting ready for scale."

Thanks for dialing in today. We're excited to share our second quarter results and speak to the progress we've made on our growth strategy since we last spoke in May. You've heard me say many times that 2023 is a crucial year for Zillow. As the year progresses, we're pleased with what we've accomplished thus far. Second quarter revenue of $506 million surpassed the high end of our outlook by $27 million and returned to slightly positive year-over-year growth. and EBITDA of $111 million surpassed the top end of our outlook by $30 million. This outperformance compared to our outlook continues to be driven by a combination of progress we've made since reorienting the company in early 2022, are focused on cost management and relative macro tailwinds as we navigate the ongoing poor housing market. As we gain to the results with you this quarter, we are particularly pleased that our residential revenue outpaced the broader real estate market decline of 22% and by 1,900 basis points, marking 4 consecutive quarters of outperformance. As you will recall from the investor deck we shared in early 2022, we believe approximately 25% of all actual U.S. homebuyers sought a Premier Agent partner in the previous year, yet we estimated that only 3% of home buyers and sellers ultimately transacted with us, a major opportunity gap to be bridged. We framed our solution to focus on growing customer transaction share, the Zillow Housing Super App. Our big strategy bet with the super app is that customers and partners alike want and need a much more digital convenient and integrated housing transaction. And that Zillow is likely the only company in the industry with the technical skills, the audience reach and partner network to pull it off. We are clearly making progress on this long runway growth strategy. We will continue to invest and prioritize for a steady drumbeat of features and services for both customers and partners which should set us up for long-term profitable growth. Our super app investment manifests in 5 growth pillars we talk about frequently with you all but it also shows up in the core day-to-day work which is a result of having our 6,000 employees orient around the same goal: to increase our share of customer transactions. Since we have made transactions such an important focus for us, we have learned a great deal about our customer experience, far beyond what we ever knew when we were purely a lead-gen focused company. We've spoken before about the significant investments in improving our customer funnel. We are making numerous incremental improvements in an effort to capture more customer demand and connect more of that demand to our partner network which has resulted in better-than-expected connections in Premier Agent. Additionally, we continue to see significant value in giving more customers the option to tour homes as the key call to action on our apps and sites which is also driving this relative outperformance. One additional boon to us, first-time homebuyers make up a larger relative share of buyers in the market today. This benefits us because we have a richer mix of first-time homebuyers. Before someone is the first-time home buyer, they are often a renter, with over 11 million rental households moving each year we continue to invest in Zillow's rental marketplace to integrate and streamline the experience while driving customer preference for Zillow's rental products. We are building a comprehensive marketplace of rental listings and integrating and experience that guides renters all the way through completing their rental transactions and supporting subsequent interactions with their landlord or property manager. Rentals revenue grew 28% year-over-year. This growth was driven by organic efforts, signing up more multifamily properties and attracting more single-family listings with limited marketing dollars. In May of last year, Zillow regained its spot as the number one most visited rentals platform according to comScore and we have widened our lead since then, putting us in a strong position for future revenue growth. We intend to differentiate our marketplace on quality of experience, building out a one-stop suite of landlord tools to attract unique supply while simultaneously investing to deliver a more seamless housing super app experience for rentals customers and partners. All of the positive performance we've seen across our business this quarter is supported by a healthy top of funnel relative to the weak housing market and consistent organic traffic to our apps and sites. From our earliest days, we prioritized the product itself as the most critical part of the marketing mix, delivering product innovations that empower and serve our customers. Our product-centric approach has served us well, driving favorable word-of-mouth marketing and strong brand recognition. Currently, more than 80% of our traffic comes directly to us which is rare and good. Another critical belief we have that underlines our housing super app strategy is the importance of our mobile app as the key interface to our customers. We were an early mobile developer back when the iPhone was released in 2007 and have been investing ever since. As a result, nearly half of our business today are in our lovely Zillow app, where people dream, shop, buy, sell, rent and finance. This has made us the leading real estate app in sight in the U.S. according to comScore. The direct branded relationship we have with our customers will serve us well into the future. We spoke last quarter about how we're thinking about AI as its potential to influence how people use digital services to accomplish countless tasks in their lives. While the initial wave of splashy headlines playing on AI hopes and fears have waned a bit, our belief in its importance to our future has not. We are energized about AI's potential to drive efficiencies and improve the experience of our customers, our Premier Agent partners, our loan officers and our employees. Understanding the opportunity here, we've deployed several work streams across the company to improve the experience of all 4 of these key constituencies. Today, we are in the rapid exploration phase and we already see how AI will be fundamental in accelerating our business. Before I talk through the progress we've made in the last quarter on our product road map, allow me to rearticulate the goal of Zillow's housing super app strategy to increase engagement customer transactions and revenue per customer transaction by investing across 5 growth pillars: touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services. The expected output of this strategy is to grow our share of customer transactions from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025. We continue to emphasize that 2023 is a year of execution. Through midyear, I am pleased to report that we have been steadily rolling out products and services across our 5 growth pillars and integrating them to create an increasingly seamless experience for customers and partners alike. To begin our product road map update, I'll start with financing. This remains an important investment for us for obvious reasons. Nearly 80% of homes purchased are financed with a mortgage, 40% of all homebuyers start their journey shopping for a mortgage, 80% of those don't yet have an agent; and almost all of those mortgage seekers use Zillow. We are building the foundation for a substantial first-party direct-to-consumer purchase mortgage origination business, seamlessly integrated with our extensive Premier Agent partner network. We've spoken about the 2 ways in which customers connect with Zillow Home Loans; property first and financing first. I'll start with financing first, the -- as the entry point for Zillow Home Loans which is when customers start their moving journey by getting prequalified before they are connected to an agent. We are making good progress on integrating our mortgage experience into the Zillow app, helping customers better understand what they can afford and to easily get preapproved before they meet a Premier Agent partner. Additionally, we are continuing to refine our ability to better connect our transaction-ready customers to one of our ZHL loan officers as quickly as possible. Lastly, we are building tools for our loan officers to make their experience easier when working with customers. All of this work is resulting in higher loan officer efficiency and a better overall customer experience. I'll now switch over to the property first entry point which is when our Zillow Home Loans lead comes back to us from a Premier Agent partner who is working with a home shopping customer we had previously sent them. Here, we are focused on building great technology for our Premier Agent partners and ZHL loan officers to bolster efficiencies and ensure a quality transaction experience. Equally important, we are focused on building a deep relationship between our ZHL loan officers and our Premier Agent partners so that together, they can provide the best possible service to our shared customers. Consistent with last quarter, we are seeing roughly 1 in 3 Premier Agent partners in our enhanced markets to connect customers to Zillow Home Loans, up from roughly 1 in 5 in Q4 2022. Suffice it to say, we are working hard on our financing growth pillar and a deep integration of Zillow Home Loans into our customer and partner experiences. I'm pleased to share that as a result of all our efforts, we are reporting 73% year-over-year growth in purchase loan origination volume and 30% growth sequentially from Q1, all in the context of a lousy mortgage market. I'll now speak about touring which continues to be one of our big bets because our data shows that movers who request a tour convert to buyers at 3x the rate of other actions on Zillow. This past quarter, we've continued to iterate and improve our real-time touring products showing time. We began by shipping new software across the industry that enabled real-time touring functionality. We then began to train our Premier Agent partners lighting up real-time touring on a market-by-market basis allowing eligible buyers to get a tour confirmed quickly with much less friction. I'm pleased to share that we've now rolled out real-time touring in all 6 of our enhanced markets, including Charlotte and Durham. Further, to accelerate the rollout of real-time touring, we've begun launching outside of our enhanced markets, including the 4 additional locations this quarter. As we are continuing to invest in product improvements to enhance the experience, for example, agents now have expanded self-service tour management capabilities at their fingertips, including the ability to reschedule or view subsequent tours in the ShowingTime app and book multi-property tours. These incremental improvements contribute to a meaningful upgrade from the antiquated game of 3-legged phone tag still being used by many customers and agents to schedule home tours. Real-time touring, combined with other initiatives in our enhanced markets, is improving our funnel and driving meaningful improvements to our ability to connect higher-intent customers to our Premier Agent partners contributing to the enhanced market outperformance that Jeremy will discuss in more detail shortly. I'll now move on to the final pillar of our product road map update, Seller Solutions. We're working to provide sellers and listing agents with tech-enabled products and services that make it easier for people to move. Last fall, we began talking about our product we're developing to differentiate listing agents on Zillow through branding and higher quality listings that look unlike anything else that exists in real estate today. I'm pleased to share that in June, we launched listing showcase by ShowingTime+ in select markets. We're excited about this product for a number of reasons. First, by targeting sellers and listing agents directly, we are expanding our serviceable addressable market, increasing our opportunity to grow customer transaction share and diversifying our business model. Second, it's great for consumers, buyers and sellers alike. Listing showcase offers sellers a differentiated listing experience that rises above the rest giving buyers richer tech-enabled insights into the homes layout and features. Finally, it's giving agents across the industry, not just Premier Agent partners an opportunity to elevate their professional brand to help them win more business. It's early days but we are optimistic. Initial feedback in demand has been strong from listing agents across the industry who are eager to learn and try out this innovative new offering. We are planning to roll out more markets over the course of this year and we'll provide more details in the coming months. We've also made progress on our other selling solutions offerings, our partnership with Opendoor which allows sellers on Zillow to request a cash offer from Opendoor is live in 25 markets as of today, compared to the 2 markets we launched initially in February. As I think about the progress we're making in the business, I'm pleased with how we have managed even as so much remains out of our control. Mortgage rates are staying higher for longer than previously expected and continued to be volatile, resulting in would be sellers hesitating to move due to their attractive legacy lower rate mortgages. This is having a more pronounced effect on sales volumes during the typically strong summer moving season. Demand has held up better than supply, driving inventory to record lows and supporting prices despite affordability headwinds. With low existing home inventory, the new construction is a bright spot, adding new supply to help meet some of the demand and growing the overall housing stock. Our new construction marketplace experienced strong growth again in Q2. Additionally, the rental market is adding record levels of new supply which has lowered occupancy rates and driven landlord demand for rental advertising contributing to 28% year-over-year growth in rentals revenue for us this quarter. The housing market outlook continues to be frustratingly foggy and we can only plan for it to take time to normalize. Volumes remained stubbornly low but we continue to have confidence that this is not some new normal and that we will get back to approximately 6 million units a year over time. To close, I'll reiterate how pleased I am with our progress this year. We're navigating well through a tough housing macro environment that is not in our control, maintaining our focus on what we can control, steady progress across our growth pillars and prudent cost management as we work towards driving profitable growth for our business. With that, I will now pass the line over to Jeremy Hofmann, who many of you already know from his 6-year tenure at Zillow which saw him rapidly increase his leadership scope to include Corp Dev, Strategy business operations, investor relations, government relations and now Olive Finance as CFO. Welcome to the microphone in Jeremy.\nJeremy Hofmann: Thanks, Rich. Great to be on the call with you all and looking forward to connecting in the coming weeks and months. Given this is my first earnings call, I want to set the table for what I'm going to cover. First, I will go into additional details about our Q2 results and our Q3 outlook for continued strong relative outperformance versus the real estate industry. Then I want to provide new transparency on our cost structure and how we plan to manage costs going forward, including share-based compensation, with our intent to be a profitable growth company. Last, I will provide some clarity on our capital management strategy, including plans for further improvement to the quality of our already strong balance sheet. In Q2, we delivered total revenue of $506 million, $41 million above the midpoint of our outlook. This revenue outperformance drove $40 million of EBITDA outperformance as well. Our costs were in line with our expectations and we were able to flow revenue through directly to EBITDA, showing the high incremental margin business that we have today. Total revenue returned to positive year-over-year growth albeit slightly so compared to the $504 million we did a year ago. On a GAAP basis, net loss was $35 million in Q2 and net loss as a percentage of revenue was 7%. EBITDA of $111 million resulted in a 22% EBITDA margin. Residential revenue was $380 million, down 3% year-over-year, outperforming the high end of our outlook range. Our residential revenue performance was 1,900 basis points above the industry decline of 22%, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Our relative outperformance continues to be driven by delivering better-than-expected number of customer connections to our Premier Agent partners and favorable tailwinds relative to the industry that Rich discussed earlier. We estimate that over the past few quarters, approximately half of our outperformance has been driven by actions taken by us and approximately half has been from relative macro influence. As Rich discussed, our ongoing investments in our top of funnel and mid-funnel experiences are paying off. Rentals revenue increased 28% year-over-year. Rentals traffic grew 15% year-over-year to 31 million average monthly rental unique visitors per comScore. This industry-leading rentals traffic drove 21% year-over-year growth in the number of multifamily properties on our apps and sites. We also continue to see industry tailwinds with occupancy rates declining from historically high levels, highlighting the need for landlords to advertise their vacant rental properties with us. Mortgages revenue was $24 million, with purchased loan origination volumes growing 30% sequentially from Q1 and 73% year-over-year. Further, total origination revenue returned to positive year-over-year growth as we lap the slowdown in refinance activity from early 2022. In Q2, we delivered a 50% increase in loan officer productivity compared to Q4 2022 based on the number of locked loans. We are adding new tools and capabilities for customers, agents and our loan officers that we expect to drive further efficiency improvements in the quarters ahead. Given this progress, we plan to increase our number of loan officers in the coming months, while we closely monitor operational efficiencies. New construction revenue growth was also strong during Q2, increasing 18% year-over-year as customers turn to new construction homes given the limited existing home inventory. Earlier this week, we also announced that Zillow will be the exclusive provider of new construction listings content on Redfin and we look forward to serving our mutual customers. With the largest selection of new construction communities of all real estate websites in the U.S., we expect our new construction marketplace to benefit with increased connections with prospective shoppers. EBITDA expenses totaled $395 million, in line with our Q2 outlook with cost of revenue slightly higher than expected, primarily due to higher revenue and select operating expenses slightly lower as a result of favorable headcount and advertising expenses. It is worth noting that share-based compensation expense this quarter was $130 million, up from $103 million in Q1. Approximately $17 million of the sequential increase was driven by the impact of departing personnel as well as the impact of our March 2023 annual employee grants. We ended Q2 with $3.3 billion of cash and investments, down slightly from Q1 which includes the benefit of net cash provided by operating activities, as well as the impact of $150 million in share repurchases during the quarter. Convertible debt was $1.7 billion at the end of Q2. Turning to our outlook for Q3. We expect total revenue to be between $458 million to $486 million, implying a year-over-year decline of 2% at the midpoint of our outlook range. We expect residential revenue to be between $339 million to $359 million, down 6% year-over-year at the midpoint of our outlook range, as compared to our estimate for an industry transaction dollar decline between 15% and 20% year-over-year in Q3. Note that we expect a total industry decline of 17% and at the midpoint of the range to nominally improve compared to the Q2 decline of 22%. Homeowners locked into their current mortgage rates are having an impact on the normal seasonality of move-up buyers who typically move between school years. Despite the challenging macro environment of higher for longer mortgage rates, we expect to continue to outperform the industry in Q3. We expect the investments we have made in our funnel will continue to deliver benefits in Q3 while experiencing less relative macro tailwinds versus previous quarters. For Premier Agent, we estimate revenue will decline between 4% to 9% year-over-year. As the macro backdrop remains choppy, we continue to focus on the inputs we can control, adding value to our customers and shipping great products and services. Despite the tough macro existing home sales environment, our customer connections with Premier Agents have been nearly flat year-over-year for the combined past 2 months. That said, we do remain cautious that buyers will find it difficult to buy homes with such low inventory levels and our outlook reflects this dynamic. For Q3, we expect EBITDA to be between $67 million to $87 million, implying a 16% margin at the midpoint of our outlook range. Consistent with the outlook that we provided at the end of Q1, we expect Q3 EBITDA expenses to be flat compared to Q2. We are announcing today that we closed on the acquisition of ARIA, a leading software provider to real estate photographers across the country. ARIA's platform capabilities and network of third-party real estate photographers will help enable us to scale ShowingTime's listing showcase product. Separately, in late June, we announced the sunsetting of Zillow Closing Services. As it did not have the tech forward and integrated product we believe customers and partners need, having originally been built for our iBuying effort. That said, integrating the real estate transaction to make buying and selling simpler for customers remains our core strategy. We are actively exploring other title and ester solutions and we'll follow up when we have more details to share. Next, as I discussed in my introduction, I want to dive deeper into providing new transparency on a few topics. I will start with our cost structure. Given the uncertain macro environment and the associated challenges with accurately forecasting revenue, we want to be more explicit with investors regarding how we plan to manage our cost structure moving forward. We evaluate costs in 3 categories: fixed, variable and advertising. Our fixed cost run rate is approximately $1.1 billion annually. Over the past 18 months, we have forward invested and believe we are currently around the right level of fixed cost to execute on the opportunities we see ahead. Looking ahead, we do not expect to materially expand our current fixed cost structure as we scale our current growth initiatives. Our variable cost run rate is approximately $400 million annually. While we expect variable costs to grow as we scale our business, we intend to drive operating leverage over time as we expand new product areas and we'll continue to seek unit economic efficiencies across the business. We continually look for efficiencies in our variable cost structure, a muscle we have been building for a while now. To that end, I wanted to share a few examples. I already mentioned that Zillow Home Loans loan officer productivity improved 50% from Q4 of last year. We have also improved our Premier Agent cost per connection by 29% since 2020. Last, our cost per floor plan annotation on our virtual touring technology has dropped by 78% and since the beginning of 2022. These are just 3 of many examples we have of ensuring that we are getting more and more efficient with our variable cost base. Next is advertising. We believe we have been effective users of advertising dollars for a long time and have dialed up and down spend depending on the environment and opportunities we see to build awareness and drive growth. We will continue to assess advertising levels with that same lens, separate and distinct from the rest of our fixed cost base. Another important part of our cost structure is share-based compensation which we manage on a cost per employee basis, while closely monitoring dilution. We recognize that share-based compensation as a percentage of revenue has been high recently, as macro housing weakness is pressuring revenue, at the same time we are forward investing to drive future growth. Going forward, as we manage our fixed headcount and deliver on our strategic revenue growth plans, we expect to leverage our share-based compensation to enable investors to see GAAP profitability over time. Additionally, we would expect those same factors to result in a higher share price that would also further limit dilution. We believe deeply in aligning our employees' incentives with our shareholders, recognizing the importance of managing dilution along the way. Now turning to our capital structure. We have a strong balance sheet with cash and investments of $3.3 billion and net cash of $1.6 billion as of the end of Q2. We also have $1.7 billion of convertible senior notes which include our 2024's and 2026's that are callable when our stock price exceeds $56.56 [ph] per share for a specified period of trading base. To the extent our Class B share price rises above those levels, we may redeem those notes. If we do, it is our expectation that we will settle the $1.1 billion principal amount on the notes due in 2024 and 2026 in cash and settle any conversion premium in shares of Class C capital stock. Based on what we know today, we do not expect to engage the convertible markets to refinance any of our outstanding notes. Instead, we expect to be in a position where we have no outstanding debt on our balance sheet as these notes mature or become callable. We also announced today that our Board has approved an additional $750 million capital repurchase authorization, bringing our total available authorization to just over $1 billion, when combined with our $264 million existing authorization. In aggregate, we have repurchased $1.5 billion worth of shares and authorized $2.5 million worth of shares since the inception of our buyback program in late 2021. Going forward, we will continue to carry some cash for risk management purposes, some cash for potential inorganic and organic investment dry powder and opportunistically consider share repurchases from operating cash flow. Now I'm going to give an update on our transaction share in our enhanced markets. In early 2022, we shared our strategy to capture what we continue to believe is a significant opportunity to drive growth by moving down funnel and focusing on the housing transaction itself. This included our plans to increase our share of customer transactions and revenue per transaction. We believe we are making good progress and have the right products in the pipeline to be successful. As evidence, while we called out the industry decline of 22% in Q2, our national connection volumes are nearly flat year-over-year on a combined basis over the past few months. Furthermore, in our 4 enhanced markets, we are seeing significant year-over-year connections growth. And while we are still in early days with product rollout, I am pleased to share that in Q2, we saw 50% year-over-year customer transaction share growth in Phoenix and Atlanta which are our most mature enhanced markets. To date, we believe this outsized performance is being driven by a combination of partner selection, early success in real-time touring and financing and buoyed by the relative macro tailwinds we are seeing across the business. We think this is a good proof point that gives us confidence to roll out more enhanced markets which we announced today. As more data becomes available, we will continue to share. It is important to call out that while we are working on our big future growth drivers, we have delivered meaningful revenue outperformance compared to the industry for the last 4 quarters and expect to do so again in Q3, evidence that we are gaining share after a challenging first half of 2022. As you have all heard from us before, 2022 was a year where we restrategized and reorganized around our Housing Super App vision. 2023 is a year for us to release new products and test in various markets, setting us up for further scaling in 2024 and 2025. Halfway through the year, we are pleased with how 2023 is progressing with a lot of work to do ahead. As we look forward, my top priority as CFO is to ensure that Zillow is a profitable growth company, resulting in outsized value to our shareholders. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's Katie [ph] on for Lloyd today. Just a quick question on the Opendoor partnership last quarter, Open announced that your partnership has been launching 5 markets. I know you guys said 2 in Feb. Now we're at 25. Is there any update on the rollout and progress you're seeing so far? Any color you guys can give us there?\nJeremy Wacksman: This is Jeremy Wacksman. I'll take that one. Yes, as Rich talked about earlier, we're now live in 25 markets, up from the 2 in February. And on top of that, in our Seller Solutions growth pillar, we just announced and have launched listing showcase by ShowingTime+ in our select markets. So we're really pleased with the expansion and coverage of our seller solutions. As Rich talked about, increasing our service addressable market to the sell side and sellers who become buyers as well as accessing more types of agents, not just from your agents and listing agents, across those solutions. So more to come in the future quarters but we're pleased with the continued progress there.\nOperator: We now turn to Brad Erickson with RBC.\nBradley Erickson: I just had a couple. The first, you obviously talked a lot about the share gains in the letter and here in the prepared remarks. Just for what we're seeing right now, I guess, just in the report and the guide, can you just unpack that a little bit more in terms of the factors that you're viewing as maybe a sustainable versus maybe not as sustainable or at least out of your control? That's the first one. And then second, you called out the accelerating the rollout of real-time touring. Just curious what that does to the mix of leads that you're sending out or if it changes at all? And just curious if that's something we could see contribute to those share gains here going forward. Just talk about the effect of the mix of touring leads that has on the PA business.\nJeremy Hofmann: Yes. Thanks, Brad. It's Jeremy Hofmann. I'll take the first one and then hand it to Jeremy Wacksman for the second one. On the outperformance, I think, similar to prepared remarks, it's roughly 50% in our control that is driving the outside share gains and 50% relative tailwinds. On our side, it's a ton of little actions that add up with a funnel that's as big as ours and then we're getting benefit from touring as a prominent call to action. So the more touring that folks see on the sites and apps the more than it makes up more of our connections, the better off we are and are seeing our performance as a result of that. On the macro side, it is the fact that there's more first-time homebuyers as a mix of all homebuyers. So those are sort of the dynamics that we see at play. Like I said in the prepared remarks, I think we expect the macro to be less helpful but we are still projecting 1,100 basis points of outperformance at the midpoint. So that gives you a sense for the -- how we feel about the investments we're making and the ability for us to keep improving our funnel. So that's that one and then I'll hand it to Jeremy for the other.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. And Brad, on real-time touring, as Rich said, we've been over time, increasing tour exposure on Zillow nationally, while also building real-time touring in our enhanced markets. And so both of those things contribute to our part of the share gain that's in our control. And so on the national, that's just about removing friction in the funnel, getting more customers interested and aware of a tour and then when they want to book a tour, making that easier for them. And then in real-time touring specifically, that is now in our enhanced market that we announced is coming to more markets, that's really about creating that reservation like system for a buyer to remove entire steps in the funnel and be able to book a tour when they want to go see it more often. And we continue to improve that product as well, right? We're expanding our product offerings, agents can now expand their self-service to our management capabilities, rescheduling and viewing and then booking subsequent tours are all features we're adding. So these are all things that we're hearing feedback from customers and partners that has been on our product road map that we're excited to get into market. So we're improving the product while also scaling and rolling out the product to more customers and partners.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ron Josey with Citi.\nRonald Josey: Maybe I wanted to get in a little bit more on just expanding the number of markets. I think you talked about Charlotte and Durham, North Carolina. Talk about just the process of expanding that -- expanding newer markets, how we think about newer markets going forward? And then, Jeremy, I heard earlier, I think you said loan officer delivered 50% increase in productivity versus 4Q '22. Just any insights on that would be helpful.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. This is -- on the first one on enhanced markets, I mean nothing further than what we announced today which is we're adding 2 more markets to our enhanced markets and rolling those out now. So Charlotte and Durham. And the other thing I think Rich talked about was also bringing real-time touring to 4 markets beyond those. So while we're not bringing the entire enhanced market playbook to those next 4 markets, real time touring is coming first and we're doing that because as we've talked to you all about before, we want to expand these capabilities as we can. And as we are getting the playbook and the technology right for real-time touring, we're able to bring that to more partners and try more things versus the entire enhanced market playbook. So that's on the touring part. And then remind me your second question.\nRichard Barton: Loan productivity.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. I mean it's a combination of a couple of things. One, it's about just continuing to help find higher-intent customers. As Rich talked about, we have so many mortgage shoppers on our site because 40% of all homebuyers want to start with that question but they're all in different stages. And so helping those folks as they raise their hand and start to ask questions with things like our personalized payment experience and our prequalification system, helping find the right customers and get the right customers to our loan officers is one big piece of it. And then just tools in the factory, we're releasing products and services so that our loan officers can more efficiently work with our customer, working in fewer systems, being able to do more digitally real-time while on the phone with the customer and not having to call them back. All those things help them be a better consultant, a better adviser and that leads to conversion gains but also just leads to productivity and efficiency gains.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Two questions, please. And I'm sorry if you already touched on these. But talk about the puts and takes to getting EBITDA margins. Once we get back into growth mode, hopefully, at some point, the macro and company-specific, hopefully, we get back into that sustained growth mode. Getting the EBITDA margins for the business as a whole back up to 30%, 30% to maybe 40%. So the biggest drivers there, what you can control, what you can't? And then, if I could just stick on the enhanced markets. And is there any evidence yet, maybe it's too soon but is there any evidence in that those enhanced markets that you're actually gaining share of transactions in those markets? Trying to figure out whether there's something we can extrapolate to the rest of the country, if you're successful in those markets.\nJeremy Hofmann: Yes, Mark, it's Jeremy Hofmann. I can answer your first one and probably take your second as well. On the first one on EBITDA margin drivers, yes, we feel good about our ability to get to those levels as we drive revenue and leverage our cost structure over time. I think we are making progress in a number of places and believe that we have a highly leverageable cost base. So as we drive revenue, we believe that will flow through. And you saw that in the performance this quarter, right? We outperformed substantially on revenue and it flowed through to EBITDA. So feel really good there about our ability to drive that over time. And then on the share gains question, I mentioned in my prepared remarks but I'll say it again here. We -- in Q2, we saw 50% year-over-year customer transaction share gains in Phoenix and Atlanta which are our 2 most mature enhanced markets. So it's obviously early days. There's a lot more markets to come from here. We're going to be methodical about rolling those out but it is a great proof point to say, hey, the strategy feels like it is working early days.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan McKeveny with Zelman & Associates.\nRyan McKeveny: A question on the residential outperformance versus the industry. I'll ask it a bit different way than Brad's question before. So if we isolate to the half of the outperformance that is kind of secular it's the benefits of the changes you've made or some of the newer initiatives, I know you don't speak to the exact breakdown between transactions on the buy side and the sell side. But can you talk to us about how that incremental penetration is trending between those categories buy side, sell side? And I guess is it happening in both areas or are one of the 2 aspects driving things more so than the other at this point in time?\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. I think on buy side versus sell side, I mean we don't tease it out specifically, especially in the incremental which I think is what your question is about. But primarily most of our transactions to date are buy side, right? And so the share gains you're seeing, the relative outperformance you're seeing is all mostly coming from the buy side. And you heard that from Rich and Jeremy, that's one part friction removal and higher-quality customers getting to higher-quality partners and one part relative macro tailwinds with the buyer mix. That said, we are really excited about our ability to gain and see more share gains as we layer in seller solutions as well, right, both between our multiple selling offerings, experience for our customers, right, introducing them to an open door offer if they're interested or a Premier Agent partner if they want and Showcase, Listing Showcase which we just launched this quarter which Rich talked a bunch about as well. So we expect share gains and customer transactions to come from both over time, even though right now, we're seeing the benefits of our own efforts and macro efforts primarily on the buy side.\nRyan McKeveny: That's helpful. And for Jeremy Hofmann, congrats on the new role. And yes, I appreciate the extra color, especially around the cost structure. I guess, teasing it out a little, so the fixed cost run rate around kind of the right levels at this point. Is that to suggest that on the mortgage side of the business, kind of the infrastructure, the fixed costs associated with the mortgage lending operation is in a pretty good spot today to scale over time? Or could that remain a potential area of investment, whereas maybe some of the other segments see some more cost rationalization? Yes, just curious how that overall comment might tie directly to what's going on in the mortgage side of things.\nJeremy Hofmann: Yes. Ryan, it's a good question. On the fixed cost side, we do feel pretty good about the amount of infrastructure we have in place for mortgage. That's to say over the next couple of years. And of course, as it grows, we'll see. But based on the current plan, we feel pretty good about the fixed cost. On the variable side, we will grow costs there because that means we're hiring loan officers but that's obviously a good thing so long as we're manufacturing loans profitably. But on the fixed side, yes, we feel pretty good on the mortgage side. And then on the overall business, I'd say, we feel like the fixed cost investment we've made to date should serve us well for the current growth initiatives we have.\nOperator: We now turn to Tom White with D.A. Davidson.\nThomas White: Maybe first one for Jeremy H. First off, congrats on the new role. The cost structure commentary, again, super helpful. On the variable expenses, you gave some examples of kind of recent efficiencies and progress. Could you maybe update us on what parts of Zillow's business today represent kind of maybe the biggest opportunity to drive further efficiencies and variable expenses? And then, maybe one for Rich on Zillow Closing Services being sunsetted. Just curious to hear you talk about maybe how you envision Zillow disrupting kind of the title and escrow space. Clearly, there would appear to be opportunities to make it a more transparent, better experience for customers but just be curious to see how you view Zillow participating there?\nJeremy Hofmann: Yes. So I'll take the first one. Good question. I think we're looking for efficiencies all over the business, our most mature businesses to the ones that are newest. I would say the biggest opportunities for us on the variable efficiencies are the newest products over time, right? So between mortgage, seller services, those should get leverage as we scale. But those are the places where we are most focused ensuring we're getting efficiency as those products come into life. And then I'll push to Rich on the second question.\nRichard Barton: Only because you asked me directly, Tom. And I haven't spoken yet in the Q&A. So thank you for including me. Yes. So we sunsetted ZCS now because we don't think title and escrow is important as part of the transaction but because we built that thing for Zillow Offers. And for our iBuying business and it wasn't -- it just wasn't the right solution for us with what we have envisioned now. I think Jeremy Hofmann in his prepared remarks, talked a bit about how we think it's an important thing. And to watch this space. We are working on alternatives right now. So watch this space. Anything to add, Jeremy Wacksman?\nJeremy Wacksman: No.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Camber with Stephens.\nJohn Campbell: Jeremy, I'd like echo as well, congrats on the promotion and the OpEx disclosures are very helpful. You guys have obviously torched your guidance in recent quarters. I'm thinking that you've probably set the stage here again. But the EBITDA, that's always going to hinge on obviously the top line. So I just maybe wanted to double-click on the Premier Agent guidance. mainly the industry forecast, it looks like you guys are baking in a down 15% to maybe down 20% year-over-year. It looks like the NAR is calling for down 7%. Fannie and MBA it looks like they averaged down 8%. So you guys are a little bit out there. I think that year-over-year decline also is implying that the market would drop a good bit sequentially off of what kind of already feels like trough levels at this stage. But my question here is, are you seeing something internally there that might signal softer trends from here? Or is that just a conservative approach against, I guess, the continuation of market uncertainty?\nJeremy Hofmann: Yes, it's a good question. We guided based on the best information that we have. And I think existing home sales an inventory just being as low as they are right now, puts us in a spot that we have to make the best information available that we have. We have internal economists that look at this every day. So really, given the best information that we have what we're most focused on, I would say, is ensuring that we continue to outperform the industry. So we're feeling quite good about the ability to outperform the last 4 quarters and we're guiding to outperform 1,100 basis points at midpoint to midpoint in PA versus the industry for Q3 as well.\nOperator: We now turn to Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Maybe a quick follow-up to Mark and Ron's questions on enhanced markets. Can you remind us what kind of things you're looking at or you're looking to see in locations to expand as an enhanced market? And then as your new products are aging in your first enhanced markets, are you seeing any changes in usage or agent behavior? Any dynamics to call out with respect to kind of enhanced market cohorts, if you will.\nJeremy Wacksman: Sure. Thanks, Brian. The things we're looking for in our enhanced markets are -- I mean, ultimately, the outputs or customer transaction share. And the indicators to that, I think we've talked to you all about before in the funnel are reducing the friction and so customer engagement and customer agent engagement and work with rates between those two. And so these things take a long time to mature, transactions take a long time but we watch those kind of mid-funnel indicators on both the customer side and the agent side. And as Jeremy Hofmann talked about, we're really pleased that we're seeing significant customer transaction share growth in our 2 oldest enhanced markets, even as we're early in seeing the benefits of the rollout of a bunch of those capabilities. So again, increased focus on partner quality and really aligning ourselves with partners that work more deeply with us across these product experiences, the rollout of real-time touring, the rollout of Zillow Home Loans and the rollout of seller solutions across all those things, we think is a recipe for success in the share growth you're seeing and that's why we have confidence is going to continue. And then in terms of what we think about going forward, that's why we've started to bring those to more markets even at the same time, while we're continuing to improve and mature the products themselves. We're not done building the things we're talking to you all about. We are building and deploying at the same time. And so, the capability improvements for both customers and our Premier Agent partners and our loan officers will continue, as you heard a bit from Rich and Jeremy about.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Dae K. Lee with JPMorgan.\nDae Lee: First one for Rich. A question on the [indiscernible] it sounds like you guys are exploring all of the options right now. But when you're looking at it from a near-term perspective, what we can achieve on those from a longer-term perspective? And then another question on the mass market. about market one with your 6% transaction and share target by any the need to be rolled out more broadly to all of your markets? Or are something that can be added in a smaller number of markets within [indiscernible]?\nRichard Barton: Dae, we -- I think we got the second question but you're -- we're having trouble with your audio a little bit. We didn't quite get the first question. Can you repeat it?\nDae Lee: Hopefully, this timing is better. First one was on AI. It looks like you guys are exploring all options. But when you look at the opportunity from a near-term perspective, where are you most excited about? And thinking for a longer-term perspective.\nRichard Barton: Yes. Okay, got it. Got it. All right. I'll take that and then maybe kick it to Jeremy Wacksman for the enhanced market. Can we go faster question. I mean, look, we see real opportunity. I mean, I think a lot of the excitement and imagination has been sparked at kind of the ultimate user interface opportunity. with generative AI and moving towards a conversational UI. And then how might that change the kind of historic physics of the Internet and that's fascinating to us and obviously, very important. I do think though that that is also going to be one of the longest lead time behavioral change ones. So we're exploring that aggressively and are quite interested in making sure we feel like we are really well situated from an audience brand and unique data perspective and leaning into it such that we don't somehow miss the boat and missed the memo on the change. So we feel good there but that's probably a longer lead time one. The stuff that we're seeing in the short term really is like engineer productivity, marketer productivity, a little slower will be legal and accounting. We're seeing -- we're already seeing some productivity gains for people on phones. So sales folks, partners, loan officers. It is early days but I think we'll probably see more progress more quickly on the engine room stuff than the exposed stuff. All right. So hopefully, that helps you. And then Jeremy Wacksman, maybe hit the wind-up faster but I do want to know that, too.\nJeremy Wacksman: How enhanced markets contribute to our ultimate share goals. And the way I think about it is it's a combination of national progress and local progress, right? And that's what you've seen from us the last couple of quarters. You've seen relative outperformance overall nationally which largely has not been from the benefits of the enhanced market and the growth pillars in enhanced markets. And then now you're starting to see the results and the progress we can get market by market. And so as we scale our enhanced market recipe to more markets, that will become a bigger contributor to our overall national footprint. But again, that doesn't mean we're not going to continue to keep working on improvements nationally and things that we don't need to take in and market. So, we really think about it as a combo of both. And that's why we're excited about the progress we've seen in the enhanced markets, the ability to bring some of these components to more markets and then as we mature the offerings and work with our partners, the share gains to continue.\nRichard Barton: And it feels like a long runway of opportunity. It feels like durable opportunity to us that we are attacking methodically. We kind of did a major reset in organization last year in 2022. And now you're seeing us both develop and engineer and launch new stuff across the board in enhanced markets and nationally. So this is kind of our year of execution and we're posting really good relative results. It's a terrible macro, housing macro and we can get really bummed out about that. But we internally are quite excited by our relative performance and the share gains we're seeing in our enhanced markets. The 1,900 basis points of outperformance for our residential revenue line item purchased mortgage business up 73% year-over-year in a crap mortgage market. we keep rolling out this real-time touring this real-time touring feature set that is really quite a game changer. And even rentals, like we're seeing 28% year-over-year growth. So internally, we it's tough weather outside but internally, I, for one, am really pleased at what I'm seeing. And I'm quietly reservably guardedly optimistic and excited as I look into the future, yes. I was assuming that that was the big wrap.\nOperator: This completes the time for questions. I'll now turn the call back over to Rich Barton for any closing remarks.\nRichard Barton: All right. I just did my big closing remark. Great chatting. Great chatting with you all. Thanks for making the time. We look forward to chatting with you soon. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, today's call is now concluded. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeremy Hofmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Rich. Great to be on the call with you all and looking forward to connecting in the coming weeks and months. Given this is my first earnings call, I want to set the table for what I'm going to cover. First, I will go into additional details about our Q2 results and our Q3 outlook for continued strong relative outperformance versus the real estate industry. Then I want to provide new transparency on our cost structure and how we plan to manage costs going forward, including share-based compensation, with our intent to be a profitable growth company. Last, I will provide some clarity on our capital management strategy, including plans for further improvement to the quality of our already strong balance sheet. In Q2, we delivered total revenue of $506 million, $41 million above the midpoint of our outlook. This revenue outperformance drove $40 million of EBITDA outperformance as well. Our costs were in line with our expectations and we were able to flow revenue through directly to EBITDA, showing the high incremental margin business that we have today. Total revenue returned to positive year-over-year growth albeit slightly so compared to the $504 million we did a year ago. On a GAAP basis, net loss was $35 million in Q2 and net loss as a percentage of revenue was 7%. EBITDA of $111 million resulted in a 22% EBITDA margin. Residential revenue was $380 million, down 3% year-over-year, outperforming the high end of our outlook range. Our residential revenue performance was 1,900 basis points above the industry decline of 22%, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Our relative outperformance continues to be driven by delivering better-than-expected number of customer connections to our Premier Agent partners and favorable tailwinds relative to the industry that Rich discussed earlier. We estimate that over the past few quarters, approximately half of our outperformance has been driven by actions taken by us and approximately half has been from relative macro influence. As Rich discussed, our ongoing investments in our top of funnel and mid-funnel experiences are paying off. Rentals revenue increased 28% year-over-year. Rentals traffic grew 15% year-over-year to 31 million average monthly rental unique visitors per comScore. This industry-leading rentals traffic drove 21% year-over-year growth in the number of multifamily properties on our apps and sites. We also continue to see industry tailwinds with occupancy rates declining from historically high levels, highlighting the need for landlords to advertise their vacant rental properties with us. Mortgages revenue was $24 million, with purchased loan origination volumes growing 30% sequentially from Q1 and 73% year-over-year. Further, total origination revenue returned to positive year-over-year growth as we lap the slowdown in refinance activity from early 2022. In Q2, we delivered a 50% increase in loan officer productivity compared to Q4 2022 based on the number of locked loans. We are adding new tools and capabilities for customers, agents and our loan officers that we expect to drive further efficiency improvements in the quarters ahead. Given this progress, we plan to increase our number of loan officers in the coming months, while we closely monitor operational efficiencies. New construction revenue growth was also strong during Q2, increasing 18% year-over-year as customers turn to new construction homes given the limited existing home inventory. Earlier this week, we also announced that Zillow will be the exclusive provider of new construction listings content on Redfin and we look forward to serving our mutual customers. With the largest selection of new construction communities of all real estate websites in the U.S., we expect our new construction marketplace to benefit with increased connections with prospective shoppers. EBITDA expenses totaled $395 million, in line with our Q2 outlook with cost of revenue slightly higher than expected, primarily due to higher revenue and select operating expenses slightly lower as a result of favorable headcount and advertising expenses. It is worth noting that share-based compensation expense this quarter was $130 million, up from $103 million in Q1. Approximately $17 million of the sequential increase was driven by the impact of departing personnel as well as the impact of our March 2023 annual employee grants. We ended Q2 with $3.3 billion of cash and investments, down slightly from Q1 which includes the benefit of net cash provided by operating activities, as well as the impact of $150 million in share repurchases during the quarter. Convertible debt was $1.7 billion at the end of Q2. Turning to our outlook for Q3. We expect total revenue to be between $458 million to $486 million, implying a year-over-year decline of 2% at the midpoint of our outlook range. We expect residential revenue to be between $339 million to $359 million, down 6% year-over-year at the midpoint of our outlook range, as compared to our estimate for an industry transaction dollar decline between 15% and 20% year-over-year in Q3. Note that we expect a total industry decline of 17% and at the midpoint of the range to nominally improve compared to the Q2 decline of 22%. Homeowners locked into their current mortgage rates are having an impact on the normal seasonality of move-up buyers who typically move between school years. Despite the challenging macro environment of higher for longer mortgage rates, we expect to continue to outperform the industry in Q3. We expect the investments we have made in our funnel will continue to deliver benefits in Q3 while experiencing less relative macro tailwinds versus previous quarters. For Premier Agent, we estimate revenue will decline between 4% to 9% year-over-year. As the macro backdrop remains choppy, we continue to focus on the inputs we can control, adding value to our customers and shipping great products and services. Despite the tough macro existing home sales environment, our customer connections with Premier Agents have been nearly flat year-over-year for the combined past 2 months. That said, we do remain cautious that buyers will find it difficult to buy homes with such low inventory levels and our outlook reflects this dynamic. For Q3, we expect EBITDA to be between $67 million to $87 million, implying a 16% margin at the midpoint of our outlook range. Consistent with the outlook that we provided at the end of Q1, we expect Q3 EBITDA expenses to be flat compared to Q2. We are announcing today that we closed on the acquisition of ARIA, a leading software provider to real estate photographers across the country. ARIA's platform capabilities and network of third-party real estate photographers will help enable us to scale ShowingTime's listing showcase product. Separately, in late June, we announced the sunsetting of Zillow Closing Services. As it did not have the tech forward and integrated product we believe customers and partners need, having originally been built for our iBuying effort. That said, integrating the real estate transaction to make buying and selling simpler for customers remains our core strategy. We are actively exploring other title and ester solutions and we'll follow up when we have more details to share. Next, as I discussed in my introduction, I want to dive deeper into providing new transparency on a few topics. I will start with our cost structure. Given the uncertain macro environment and the associated challenges with accurately forecasting revenue, we want to be more explicit with investors regarding how we plan to manage our cost structure moving forward. We evaluate costs in 3 categories: fixed, variable and advertising. Our fixed cost run rate is approximately $1.1 billion annually. Over the past 18 months, we have forward invested and believe we are currently around the right level of fixed cost to execute on the opportunities we see ahead. Looking ahead, we do not expect to materially expand our current fixed cost structure as we scale our current growth initiatives. Our variable cost run rate is approximately $400 million annually. While we expect variable costs to grow as we scale our business, we intend to drive operating leverage over time as we expand new product areas and we'll continue to seek unit economic efficiencies across the business. We continually look for efficiencies in our variable cost structure, a muscle we have been building for a while now. To that end, I wanted to share a few examples. I already mentioned that Zillow Home Loans loan officer productivity improved 50% from Q4 of last year. We have also improved our Premier Agent cost per connection by 29% since 2020. Last, our cost per floor plan annotation on our virtual touring technology has dropped by 78% and since the beginning of 2022. These are just 3 of many examples we have of ensuring that we are getting more and more efficient with our variable cost base. Next is advertising. We believe we have been effective users of advertising dollars for a long time and have dialed up and down spend depending on the environment and opportunities we see to build awareness and drive growth. We will continue to assess advertising levels with that same lens, separate and distinct from the rest of our fixed cost base. Another important part of our cost structure is share-based compensation which we manage on a cost per employee basis, while closely monitoring dilution. We recognize that share-based compensation as a percentage of revenue has been high recently, as macro housing weakness is pressuring revenue, at the same time we are forward investing to drive future growth. Going forward, as we manage our fixed headcount and deliver on our strategic revenue growth plans, we expect to leverage our share-based compensation to enable investors to see GAAP profitability over time. Additionally, we would expect those same factors to result in a higher share price that would also further limit dilution. We believe deeply in aligning our employees' incentives with our shareholders, recognizing the importance of managing dilution along the way. Now turning to our capital structure. We have a strong balance sheet with cash and investments of $3.3 billion and net cash of $1.6 billion as of the end of Q2. We also have $1.7 billion of convertible senior notes which include our 2024's and 2026's that are callable when our stock price exceeds $56.56 [ph] per share for a specified period of trading base. To the extent our Class B share price rises above those levels, we may redeem those notes. If we do, it is our expectation that we will settle the $1.1 billion principal amount on the notes due in 2024 and 2026 in cash and settle any conversion premium in shares of Class C capital stock. Based on what we know today, we do not expect to engage the convertible markets to refinance any of our outstanding notes. Instead, we expect to be in a position where we have no outstanding debt on our balance sheet as these notes mature or become callable. We also announced today that our Board has approved an additional $750 million capital repurchase authorization, bringing our total available authorization to just over $1 billion, when combined with our $264 million existing authorization. In aggregate, we have repurchased $1.5 billion worth of shares and authorized $2.5 million worth of shares since the inception of our buyback program in late 2021. Going forward, we will continue to carry some cash for risk management purposes, some cash for potential inorganic and organic investment dry powder and opportunistically consider share repurchases from operating cash flow. Now I'm going to give an update on our transaction share in our enhanced markets. In early 2022, we shared our strategy to capture what we continue to believe is a significant opportunity to drive growth by moving down funnel and focusing on the housing transaction itself. This included our plans to increase our share of customer transactions and revenue per transaction. We believe we are making good progress and have the right products in the pipeline to be successful. As evidence, while we called out the industry decline of 22% in Q2, our national connection volumes are nearly flat year-over-year on a combined basis over the past few months. Furthermore, in our 4 enhanced markets, we are seeing significant year-over-year connections growth. And while we are still in early days with product rollout, I am pleased to share that in Q2, we saw 50% year-over-year customer transaction share growth in Phoenix and Atlanta which are our most mature enhanced markets. To date, we believe this outsized performance is being driven by a combination of partner selection, early success in real-time touring and financing and buoyed by the relative macro tailwinds we are seeing across the business. We think this is a good proof point that gives us confidence to roll out more enhanced markets which we announced today. As more data becomes available, we will continue to share. It is important to call out that while we are working on our big future growth drivers, we have delivered meaningful revenue outperformance compared to the industry for the last 4 quarters and expect to do so again in Q3, evidence that we are gaining share after a challenging first half of 2022. As you have all heard from us before, 2022 was a year where we restrategized and reorganized around our Housing Super App vision. 2023 is a year for us to release new products and test in various markets, setting us up for further scaling in 2024 and 2025. Halfway through the year, we are pleased with how 2023 is progressing with a lot of work to do ahead. As we look forward, my top priority as CFO is to ensure that Zillow is a profitable growth company, resulting in outsized value to our shareholders. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. Yes. Thanks, Brad. It's Jeremy Hofmann. I'll take the first one and then hand it to Jeremy Wacksman for the second one. On the outperformance, I think, similar to prepared remarks, it's roughly 50% in our control that is driving the outside share gains and 50% relative tailwinds. On our side, it's a ton of little actions that add up with a funnel that's as big as ours and then we're getting benefit from touring as a prominent call to action. So the more touring that folks see on the sites and apps the more than it makes up more of our connections, the better off we are and are seeing our performance as a result of that. On the macro side, it is the fact that there's more first-time homebuyers as a mix of all homebuyers. So those are sort of the dynamics that we see at play. Like I said in the prepared remarks, I think we expect the macro to be less helpful but we are still projecting 1,100 basis points of outperformance at the midpoint. So that gives you a sense for the -- how we feel about the investments we're making and the ability for us to keep improving our funnel. So that's that one and then I'll hand it to Jeremy for the other. Yes, Mark, it's Jeremy Hofmann. I can answer your first one and probably take your second as well. On the first one on EBITDA margin drivers, yes, we feel good about our ability to get to those levels as we drive revenue and leverage our cost structure over time. I think we are making progress in a number of places and believe that we have a highly leverageable cost base. So as we drive revenue, we believe that will flow through. And you saw that in the performance this quarter, right? We outperformed substantially on revenue and it flowed through to EBITDA. So feel really good there about our ability to drive that over time. And then on the share gains question, I mentioned in my prepared remarks but I'll say it again here. We -- in Q2, we saw 50% year-over-year customer transaction share gains in Phoenix and Atlanta which are our 2 most mature enhanced markets. So it's obviously early days. There's a lot more markets to come from here. We're going to be methodical about rolling those out but it is a great proof point to say, hey, the strategy feels like it is working early days. Yes. Ryan, it's a good question. On the fixed cost side, we do feel pretty good about the amount of infrastructure we have in place for mortgage. That's to say over the next couple of years. And of course, as it grows, we'll see. But based on the current plan, we feel pretty good about the fixed cost. On the variable side, we will grow costs there because that means we're hiring loan officers but that's obviously a good thing so long as we're manufacturing loans profitably. But on the fixed side, yes, we feel pretty good on the mortgage side. And then on the overall business, I'd say, we feel like the fixed cost investment we've made to date should serve us well for the current growth initiatives we have. Yes. So I'll take the first one. Good question. I think we're looking for efficiencies all over the business, our most mature businesses to the ones that are newest. I would say the biggest opportunities for us on the variable efficiencies are the newest products over time, right? So between mortgage, seller services, those should get leverage as we scale. But those are the places where we are most focused ensuring we're getting efficiency as those products come into life. And then I'll push to Rich on the second question. Yes, it's a good question. We guided based on the best information that we have. And I think existing home sales an inventory just being as low as they are right now, puts us in a spot that we have to make the best information available that we have. We have internal economists that look at this every day. So really, given the best information that we have what we're most focused on, I would say, is ensuring that we continue to outperform the industry. So we're feeling quite good about the ability to outperform the last 4 quarters and we're guiding to outperform 1,100 basis points at midpoint to midpoint in PA versus the industry for Q3 as well."

            "name": "Richard Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad and thank you, Elliot. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for dialing in today. We're excited to share our second quarter results and speak to the progress we've made on our growth strategy since we last spoke in May. You've heard me say many times that 2023 is a crucial year for Zillow. As the year progresses, we're pleased with what we've accomplished thus far. Second quarter revenue of $506 million surpassed the high end of our outlook by $27 million and returned to slightly positive year-over-year growth. and EBITDA of $111 million surpassed the top end of our outlook by $30 million. This outperformance compared to our outlook continues to be driven by a combination of progress we've made since reorienting the company in early 2022, are focused on cost management and relative macro tailwinds as we navigate the ongoing poor housing market. As we gain to the results with you this quarter, we are particularly pleased that our residential revenue outpaced the broader real estate market decline of 22% and by 1,900 basis points, marking 4 consecutive quarters of outperformance. As you will recall from the investor deck we shared in early 2022, we believe approximately 25% of all actual U.S. homebuyers sought a Premier Agent partner in the previous year, yet we estimated that only 3% of home buyers and sellers ultimately transacted with us, a major opportunity gap to be bridged. We framed our solution to focus on growing customer transaction share, the Zillow Housing Super App. Our big strategy bet with the super app is that customers and partners alike want and need a much more digital convenient and integrated housing transaction. And that Zillow is likely the only company in the industry with the technical skills, the audience reach and partner network to pull it off. We are clearly making progress on this long runway growth strategy. We will continue to invest and prioritize for a steady drumbeat of features and services for both customers and partners which should set us up for long-term profitable growth. Our super app investment manifests in 5 growth pillars we talk about frequently with you all but it also shows up in the core day-to-day work which is a result of having our 6,000 employees orient around the same goal: to increase our share of customer transactions. Since we have made transactions such an important focus for us, we have learned a great deal about our customer experience, far beyond what we ever knew when we were purely a lead-gen focused company. We've spoken before about the significant investments in improving our customer funnel. We are making numerous incremental improvements in an effort to capture more customer demand and connect more of that demand to our partner network which has resulted in better-than-expected connections in Premier Agent. Additionally, we continue to see significant value in giving more customers the option to tour homes as the key call to action on our apps and sites which is also driving this relative outperformance. One additional boon to us, first-time homebuyers make up a larger relative share of buyers in the market today. This benefits us because we have a richer mix of first-time homebuyers. Before someone is the first-time home buyer, they are often a renter, with over 11 million rental households moving each year we continue to invest in Zillow's rental marketplace to integrate and streamline the experience while driving customer preference for Zillow's rental products. We are building a comprehensive marketplace of rental listings and integrating and experience that guides renters all the way through completing their rental transactions and supporting subsequent interactions with their landlord or property manager. Rentals revenue grew 28% year-over-year. This growth was driven by organic efforts, signing up more multifamily properties and attracting more single-family listings with limited marketing dollars. In May of last year, Zillow regained its spot as the number one most visited rentals platform according to comScore and we have widened our lead since then, putting us in a strong position for future revenue growth. We intend to differentiate our marketplace on quality of experience, building out a one-stop suite of landlord tools to attract unique supply while simultaneously investing to deliver a more seamless housing super app experience for rentals customers and partners. All of the positive performance we've seen across our business this quarter is supported by a healthy top of funnel relative to the weak housing market and consistent organic traffic to our apps and sites. From our earliest days, we prioritized the product itself as the most critical part of the marketing mix, delivering product innovations that empower and serve our customers. Our product-centric approach has served us well, driving favorable word-of-mouth marketing and strong brand recognition. Currently, more than 80% of our traffic comes directly to us which is rare and good. Another critical belief we have that underlines our housing super app strategy is the importance of our mobile app as the key interface to our customers. We were an early mobile developer back when the iPhone was released in 2007 and have been investing ever since. As a result, nearly half of our business today are in our lovely Zillow app, where people dream, shop, buy, sell, rent and finance. This has made us the leading real estate app in sight in the U.S. according to comScore. The direct branded relationship we have with our customers will serve us well into the future. We spoke last quarter about how we're thinking about AI as its potential to influence how people use digital services to accomplish countless tasks in their lives. While the initial wave of splashy headlines playing on AI hopes and fears have waned a bit, our belief in its importance to our future has not. We are energized about AI's potential to drive efficiencies and improve the experience of our customers, our Premier Agent partners, our loan officers and our employees. Understanding the opportunity here, we've deployed several work streams across the company to improve the experience of all 4 of these key constituencies. Today, we are in the rapid exploration phase and we already see how AI will be fundamental in accelerating our business. Before I talk through the progress we've made in the last quarter on our product road map, allow me to rearticulate the goal of Zillow's housing super app strategy to increase engagement customer transactions and revenue per customer transaction by investing across 5 growth pillars: touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services. The expected output of this strategy is to grow our share of customer transactions from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025. We continue to emphasize that 2023 is a year of execution. Through midyear, I am pleased to report that we have been steadily rolling out products and services across our 5 growth pillars and integrating them to create an increasingly seamless experience for customers and partners alike. To begin our product road map update, I'll start with financing. This remains an important investment for us for obvious reasons. Nearly 80% of homes purchased are financed with a mortgage, 40% of all homebuyers start their journey shopping for a mortgage, 80% of those don't yet have an agent; and almost all of those mortgage seekers use Zillow. We are building the foundation for a substantial first-party direct-to-consumer purchase mortgage origination business, seamlessly integrated with our extensive Premier Agent partner network. We've spoken about the 2 ways in which customers connect with Zillow Home Loans; property first and financing first. I'll start with financing first, the -- as the entry point for Zillow Home Loans which is when customers start their moving journey by getting prequalified before they are connected to an agent. We are making good progress on integrating our mortgage experience into the Zillow app, helping customers better understand what they can afford and to easily get preapproved before they meet a Premier Agent partner. Additionally, we are continuing to refine our ability to better connect our transaction-ready customers to one of our ZHL loan officers as quickly as possible. Lastly, we are building tools for our loan officers to make their experience easier when working with customers. All of this work is resulting in higher loan officer efficiency and a better overall customer experience. I'll now switch over to the property first entry point which is when our Zillow Home Loans lead comes back to us from a Premier Agent partner who is working with a home shopping customer we had previously sent them. Here, we are focused on building great technology for our Premier Agent partners and ZHL loan officers to bolster efficiencies and ensure a quality transaction experience. Equally important, we are focused on building a deep relationship between our ZHL loan officers and our Premier Agent partners so that together, they can provide the best possible service to our shared customers. Consistent with last quarter, we are seeing roughly 1 in 3 Premier Agent partners in our enhanced markets to connect customers to Zillow Home Loans, up from roughly 1 in 5 in Q4 2022. Suffice it to say, we are working hard on our financing growth pillar and a deep integration of Zillow Home Loans into our customer and partner experiences. I'm pleased to share that as a result of all our efforts, we are reporting 73% year-over-year growth in purchase loan origination volume and 30% growth sequentially from Q1, all in the context of a lousy mortgage market. I'll now speak about touring which continues to be one of our big bets because our data shows that movers who request a tour convert to buyers at 3x the rate of other actions on Zillow. This past quarter, we've continued to iterate and improve our real-time touring products showing time. We began by shipping new software across the industry that enabled real-time touring functionality. We then began to train our Premier Agent partners lighting up real-time touring on a market-by-market basis allowing eligible buyers to get a tour confirmed quickly with much less friction. I'm pleased to share that we've now rolled out real-time touring in all 6 of our enhanced markets, including Charlotte and Durham. Further, to accelerate the rollout of real-time touring, we've begun launching outside of our enhanced markets, including the 4 additional locations this quarter. As we are continuing to invest in product improvements to enhance the experience, for example, agents now have expanded self-service tour management capabilities at their fingertips, including the ability to reschedule or view subsequent tours in the ShowingTime app and book multi-property tours. These incremental improvements contribute to a meaningful upgrade from the antiquated game of 3-legged phone tag still being used by many customers and agents to schedule home tours. Real-time touring, combined with other initiatives in our enhanced markets, is improving our funnel and driving meaningful improvements to our ability to connect higher-intent customers to our Premier Agent partners contributing to the enhanced market outperformance that Jeremy will discuss in more detail shortly. I'll now move on to the final pillar of our product road map update, Seller Solutions. We're working to provide sellers and listing agents with tech-enabled products and services that make it easier for people to move. Last fall, we began talking about our product we're developing to differentiate listing agents on Zillow through branding and higher quality listings that look unlike anything else that exists in real estate today. I'm pleased to share that in June, we launched listing showcase by ShowingTime+ in select markets. We're excited about this product for a number of reasons. First, by targeting sellers and listing agents directly, we are expanding our serviceable addressable market, increasing our opportunity to grow customer transaction share and diversifying our business model. Second, it's great for consumers, buyers and sellers alike. Listing showcase offers sellers a differentiated listing experience that rises above the rest giving buyers richer tech-enabled insights into the homes layout and features. Finally, it's giving agents across the industry, not just Premier Agent partners an opportunity to elevate their professional brand to help them win more business. It's early days but we are optimistic. Initial feedback in demand has been strong from listing agents across the industry who are eager to learn and try out this innovative new offering. We are planning to roll out more markets over the course of this year and we'll provide more details in the coming months. We've also made progress on our other selling solutions offerings, our partnership with Opendoor which allows sellers on Zillow to request a cash offer from Opendoor is live in 25 markets as of today, compared to the 2 markets we launched initially in February. As I think about the progress we're making in the business, I'm pleased with how we have managed even as so much remains out of our control. Mortgage rates are staying higher for longer than previously expected and continued to be volatile, resulting in would be sellers hesitating to move due to their attractive legacy lower rate mortgages. This is having a more pronounced effect on sales volumes during the typically strong summer moving season. Demand has held up better than supply, driving inventory to record lows and supporting prices despite affordability headwinds. With low existing home inventory, the new construction is a bright spot, adding new supply to help meet some of the demand and growing the overall housing stock. Our new construction marketplace experienced strong growth again in Q2. Additionally, the rental market is adding record levels of new supply which has lowered occupancy rates and driven landlord demand for rental advertising contributing to 28% year-over-year growth in rentals revenue for us this quarter. The housing market outlook continues to be frustratingly foggy and we can only plan for it to take time to normalize. Volumes remained stubbornly low but we continue to have confidence that this is not some new normal and that we will get back to approximately 6 million units a year over time. To close, I'll reiterate how pleased I am with our progress this year. We're navigating well through a tough housing macro environment that is not in our control, maintaining our focus on what we can control, steady progress across our growth pillars and prudent cost management as we work towards driving profitable growth for our business. With that, I will now pass the line over to Jeremy Hofmann, who many of you already know from his 6-year tenure at Zillow which saw him rapidly increase his leadership scope to include Corp Dev, Strategy business operations, investor relations, government relations and now Olive Finance as CFO. Welcome to the microphone in Jeremy. Loan productivity. Only because you asked me directly, Tom. And I haven't spoken yet in the Q&A. So thank you for including me. Yes. So we sunsetted ZCS now because we don't think title and escrow is important as part of the transaction but because we built that thing for Zillow Offers. And for our iBuying business and it wasn't -- it just wasn't the right solution for us with what we have envisioned now. I think Jeremy Hofmann in his prepared remarks, talked a bit about how we think it's an important thing. And to watch this space. We are working on alternatives right now. So watch this space. Anything to add, Jeremy Wacksman? Dae, we -- I think we got the second question but you're -- we're having trouble with your audio a little bit. We didn't quite get the first question. Can you repeat it? Yes. Okay, got it. Got it. All right. I'll take that and then maybe kick it to Jeremy Wacksman for the enhanced market. Can we go faster question. I mean, look, we see real opportunity. I mean, I think a lot of the excitement and imagination has been sparked at kind of the ultimate user interface opportunity. with generative AI and moving towards a conversational UI. And then how might that change the kind of historic physics of the Internet and that's fascinating to us and obviously, very important. I do think though that that is also going to be one of the longest lead time behavioral change ones. So we're exploring that aggressively and are quite interested in making sure we feel like we are really well situated from an audience brand and unique data perspective and leaning into it such that we don't somehow miss the boat and missed the memo on the change. So we feel good there but that's probably a longer lead time one. The stuff that we're seeing in the short term really is like engineer productivity, marketer productivity, a little slower will be legal and accounting. We're seeing -- we're already seeing some productivity gains for people on phones. So sales folks, partners, loan officers. It is early days but I think we'll probably see more progress more quickly on the engine room stuff than the exposed stuff. All right. So hopefully, that helps you. And then Jeremy Wacksman, maybe hit the wind-up faster but I do want to know that, too. And it feels like a long runway of opportunity. It feels like durable opportunity to us that we are attacking methodically. We kind of did a major reset in organization last year in 2022. And now you're seeing us both develop and engineer and launch new stuff across the board in enhanced markets and nationally. So this is kind of our year of execution and we're posting really good relative results. It's a terrible macro, housing macro and we can get really bummed out about that. But we internally are quite excited by our relative performance and the share gains we're seeing in our enhanced markets. The 1,900 basis points of outperformance for our residential revenue line item purchased mortgage business up 73% year-over-year in a crap mortgage market. we keep rolling out this real-time touring this real-time touring feature set that is really quite a game changer. And even rentals, like we're seeing 28% year-over-year growth. So internally, we it's tough weather outside but internally, I, for one, am really pleased at what I'm seeing. And I'm quietly reservably guardedly optimistic and excited as I look into the future, yes. I was assuming that that was the big wrap. All right. I just did my big closing remark. Great chatting. Great chatting with you all. Thanks for making the time. We look forward to chatting with you soon. Have a good day."

            "name": "Jeremy Wacksman",
            "content": "This is Jeremy Wacksman. I'll take that one. Yes, as Rich talked about earlier, we're now live in 25 markets, up from the 2 in February. And on top of that, in our Seller Solutions growth pillar, we just announced and have launched listing showcase by ShowingTime+ in our select markets. So we're really pleased with the expansion and coverage of our seller solutions. As Rich talked about, increasing our service addressable market to the sell side and sellers who become buyers as well as accessing more types of agents, not just from your agents and listing agents, across those solutions. So more to come in the future quarters but we're pleased with the continued progress there. Yes. And Brad, on real-time touring, as Rich said, we've been over time, increasing tour exposure on Zillow nationally, while also building real-time touring in our enhanced markets. And so both of those things contribute to our part of the share gain that's in our control. And so on the national, that's just about removing friction in the funnel, getting more customers interested and aware of a tour and then when they want to book a tour, making that easier for them. And then in real-time touring specifically, that is now in our enhanced market that we announced is coming to more markets, that's really about creating that reservation like system for a buyer to remove entire steps in the funnel and be able to book a tour when they want to go see it more often. And we continue to improve that product as well, right? We're expanding our product offerings, agents can now expand their self-service to our management capabilities, rescheduling and viewing and then booking subsequent tours are all features we're adding. So these are all things that we're hearing feedback from customers and partners that has been on our product road map that we're excited to get into market. So we're improving the product while also scaling and rolling out the product to more customers and partners. Yes. This is -- on the first one on enhanced markets, I mean nothing further than what we announced today which is we're adding 2 more markets to our enhanced markets and rolling those out now. So Charlotte and Durham. And the other thing I think Rich talked about was also bringing real-time touring to 4 markets beyond those. So while we're not bringing the entire enhanced market playbook to those next 4 markets, real time touring is coming first and we're doing that because as we've talked to you all about before, we want to expand these capabilities as we can. And as we are getting the playbook and the technology right for real-time touring, we're able to bring that to more partners and try more things versus the entire enhanced market playbook. So that's on the touring part. And then remind me your second question. Yes. I mean it's a combination of a couple of things. One, it's about just continuing to help find higher-intent customers. As Rich talked about, we have so many mortgage shoppers on our site because 40% of all homebuyers want to start with that question but they're all in different stages. And so helping those folks as they raise their hand and start to ask questions with things like our personalized payment experience and our prequalification system, helping find the right customers and get the right customers to our loan officers is one big piece of it. And then just tools in the factory, we're releasing products and services so that our loan officers can more efficiently work with our customer, working in fewer systems, being able to do more digitally real-time while on the phone with the customer and not having to call them back. All those things help them be a better consultant, a better adviser and that leads to conversion gains but also just leads to productivity and efficiency gains. Yes. I think on buy side versus sell side, I mean we don't tease it out specifically, especially in the incremental which I think is what your question is about. But primarily most of our transactions to date are buy side, right? And so the share gains you're seeing, the relative outperformance you're seeing is all mostly coming from the buy side. And you heard that from Rich and Jeremy, that's one part friction removal and higher-quality customers getting to higher-quality partners and one part relative macro tailwinds with the buyer mix. That said, we are really excited about our ability to gain and see more share gains as we layer in seller solutions as well, right, both between our multiple selling offerings, experience for our customers, right, introducing them to an open door offer if they're interested or a Premier Agent partner if they want and Showcase, Listing Showcase which we just launched this quarter which Rich talked a bunch about as well. So we expect share gains and customer transactions to come from both over time, even though right now, we're seeing the benefits of our own efforts and macro efforts primarily on the buy side. No. Sure. Thanks, Brian. The things we're looking for in our enhanced markets are -- I mean, ultimately, the outputs or customer transaction share. And the indicators to that, I think we've talked to you all about before in the funnel are reducing the friction and so customer engagement and customer agent engagement and work with rates between those two. And so these things take a long time to mature, transactions take a long time but we watch those kind of mid-funnel indicators on both the customer side and the agent side. And as Jeremy Hofmann talked about, we're really pleased that we're seeing significant customer transaction share growth in our 2 oldest enhanced markets, even as we're early in seeing the benefits of the rollout of a bunch of those capabilities. So again, increased focus on partner quality and really aligning ourselves with partners that work more deeply with us across these product experiences, the rollout of real-time touring, the rollout of Zillow Home Loans and the rollout of seller solutions across all those things, we think is a recipe for success in the share growth you're seeing and that's why we have confidence is going to continue. And then in terms of what we think about going forward, that's why we've started to bring those to more markets even at the same time, while we're continuing to improve and mature the products themselves. We're not done building the things we're talking to you all about. We are building and deploying at the same time. And so, the capability improvements for both customers and our Premier Agent partners and our loan officers will continue, as you heard a bit from Rich and Jeremy about. How enhanced markets contribute to our ultimate share goals. And the way I think about it is it's a combination of national progress and local progress, right? And that's what you've seen from us the last couple of quarters. You've seen relative outperformance overall nationally which largely has not been from the benefits of the enhanced market and the growth pillars in enhanced markets. And then now you're starting to see the results and the progress we can get market by market. And so as we scale our enhanced market recipe to more markets, that will become a bigger contributor to our overall national footprint. But again, that doesn't mean we're not going to continue to keep working on improvements nationally and things that we don't need to take in and market. So, we really think about it as a combo of both. And that's why we're excited about the progress we've seen in the enhanced markets, the ability to bring some of these components to more markets and then as we mature the offerings and work with our partners, the share gains to continue."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Zillow Group First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Berning, Vice President, Strategic Affairs and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nBradley Berning: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Zillow Group's First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Zillow Group's Co-Founder and CEO, and Rich Barton; CFO, Allen Parker; and COO, Jeremy Wacksman.  During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements about our future performance and operating plans and the housing market based on current expectations and assumptions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and we encourage you to consider the risk factors described in our SEC filings for additional information. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events, except as required by law. This call is being broadcast on the Internet and is accessible on our Investor Relations website. A recording of the call will be available later today.  During the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, which we refer to as EBITDA. We encourage you to read our shareholder letter and our earnings release, which can be found on our Investor Relations website, as they contain important information about our GAAP and non-GAAP results, including reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures.  We will now open the call with remarks followed by live Q&A. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich.\nRichard Barton: Thank you, Brad. And thank you, Hanna. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for dialing in today. We are excited to share our first quarter results and the progress we've made on our growth strategy since we last spoke in February. As I noted during our last earnings call, 2023 is critical for Zillow, and I'm pleased with how we've started the year. Total revenue of $469 million and EBITDA of $104 million surpassed the top end of our outlook. This outperformance is due to a combination of progress that we've made since reorienting the company in early 2022, along with favorable relative tailwinds in a tough housing environment.  Since the beginning of 2022, we have made significant investments in improving our customer funnel, capturing more customer demand and connecting more of that demand to our strengthening partner network, resulting in increased conversion rates in Premier Agent. We have focused on many improvements in our customer funnel experience by offering clear call to action that quickly and efficiently help solve customer needs. These numerous incremental changes collectively have been adding up to make a real impact on our business. The most tangible example we made over the last year is providing easier ways for buyers to request home tours on Zillow apps and sites. This has resulted in less drop-off in our funnel, which is a key driver behind improved expected lead volumes of higher intent customers, which does not yet even account for the benefits I'll discuss shortly from real-time touring. Overall, it has been nice to see our focus and investments begin to pay off, with our year-over-year residential revenue outpacing the broader real estate market by 1,300 basis points and an expectation that we will see continued relative gains in Q2.  Beyond our revenue gains relative to the industry, we are also pleased with the profit leverage in our business model. Our EBITDA outperformance for the quarter is a nod to how nicely revenue outperformance can flow through to the bottom line when we prudently manage costs. We couple these results with a strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with $3.4 billion in cash and investments even after buying back $86 million of stock in Q1.  Interestingly and unexpectedly during the quarter, we have felt the first tremor of what we believe to be a coming earthquake in the broader technology landscape with the introduction of OpenAI's ChatGPT. We believe the arrival of conversational generative AI may well be a platform shift on par with the introduction of the graphical user interface or the touch interface on the first smartphones.  Artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision and the use of data have been core to Zillow since our founding. Our AI journey began in 2006 with the invention of the Zestimate, which required massive amounts of data and the machine learning algorithm, albeit one that looks quite primitive versus what we have deployed today. What started with AI and Zestimate expanded to more parts of the product in the year as follows: advancements with our new neural Zestimate, computer vision-powered rich media experiences, AI-generated immersive floor plans and natural language search queries are 4 more recent examples of how these capabilities show up in our products and services today.  The launch of ChatGPT and now new Bing and Bard have brought AI out of the basement and into the life for all of us to interact with. We recognize that it is in its infancy, that it is evolving incredibly fast and that it is fraught on many levels. However, we are excited and confident in our ability to harness its power to drive growth. We believe this technology will improve our customer and partner experiences, meaningfully increase the productivity of our employees and the velocity of our output and ultimately drive growth for both Zillow and our partners' businesses. We are well positioned for this opportunity not only because we have understood and been early adopters of important new platforms as they emerged, like we did with iOS and Android, but also because we have the brand, the audience, and the access to large proprietary relevant data sets as well.  There is another valid worry out there about how ChatGPT might disrupt the physics of the way people search, find and navigate the web itself. At Zillow, we are experimenting aggressively to understand this new paradigm. OpenAI's ChatGPT has a limited release alpha plug-in program that enables select app developers to have API-level platform access. We launched an alpha version Zillow plug-in yesterday, which operates in a small sandbox but with which we will learn and iterate rapidly. Again, I am confident that Zillow is well positioned for whatever disruption may come not only because we are leaning in hard, but because we own our own customer demand.  The #1 core value at Zillow is that the customer is our north star. Starting with the Zestimate, we have released a drumbeat of magical product innovations, which empower, entertain and engage our customers throughout their home shopping journey. That has freed us to predominantly market Zillow by a good old word of mouth boosted by great PR and brand marketing. We have always believed that the product itself is the most important part of the marketing mix. This has worked well for us. Our brand has grown to become the best known and trusted name in real estate. Zillow is the leading real estate app and site in the U.S. according to comScore.  While we recognize and respect that SEO and SEM have a real and important place in the marketing mix, we have always been keenly aware that any vertical sites over dependence on SEO and SEM makes it strategically fragile. Today, over 80% of our traffic comes to us directly. This is rare and very good. The direct branded relationship we have with our customers will help us well into the future.  As you all know, a few years ago, we embarked on a new frontier, it digitized the real estate transaction itself, to convert and monetize a small but increasing percentage of the 200 million average monthly unique users on our asset sites, turning them into transactors. Our growth investments are focused on improving the transaction experience so that we might not only help people search and find homes but also help them buy, sell, finance and rent and ultimately get into the next home with more ease, more transparency, more efficiency than ever before. We've been laying the groundwork for our transaction strategy for quite some time and believe this is how we both differentiate and continue to grow our business and our brand, by being the destination for buyers, sellers and renters end-to-end housing transaction needs.  This strategy of shifting our focus and efforts down funnel to the transaction is manifest in what we call our Housing Super App vision, an integrated end-to-end experience to help our customers move. Our goal is to increase engagement, customer transactions and revenue per customer transaction by investing across 5 growth pillars: touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services. The expected output of this strategy is to grow our share of customer transactions from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025.  On our road map, 2023 is about execution, steadily rolling out products in constrained geographies across our 5 growth pillars and integrating them to create a seamless experience for our customers and partners. We are obviously excited about all the tech-enabled solutions we're building to improve the gnarly process of moving, but we are clear-eyed about the importance of connecting that technology to our critical partners in the physical world as well as the physical homes and apartments that are available for sale or rent.  Rich, smart integration within our ecosystem is crucial to our Housing Super App vision, be it connecting with the Premier Agent partner that tours homes with you; after you book it with showing time or working with the Zillow Home Loans Officer; who secures your mortgage. We are bringing this seamless, connected experience to various markets throughout the country with our first 4 in Raleigh, Denver, Atlanta and Phoenix.  I'll kick off our product road map progress report with touring; stepping into the home, whether virtually through a 3D -- Zillow 3D home interactive floor plan, where our computer vision technology makes it feel like you're walking through the home; or in person when you are actually physically touring the home with their Premier Agent partner brings the shopping experience to let. So when we talk about touring, we're talking about the point-of-sale moment when dreamers turn into customers. This means capturing the attention of the users who are currently dreaming and scrolling at the top of the funnel and providing them with a tangible step into the real life home shopping experience of touring a home.  This is one of our big bets and a critical piece of our product road map because our data shows that movers who requested to convert to buyers at 3x the rate of other actions on Zillow. And making improvements to the home tour process is critical to achieving the seamless, connected experience we envision. Enabled by showing times integration with Zillow, real-time touring allows eligible buyers to get a tour confirmed in less than an hour with much less friction in the process.  In February, we shared early results we were seeing with real-time touring in Atlanta. Connection rates were higher, and customers were more likely to work with our Premier Agent partners. That trend continued in Q1, leading to more tours being fulfilled and early indications of higher transaction rates. I'm pleased to share we have now rolled out real-time touring in our other 3 enhanced markets: Raleigh, Denver and Phoenix. Combined with the other initiatives we're driving in our enhanced markets, real-time touring is improving our funnel, driving meaningful improvements in our ability to connect higher-intent customers to our Premier Agent partners.  Beyond our improvements in tour, we are continuing to enhance our partner network. As we've discussed, our Premier Agent partners are critical to delivering integrated service and, therefore, growth. What's good for our customers is good for our agent partners. Helping customers find and win their homes also helps agents grow their businesses. We are holding ourselves accountable to connect higher-intent customers to our partners and are holding our Premier Agent partners accountable to higher-performance standards as well. Across all 4 enhanced markets, we meaningfully consolidated our partner network with a focus on Premier Agent partners, who convert leads into transactions best, who treat our customers best and who are motivated to grow their businesses alongside us. And we are seeing the operational benefits from working with a tighter set of partners.  First, we're able to work more closely to deliver a brand-aligned experience to our shared customers. And second, it has allowed us to quickly test new products and services and evaluate in real time how things are going before we scale. Most importantly, we are seeing improvements in customer satisfaction and engagement as we connect customers with our strongest partners in each market.  For our next product road map update, I'll cover financing. This is an important investment for us because 87% of homes purchased are financed for the mortgage, 40% of all homebuyers start their journey shopping for a mortgage, and 80% of those don't yet have an agent. We told you before that we've turned our attention towards building the foundation for a substantial first-party, direct-to-consumer purchase mortgage origination business. Our top priorities include building overall awareness for Zillow Home Loans, building a better digital mortgage experience, bolstering our loan officers tools and capabilities and working closely with our Premier Agent partner base to build integrated processes. And we're making progress on all fronts.  You may recall last quarter, we spoke about the 2 broad ways in which customers connect with Zillow Home Loans, property first and financing first, though aimed based on whether our customer entered their transaction journey through a property inquiry or through a mortgaging for. I'll start with property first, which is when our Zillow Home Loans lead comes back to us from a Premier Agent partner who is working with a home shopping customer we had previously sent them. We are now seeing roughly 1 in 3 Premier Agent partners in our enhanced markets introduce customers to Zillow Home Loans, up from roughly 1 in 5 last quarter. Continue to drive conversion here, we focused on making it much easier for Premier Agent partners to connect customers with Zillow Home Loans, which makes for a more seamless connection process that generates a better customer experience.  First, it provides our customers optionality. For customers who may have sought financing advice elsewhere, our management partners can give them the choice to speak with the Zillow Home Loans Officer if they want to seek a second opinion. Second, our Premier Agent partners can connect a customer to a Zillow Home Loans officer with confidence because they can choose the loan officer who specializes in their market and who can provide a more knowledgeable, personalized financing experience.  Let's now switch over to financing first, the other entry point, which is when a customer starts their moving journey by getting prequalified before they are connected to an agent. We've made some very good progress here. We've begun turning the dial on a number of different strategies to build overall awareness of Zillow Home Loans, including recently rolling out an update on the Zillow app to put financing at the forefront of the customer experience.  We've rolled out a central hub for financing on the navigation bar at the bottom of the app, which gives the customer multiple options, including Calculate What You Can Afford tool and a direct connection to Zillow Home loans via a Get Prequalified button. We began rolling this out in early April and expect it to be available to customers nationally by the end of Q2. We've also shipped an affordability search filter that gives home shopper the ability to customize the home details page only showing them homes that fit within their monthly mortgage payment budget. These are 2 examples of how we're putting financing at the forefront, working to improve awareness of Zillow Home Loans and shipping features of the Housing Super App as we strive to solve our customers' complicated problems.  As we've said before, we think there is a big prize for us in purchase mortgage originations, and extending the Zillow's umbrella over mortgages is a critical part of our transformation. As a result of all of our efforts across our mortgage investments, purchase loan origination volumes in Q1 doubled year-over-year.  So I feel quite good about progress against that which we can control. But of course, we continue to live in a very challenging housing macro environment with no clear indications of a term. Transactions continue to be low. High demand to move supports a stable pricing environment, but high rates has somewhat locked sellers into their existing low rate mortgages. So we see record combined new home and new apartment inventory on the way, it will take quite some time to balance demand with supply and to normalize the market. And while we may see rates come down at any time, we are certainly not counting on it. Meanwhile, we are well capitalized generating positive operating cash flow and heads down making progress on our growth plan, converting traffic into transactions with the help of our rapid product innovation and our increasingly intertwined relationships with our terrific partners and loan officers.  To close, I am pleased with how we started the year, as evidenced by our solid Q1 results. That said, we have a lot of work to do to drive outsized gains in our share of customer transactions moving forward, and our team is focused on delivering on our product road map and service of our customers. We appreciate you all being on the journey with us and look forward to connecting with you in the days and weeks ahead.  With that, I'll pass it over to Allen. Allen?\nAllen Parker: Thanks, Rich. In Q1, we delivered results above our outlook for both revenue and EBITDA. Residential revenue also outperformed the tough housing industry, and we expect that trend to continue into Q2. Residential revenue was $361 million, down 14% year-over-year, outperforming the high end of our outlook range and the industry total transaction dollar decline of 27% according to data from the National Association of Realtors. The relative outperformance was driven by a combination of the strength of our brand, a better-than-expected number of customer connections provided to our Premier Agent partners from the investments we have made that Rich already discussed and favorable tailwinds relative to the industry that we've discussed before.  New construction revenue was also strong during Q1, growing 16% year-over-year as customers turned to new construction given tight housing inventory. Rentals revenue increased 21% year-over-year as rentals traffic on Zillow grew 16% year-over-year to 29 million average monthly unique visitors in Q1 for comScore despite industry headwinds in multifamily demand. Our industry-leading rentals traffic helped us drive accelerated year-over-year growth in the number of multifamily partners on our apps and sites when compared to Q4 2022. We also continue to see industry tailwinds with occupancy rates declining from historically high levels and lower rental customer demand, combined with new supply coming onto the market, drove an increased need for advertising for landlords.  Mortgages revenue was $26 million, with purchase loan origination volumes growing 9% sequentially and more than 100% year-over-year. We continue to make progress building our Zillow Home Loans-purchased mortgage business. We began to assign our centralized team of loan officers to specific geographic areas and enhance the ability for Premier Agent partners and their buyers to choose their loan officer. We also made changes to our apps and sites to show Zillow Home Loans to more customers. Given this progress and to meet customer demand, we plan to increase our number of loan officers in the coming months while we closely monitor operational efficiencies.  Our EBITDA expenses totaled $365 million in Q1, roughly flat from $362 million in Q4 and meeting the midpoint of the range implied in our outlook for Q1. We grew planned investments in our key growth initiatives with active cost management of other discretionary and nonpeople-related costs, such as direct advertising and marketing expenses, which were down both sequentially and year-over-year.  On a GAAP basis, net loss was $22 million in Q1, and net loss margin was 5%. EBITDA was $104 million, above the midpoint of our outlook range by $48 million in Q1. EBITDA margin was 22%. This outperformance demonstrates the inherent profit leverage in our business model and how quickly revenue outperformance can flow through to the bottom line.  We ended Q1 with $3.4 billion of cash and investments, flat from the end of 2022, which includes the benefit of net cash provided by operating activities as well as the impact of $86 million in share repurchases during Q1. convertible debt was $1.7 billion at the end of Q1.  Turning to our outlook for Q2. We expect total revenue to be $451 million to $479 million, implying a year-over-year decline of 8% at the midpoint of our outlook range. We expect residential revenue to be in the range of $341 million to $361 million, down 10% year-over-year at the midpoint of our outlook range as compared to our estimate for an industry transaction dollar decline between 18% and 28% year-over-year in Q2. This implies 4 consecutive quarters of outperformance relative to the industry.  For Premier Agent, we estimate revenue will decrease 9% to 13% year-over-year. We expect the investments we have made in our funnel will continue to deliver benefits into Q2. As the macro backdrop remains choppy, we continue to focus on the inputs we can control, adding value to our customers and shipping great products while actively managing costs.  For Q2, we expect EBITDA to be in the range of $61 million to $81 million, implying a 15% margin at the midpoint of our outlook range. Our outlook implies a planned increase in EBITDA expenses from $365 million in Q1 to a range of $390 million to $398 million for Q2, driven primarily by a sequential increase in marketing and advertising expenses, which is the largest driver. This is a combination of typical seasonal spending in Q2 and a pull forward of previously planned second half marketing as we are ready to test additional initiatives in our enhanced markets earlier than expected. We also have a small amount of advertising that we pushed from Q1 to Q2.  In addition, we expect a modest increase in planned hiring investments as we continue to support our growth strategy. Part of the increase includes some hiring timing that was moved from Q1 to Q2 and staffing up to support product and market launches during the remainder of the year. We also expect to add variable resources for increased activity levels, such as hiring of additional loan officers, evidence that our growth strategy is gaining traction. Taken as a whole, we believe Q2 EBITDA expenses will be close to the run rates we expect in the second half based on what we know today.  We are currently willing to look through the macroeconomic environment as we balance prudent investments while constantly seeking operating efficiencies across the business. We are making progress on reducing friction in our funnel, and we feel good about the progress we are making towards our growth pillars. We believe investing against our growth targets while managing costs is the right thing to do to drive customer transaction share and grow revenue per transaction. We have a high incremental margin business, where we expect to see operating leverage as we grow revenue across the housing industry cycle.  In closing, we remain in a strong position to invest against our strategy to better serve more customers, resulting in share growth and more revenue per transaction. As we look forward, our priorities remain focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners. We plan to continue to grow our customer engagement through compelling dream and shop experience; deliver a more integrated customer transaction experience to drive customers to choose to transact with us and our partners; invest in sustainable top line growth opportunities across the company, including new integrated services that are more scalable, less subject to earnings volatility and more capital efficient; and manage our cost structure and improve productivity, including continued prioritization of our investments that we expect will drive a profitable, scalable and positive operating cash flow company.  And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of John Campbell with Stephens.\nJohn Campbell: A question here on touring, and then I had a quick follow-up on mortgage. You guys have talked pretty consistently about the touring leads, converting it at 3x the rate. You guys have obviously moved more and more of that mix towards touring in recent quarters. But with a little bit more time under the belt, I'm curious how those touring lead conversions are looking in the test markets. Rich, you talked to more leads and a higher rate of connections. But specifically for those under flex, could you maybe talk to the degree of uplift in actual conversions you're seeing? And would you characterize it as maybe modest improvements or something closer to step function improvements?\nJeremy Wacksman: John, this is Jeremy Wacksman. I'll take that one. Yes, as Rich talked about, in general, the touring customer converts at a higher rate intrajection than a nontouring customer. And in our enhanced markets where we're piloting this real-time touring, right, this ability to really kind of book your tour nearly instantly, we see less friction, which plugs the holes in the funnel and increases both the customers' ability to get the tour when they want. It also increases the ability for those customers to connect with our Premier Agent partners, and they report higher propensity to work with those Premier Agents. So all those things lead to a higher tour fulfillment rate.  If you ask those customers, do they get to see the home when they want to see it, they're able to more often, and they end up liking working with the agents they're working with more often. So all of those mid-funnel metrics are really good indicators of higher transaction rates. As you know, transaction cohorts take a long time to mature. That's why we're giving you all kind of early indicator data on what historically looks like higher transaction rates. And as we get that data in those markets, we'll share more.\nJohn Campbell: Okay. That's helpful. And then on mortgage, obviously, that's an important long-term growth driver for you guys. It's also an important COG for the super app, but Granted, you're still very early stage and you're still in that build-out mode, so the strategy still might be information. But longer term, I'm curious how you're going to look to capitalize on the sizable CAC advantage. At the highest level, are you looking to maybe use that to kind of run at industry average margin with in-line pricing or -- excuse me, with lower pricing and just basically take share? Or is that something where you can maybe see a higher than average margin and mortgage just better pricing?\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. It's a great question on mortgage in the long term. And as Rich also talked about, very early and very focused on getting the machine, the factory, the partners and the customer experience all right and all working well together. You're right to point out, we do believe we have a great CAC advantage in mortgage. The 2 hardest things, I think, for a stand-alone mortgage company to work through are how to acquire customers and how to find a great referral network of agent partners, and those are the 2 advantages that we have at Zillow with our fantastic brand and audience. As Rich talked about, many customers on Zillow today are starting with that financing question, and so starting to explore ways to connect them with our own offering as well as have our agent partners refer those customers back to us who want to start with a property inquiry. So you're correct in that, that CAC advantage, which, in some cases, is 25% of industry cost is one for us.  I think it's too early to say how we might look to structure the business long term. I guess the only comment I'll make is that as we've been growing this business carefully with our great loan officers, our great agent partners, the feedback we get is what folks care most about is closing on time and having a great and high level of service. So of course, they want great value. But as we're building the technology and the people operations to make this go, the real value to a customer and to their agent is, is the loan going to close on time, do I have transparency on when that's going to happen, and do I get a great level of service. And so that's really what we're focused on. And we think if we can deliver that, that's a great business with great margins.\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan McKeveny with Zelman.\nRyan McKeveny: And congrats on the results. I also wanted to dig in a bit on real-time touring. So the commentary in Atlanta and the other test markets obviously sounds encouraging, and the bigger picture idea of 3x conversions is obviously important. I guess what should we be thinking about in terms of how quickly or how widespread you plan to roll out real-time touring beyond just the test markets, assumingly eventually getting to a point across the country? Is this -- I guess just any time line or where you would frame how we should think about moving beyond just kind of the test phase for these enhanced markets to something more widespread?\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. This is Jeremy. I'll take that one, too. Thanks. Nothing to share yet other than, as Rich talked about, we're really excited that we went from 1 market to 4 markets in the last quarter. And of course, as we continue to see the signals of better customer experience, better funnel performance and also better agent feedback, we're excited to figure out how can we bring that to more customers and more partners in more markets.  I will just caution the complexity of that and the reason we're doing this market by market is because it is a new workflow. So to the customer, it maybe looks invisible that you click this button on Zillow and something better happens and there's less friction, but it's an entirely different way for agent team to connect with those customers than what they've done before. And so that's why we've been very methodical in working closely with these great, optimized partners we're working with to help them figure out how to retrain their agent teams to go meet these customers where they are. So part of the benefit of it is the less friction on the digital side. Part of the other benefit is the less friction on the operational side, and making sure we get that right with each partner is something we're really focused on.\nRyan McKeveny: Got it. No, that's great. And second question maybe for Allen. I think you alluded to this in your commentary on the OpEx and mentioning the uplift with some hiring into 2Q. I guess, generally, as you do go from, let's say, test markets to the broader footprint, either with touring or just the other initiatives, generally speaking, should we expect OpEx to kind of be on an incremental trend up as more of these new initiatives are rolled out? Or do you reach a point where effectively the OpEx or the cost base you guys have just gets incrementally as leveraged?\nAllen Parker: I lose you?\nRichard Barton: No. We hear you, Allen.\nAllen Parker: Okay. Yes. Thanks, Ryan. So what I describe is we gave some guidance kind of on our EBITDA OpEx to tick up in Q2, and we believe the guide we have for Q2 is pretty representative of what we expect in run rate as we close out the year. Obviously, as we see success and to the extent mortgage would be a great example, if volume were to tick up, there would be some variable resources that we'd hire to support that volume, but that would come also with the increase in revenue.  So I think in terms of modeling, what I would say is we're having to tick up from Q1 to Q2. We expect that run rate based on what we know today to be relatively consistent as we close out the year. And as we make progress on these -- as we make progress on our initiatives, again, we'll continue to look for ways to fund them. And I would expect some variable costs, but I would expect variable profits or revenue to come with that.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of James Michael Sherman Lewis with Citi.\nRonald Josey: This is Ron. I don't know if you can hear me okay.\nRichard Barton: Yes, we got you, Ron.\nRonald Josey: Great. So Rich, I had a question. Good to talk to you all again. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the higher conversion rates that were mentioned in the letter, and I know we talked about touring and mortgages and whatnot. But you also mentioned mid-funnel investments that have been driving those higher conversion rates since reorienting the company. Can you just help us unpack those a little bit more in terms of what's driving those higher conversion rates? And then maybe as a follow-on question to Rich or Allen, great to see the 1 in 3 PA partners introduced a customer to Zillow Home Loans. But maybe talk just about the plan to go up to 80% of shoppers that don't have an agent. And I get that maybe the app is a way to do that, but any other plans would be helpful.\nRichard Barton: Ron, this is Rich. I think the -- probably, Jeremy, you're best positioned to address the higher conversion mid-funnel question, and then we'll talk about the second part.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. Yes, I'm happy to take the first one. Yes. I mean Rich talked a little bit in his prepared remarks around just overall reducing funnel friction. Just as a way to tease out, I think all of the consumer improvements and technology improvements we've made on our sites and apps independent of real-time touring, we spend a lot of time talking about our growth pillars with you all, but there are many folks hard at work at Zillow just improving the customer experience for customers using our sites and apps outside of those markets and the partner experience and the software and the processes.  And so that's things like exposing more folks and being more clear on the call to action on our websites and apps with what is a touring request, what is the financing request and what is the question that they want to ask. That's things like the software to ensure that customers more quickly can get connected with a partner when they want to ask that question and getting the right data from them to make sure that handoff and that live transfer to the agent goes well.  So all these little things are very small, but they add up to very meaningful improvements in the number of customers that ultimately get connected and get a question answered to get what they want and then ultimately the quality of those connections to our agent partners. So I think that's -- it's more just teasing out all those relative improvements to the national experience juxtaposed against these very specific growth levers that we also are obviously very excited about.\nRichard Barton: Yes. And on the mortgage question, Ron, I mean we see it as a huge progress to go from 1 out of 5 Premier Agents in our enhanced markets referring or sending a ZHL potential customer back to us after we sent them the customer. Originally, growing to 1 out of 3 is a pretty big win. Obviously, we have a lot of room to go. Ultimately, it will show up in the number of purchased mortgages we complete. But I think the answer to your question about how do we increase penetration, well, we're up 100% year-over-year. We can continue at that pace. That's pretty good. But it's probably the answer, maybe Jeremy can chime in, but it's more probably 100 more little things on funnel improvement, 100 more things like Jeremy had just talked about in terms of touring.  I gave a couple of examples in my script of seemingly basic but really important stuff around insertion of Zillow Home Loans into the Zillow app itself in a really natural and prominent and logical way. That's just Step 1. We see a long road of improvement ahead of us. And I, for one, will tell you my expectations are quite high.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. I mean maybe the only thing I'll add is just some comments Rich made earlier. I mean our priority for growing and scaling the overall mortgage business are building the overall awareness for Zillow Home Loans. The majority of our customers on our website who ask a financing question have no idea that we offer a mortgage. Building that better digital mortgage experience, which gave a couple of examples of that, we have this very fortunate position where folks who know they need and want a mortgage are spending all their time on Zillow shopping. And helping them understand their affordability and their financing questions and getting those answered on their way towards taking a tour or getting prequalified is a unique opportunity for us. And then building a great platform for loan officers, helping them be efficient and provide and deliver great service for those customers. And then lastly, connecting that customer with an agent partner and having that experience be integrated. Because when you are buying, you're working with your agent and you're working with your loan officer to make your decision and actually get your transaction done.  So it sounds simple to work across those 4 things, but it does require really great technology and process to be built across all 4 of those things to be able to take it from a smaller number of people to a far larger number of people. So we're just constantly working on all 4 of those, and we'll turn the dial as we make progress on them.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brad Erickson with RBC.\nBradley Erickson: So maybe 1 or 2 more on tours. Just based on all the positive indicators going on that you mentioned, how would we see tours in this case start to translate to revenue in terms of, I guess, agents finding more value and conversion from those leads and then obviously wanting to pay more? Because I guess with the 3x conversion comment you've always given, that kind of implies that agents already pay more for those leads or would. Maybe that's right or not. But if you could just talk about the mechanics and the kind of the process of getting paid more on that higher conversion and sort of how you see that evolving with real-time touring in particular.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. This is Jeremy. I'll grab that. I mean you're right on the one hand, as we are able to get more touring customers to agents, they are paying for those already more, especially in the Flex postpay model. And then in theory, they're paying more for that in terms of increased ROI in their market-based pricing spend. And that's a little bit of the outperformance last quarter, and the guide for continued outperformance is about being able to help give more touring customers to our agent partners. And then real-time touring on top of that is more of an accelerant, right?  So again, even with all that goodness in folks who want to take a tour as their starting point and the benefits that gives to Zillow and to our partners, the majority of those tours don't get fulfilled when the customer wants to take it, right? That's part of why we've made such a huge investment. I mean it's a great customer introduction, but it's still hindered with tons of friction and the agent having to jump through hoops to get the customer at the time they want to go see the home and make all that happen. And so if we can remove all that friction, it just sets the agent up to do what they do best, and that's why we talk so much about reducing the friction in the process, leading to higher work with rates, which are all of these early indicators of increasing transactions on top of that.  So on the one hand, you're right. More touring customers is better, and then more real-time touring within that is even better, and so it's really the benefits of both that will show up in the revenue over time.\nBradley Erickson: Got it. Maybe just one follow-up related to that then. Are you saying then that you're also -- I recognize the real-time touring rolling it out in 4 markets, et cetera, and going presumably nationwide over time. But are you also seeing a mix of touring leads within the broader business? Is that what you're saying? Or am I not understanding that right?\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes, that's correct, and we've talked about it before. Increasing just the overall share of connections or leads to our agents that are tour types of connections, it's something we have been working on for the last number of quarters. And so you've seen those gains in our performance, and we will continue to work on that. Again, it all goes back to that customer choice of am I trying to ask a question, do I want to just go see the home, do I want to go see the home virtually, as Rich talked about, or do I need to answer a financing question first. And so as we get better at helping identify what the customer is trying to do and serve them up the right experience, that increases the number of folks that go through each door as well as increases the quality of the folks that go through each door.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Vincent Cardos with Jefferies.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Vincent on for John Colantuoni at Jeffries. I have a follow-up on real-time touring as well. Is there any color you're able to provide on the impact specifically from real-time touring in your test markets that you're seeing on the cost per transaction, the rate at which Premier Agents to introduce clients to Zillow Home Loan officers or the ultimate mortgage attachment rate buyers?\nJeremy Wacksman: This is Jeremy. I mean I don't think anything beyond what we've given. I mean cost-wise, it's not really different. I mean, I guess you could argue at scale and with mature technology, it might be a little more efficient because there's less hoops and less steps to go make the tour happen. That's one of the big benefits of the showing time platform, right? When listing agents are using showing time to manage their listings, they're more efficient, and their communications with all the buy-side agents that they need to work with to get that home sold is more efficient. So you could imagine a world of more efficiency generally on the overall kind of cost of a tour or cost of a listing. We don't really think about that way on our customer experience.  And then in terms of adoption rates, I mean the only thing I'll say there is, in general, if we're able to make the connection between the buyer and the agent happen more often when the buyer gets what they want, we see the buyers say they want to work with that agent and have a great experience with that agent more often and not then you would expect would lead to higher success rate working in transaction with that agent referring them to other services and having that integrated transaction. So nothing to share at this early stage. But that's why we're so focused on reducing that friction and increasing that success rate, is because we can make that happy connection happen, and those folks end up working together. That's where the transaction goodness flows from.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Got it. And then one more quick one on the financing side of the business as well as new comer agents, is there anything you're able to tell us at this point about kind of what you've seen as mortgage rates have started to stabilize a little bit in kind of the 6.3% to 6.4% range over the past month or 2 year?\nRichard Barton: Are you seeing -- Brad, maybe? Are you seeing anything I mean my commentary on the macro is it kind of more of the same. Brad, are you seeing anything -- how have our e-com forecast for, say, transactions for the year changed recently, not much, right?\nBradley Berning: Yes, not much. I think you saw out of the March quarter, we were talking about around $4.4 million, $4.5 million for the full year, I think we're looking at like $4.3 million now. So there's been some modest changes, but relatively modest as we bounce around at these levels.\nRichard Barton: Which are low. I mean they're low levels. We've said for a couple of quarters now that we think over the next 10 years, they're going to be 60 million home transactions. And our eyes are focused on that. We're investing for that, and we want to have a meaningful and increasing percentage of those transactions happen in our sphere, so that we can monetize it and we can deliver value by the Super App and many other means.\nOperator: The next question is from Tom White with D.A. Davidson.\nThomas White: Maybe just a couple on the enhanced partner network initiative. Can you -- what's the response been, I guess, with kind of other, for lack of a better word, nonenhanced agents in the markets where you've kind of rolled it out, including agents that maybe were Premier Agents but might not make the cut to be kind of enhanced? Just curious kind of how that dynamic is going, whether they're still getting leads. And then just a housekeeping question. The marketing spend that you called out that had originally been planned for the second half but pulled forward, can you maybe quantify that a bit for us?\nRichard Barton: Maybe, Jeremy, maybe you start and then Allen finish?\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes, yes. So on the enhanced markets, I mean, it's important to remember that our strategy for a while has been to try and enhance who we work with, right? The best of Zillow program, all of our work on kind of higher-quality agent partners and agent teams and all of our train that we do with our agents nationally, we have been preaching quality and working with them on quality experiences and how to work with our customers generally. And so the enhanced markets, where we're being even more directed and even more prescriptive, and really, we've consolidated around a fewer set of partners so we can more cleanly test more of these integrated experiences, just feels like a heightened version of that.  So the overall feedback of we want to work with the best, and we want to make sure you all can help us with our shared customer is not new, and so I think that helps with the conversation. Of course, as you align yourselves and make decisions, and we're always optimizing the partner network, you're going to have conversations that are great, and you're going to have conversations with folks where it's not working out as well. But that's really on the margin. And like I said, I think it's because, this has kind of been our strategy for a while now, and you're just seeing a more accelerated version of it in these 4 markets.\nRichard Barton: Do you want to hit the marketing, too? Or Allen, do you want to hit that?\nAllen Parker: I'm happy to hear me talk. Or Jeremy...\nRichard Barton: I would just say on the marketing the majority of the tick up for marketing and advertising spend is based on seasonality. So the amounts that we're pulling from the second half as we're ready to test around some of our initiatives in our enhanced markets is a smaller portion of the tick up. And then there was an even smaller portion of what was pushed from Q1 to Q2. So again, the big driver here is seasonality, but we are excited that we're able to test some things earlier than expected, and so we've made those switches throughout the year in prioritizing that spend and moving it around. I don't know, Jeremy, would you add anything?\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. No, I think that's right.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jay McCanless with Wedbush.\nJay McCanless: Sorry to press on this topic, but still not understanding. When you talk about the better-than-expected number of connections, that -- those connections weren't from a specific app or a specific process that you have there, but it's more you fix the pipeline of how those leads got to the agents. And I guess the kind of the second part of that question is, if that pipeline wasn't working before, do you feel like you may have lost some business that now you'll be gaining and helping you to grow ahead of the market?\nRichard Barton: Jeremy, it sounds like you have a reasonable -- I mean...\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. I mean, I guess, I think, Rich, you talked about it earlier as fixing our leaky funnel, right? It's really...\nRichard Barton: I don't like to talk about it as a leakage funnel anymore. That implies we're broke. We're like smoothing. We're getting better at converting the leads that are already in our funnel into transactions.\nJeremy Wacksman: And I think that's probably the right way to think about it to your question, Jay. It's not that we are missing something before. It's that as we make it easier for people to find what they want, both digitally before they go submit, but then also post submit as they connect with either a Premier Agent partner or someone in the Zillow ecosystem or as the software works to follow up with them, it's all those little things to help that customer ultimately turn into the right type of connection to our partners.  And so we've talked for a while now about focusing on mid-funnel. That's really what that is. It's -- we have 200-plus million folks coming to our webs and apps -- website and apps every month, and yet we're only a fraction of those folks are transacting with our partners in some form or fashion. And so being able to find the places to help nurture those folks along and convert those folks into transactions and into relationships with our Premier Agent and our loan officers, that's really what the work is. And so it's not about if you pro forma that in history with something missing, it's more about smoothing, to use Richard's point, versus fixing what was a funnel that had a lot of drop-off steps in it.\nRichard Barton: And it has all kinds of stuff we're doing way up funnel to personalize and prequalify people and get them ready to be handed off. Right through the handoff and the quality of the partner is really important as we've been as we've been talking about. And then after we introduced them to the partner, getting them all the way to the transaction and integrating financing and integrating touring. And anyway, it's a continuum. There isn't like some discrete handoff point, and then we wash our hands and we're done with it. No, our whole business model has been reoriented around aligning our interests from a business model perspective with the customers' interest of actually getting into their house and getting a mortgage. And that aligns it with our partner's interest, too. And so you're going to hear, like it or not, a lot more of this in the quarters to come. And as Jeremy was saying, there's just a lot of wood to chop here, like we have so much wood to chop because we basically get a look at every mover. Almost every mover comes and uses one of our sites or apps, and we're only monetizing an embarrassingly small portion of them right now.\nJay McCanless: Understood. All right. And then the second question I had -- and kudos on the growth in new construction. And I was wondering, you said when you were given the guidance about resi being down 10% in the midpoint, probably doing better than the overall market. Is that just Zillow's residential revenue versus existing homes? Or is there a forecast around new housing growth built in there? And if so, maybe could you talk about what you're thinking the growth rates for those 2 different types of housing would be\nBradley Berning: Do you want me to start on that, Rich?\nRichard Barton: Yes, yes. Sure, Brad.\nBradley Berning: So the existing home sale forecast that we talked about is we're talking about down 18% to down 28% in total transaction dollar volumes for Q2, and so our residential outperformance we talked about is versus that existing home market. That does not include, obviously, the new home market. The new home market is a smaller part of our overall business. So the part that more closely correlates with our business is the existing home sales, so that's why you see us reference that and correlate. And as we called out, the things that are driving the benefits that we see in Q1, we expect to continue into Q2.\nOperator: This completes the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Rich Barton for any closing remarks.\nRichard Barton: Well, great chatting with everybody. Thanks for taking the time on this busy earnings day. You can see we feel really good about a bunch of incremental improvements adding up to good relative results, good results relative to the industry. We look forward to chatting with you soon. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad. And thank you, Hanna. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for dialing in today. We are excited to share our first quarter results and the progress we've made on our growth strategy since we last spoke in February. As I noted during our last earnings call, 2023 is critical for Zillow, and I'm pleased with how we've started the year. Total revenue of $469 million and EBITDA of $104 million surpassed the top end of our outlook. This outperformance is due to a combination of progress that we've made since reorienting the company in early 2022, along with favorable relative tailwinds in a tough housing environment.  Since the beginning of 2022, we have made significant investments in improving our customer funnel, capturing more customer demand and connecting more of that demand to our strengthening partner network, resulting in increased conversion rates in Premier Agent. We have focused on many improvements in our customer funnel experience by offering clear call to action that quickly and efficiently help solve customer needs. These numerous incremental changes collectively have been adding up to make a real impact on our business. The most tangible example we made over the last year is providing easier ways for buyers to request home tours on Zillow apps and sites. This has resulted in less drop-off in our funnel, which is a key driver behind improved expected lead volumes of higher intent customers, which does not yet even account for the benefits I'll discuss shortly from real-time touring. Overall, it has been nice to see our focus and investments begin to pay off, with our year-over-year residential revenue outpacing the broader real estate market by 1,300 basis points and an expectation that we will see continued relative gains in Q2.  Beyond our revenue gains relative to the industry, we are also pleased with the profit leverage in our business model. Our EBITDA outperformance for the quarter is a nod to how nicely revenue outperformance can flow through to the bottom line when we prudently manage costs. We couple these results with a strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with $3.4 billion in cash and investments even after buying back $86 million of stock in Q1.  Interestingly and unexpectedly during the quarter, we have felt the first tremor of what we believe to be a coming earthquake in the broader technology landscape with the introduction of OpenAI's ChatGPT. We believe the arrival of conversational generative AI may well be a platform shift on par with the introduction of the graphical user interface or the touch interface on the first smartphones.  Artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision and the use of data have been core to Zillow since our founding. Our AI journey began in 2006 with the invention of the Zestimate, which required massive amounts of data and the machine learning algorithm, albeit one that looks quite primitive versus what we have deployed today. What started with AI and Zestimate expanded to more parts of the product in the year as follows: advancements with our new neural Zestimate, computer vision-powered rich media experiences, AI-generated immersive floor plans and natural language search queries are 4 more recent examples of how these capabilities show up in our products and services today.  The launch of ChatGPT and now new Bing and Bard have brought AI out of the basement and into the life for all of us to interact with. We recognize that it is in its infancy, that it is evolving incredibly fast and that it is fraught on many levels. However, we are excited and confident in our ability to harness its power to drive growth. We believe this technology will improve our customer and partner experiences, meaningfully increase the productivity of our employees and the velocity of our output and ultimately drive growth for both Zillow and our partners' businesses. We are well positioned for this opportunity not only because we have understood and been early adopters of important new platforms as they emerged, like we did with iOS and Android, but also because we have the brand, the audience, and the access to large proprietary relevant data sets as well.  There is another valid worry out there about how ChatGPT might disrupt the physics of the way people search, find and navigate the web itself. At Zillow, we are experimenting aggressively to understand this new paradigm. OpenAI's ChatGPT has a limited release alpha plug-in program that enables select app developers to have API-level platform access. We launched an alpha version Zillow plug-in yesterday, which operates in a small sandbox but with which we will learn and iterate rapidly. Again, I am confident that Zillow is well positioned for whatever disruption may come not only because we are leaning in hard, but because we own our own customer demand.  The #1 core value at Zillow is that the customer is our north star. Starting with the Zestimate, we have released a drumbeat of magical product innovations, which empower, entertain and engage our customers throughout their home shopping journey. That has freed us to predominantly market Zillow by a good old word of mouth boosted by great PR and brand marketing. We have always believed that the product itself is the most important part of the marketing mix. This has worked well for us. Our brand has grown to become the best known and trusted name in real estate. Zillow is the leading real estate app and site in the U.S. according to comScore.  While we recognize and respect that SEO and SEM have a real and important place in the marketing mix, we have always been keenly aware that any vertical sites over dependence on SEO and SEM makes it strategically fragile. Today, over 80% of our traffic comes to us directly. This is rare and very good. The direct branded relationship we have with our customers will help us well into the future.  As you all know, a few years ago, we embarked on a new frontier, it digitized the real estate transaction itself, to convert and monetize a small but increasing percentage of the 200 million average monthly unique users on our asset sites, turning them into transactors. Our growth investments are focused on improving the transaction experience so that we might not only help people search and find homes but also help them buy, sell, finance and rent and ultimately get into the next home with more ease, more transparency, more efficiency than ever before. We've been laying the groundwork for our transaction strategy for quite some time and believe this is how we both differentiate and continue to grow our business and our brand, by being the destination for buyers, sellers and renters end-to-end housing transaction needs.  This strategy of shifting our focus and efforts down funnel to the transaction is manifest in what we call our Housing Super App vision, an integrated end-to-end experience to help our customers move. Our goal is to increase engagement, customer transactions and revenue per customer transaction by investing across 5 growth pillars: touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services. The expected output of this strategy is to grow our share of customer transactions from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025.  On our road map, 2023 is about execution, steadily rolling out products in constrained geographies across our 5 growth pillars and integrating them to create a seamless experience for our customers and partners. We are obviously excited about all the tech-enabled solutions we're building to improve the gnarly process of moving, but we are clear-eyed about the importance of connecting that technology to our critical partners in the physical world as well as the physical homes and apartments that are available for sale or rent.  Rich, smart integration within our ecosystem is crucial to our Housing Super App vision, be it connecting with the Premier Agent partner that tours homes with you; after you book it with showing time or working with the Zillow Home Loans Officer; who secures your mortgage. We are bringing this seamless, connected experience to various markets throughout the country with our first 4 in Raleigh, Denver, Atlanta and Phoenix.  I'll kick off our product road map progress report with touring; stepping into the home, whether virtually through a 3D -- Zillow 3D home interactive floor plan, where our computer vision technology makes it feel like you're walking through the home; or in person when you are actually physically touring the home with their Premier Agent partner brings the shopping experience to let. So when we talk about touring, we're talking about the point-of-sale moment when dreamers turn into customers. This means capturing the attention of the users who are currently dreaming and scrolling at the top of the funnel and providing them with a tangible step into the real life home shopping experience of touring a home.  This is one of our big bets and a critical piece of our product road map because our data shows that movers who requested to convert to buyers at 3x the rate of other actions on Zillow. And making improvements to the home tour process is critical to achieving the seamless, connected experience we envision. Enabled by showing times integration with Zillow, real-time touring allows eligible buyers to get a tour confirmed in less than an hour with much less friction in the process.  In February, we shared early results we were seeing with real-time touring in Atlanta. Connection rates were higher, and customers were more likely to work with our Premier Agent partners. That trend continued in Q1, leading to more tours being fulfilled and early indications of higher transaction rates. I'm pleased to share we have now rolled out real-time touring in our other 3 enhanced markets: Raleigh, Denver and Phoenix. Combined with the other initiatives we're driving in our enhanced markets, real-time touring is improving our funnel, driving meaningful improvements in our ability to connect higher-intent customers to our Premier Agent partners.  Beyond our improvements in tour, we are continuing to enhance our partner network. As we've discussed, our Premier Agent partners are critical to delivering integrated service and, therefore, growth. What's good for our customers is good for our agent partners. Helping customers find and win their homes also helps agents grow their businesses. We are holding ourselves accountable to connect higher-intent customers to our partners and are holding our Premier Agent partners accountable to higher-performance standards as well. Across all 4 enhanced markets, we meaningfully consolidated our partner network with a focus on Premier Agent partners, who convert leads into transactions best, who treat our customers best and who are motivated to grow their businesses alongside us. And we are seeing the operational benefits from working with a tighter set of partners.  First, we're able to work more closely to deliver a brand-aligned experience to our shared customers. And second, it has allowed us to quickly test new products and services and evaluate in real time how things are going before we scale. Most importantly, we are seeing improvements in customer satisfaction and engagement as we connect customers with our strongest partners in each market.  For our next product road map update, I'll cover financing. This is an important investment for us because 87% of homes purchased are financed for the mortgage, 40% of all homebuyers start their journey shopping for a mortgage, and 80% of those don't yet have an agent. We told you before that we've turned our attention towards building the foundation for a substantial first-party, direct-to-consumer purchase mortgage origination business. Our top priorities include building overall awareness for Zillow Home Loans, building a better digital mortgage experience, bolstering our loan officers tools and capabilities and working closely with our Premier Agent partner base to build integrated processes. And we're making progress on all fronts.  You may recall last quarter, we spoke about the 2 broad ways in which customers connect with Zillow Home Loans, property first and financing first, though aimed based on whether our customer entered their transaction journey through a property inquiry or through a mortgaging for. I'll start with property first, which is when our Zillow Home Loans lead comes back to us from a Premier Agent partner who is working with a home shopping customer we had previously sent them. We are now seeing roughly 1 in 3 Premier Agent partners in our enhanced markets introduce customers to Zillow Home Loans, up from roughly 1 in 5 last quarter. Continue to drive conversion here, we focused on making it much easier for Premier Agent partners to connect customers with Zillow Home Loans, which makes for a more seamless connection process that generates a better customer experience.  First, it provides our customers optionality. For customers who may have sought financing advice elsewhere, our management partners can give them the choice to speak with the Zillow Home Loans Officer if they want to seek a second opinion. Second, our Premier Agent partners can connect a customer to a Zillow Home Loans officer with confidence because they can choose the loan officer who specializes in their market and who can provide a more knowledgeable, personalized financing experience.  Let's now switch over to financing first, the other entry point, which is when a customer starts their moving journey by getting prequalified before they are connected to an agent. We've made some very good progress here. We've begun turning the dial on a number of different strategies to build overall awareness of Zillow Home Loans, including recently rolling out an update on the Zillow app to put financing at the forefront of the customer experience.  We've rolled out a central hub for financing on the navigation bar at the bottom of the app, which gives the customer multiple options, including Calculate What You Can Afford tool and a direct connection to Zillow Home loans via a Get Prequalified button. We began rolling this out in early April and expect it to be available to customers nationally by the end of Q2. We've also shipped an affordability search filter that gives home shopper the ability to customize the home details page only showing them homes that fit within their monthly mortgage payment budget. These are 2 examples of how we're putting financing at the forefront, working to improve awareness of Zillow Home Loans and shipping features of the Housing Super App as we strive to solve our customers' complicated problems.  As we've said before, we think there is a big prize for us in purchase mortgage originations, and extending the Zillow's umbrella over mortgages is a critical part of our transformation. As a result of all of our efforts across our mortgage investments, purchase loan origination volumes in Q1 doubled year-over-year.  So I feel quite good about progress against that which we can control. But of course, we continue to live in a very challenging housing macro environment with no clear indications of a term. Transactions continue to be low. High demand to move supports a stable pricing environment, but high rates has somewhat locked sellers into their existing low rate mortgages. So we see record combined new home and new apartment inventory on the way, it will take quite some time to balance demand with supply and to normalize the market. And while we may see rates come down at any time, we are certainly not counting on it. Meanwhile, we are well capitalized generating positive operating cash flow and heads down making progress on our growth plan, converting traffic into transactions with the help of our rapid product innovation and our increasingly intertwined relationships with our terrific partners and loan officers.  To close, I am pleased with how we started the year, as evidenced by our solid Q1 results. That said, we have a lot of work to do to drive outsized gains in our share of customer transactions moving forward, and our team is focused on delivering on our product road map and service of our customers. We appreciate you all being on the journey with us and look forward to connecting with you in the days and weeks ahead.  With that, I'll pass it over to Allen. Allen? No. We hear you, Allen. Yes, we got you, Ron. Ron, this is Rich. I think the -- probably, Jeremy, you're best positioned to address the higher conversion mid-funnel question, and then we'll talk about the second part. Yes. And on the mortgage question, Ron, I mean we see it as a huge progress to go from 1 out of 5 Premier Agents in our enhanced markets referring or sending a ZHL potential customer back to us after we sent them the customer. Originally, growing to 1 out of 3 is a pretty big win. Obviously, we have a lot of room to go. Ultimately, it will show up in the number of purchased mortgages we complete. But I think the answer to your question about how do we increase penetration, well, we're up 100% year-over-year. We can continue at that pace. That's pretty good. But it's probably the answer, maybe Jeremy can chime in, but it's more probably 100 more little things on funnel improvement, 100 more things like Jeremy had just talked about in terms of touring.  I gave a couple of examples in my script of seemingly basic but really important stuff around insertion of Zillow Home Loans into the Zillow app itself in a really natural and prominent and logical way. That's just Step 1. We see a long road of improvement ahead of us. And I, for one, will tell you my expectations are quite high. Are you seeing -- Brad, maybe? Are you seeing anything I mean my commentary on the macro is it kind of more of the same. Brad, are you seeing anything -- how have our e-com forecast for, say, transactions for the year changed recently, not much, right? Which are low. I mean they're low levels. We've said for a couple of quarters now that we think over the next 10 years, they're going to be 60 million home transactions. And our eyes are focused on that. We're investing for that, and we want to have a meaningful and increasing percentage of those transactions happen in our sphere, so that we can monetize it and we can deliver value by the Super App and many other means. Maybe, Jeremy, maybe you start and then Allen finish? Do you want to hit the marketing, too? Or Allen, do you want to hit that? I would just say on the marketing the majority of the tick up for marketing and advertising spend is based on seasonality. So the amounts that we're pulling from the second half as we're ready to test around some of our initiatives in our enhanced markets is a smaller portion of the tick up. And then there was an even smaller portion of what was pushed from Q1 to Q2. So again, the big driver here is seasonality, but we are excited that we're able to test some things earlier than expected, and so we've made those switches throughout the year in prioritizing that spend and moving it around. I don't know, Jeremy, would you add anything? Jeremy, it sounds like you have a reasonable -- I mean... I don't like to talk about it as a leakage funnel anymore. That implies we're broke. We're like smoothing. We're getting better at converting the leads that are already in our funnel into transactions. And it has all kinds of stuff we're doing way up funnel to personalize and prequalify people and get them ready to be handed off. Right through the handoff and the quality of the partner is really important as we've been as we've been talking about. And then after we introduced them to the partner, getting them all the way to the transaction and integrating financing and integrating touring. And anyway, it's a continuum. There isn't like some discrete handoff point, and then we wash our hands and we're done with it. No, our whole business model has been reoriented around aligning our interests from a business model perspective with the customers' interest of actually getting into their house and getting a mortgage. And that aligns it with our partner's interest, too. And so you're going to hear, like it or not, a lot more of this in the quarters to come. And as Jeremy was saying, there's just a lot of wood to chop here, like we have so much wood to chop because we basically get a look at every mover. Almost every mover comes and uses one of our sites or apps, and we're only monetizing an embarrassingly small portion of them right now. Yes, yes. Sure, Brad. Well, great chatting with everybody. Thanks for taking the time on this busy earnings day. You can see we feel really good about a bunch of incremental improvements adding up to good relative results, good results relative to the industry. We look forward to chatting with you soon. Thanks a lot."

            "name": "Jeremy Wacksman",
            "content": "John, this is Jeremy Wacksman. I'll take that one. Yes, as Rich talked about, in general, the touring customer converts at a higher rate intrajection than a nontouring customer. And in our enhanced markets where we're piloting this real-time touring, right, this ability to really kind of book your tour nearly instantly, we see less friction, which plugs the holes in the funnel and increases both the customers' ability to get the tour when they want. It also increases the ability for those customers to connect with our Premier Agent partners, and they report higher propensity to work with those Premier Agents. So all those things lead to a higher tour fulfillment rate.  If you ask those customers, do they get to see the home when they want to see it, they're able to more often, and they end up liking working with the agents they're working with more often. So all of those mid-funnel metrics are really good indicators of higher transaction rates. As you know, transaction cohorts take a long time to mature. That's why we're giving you all kind of early indicator data on what historically looks like higher transaction rates. And as we get that data in those markets, we'll share more. Yes. It's a great question on mortgage in the long term. And as Rich also talked about, very early and very focused on getting the machine, the factory, the partners and the customer experience all right and all working well together. You're right to point out, we do believe we have a great CAC advantage in mortgage. The 2 hardest things, I think, for a stand-alone mortgage company to work through are how to acquire customers and how to find a great referral network of agent partners, and those are the 2 advantages that we have at Zillow with our fantastic brand and audience. As Rich talked about, many customers on Zillow today are starting with that financing question, and so starting to explore ways to connect them with our own offering as well as have our agent partners refer those customers back to us who want to start with a property inquiry. So you're correct in that, that CAC advantage, which, in some cases, is 25% of industry cost is one for us.  I think it's too early to say how we might look to structure the business long term. I guess the only comment I'll make is that as we've been growing this business carefully with our great loan officers, our great agent partners, the feedback we get is what folks care most about is closing on time and having a great and high level of service. So of course, they want great value. But as we're building the technology and the people operations to make this go, the real value to a customer and to their agent is, is the loan going to close on time, do I have transparency on when that's going to happen, and do I get a great level of service. And so that's really what we're focused on. And we think if we can deliver that, that's a great business with great margins. Yes. This is Jeremy. I'll take that one, too. Thanks. Nothing to share yet other than, as Rich talked about, we're really excited that we went from 1 market to 4 markets in the last quarter. And of course, as we continue to see the signals of better customer experience, better funnel performance and also better agent feedback, we're excited to figure out how can we bring that to more customers and more partners in more markets.  I will just caution the complexity of that and the reason we're doing this market by market is because it is a new workflow. So to the customer, it maybe looks invisible that you click this button on Zillow and something better happens and there's less friction, but it's an entirely different way for agent team to connect with those customers than what they've done before. And so that's why we've been very methodical in working closely with these great, optimized partners we're working with to help them figure out how to retrain their agent teams to go meet these customers where they are. So part of the benefit of it is the less friction on the digital side. Part of the other benefit is the less friction on the operational side, and making sure we get that right with each partner is something we're really focused on. Yes. Yes, I'm happy to take the first one. Yes. I mean Rich talked a little bit in his prepared remarks around just overall reducing funnel friction. Just as a way to tease out, I think all of the consumer improvements and technology improvements we've made on our sites and apps independent of real-time touring, we spend a lot of time talking about our growth pillars with you all, but there are many folks hard at work at Zillow just improving the customer experience for customers using our sites and apps outside of those markets and the partner experience and the software and the processes.  And so that's things like exposing more folks and being more clear on the call to action on our websites and apps with what is a touring request, what is the financing request and what is the question that they want to ask. That's things like the software to ensure that customers more quickly can get connected with a partner when they want to ask that question and getting the right data from them to make sure that handoff and that live transfer to the agent goes well.  So all these little things are very small, but they add up to very meaningful improvements in the number of customers that ultimately get connected and get a question answered to get what they want and then ultimately the quality of those connections to our agent partners. So I think that's -- it's more just teasing out all those relative improvements to the national experience juxtaposed against these very specific growth levers that we also are obviously very excited about. Yes. I mean maybe the only thing I'll add is just some comments Rich made earlier. I mean our priority for growing and scaling the overall mortgage business are building the overall awareness for Zillow Home Loans. The majority of our customers on our website who ask a financing question have no idea that we offer a mortgage. Building that better digital mortgage experience, which gave a couple of examples of that, we have this very fortunate position where folks who know they need and want a mortgage are spending all their time on Zillow shopping. And helping them understand their affordability and their financing questions and getting those answered on their way towards taking a tour or getting prequalified is a unique opportunity for us. And then building a great platform for loan officers, helping them be efficient and provide and deliver great service for those customers. And then lastly, connecting that customer with an agent partner and having that experience be integrated. Because when you are buying, you're working with your agent and you're working with your loan officer to make your decision and actually get your transaction done.  So it sounds simple to work across those 4 things, but it does require really great technology and process to be built across all 4 of those things to be able to take it from a smaller number of people to a far larger number of people. So we're just constantly working on all 4 of those, and we'll turn the dial as we make progress on them. Yes. This is Jeremy. I'll grab that. I mean you're right on the one hand, as we are able to get more touring customers to agents, they are paying for those already more, especially in the Flex postpay model. And then in theory, they're paying more for that in terms of increased ROI in their market-based pricing spend. And that's a little bit of the outperformance last quarter, and the guide for continued outperformance is about being able to help give more touring customers to our agent partners. And then real-time touring on top of that is more of an accelerant, right?  So again, even with all that goodness in folks who want to take a tour as their starting point and the benefits that gives to Zillow and to our partners, the majority of those tours don't get fulfilled when the customer wants to take it, right? That's part of why we've made such a huge investment. I mean it's a great customer introduction, but it's still hindered with tons of friction and the agent having to jump through hoops to get the customer at the time they want to go see the home and make all that happen. And so if we can remove all that friction, it just sets the agent up to do what they do best, and that's why we talk so much about reducing the friction in the process, leading to higher work with rates, which are all of these early indicators of increasing transactions on top of that.  So on the one hand, you're right. More touring customers is better, and then more real-time touring within that is even better, and so it's really the benefits of both that will show up in the revenue over time. Yes, that's correct, and we've talked about it before. Increasing just the overall share of connections or leads to our agents that are tour types of connections, it's something we have been working on for the last number of quarters. And so you've seen those gains in our performance, and we will continue to work on that. Again, it all goes back to that customer choice of am I trying to ask a question, do I want to just go see the home, do I want to go see the home virtually, as Rich talked about, or do I need to answer a financing question first. And so as we get better at helping identify what the customer is trying to do and serve them up the right experience, that increases the number of folks that go through each door as well as increases the quality of the folks that go through each door. This is Jeremy. I mean I don't think anything beyond what we've given. I mean cost-wise, it's not really different. I mean, I guess you could argue at scale and with mature technology, it might be a little more efficient because there's less hoops and less steps to go make the tour happen. That's one of the big benefits of the showing time platform, right? When listing agents are using showing time to manage their listings, they're more efficient, and their communications with all the buy-side agents that they need to work with to get that home sold is more efficient. So you could imagine a world of more efficiency generally on the overall kind of cost of a tour or cost of a listing. We don't really think about that way on our customer experience.  And then in terms of adoption rates, I mean the only thing I'll say there is, in general, if we're able to make the connection between the buyer and the agent happen more often when the buyer gets what they want, we see the buyers say they want to work with that agent and have a great experience with that agent more often and not then you would expect would lead to higher success rate working in transaction with that agent referring them to other services and having that integrated transaction. So nothing to share at this early stage. But that's why we're so focused on reducing that friction and increasing that success rate, is because we can make that happy connection happen, and those folks end up working together. That's where the transaction goodness flows from. Yes, yes. So on the enhanced markets, I mean, it's important to remember that our strategy for a while has been to try and enhance who we work with, right? The best of Zillow program, all of our work on kind of higher-quality agent partners and agent teams and all of our train that we do with our agents nationally, we have been preaching quality and working with them on quality experiences and how to work with our customers generally. And so the enhanced markets, where we're being even more directed and even more prescriptive, and really, we've consolidated around a fewer set of partners so we can more cleanly test more of these integrated experiences, just feels like a heightened version of that.  So the overall feedback of we want to work with the best, and we want to make sure you all can help us with our shared customer is not new, and so I think that helps with the conversation. Of course, as you align yourselves and make decisions, and we're always optimizing the partner network, you're going to have conversations that are great, and you're going to have conversations with folks where it's not working out as well. But that's really on the margin. And like I said, I think it's because, this has kind of been our strategy for a while now, and you're just seeing a more accelerated version of it in these 4 markets. Yes. No, I think that's right. Yes. I mean, I guess, I think, Rich, you talked about it earlier as fixing our leaky funnel, right? It's really... And I think that's probably the right way to think about it to your question, Jay. It's not that we are missing something before. It's that as we make it easier for people to find what they want, both digitally before they go submit, but then also post submit as they connect with either a Premier Agent partner or someone in the Zillow ecosystem or as the software works to follow up with them, it's all those little things to help that customer ultimately turn into the right type of connection to our partners.  And so we've talked for a while now about focusing on mid-funnel. That's really what that is. It's -- we have 200-plus million folks coming to our webs and apps -- website and apps every month, and yet we're only a fraction of those folks are transacting with our partners in some form or fashion. And so being able to find the places to help nurture those folks along and convert those folks into transactions and into relationships with our Premier Agent and our loan officers, that's really what the work is. And so it's not about if you pro forma that in history with something missing, it's more about smoothing, to use Richard's point, versus fixing what was a funnel that had a lot of drop-off steps in it."

            "content": "Thanks, Rich. In Q1, we delivered results above our outlook for both revenue and EBITDA. Residential revenue also outperformed the tough housing industry, and we expect that trend to continue into Q2. Residential revenue was $361 million, down 14% year-over-year, outperforming the high end of our outlook range and the industry total transaction dollar decline of 27% according to data from the National Association of Realtors. The relative outperformance was driven by a combination of the strength of our brand, a better-than-expected number of customer connections provided to our Premier Agent partners from the investments we have made that Rich already discussed and favorable tailwinds relative to the industry that we've discussed before.  New construction revenue was also strong during Q1, growing 16% year-over-year as customers turned to new construction given tight housing inventory. Rentals revenue increased 21% year-over-year as rentals traffic on Zillow grew 16% year-over-year to 29 million average monthly unique visitors in Q1 for comScore despite industry headwinds in multifamily demand. Our industry-leading rentals traffic helped us drive accelerated year-over-year growth in the number of multifamily partners on our apps and sites when compared to Q4 2022. We also continue to see industry tailwinds with occupancy rates declining from historically high levels and lower rental customer demand, combined with new supply coming onto the market, drove an increased need for advertising for landlords.  Mortgages revenue was $26 million, with purchase loan origination volumes growing 9% sequentially and more than 100% year-over-year. We continue to make progress building our Zillow Home Loans-purchased mortgage business. We began to assign our centralized team of loan officers to specific geographic areas and enhance the ability for Premier Agent partners and their buyers to choose their loan officer. We also made changes to our apps and sites to show Zillow Home Loans to more customers. Given this progress and to meet customer demand, we plan to increase our number of loan officers in the coming months while we closely monitor operational efficiencies.  Our EBITDA expenses totaled $365 million in Q1, roughly flat from $362 million in Q4 and meeting the midpoint of the range implied in our outlook for Q1. We grew planned investments in our key growth initiatives with active cost management of other discretionary and nonpeople-related costs, such as direct advertising and marketing expenses, which were down both sequentially and year-over-year.  On a GAAP basis, net loss was $22 million in Q1, and net loss margin was 5%. EBITDA was $104 million, above the midpoint of our outlook range by $48 million in Q1. EBITDA margin was 22%. This outperformance demonstrates the inherent profit leverage in our business model and how quickly revenue outperformance can flow through to the bottom line.  We ended Q1 with $3.4 billion of cash and investments, flat from the end of 2022, which includes the benefit of net cash provided by operating activities as well as the impact of $86 million in share repurchases during Q1. convertible debt was $1.7 billion at the end of Q1.  Turning to our outlook for Q2. We expect total revenue to be $451 million to $479 million, implying a year-over-year decline of 8% at the midpoint of our outlook range. We expect residential revenue to be in the range of $341 million to $361 million, down 10% year-over-year at the midpoint of our outlook range as compared to our estimate for an industry transaction dollar decline between 18% and 28% year-over-year in Q2. This implies 4 consecutive quarters of outperformance relative to the industry.  For Premier Agent, we estimate revenue will decrease 9% to 13% year-over-year. We expect the investments we have made in our funnel will continue to deliver benefits into Q2. As the macro backdrop remains choppy, we continue to focus on the inputs we can control, adding value to our customers and shipping great products while actively managing costs.  For Q2, we expect EBITDA to be in the range of $61 million to $81 million, implying a 15% margin at the midpoint of our outlook range. Our outlook implies a planned increase in EBITDA expenses from $365 million in Q1 to a range of $390 million to $398 million for Q2, driven primarily by a sequential increase in marketing and advertising expenses, which is the largest driver. This is a combination of typical seasonal spending in Q2 and a pull forward of previously planned second half marketing as we are ready to test additional initiatives in our enhanced markets earlier than expected. We also have a small amount of advertising that we pushed from Q1 to Q2.  In addition, we expect a modest increase in planned hiring investments as we continue to support our growth strategy. Part of the increase includes some hiring timing that was moved from Q1 to Q2 and staffing up to support product and market launches during the remainder of the year. We also expect to add variable resources for increased activity levels, such as hiring of additional loan officers, evidence that our growth strategy is gaining traction. Taken as a whole, we believe Q2 EBITDA expenses will be close to the run rates we expect in the second half based on what we know today.  We are currently willing to look through the macroeconomic environment as we balance prudent investments while constantly seeking operating efficiencies across the business. We are making progress on reducing friction in our funnel, and we feel good about the progress we are making towards our growth pillars. We believe investing against our growth targets while managing costs is the right thing to do to drive customer transaction share and grow revenue per transaction. We have a high incremental margin business, where we expect to see operating leverage as we grow revenue across the housing industry cycle.  In closing, we remain in a strong position to invest against our strategy to better serve more customers, resulting in share growth and more revenue per transaction. As we look forward, our priorities remain focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners. We plan to continue to grow our customer engagement through compelling dream and shop experience; deliver a more integrated customer transaction experience to drive customers to choose to transact with us and our partners; invest in sustainable top line growth opportunities across the company, including new integrated services that are more scalable, less subject to earnings volatility and more capital efficient; and manage our cost structure and improve productivity, including continued prioritization of our investments that we expect will drive a profitable, scalable and positive operating cash flow company.  And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. I lose you? Okay. Yes. Thanks, Ryan. So what I describe is we gave some guidance kind of on our EBITDA OpEx to tick up in Q2, and we believe the guide we have for Q2 is pretty representative of what we expect in run rate as we close out the year. Obviously, as we see success and to the extent mortgage would be a great example, if volume were to tick up, there would be some variable resources that we'd hire to support that volume, but that would come also with the increase in revenue.  So I think in terms of modeling, what I would say is we're having to tick up from Q1 to Q2. We expect that run rate based on what we know today to be relatively consistent as we close out the year. And as we make progress on these -- as we make progress on our initiatives, again, we'll continue to look for ways to fund them. And I would expect some variable costs, but I would expect variable profits or revenue to come with that. I'm happy to hear me talk. Or Jeremy..."

We will now open the call with remarks followed by live Q&A. And with that, I will turn the call over to Jeremy Wacksman.\nJeremy Wacksman: Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us during a busy time of year. We are excited to share our third quarter 2024 results with you. With Zillow's leading brand, deep technology expertise, and strong financial foundation, we are successfully seizing our incredible opportunity to transform and digitize residential real estate on behalf of consumers, agents, and the broader industry. As you will hear again today, we are in a strong position executing our strategy well and delivering solid results. In Q3, we grew revenue by 17% and outperformed the residential real estate industry, all while demonstrating cost discipline as we steer towards sustainable, profitable growth. As with everything we do at Zillow, our approach begins with the customers we serve: movers, agents, and real estate industry professionals. We invest in providing products and services that offer a superior end-to-end transaction experience. This creates a top-of-funnel advantage, helps us identify and connect high-intent movers with high-performing partners, and alongside our software tools, this drives increased connection rates and conversion rates resulting in greater revenue. As we continue to leverage our cost structure, our consistent revenue outperformance shows up as expanded EBITDA margins. Those outcomes bolster our continued confidence in our strategy. Before I dive further into our results, I will remind you why we believe Zillow is best positioned to succeed in our ever-evolving industry. As we have said consistently throughout the past year, our perspective is grounded in Zillow's consumer advocacy principles. We believe in easy and free access to all available real estate information and listings, independent representation for buyers and sellers, and transparency regarding agent compensation and consumers' right to negotiate it. We launched Zillow with a promise to turn on the lights in real estate because we believe everyone benefits from transparency. An open, free marketplace is good for sellers, good for buyers, good for agents, and makes for the robust industry we have here in the US. As the industry has undergone its recent very healthy evolution toward more transparency, we are confident that Zillow and agents who work with us will benefit. This is clear to us for three reasons. First, Zillow has the most and highest intent movers. More than two-thirds of US homebuyers use Zillow today. About 80% of our users come to us organically, and we have three times more app users than anyone else in the category. We have built and maintained this strong brand position by staying focused on what the customer wants and needs, delivering impressive and delightful tech innovations that improve their moving experience. This quarter, for example, we have launched helpful new features, like comprehensive climate risk data, tools to help agents, loan officers, and movers streamline their communications, and upgrades to our AI-powered natural language search. The second reason is that we partner with top agents and teams across the country. Those that offer superior customer service and real value for movers, a deep understanding of the industry and their local market, and a proven ability to scale. These are the agents who are the most successful at growing their business alongside us and are poised to take customer share. Third, we expect to benefit as the industry evolves because we provide exceptional tech solutions to make moving more efficient. Not just for movers, but for agents, brokers, loan officers, and other real estate professionals as well. We believe a rising digital tide lifts all boats. Zillow's independent software solutions like ShowingTime, Dotloop, Bridge Interactive, and Follow-up Boss are already used by hundreds of thousands of professionals across the residential real estate industry. Our opportunity is to expand the breadth of those offerings and stitch them together, powering the industry to be more transparent, faster, and more integrated. Considering all the professionals we are already serving today with our digital workflow tools and foundational technologies, we believe this represents a significant opportunity for Zillow to better serve customers and drive transactions within Zillow's ecosystem. It is solutions like these combined with our many products and services for movers that together make Zillow a housing super app, giving buyers, sellers, agents, and the industry the seamless, integrated, and tech-enabled experience they demand and deserve. Now onto our third quarter 2024 results. I am excited to share that we reported total revenue of $581 million in Q3, up 17% year over year, exceeding our revenue outlook and outperforming the residential real estate industry. Q3 residential revenue grew 12% year over year to $405 million. Rentals momentum continued with $123 million in revenue in Q3, up 24% year over year. Multifamily rentals revenue is up 38% year over year, driven by growth in our multifamily property count. We are also making strong progress in mortgages; Q3 revenue was $39 million, accelerating to 63% year over year growth compared to 42% growth in Q2, with our purchase loan origination volume up 80% year over year. We are delivering strong revenue performance while growing our engaged audience of users. For Q3, we reported 233 million average monthly unique users across Zillow's ecosystem of apps and sites, according to our internal metrics, and 116 million average monthly unique visitors in Q3 according to Comscore. As you will recall, Comscore is widely viewed among Internet brands as a reliable, transparent third-party source because it aims to capture the number of unique visitors while deduplicating cookies. Our success is the result of solid execution on our growth strategy. On the for-sale side of our business, we are anchored by efforts in integrating our services, financing, touring, seller solutions, and enhancing our partner network. These investments are propelling us toward our goal to increase customer share to 6% by the end of 2025. We are also focused on expanding our rentals marketplace, which currently represents more than 20% of our revenue and is growing rapidly. The seamless transaction experience we have been building out on Zillow, the housing super app, is most fully experienced by customers in our enhanced markets. We have rolled out 43 enhanced markets thus far, surpassing our goal of reaching 40 by the end of this year. Heading into 2025, we expect to deepen our penetration in the existing markets and expand into more markets. We have been pleased with the progress we are making across the enhanced markets with this land and expand strategy, and we continue to expect enhanced markets to cover 20% of our connections by the end of this year. As of Q3, more than 80% of enhanced market connections are being managed through Follow-up Boss, an industry-leading customer relationship management system we acquired about a year ago. Follow-up Boss is used by many real estate agents and teams and manages 25 million leads each year. Our efforts to upgrade and integrate it are a key part of the Housing Super App experience we are building. For example, in Q3, we introduced new features including piloting in-app messaging to allow agents to communicate with buyers on Zillow, an in-app option to connect buyers directly to a loan officer with Zillow Home Loans, and new and improved client insights, allowing agents to tailor their services to an individual client's needs and interests. When the customer, agent, loan officer, and other services are connected through a common platform, movers have a more seamless experience, and real estate professionals can work more efficiently and serve their clients better. Overall, we are excited that our efforts in enhanced markets are beginning to deliver results. In February, we told you our first four enhanced markets had seen share gains of more than 50% since the beginning of 2023. Then in August, we told you it had risen to more than 80%. Now it has doubled since the beginning of 2023, and we are seeing similar trends in the enhanced markets we have launched since. As we land and expand in more enhanced markets and keep working across the business to increase connection and conversion rates, we expect to see share growth relative to the industry total transaction value, or TTV, in our residential and mortgages revenue. As you can see in the chart in our shareholder letter, our revenue per TTV has increased meaningfully over the past two years, a great proof point that our investments are having an impact on our business. Moving on to financing, we are building a substantial direct-to-consumer purchase mortgage origination business, integrated with our agent partner network, to offer the many mortgage seekers on Zillow financing options at the right point in their moving journey. Forty percent of all homebuyers start their home shopping journey looking for a mortgage, and more than 80% of those buyers do not yet have an agent. So when a high-intent customer comes to Zillow, whether they are starting with financing or starting by touring property and being connected with a great agent, we can help. Providing a more seamless experience for movers, agents, and loan officers helps identify high-intent customers in our funnel and drives conversion and revenue growth. Most notably, our efforts are accelerating mortgage growth. Origination revenue is beginning to scale, with purchase loan origination volume up 80% year over year in Q3, and mortgages revenue up 63% year over year to $39 million. In enhanced markets we have been in for more than six months, customer adoption rates for Zillow Home Loans are in the mid-teens, with newer markets trending similarly. At the same time, we are seeing higher transaction conversion rates for agent partners working with customers who choose Zillow Home Loans as we help agents and loan officers better serve customers together when they are ready to transact. We are also seeing an impact from our efforts to make booking a home tour as seamless as booking a restaurant reservation online. As we work to help more Zillow visitors transact, touring remains a critical focus area for us, both so we can identify high-intent buyers and so we can solve a process that has historically been full of friction, busy work, and back and forth. In 2021, we acquired ShowingTime, the industry leader in home touring technology, which facilitates five million showings a month across the country. Bringing ShowingTime onto Zillow's tech-enabled platform has uniquely positioned us to remove the friction in touring, helping high-intent buyers tour homes with ease and freeing up agents' time to focus on value-added services for movers. Our investments here are delivering improved connection rates, and today, more than 25% of our connections are coming through the digitized, improved, real-time touring experience, which is contributing to residential revenue outperformance. Meanwhile, our consumer-friendly touring agreement is helping agents adopt the new requirements stemming from the National Association of Realtors Settlement and is connecting them with higher-intent buyers who are more likely to take a tour. While agents are not required to use our touring agreement, it is available for more than 90% of our touring connections and is tailored by state. Our touring agreement process is automated and digital, setting a gold standard for the industry. This is an example of how we have adapted alongside the industry in a way that is positively evolving our business. We are also investing in seller solutions that not only make selling a home easier but also create real value for sellers and their agents. We are particularly excited about Zillow Showcase, which we made available nationwide beginning this year. As you will remember, Zillow Showcase elevates agents' brand presence on Zillow and provides a better shopping experience through our homegrown AI-powered rich media and floor plan technologies. There is truly nothing else like it on the market. Showcase listings are driving higher engagement compared to similar non-showcase listings on Zillow: more views, more shares, and more saves. Most important, however, is that Showcase listings are selling faster and for more money than similar non-showcase listings on our site. Zillow Showcase is already on nearly 1.5% of new for-sale listings nationwide, putting us on our way to achieving our intermediate-term goal of 5 to 10% listing coverage on Zillow. As we have said before, we believe a rising digital tide lifts all boats, which is why we continue to look for ways to improve and expand our offerings for the benefit of the broader residential real estate industry, whether through buying, building, or partnering. For example, last month, we acquired Virtual Staging AI, a company whose technology helps sellers, agents, and photographers create digitally staged listing images in seconds. And in October, we announced an agreement to share Zillow 3D home tours and interactive floor plans with Realtor.com, helping agents easily provide our leading immersive virtual content to more home shoppers. Finally, I will update you on our continued progress in rentals. As you know from our investor presentation six months ago, we have spent the past several years building a highly differentiated two-sided marketplace with a comprehensive suite of listings, combining multifamily properties with unique long-tailed properties, which we define as fewer than 25 units but primarily comprises single-family homes. As a result, Zillow is rapidly becoming the nationwide marketplace renters and landlords have sorely needed. And as we have said, we are in the best position to fix the fragmented rental experience because of our many years of success building great products for our massive audience of movers on the for-sale side. Renters on Zillow can shop, tour, apply, sign a lease, and pay rent securely. And property managers can list, book tours, screen applicants, create leases, sign them electronically, and collect rent payments all on one convenient platform: Zillow. These efforts to create a more seamless and convenient experience on both sides of the rental process are paying off, yielding growth in traffic, multifamily property count, and revenue. Our multifamily advertising campaign and our ongoing partnership to share rental listings with Realtor.com are also helping boost our success by contributing to increased customer awareness of Zillow Rentals. In Q3, our total average monthly rentals unique visitors were up 20% according to Comscore. We continue to expect multifamily to be the main engine of rentals revenue growth. We now have 47,000 multifamily properties on Zillow, having added close to 10,000 year to date, and multifamily revenue is up 38% year over year. As it stands today, with the combination of both long-tail and multifamily properties, we have the most rental listings in the country and consequently, the most users. With steady growth under our belts, we believe Zillow Rentals is well on its way toward the billion-dollar-plus revenue opportunity we see in front of us. Across the entire business, I am proud of the progress we are making to improve the experience of getting home. We have a much-loved and trusted brand, with the largest, most engaged audience of movers, a partner network made up of some of the best and most productive agents and teams in the country, a solid financial foundation, and deep tech expertise that allows us to invest in software solutions to benefit movers and the entire industry. Our business is increasingly diversified, and we have continued to outperform the industry while maintaining strong cost discipline. Looking ahead, we are focused on capturing a more meaningful share of the $30 billion accessible TAM in residential real estate, while continuing to deliver on behalf of our customers and shareholders. Thank you as always for being on this journey with us, and on that note, I will hand the mic over to CFO Jeremy Hofmann.\nJeremy Hofmann: Thanks, Jeremy, and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard, we delivered excellent results in Q3, and we are well-positioned to continue doing so as we execute on our strategy. Our Q3 2024 results exceeded expectations for revenue and EBITDA, with revenue up 17% year over year, to $581 million, which was $28 million above the midpoint of our range. Executing on our strategy drove double-digit year-over-year growth across each of our revenue categories, including residential, rentals, and mortgages. We outperformed the broader residential real estate industry by approximately 1,500 basis points, as the housing market grew 2% this quarter according to NAR. Additionally, we estimate that the total purchase loan volume for mortgage buyers, which is more aligned with our customer base for Premier Agent, declined low single digits in Q3, underperforming the overall housing market. On a GAAP basis, Q3 net loss was $20 million, representing 3% of our revenue. EBITDA was $127 million for the quarter, resulting in a 22% EBITDA margin. The combination of our revenue outperformance and effective cost management delivered better-than-expected EBITDA results in the third quarter. Residential revenue grew 12% year over year to $405 million, outperforming our outlook range. Our Premier Agent revenue benefited from continued conversion improvements as more buyers and sellers transacted with the Zillow agent partners. We also had a strong quarter of growth in Zillow Showcase, which now represents nearly 1.5% of all new for-sale listings in the country. Additionally, our new construction marketplace and the software solutions from ShowingTime Plus and Follow-up Boss performed well. The combination of these factors led to better-than-expected results. Rental's revenue grew 24% year over year in Q3 to $123 million, driven primarily by our multifamily revenue, which grew 38% year over year. We increased the number of multifamily properties on our apps and sites by 34% year over year, reaching an all-time high of 47,000 multifamily properties as of the end of Q3, up from 44,000 properties at the end of Q2. Total listings across our entire rentals marketplace were up 15% year over year, an industry-leading 1.9 million listings in September. With steady growth under our belts, we believe Zillow Rentals is well on its way toward the billion-dollar-plus revenue opportunity we see in front of us. Mortgages revenue growth accelerated in Q3, up 63% year over year to $39 million, with purchase loan origination volume growing 80% year over year to $812 million. Our mortgage strategy is leading to more buyers choosing financing through Zillow Home Loans. As expected, we are also seeing our purchase loan origination growth more closely aligned with mortgages revenue growth. This means our purchase mortgage revenue is now the main growth driver of our overall mortgages revenue category. Our disciplined cost management resulted in Q3 EBITDA expenses of $454 million, roughly in line with our outlook and allowed our Q3 revenue upside to flow to the bottom line. Additionally, our Q3 share-based compensation expense of $108 million was down year over year, and we are on track for these full-year 2024 expenses to decline from 2023 levels. As we execute on our growth strategy, we are successfully driving operating leverage. Looking ahead, as we continue to grow revenue, we expect this leverage to play out in both expanding EBITDA margins and sustainable profitable growth over time. We ended Q3 with $2.2 billion of cash and investments, down from $2.6 billion at the end of Q2, primarily due to the maturity and settlement of our 2024 convertible debt in September, which included aggregate cash payments of $610 million. This was partially offset by Q3 net cash provided by operating activities of $171 million. As of the end of Q3, we had $918 million of outstanding convertible senior notes. In December of this year, we will settle the $499 million of our outstanding convertible senior notes due in 2026. We issued a notice of redemption for these notes on October 8th, and we plan to repay the principal in cash and issue shares to satisfy any conversion premium. We have outstanding cap call hedges related to these notes, and we expect any dilution from settling the 2026 notes ultimately to be offset by settlement of the cap calls upon unwind or at maturity. Because the cap calls have additional value, as our Class C share price appreciates up to approximately $81 per share, we do not expect to settle the cap calls at this time, and we will continue to monitor and evaluate the economics of unwinding prior to maturity. After our Q4 debt settlement, we will have only the $419 million of senior convertible notes due in May 2025 outstanding. Our current expectation is that we will also settle the principal balance of these notes in cash, and any conversion premiums in shares of Class C capital stock. Once these notes are retired, we expect to be convertible debt-free in Q2 2025. As we look in aggregate, 2024 has been an important year for our capital allocation strategy. $1.2 billion of cash has or will soon be returned to shareholders via the settlement of our convertible senior notes. We have also had $301 million of share repurchases at a weighted average price of roughly $42. We are pleased with our execution this year. From the end of 2021 to today, we have repurchased approximately $2 billion of stock at a weighted average price of roughly $45. Our balance sheet is rock solid, and we believe the share repurchases we have made since the end of 2021 have been a great use of capital as we execute on our growth strategy and drive share price appreciation over time. Turning to our outlook for Q4, we expect total company revenue to be between $525 million and $540 million, implying a year-over-year increase of 12% at the midpoint of our outlook range. We expect residential revenue to be between $364 million and $374 million. Our residential revenue outlook for Q4 is driven by the normal seasonality of our Premier Agent revenue as well as the continued strength of revenue contributions from Zillow Showcase, ShowingTime Plus, new construction, and Follow-up Boss. We expect that the housing market will continue to bounce around at current levels, implying modest year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. While there continues to be pent-up desire to move, affordability remains a challenge. Our Q4 outlook takes this into consideration. We expect our rentals revenue to grow in the mid-20% range year over year in Q4 as we benefit from our execution on building our two-sided marketplace. Our multifamily rentals revenue is expected to grow faster than our overall rental revenue as we see the benefits of continued property expansion, our national rentals brand awareness campaign, and our partnership with Realtor.com. For mortgages, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid-60% range year over year. For Q4, we expect EBITDA to be between $90 million and $105 million, equating to an 18% margin at the midpoint of our outlook range, up approximately 300 basis points year over year. This implies EBITDA expenses will decrease from $454 million in Q3 to an estimated $435 million in Q4. The majority of the sequential decrease in EBITDA expenses from Q3 to Q4 is expected to be driven by seasonally lower advertising spend. Additionally, we expect our annual fixed cost run rate will continue to be approximately $1 billion, consistent with where we stood at the end of 2023. We are on track to deliver our original 2024 full-year target of double-digit revenue growth with EBITDA margin expansion. At the midpoint of our Q4 outlook ranges, our total company revenue in 2024 would be up 14% and our total company EBITDA margin in 2024 would be 22%, which implies approximately 200 basis points of margin expansion versus 2023. Before we close, I would like to take a moment to highlight the results we are seeing from the investments we have made over the past two years in our for-sale strategy. As you will recall, we look at revenue per total transaction value, or TTV, on a trailing twelve-month basis as a comprehensive indicator of relative growth against the residential real estate industry. When we combine our residential and mortgages revenue categories, which in aggregate represent our for-sale revenue, our revenue per TTV in Q3 was up 800 basis points year over year, and more than 2,000 basis points since the beginning of 2023. This is the culmination of investments we have been making over the past couple of years to improve our customer experiences so that we can identify high-intent movers and connect them with high-performing agents. This has helped us drive more connections and convert more buyers and sellers to transact with us and our partners. We are also beginning to benefit from the early stages of scaling our newer products to more markets, most notably with Zillow Home Loans, which has grown purchase loan origination volume by over 3x from the beginning of 2023 to now. We expect continued success in 2025 as we expand into more enhanced markets and provide more services within those markets, including offering more of our unique software solutions such as Zillow Showcase and Follow-up Boss. On the cost side, we understand it is important for us to demonstrate to our investors that the investments we have been making to increase top-line growth will result in expanding margins. As we have been saying for some time, we believe we are at the right fixed investment level to achieve our 2025 transaction share target and expect fixed investment costs to grow modestly with inflation. Our fixed costs remain just under a billion-dollar annualized run rate in Q3, growing only 4% year over year, and decreasing as a percentage of revenue by 500 basis points year over year, despite three acquisitions: Aerial, Follow-up Boss, and Spruce. Looking at variable costs, we have intentionally increased these costs as a percentage of revenue during 2024 as we invest in our rentals and Zillow Showcase sales teams, as well as additional Zillow Home Loans officers to support future expected growth. For marketing and advertising, we have been clear that we make discrete decisions to dial our efforts up or down based on the opportunities we see. The most obvious opportunity we have had on the marketing front has been for our rentals marketplace, and we have invested in a national campaign this year. This investment in Q2 and Q3 has noticeably expanded Zillow brand awareness for apartment seekers, and we are pleased with the early results. To close, it is clear we are executing on our strategy, and we are very excited about the opportunity ahead of us. We have a beloved brand with the largest, most engaged audience of movers, a partner network made up of some of the best and most productive agents and teams in the country, a solid financial foundation, and unmatched tech expertise to tackle the hard problems necessary to digitize this analog industry. As I look forward, we are growing across every part of our business with investments in place to drive future growth. We are disciplined on our costs, and we expect to drive sustainable profitable growth on our way to strong GAAP profits over time. And with that, operator, we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please click on the raise hand button which can be found on the black bar at the bottom of your screen. When it is your turn, you will receive a message on your screen from the host allowing you to talk, and then your name will be called. Please accept, unmute your audio, and ask your question. We will wait one moment to allow the queue to form. Our first question will come from John Colantuoni from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJohn Colantuoni: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a multipart question on real-time touring. Can you give us some perspective on how lead conversion for real-time touring is comparing to other types of connections? And I believe real-time touring generally lends itself to agents transitioning to the flex model. So I am curious if you could detail how many agents are transitioning to flex in markets you rolled out real-time touring, and if that transition is providing additional tailwinds to revenue given you are now more directly monetizing the commission through a product that has a higher lead conversion. Thanks.\nJeremy Wacksman: Hey, John. This is Jeremy Wacksman. On real-time touring, we have not broken out real-time touring versus other touring types, but we have for a while talked about how the touring customer in general converts to transaction at about a 3x the rate. And the other color I can give is real-time touring is going to be north of 25% of our connections by the end of the year. That has been our goal, and we are going to be ahead of that. We did talk a bit in the prepared remarks about seeing conversion improvements generally. Touring is obviously a piece of that, and so that is driving obviously the increased conversion generally as a component. In terms of payment model and kind of business model mix, real-time touring actually is available across both. And, again, it just goes back to our strategy of trying to help identify higher intent customers. Real-time touring does a pretty big job of that. And then trying to help land them with our best agent partners. As a reminder, you know, we work with lots of agents, but they represent the top end of the industry, the top 20% of the industry is the majority of our Premier Agent base. So we are really pleased as we are able to identify and hand them higher intent customers. You are seeing the benefits that play out in conversion.\nJohn Colantuoni: Thanks, Jeremy.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brad Erickson with RBC Capital Markets.\nBrad Erickson: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I have two. First on the kind of regulatory changes and just curious, you guys have obviously rolled out kind of a light version of the mandated buyer's agreements for agents. Just curious if you are seeing any structural changes to conversion where, you know, particularly those markets where that is kind of a brand new practice. And just curious if that is maybe at all affecting your market share on everything. And then second, just on Zillow Showcase, can you just remind us you gave the overall share of new listings, I know, in the prepared remarks and everything, but just remind us where you have kind of seen your market share of total listings or new listings go in some of the more mature markets, like the individual markets, if you could. Thanks.\nJeremy Wacksman: Sure. So let me take Zillow Showcase first, and then maybe we will do in reverse order. So on Zillow Showcase, yeah, we said in the prepared remarks it is now nearly 1.5% share of new listings. We just rolled it out nationwide earlier this year, and so the growth while has some dispersion in markets. We have not given out any kind of market mix details. I will say across the board, we continue to be really impressed that the product market fit holds as we grow that scale. So that higher engagements that we talked about, you know, 80% more page views, 75% more saves, 75% more shares, those stats hold across markets as we grow availability. And we are continuing to see homes sell faster and for more money. So 2% more, which is about $9,000 on average per home. And we continue to see agents who use it, as we talked about in the remarks, win more listings. They are winning about 20% more than similar agents who are not using Zillow Showcase. So we are still really early. You know, we just went nationwide earlier this year. And we see a long runway ahead of us. We talked about a 5 to 10% total active listing goal over time. And I think as we get to that level, Brad, I think we will have more maturity in markets to talk about the machinations across price points or geographies. But right now, it is still really early. And then on the buyer's agreement, we do not have any concrete data to share other than to say, we look at it as really helpful friction for the buyer. It is an education process. It is getting them through a really necessary education step, and it better prepares them to meet the agent. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, it is available on more than 90% of touring connections nationwide, and we have worked really hard to customize it where necessary by state. And we see this as a really healthy evolution and processing all these settlement changes to help start to educate the buyers on how this process works to make sure when they meet these great agents, they are even more educated on what to expect both in the initial tour and then in what to expect in the relationship if they choose to move forward.\nBrad Erickson: Got it. That is great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ron Josey with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRonald Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Jeremy, I wanted to ask a little bit more just about residential revenue, and Q3 is another quarter where revenue growth outperformed the broader industry, and I wanted to understand just the drivers of this outperformance and obviously, enhanced markets now in 43 markets, showcase listings we just talked about. Any insights on what is driving just the better overall outperformance would be helpful, I think. And then another sort of maybe bigger picture question on the overall go-to-market strategy. I think we saw a new head of agent sales was hired back in July. I want to understand just how Premier Agent sales might interact with showcase listing sales and just the overall and also the software and services sales team and just understanding go-to-market strategy overall going forward. Thank you.\nJeremy Hofmann: Yeah. Thanks, Ron. It is Jeremy Hofmann. I will take the first one, and then I will pass it to Jeremy Wacksman for the second one. I think across the business, we performed quite well in Q3. You know, we grew double digits in residential, rentals, and mortgages, and, obviously, total growth of 17% year over year, we are quite pleased with. Within residential, the drivers are a few folds. So one, PA just benefited from continued conversion improvements. You know, we have been investing pretty heavily in honing our funnel for a while at this point, and we are just seeing the benefits of those particularly as we go into more enhanced markets and we get more contributions from real-time touring. And then beyond that, we had another strong quarter of growth from Zillow Showcase, which is now, you know, nearly 1.5% of all new listings in the country. And that was all supplemented by the new construction marketplace continues to perform well. And the software solutions we are providing from ShowingTime Plus and Follow-up Boss are being well received too. So it really has been across the board, and something we are quite pleased with. And then, Jeremy, you want to hit the second one?\nJeremy Wacksman: Yeah. On the new sales leader, yes, that is the start of maybe more integration and scale for our sales organization to offer just a more seamless go-to-market to our agent community. And so you should expect to see us scale some of our products across that larger Salesforce and start to bring them to market in a more integrated fashion to date. We have been doing that in pockets and places, but our goal over time is to have, you know, one face to the industry to represent all of our products that will most notably show up in kind of our market-based pricing and showcase offerings. But over time, you can imagine that will scale beyond that.\nRonald Josey: That is great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Great. Thanks. I want to ask two things. I want to follow-up on Brad's question about these NAR settlement changes. And you just talk about what you have seen in the market so far? I guess we are three or four months into this. Does it from your perspective, has greater friction occurred in the market, or has it been largely immaterial so far? And then your comments also on stock-based compensation, you know, being down year over year. What is your goal with stock-based compensation kind of going forwards, you know, the next two years? Asked that from a perspective of trying to figure out when you get to kind of sustained GAAP, you know, profitability and stock-based compensation will be one key lever for that. So just talk about how you plan to manage that going forwards. Thank you.\nJeremy Hofmann: Great. Thanks, Mark. It is Jeremy Hofmann. I will take both of those. So I think on the NAR settlement impact, we cannot speak to broad commission trends just because 80% of our Premier Agent base is in that top 20% of all producers. So we are really working with top agents versus a broad swath of folks in PA. And for our agents across our PA business, we have seen commission rates stay in a tight band. Obviously, Q3 performance was quite strong. Being able to grow the total company revenue 17%, 12% across residential, and pretty substantially outperforming the category. We were really pleased. Beyond that, I would say we have been pretty consistent here for a while. We believe we and our partners are the outsized beneficiaries of any changes in the real estate industry. You know, we have the most customers. We work with the best partners, and we provide the most technology. So we expect our PAs will deliver value and get paid because they provide great service. And that we and they are sharetakers in really any evolution or dispersion of the industry. So that is how we are feeling on that front. And then the second question around stock-based compensation. We plan to leverage it going forward. So just as a reminder, our fixed cost base is in about the $1 billion range on an annualized basis. And 90% of our stock-based comp sits within that bucket. So as we are controlled on the fixed cost front and grow revenue, we will get more and more leverage on the SBC line that will drive to greater GAAP profitability over time.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Nicholas Jones with JPM Securities. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Jones: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, some follow-ups on the showcase. As you roll this out, can you kind of speak to the demand you are seeing in the market for the product? And I guess, what are you learning about how you are pricing it today and potentially where that can go against kind of the intermediate or longer-term targets you have for that business? Thank you.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yeah. Nick, happy to take that. So as we said a couple of times, it is early. We are really pleased at this early. We are at nearly 1.5% share of new listings. And the two things I would say we have learned so far is, you know, price which is variable by home price and geography, lands well with agents and teams. The big challenge is helping them work through their workflow and operations to scale listings across them. Right? So we have folks who have a listing at a time. We have folks who have hundreds of listings on their team and across our agent force. And just working with them to operationalize the change, it is new media, new media capture. It is a new client sales experience with sellers. That is what we are working through and doing that with different size types of teams across the country something we will continue to learn and mature as we go. We continue to see great results from it, I talked about the stats earlier. It continues to remain really engaging with buyers and with sellers, and we continue to see agents benefit from it to win more business. That is why we remain confident in that intermediate-term goal. Right? Our medium-term target is 5 to 10% of total active listings, and that is a $150 to $300 million annual business for us. And of course, we think there is potential beyond that. We want to give you all kind of a mile marker in the road. What excites us about Zillow Showcase and the tech powering it is once a buyer and a seller experience it, they do not really want to go back to traditional listing of just photos and text. They kind of have this expectation of that. That is how a listing should behave. They should be able to really immersively tour the home that way as a buyer, and a seller should be able to show off their home that way. So we get excited about the ability to drive adoption of the tech and the product far beyond the goal we have shared with you. That will, of course, take time to retrain the industry, but you can see the potential of it in the product. And as you guys do your channel checks with our agents who have experienced it, I think you will see the same.\nNicholas Jones: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Kuntarich from UBS. Please go ahead.\nChris Kuntarich: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one on the market share doubling within the four oldest enhanced markets. I think if I am looking at the right chart from an investor deck a while back, that was closer to 3.5% in January of 2023. So that implies, I guess, we are closer to 7% and above that average now. Can you maybe talk to us a bit about this oldest cohort of enhanced markets and how kind of the puts and takes we should be thinking about as it relates to using that as a case study for some of these newer cohorts of enhanced markets ramping? Thanks.\nJeremy Hofmann: Yep. I can take that as Jeremy Hofmann. What we are referring to in the shareholder letter and then also in Jeremy Wacksman's prepared remarks is that we have grown in our oldest four enhanced markets. We grew revenue per total transaction value. It is a combination of residential and mortgages, grew versus total transaction value in those markets by 50% through the course of 2023, by 80% in aggregate through the end of June, and then doubled by the end of September of this year. So that is a really good proof point for why we have continued to roll out these enhanced markets at the pace that we have. We went from nine at the end of last year to 43 as of October. And what we are seeing from a trend perspective in the earlier enhanced markets are quite consistent with the older ones, which gives us confidence to keep landing and expanding from here.\nChris Kuntarich: Got it. Thanks for the clarification there. And maybe just one on the Virtual Staging AI, the acquisition that you had made in early October. Apologies if you touched on this earlier, but just could you maybe talk to us about how you are thinking about letting this value and integration into Zillow Showcase, like, how you may let that value accrue to the seller agents versus potentially offering different tiers of Zillow Showcase.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yeah. This is Jeremy Wacksman. I will take that. We continue to look for ways to improve and expand our offerings, you know, for sellers and for buyers. And I just talked a bunch about Zillow Showcase as it exists today. Virtual Staging is a fantastic capability that we are excited to bring to both sellers and agents as well as their photographers. Right? Because you can digitally stage listing images in seconds, we are not sharing any changes to go to market other than I think you should expect us to bring that to market on listings in a broad way. You know, I will comment. We also announced an agreement to share our Zillow 3D home tours and interactive floor plans with Realtor.com this quarter as well. Again, just back to trying to get the technology out there and well understood by buyers and sellers as they enter the category, experience content, and create this new norm and expectation for what a digital listing should look like.\nChris Kuntarich: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ng: Hey. Good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I just have two. I guess, the first one is just on rentals. Really impressive rental's traffic growth. And it sounds like the marketing campaign that you are leaning into is working well. As we head into 2025, do you see opportunities to further expand that marketing campaign or other advertising levers that you could pull that you see as potential high returns? I am just thinking about the OpEx outlook next year. Thanks.\nJeremy Wacksman: Why do not I start on rentals, and then maybe, Jeremy, you could talk maybe how to think about the future. Yeah. We are, as Jeremy Hofmann said, we are really pleased with the results of our demand efforts here. That is both our multifamily advertising campaign and our partnership with Realtor.com. It is really helping develop and mature our strategy, right, which is the sustainable supply of unique listings to drive the largest audience. Right? And that audience, like you mentioned, largest audience of renters in the country, up 20% year over year and well ahead of the competition. And that in turn as a strategy bringing high-quality renters solving their major problem, which is finding as much inventory as possible. It is what is leading advertisers to want to get in front of that audience. And that is what is driving, not just the revenue growth, in rentals, but the multifamily revenue growth up 38% year over year. So we expect that growth to continue, you know, we saw strong growth in Q3. We expect to in Q4. And, Jeremy, I do not know if you want to talk at all about how to think about 2025.\nJeremy Hofmann: Yeah, Mike. All I would say there is we are pretty excited about the opportunity in rentals, not just towards the $1 billion-plus mile marker we gave you all, which we think will really be on the back of multifamily growth, but beyond that as well. We just think the strategy that we are going after really aggregating both single-family homes and multifamily properties in one experience is quite unique and quite differentiated. So the long-term opportunity is one we think is well beyond the billion-dollar revenue mile marker we put out there. And I think marketing will be a mix. We will be part of that mix. I think we have always been the types of folks that start with product and then add marketing to accelerate growth. And I would assume the same type of strategy going forward.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you. That is all very helpful color. And my second question, I was wondering if you could speak to any risks to changes in clear cooperation. I think you made some comments in your prepared remarks, but we just love your view on where we stand today and how you are thinking about any potential changes in the future? Thank you.\nJeremy Wacksman: Happy to. Yeah. I outlined in our prepared remarks. I mean, our advocacy principles have been consistent for some time. They start with access. Zillow was founded to help turn on the lights and provide free access to buyers, sellers, and the real estate industry. And changes to rules and cooperation that would pull listings off MLS's so that Zillow and others could not share as many of them, that is just not good for buyers or sellers. It is also not good for agents. Putting listings in private networks means buyer's agents cannot show all the available inventory. So it is not as much of a business issue for us right now, especially as the largest audience and the largest brand, we will always find ways to get our share of inventory to create that experience for buyers, sellers, and connect them with great agents. It is more about the consumer good for the industry. You know, the US real estate market is the most transparent market in the world because of policies like this, and we would love to see those policies strengthen so we can build great businesses and consumer experiences on top of them versus weakened so that some can benefit from trying to pull a pretty small share of listings behind a velvet rope for their own benefit.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you, Jeremy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Campbell with Stephens Inc.\nJohn Campbell: Thanks, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Just want to stick on the Q4 revenue guidance. You guys have obviously provided some direction for pretty sharp growth, you know, continuation of growth out of rentals and mortgage. So just isolating residential, it seems like you have a fairly large subscription there. So I am thinking the swing factor is probably going to be flex, but from just what you guys have given and if just kind of taking the back of the napkin here, I am thinking I am going to have to assume that Premier Agent revenue is going to be down year over year. I know you guys do not report them out anymore, but maybe just directionally, if you could help us, does the guide imply a Premier Agent decline year over year?\nJeremy Hofmann: Yeah. Thanks, John. It is Jeremy Hofmann. I think of it as seasonality in the business from Q3 to Q4 and want to over-focus on that. I think, overarchingly, we are pleased with our Q4 guide. Twelve percent growth at the midpoint for the company in a continued challenged housing market we think is quite solid. And the macro has been and we expect to continue to remain choppy just because affordability remains a challenge. And in the meantime, we are consistently outperforming the industry just given how many products and partner improvements we are making. And then stepping further back, we are on track to deliver double-digit growth and margin expansion in both Q4 and full-year 2024. So assuming the midpoint of the range, we will grow revenue 14% year over year in 2024 for the company and 22% EBITDA margins, which implies 200 basis points of margin expansion. So, overarchingly, feeling quite good. And then as you think about what we are doing on the residential side, which obviously Premier Agent is a huge piece of that, you know, we are really gaining our share versus total transaction value. We were up 800 basis points year over year in Q3, and we have had 2,000 basis points of share gains since the beginning of 2023. We expect continued growth just on the back of the enhanced market rollouts we are having and the success we are having there along with things like listing showcase, rentals, follow-up boss, and ShowingTime Plus. So I think, overarchingly, I think we are well set up not just in Q4, but beyond that.\nJohn Campbell: Okay. Makes sense. And then a quick follow-up just on Follow-up Boss. Seems like the adoption uptick has been pretty sharp of late. I do not know how much of that is due to the enhanced market expansion. So maybe if you could touch on that. And then I saw that you raised the contingent consideration for Follow-up Boss. So it seems like you are doing really well there. So maybe if you can talk about how you have been able to change, you know, to what extent you have been able to change the Follow-up Boss growth trajectory?\nJeremy Wacksman: Maybe I will hit adoption and Hofmann, you can hit the second piece. Yeah. John, we are seeing really great success with Follow-up Boss. As you remember, it is really a two-part strategy. One is just continuing to help the Follow-up Boss team grow. Their efforts to attract more agent teams. Having the power of Zillow behind them and helping them grow and onboard more partners broadly. That is a big part of the strategy. And then the other strategy is to help get our enhanced market partners using Follow-up Boss as we start to build really good integrations between Zillow customers and them as our enhanced market partners. And we shared, you know, 80% of connections in our enhanced markets now are flowing through Follow-up Boss. So you are just seeing the adoption of Follow-up Boss by the lion's share of those partners right alongside just healthy organic Follow-up Boss growth. So it is just now coming up on a year since acquisition, and we are just so pleased both with how the team is executing on that dual charter mandate and how the integration has gone. And you know, we continue to hear just great feedback from our agent partners on how Follow-up Boss is helping them power their business.\nJeremy Hofmann: Yeah. And then, John, on your second question around the contingent consideration, there is no change to expected payout. We just have a change in fair value based on the time value of money and getting closer to those payout dates. So I would not overlook that. I think what Jeremy just highlighted is what we are most excited about, and we think it is a really great piece of software that our agents are really enjoying.\nJohn Campbell: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ryan McKeveny from Zelman and Associates.\nRyan McKeveny: Hey. Thanks, guys. Congrats on the results. Just one from me related to how you are thinking about expense growth going forward. So, you know, Jeremy, you have talked about the variable cost side and the investments outpacing revenue growth in 2024. Obviously, still resulting in margin expansion with low fixed cost growth. I know it is early to give any, you know, 2025 guidance in terms of revenue or margin, but if we do assume mortgage rates stay high and we are in this kind of stuck, you know, slow housing market, you know, should we generally expect that trend to continue in terms of variable cost relative to revenue cost growth, or are you reaching a point where some of those initiatives have scaled to the point where maybe that will no longer be the case? Thank you.\nJeremy Hofmann: Yeah, Ryan, it is Jeremy Hofmann. I will take it. You know, you said it right. No guidance on 2025. We are quite pleased with execution this year. I think 2025, you should assume more of the same strategy and go-to-market. Right? We are going to continue to land in new enhanced markets, expand into existing ones. And that will drive residential revenue, drive mortgages revenue alongside showcase, Follow-up Boss, new construction, and then we keep executing in rentals as well. At the same time, we are going to continue to be disciplined on the cost side. We have been, I think, fairly consistent here that macro has been choppy. We expect it continues to be choppy, and we will plan the cost structure accordingly. So you should not expect much different in terms of how we think about our cost structure. And, obviously, we will dial up and down opportunities on the variable and marketing side depending on what we see fit. But that fixed cost level that we have been at, we feel comfortable with to go hit our 2025 share targets.\nRyan McKeveny: Sounds good. Thanks very much.\nOperator: This completes the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Jeremy Wacksman for any closing remarks.\nJeremy Wacksman: I just want to close by saying thank you all. We really appreciate your time this quarter. Thanks for all the questions, and we will see you all next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you for joining the Zillow Group third quarter 2024 call. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jeremy Hofmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremy, and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard, we delivered excellent results in Q3, and we are well-positioned to continue doing so as we execute on our strategy. Our Q3 2024 results exceeded expectations for revenue and EBITDA, with revenue up 17% year over year, to $581 million, which was $28 million above the midpoint of our range. Executing on our strategy drove double-digit year-over-year growth across each of our revenue categories, including residential, rentals, and mortgages. We outperformed the broader residential real estate industry by approximately 1,500 basis points, as the housing market grew 2% this quarter according to NAR. Additionally, we estimate that the total purchase loan volume for mortgage buyers, which is more aligned with our customer base for Premier Agent, declined low single digits in Q3, underperforming the overall housing market. On a GAAP basis, Q3 net loss was $20 million, representing 3% of our revenue. EBITDA was $127 million for the quarter, resulting in a 22% EBITDA margin. The combination of our revenue outperformance and effective cost management delivered better-than-expected EBITDA results in the third quarter. Residential revenue grew 12% year over year to $405 million, outperforming our outlook range. Our Premier Agent revenue benefited from continued conversion improvements as more buyers and sellers transacted with the Zillow agent partners. We also had a strong quarter of growth in Zillow Showcase, which now represents nearly 1.5% of all new for-sale listings in the country. Additionally, our new construction marketplace and the software solutions from ShowingTime Plus and Follow-up Boss performed well. The combination of these factors led to better-than-expected results. Rental's revenue grew 24% year over year in Q3 to $123 million, driven primarily by our multifamily revenue, which grew 38% year over year. We increased the number of multifamily properties on our apps and sites by 34% year over year, reaching an all-time high of 47,000 multifamily properties as of the end of Q3, up from 44,000 properties at the end of Q2. Total listings across our entire rentals marketplace were up 15% year over year, an industry-leading 1.9 million listings in September. With steady growth under our belts, we believe Zillow Rentals is well on its way toward the billion-dollar-plus revenue opportunity we see in front of us. Mortgages revenue growth accelerated in Q3, up 63% year over year to $39 million, with purchase loan origination volume growing 80% year over year to $812 million. Our mortgage strategy is leading to more buyers choosing financing through Zillow Home Loans. As expected, we are also seeing our purchase loan origination growth more closely aligned with mortgages revenue growth. This means our purchase mortgage revenue is now the main growth driver of our overall mortgages revenue category. Our disciplined cost management resulted in Q3 EBITDA expenses of $454 million, roughly in line with our outlook and allowed our Q3 revenue upside to flow to the bottom line. Additionally, our Q3 share-based compensation expense of $108 million was down year over year, and we are on track for these full-year 2024 expenses to decline from 2023 levels. As we execute on our growth strategy, we are successfully driving operating leverage. Looking ahead, as we continue to grow revenue, we expect this leverage to play out in both expanding EBITDA margins and sustainable profitable growth over time. We ended Q3 with $2.2 billion of cash and investments, down from $2.6 billion at the end of Q2, primarily due to the maturity and settlement of our 2024 convertible debt in September, which included aggregate cash payments of $610 million. This was partially offset by Q3 net cash provided by operating activities of $171 million. As of the end of Q3, we had $918 million of outstanding convertible senior notes. In December of this year, we will settle the $499 million of our outstanding convertible senior notes due in 2026. We issued a notice of redemption for these notes on October 8th, and we plan to repay the principal in cash and issue shares to satisfy any conversion premium. We have outstanding cap call hedges related to these notes, and we expect any dilution from settling the 2026 notes ultimately to be offset by settlement of the cap calls upon unwind or at maturity. Because the cap calls have additional value, as our Class C share price appreciates up to approximately $81 per share, we do not expect to settle the cap calls at this time, and we will continue to monitor and evaluate the economics of unwinding prior to maturity. After our Q4 debt settlement, we will have only the $419 million of senior convertible notes due in May 2025 outstanding. Our current expectation is that we will also settle the principal balance of these notes in cash, and any conversion premiums in shares of Class C capital stock. Once these notes are retired, we expect to be convertible debt-free in Q2 2025. As we look in aggregate, 2024 has been an important year for our capital allocation strategy. $1.2 billion of cash has or will soon be returned to shareholders via the settlement of our convertible senior notes. We have also had $301 million of share repurchases at a weighted average price of roughly $42. We are pleased with our execution this year. From the end of 2021 to today, we have repurchased approximately $2 billion of stock at a weighted average price of roughly $45. Our balance sheet is rock solid, and we believe the share repurchases we have made since the end of 2021 have been a great use of capital as we execute on our growth strategy and drive share price appreciation over time. Turning to our outlook for Q4, we expect total company revenue to be between $525 million and $540 million, implying a year-over-year increase of 12% at the midpoint of our outlook range. We expect residential revenue to be between $364 million and $374 million. Our residential revenue outlook for Q4 is driven by the normal seasonality of our Premier Agent revenue as well as the continued strength of revenue contributions from Zillow Showcase, ShowingTime Plus, new construction, and Follow-up Boss. We expect that the housing market will continue to bounce around at current levels, implying modest year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. While there continues to be pent-up desire to move, affordability remains a challenge. Our Q4 outlook takes this into consideration. We expect our rentals revenue to grow in the mid-20% range year over year in Q4 as we benefit from our execution on building our two-sided marketplace. Our multifamily rentals revenue is expected to grow faster than our overall rental revenue as we see the benefits of continued property expansion, our national rentals brand awareness campaign, and our partnership with Realtor.com. For mortgages, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid-60% range year over year. For Q4, we expect EBITDA to be between $90 million and $105 million, equating to an 18% margin at the midpoint of our outlook range, up approximately 300 basis points year over year. This implies EBITDA expenses will decrease from $454 million in Q3 to an estimated $435 million in Q4. The majority of the sequential decrease in EBITDA expenses from Q3 to Q4 is expected to be driven by seasonally lower advertising spend. Additionally, we expect our annual fixed cost run rate will continue to be approximately $1 billion, consistent with where we stood at the end of 2023. We are on track to deliver our original 2024 full-year target of double-digit revenue growth with EBITDA margin expansion. At the midpoint of our Q4 outlook ranges, our total company revenue in 2024 would be up 14% and our total company EBITDA margin in 2024 would be 22%, which implies approximately 200 basis points of margin expansion versus 2023. Before we close, I would like to take a moment to highlight the results we are seeing from the investments we have made over the past two years in our for-sale strategy. As you will recall, we look at revenue per total transaction value, or TTV, on a trailing twelve-month basis as a comprehensive indicator of relative growth against the residential real estate industry. When we combine our residential and mortgages revenue categories, which in aggregate represent our for-sale revenue, our revenue per TTV in Q3 was up 800 basis points year over year, and more than 2,000 basis points since the beginning of 2023. This is the culmination of investments we have been making over the past couple of years to improve our customer experiences so that we can identify high-intent movers and connect them with high-performing agents. This has helped us drive more connections and convert more buyers and sellers to transact with us and our partners. We are also beginning to benefit from the early stages of scaling our newer products to more markets, most notably with Zillow Home Loans, which has grown purchase loan origination volume by over 3x from the beginning of 2023 to now. We expect continued success in 2025 as we expand into more enhanced markets and provide more services within those markets, including offering more of our unique software solutions such as Zillow Showcase and Follow-up Boss. On the cost side, we understand it is important for us to demonstrate to our investors that the investments we have been making to increase top-line growth will result in expanding margins. As we have been saying for some time, we believe we are at the right fixed investment level to achieve our 2025 transaction share target and expect fixed investment costs to grow modestly with inflation. Our fixed costs remain just under a billion-dollar annualized run rate in Q3, growing only 4% year over year, and decreasing as a percentage of revenue by 500 basis points year over year, despite three acquisitions: Aerial, Follow-up Boss, and Spruce. Looking at variable costs, we have intentionally increased these costs as a percentage of revenue during 2024 as we invest in our rentals and Zillow Showcase sales teams, as well as additional Zillow Home Loans officers to support future expected growth. For marketing and advertising, we have been clear that we make discrete decisions to dial our efforts up or down based on the opportunities we see. The most obvious opportunity we have had on the marketing front has been for our rentals marketplace, and we have invested in a national campaign this year. This investment in Q2 and Q3 has noticeably expanded Zillow brand awareness for apartment seekers, and we are pleased with the early results. To close, it is clear we are executing on our strategy, and we are very excited about the opportunity ahead of us. We have a beloved brand with the largest, most engaged audience of movers, a partner network made up of some of the best and most productive agents and teams in the country, a solid financial foundation, and unmatched tech expertise to tackle the hard problems necessary to digitize this analog industry. As I look forward, we are growing across every part of our business with investments in place to drive future growth. We are disciplined on our costs, and we expect to drive sustainable profitable growth on our way to strong GAAP profits over time. And with that, operator, we will open the line for questions. Yeah. Thanks, Ron. It is Jeremy Hofmann. I will take the first one, and then I will pass it to Jeremy Wacksman for the second one. I think across the business, we performed quite well in Q3. You know, we grew double digits in residential, rentals, and mortgages, and, obviously, total growth of 17% year over year, we are quite pleased with. Within residential, the drivers are a few folds. So one, PA just benefited from continued conversion improvements. You know, we have been investing pretty heavily in honing our funnel for a while at this point, and we are just seeing the benefits of those particularly as we go into more enhanced markets and we get more contributions from real-time touring. And then beyond that, we had another strong quarter of growth from Zillow Showcase, which is now, you know, nearly 1.5% of all new listings in the country. And that was all supplemented by the new construction marketplace continues to perform well. And the software solutions we are providing from ShowingTime Plus and Follow-up Boss are being well received too. So it really has been across the board, and something we are quite pleased with. And then, Jeremy, you want to hit the second one? Great. Thanks, Mark. It is Jeremy Hofmann. I will take both of those. So I think on the NAR settlement impact, we cannot speak to broad commission trends just because 80% of our Premier Agent base is in that top 20% of all producers. So we are really working with top agents versus a broad swath of folks in PA. And for our agents across our PA business, we have seen commission rates stay in a tight band. Obviously, Q3 performance was quite strong. Being able to grow the total company revenue 17%, 12% across residential, and pretty substantially outperforming the category. We were really pleased. Beyond that, I would say we have been pretty consistent here for a while. We believe we and our partners are the outsized beneficiaries of any changes in the real estate industry. You know, we have the most customers. We work with the best partners, and we provide the most technology. So we expect our PAs will deliver value and get paid because they provide great service. And that we and they are sharetakers in really any evolution or dispersion of the industry. So that is how we are feeling on that front. And then the second question around stock-based compensation. We plan to leverage it going forward. So just as a reminder, our fixed cost base is in about the $1 billion range on an annualized basis. And 90% of our stock-based comp sits within that bucket. So as we are controlled on the fixed cost front and grow revenue, we will get more and more leverage on the SBC line that will drive to greater GAAP profitability over time. Yep. I can take that as Jeremy Hofmann. What we are referring to in the shareholder letter and then also in Jeremy Wacksman's prepared remarks is that we have grown in our oldest four enhanced markets. We grew revenue per total transaction value. It is a combination of residential and mortgages, grew versus total transaction value in those markets by 50% through the course of 2023, by 80% in aggregate through the end of June, and then doubled by the end of September of this year. So that is a really good proof point for why we have continued to roll out these enhanced markets at the pace that we have. We went from nine at the end of last year to 43 as of October. And what we are seeing from a trend perspective in the earlier enhanced markets are quite consistent with the older ones, which gives us confidence to keep landing and expanding from here. Yeah, Mike. All I would say there is we are pretty excited about the opportunity in rentals, not just towards the $1 billion-plus mile marker we gave you all, which we think will really be on the back of multifamily growth, but beyond that as well. We just think the strategy that we are going after really aggregating both single-family homes and multifamily properties in one experience is quite unique and quite differentiated. So the long-term opportunity is one we think is well beyond the billion-dollar revenue mile marker we put out there. And I think marketing will be a mix. We will be part of that mix. I think we have always been the types of folks that start with product and then add marketing to accelerate growth. And I would assume the same type of strategy going forward. Yeah. Thanks, John. It is Jeremy Hofmann. I think of it as seasonality in the business from Q3 to Q4 and want to over-focus on that. I think, overarchingly, we are pleased with our Q4 guide. Twelve percent growth at the midpoint for the company in a continued challenged housing market we think is quite solid. And the macro has been and we expect to continue to remain choppy just because affordability remains a challenge. And in the meantime, we are consistently outperforming the industry just given how many products and partner improvements we are making. And then stepping further back, we are on track to deliver double-digit growth and margin expansion in both Q4 and full-year 2024. So assuming the midpoint of the range, we will grow revenue 14% year over year in 2024 for the company and 22% EBITDA margins, which implies 200 basis points of margin expansion. So, overarchingly, feeling quite good. And then as you think about what we are doing on the residential side, which obviously Premier Agent is a huge piece of that, you know, we are really gaining our share versus total transaction value. We were up 800 basis points year over year in Q3, and we have had 2,000 basis points of share gains since the beginning of 2023. We expect continued growth just on the back of the enhanced market rollouts we are having and the success we are having there along with things like listing showcase, rentals, follow-up boss, and ShowingTime Plus. So I think, overarchingly, I think we are well set up not just in Q4, but beyond that. Yeah. And then, John, on your second question around the contingent consideration, there is no change to expected payout. We just have a change in fair value based on the time value of money and getting closer to those payout dates. So I would not overlook that. I think what Jeremy just highlighted is what we are most excited about, and we think it is a really great piece of software that our agents are really enjoying. Yeah, Ryan, it is Jeremy Hofmann. I will take it. You know, you said it right. No guidance on 2025. We are quite pleased with execution this year. I think 2025, you should assume more of the same strategy and go-to-market. Right? We are going to continue to land in new enhanced markets, expand into existing ones. And that will drive residential revenue, drive mortgages revenue alongside showcase, Follow-up Boss, new construction, and then we keep executing in rentals as well. At the same time, we are going to continue to be disciplined on the cost side. We have been, I think, fairly consistent here that macro has been choppy. We expect it continues to be choppy, and we will plan the cost structure accordingly. So you should not expect much different in terms of how we think about our cost structure. And, obviously, we will dial up and down opportunities on the variable and marketing side depending on what we see fit. But that fixed cost level that we have been at, we feel comfortable with to go hit our 2025 share targets."

            "name": "Jeremy Wacksman",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us during a busy time of year. We are excited to share our third quarter 2024 results with you. With Zillow's leading brand, deep technology expertise, and strong financial foundation, we are successfully seizing our incredible opportunity to transform and digitize residential real estate on behalf of consumers, agents, and the broader industry. As you will hear again today, we are in a strong position executing our strategy well and delivering solid results. In Q3, we grew revenue by 17% and outperformed the residential real estate industry, all while demonstrating cost discipline as we steer towards sustainable, profitable growth. As with everything we do at Zillow, our approach begins with the customers we serve: movers, agents, and real estate industry professionals. We invest in providing products and services that offer a superior end-to-end transaction experience. This creates a top-of-funnel advantage, helps us identify and connect high-intent movers with high-performing partners, and alongside our software tools, this drives increased connection rates and conversion rates resulting in greater revenue. As we continue to leverage our cost structure, our consistent revenue outperformance shows up as expanded EBITDA margins. Those outcomes bolster our continued confidence in our strategy. Before I dive further into our results, I will remind you why we believe Zillow is best positioned to succeed in our ever-evolving industry. As we have said consistently throughout the past year, our perspective is grounded in Zillow's consumer advocacy principles. We believe in easy and free access to all available real estate information and listings, independent representation for buyers and sellers, and transparency regarding agent compensation and consumers' right to negotiate it. We launched Zillow with a promise to turn on the lights in real estate because we believe everyone benefits from transparency. An open, free marketplace is good for sellers, good for buyers, good for agents, and makes for the robust industry we have here in the US. As the industry has undergone its recent very healthy evolution toward more transparency, we are confident that Zillow and agents who work with us will benefit. This is clear to us for three reasons. First, Zillow has the most and highest intent movers. More than two-thirds of US homebuyers use Zillow today. About 80% of our users come to us organically, and we have three times more app users than anyone else in the category. We have built and maintained this strong brand position by staying focused on what the customer wants and needs, delivering impressive and delightful tech innovations that improve their moving experience. This quarter, for example, we have launched helpful new features, like comprehensive climate risk data, tools to help agents, loan officers, and movers streamline their communications, and upgrades to our AI-powered natural language search. The second reason is that we partner with top agents and teams across the country. Those that offer superior customer service and real value for movers, a deep understanding of the industry and their local market, and a proven ability to scale. These are the agents who are the most successful at growing their business alongside us and are poised to take customer share. Third, we expect to benefit as the industry evolves because we provide exceptional tech solutions to make moving more efficient. Not just for movers, but for agents, brokers, loan officers, and other real estate professionals as well. We believe a rising digital tide lifts all boats. Zillow's independent software solutions like ShowingTime, Dotloop, Bridge Interactive, and Follow-up Boss are already used by hundreds of thousands of professionals across the residential real estate industry. Our opportunity is to expand the breadth of those offerings and stitch them together, powering the industry to be more transparent, faster, and more integrated. Considering all the professionals we are already serving today with our digital workflow tools and foundational technologies, we believe this represents a significant opportunity for Zillow to better serve customers and drive transactions within Zillow's ecosystem. It is solutions like these combined with our many products and services for movers that together make Zillow a housing super app, giving buyers, sellers, agents, and the industry the seamless, integrated, and tech-enabled experience they demand and deserve. Now onto our third quarter 2024 results. I am excited to share that we reported total revenue of $581 million in Q3, up 17% year over year, exceeding our revenue outlook and outperforming the residential real estate industry. Q3 residential revenue grew 12% year over year to $405 million. Rentals momentum continued with $123 million in revenue in Q3, up 24% year over year. Multifamily rentals revenue is up 38% year over year, driven by growth in our multifamily property count. We are also making strong progress in mortgages; Q3 revenue was $39 million, accelerating to 63% year over year growth compared to 42% growth in Q2, with our purchase loan origination volume up 80% year over year. We are delivering strong revenue performance while growing our engaged audience of users. For Q3, we reported 233 million average monthly unique users across Zillow's ecosystem of apps and sites, according to our internal metrics, and 116 million average monthly unique visitors in Q3 according to Comscore. As you will recall, Comscore is widely viewed among Internet brands as a reliable, transparent third-party source because it aims to capture the number of unique visitors while deduplicating cookies. Our success is the result of solid execution on our growth strategy. On the for-sale side of our business, we are anchored by efforts in integrating our services, financing, touring, seller solutions, and enhancing our partner network. These investments are propelling us toward our goal to increase customer share to 6% by the end of 2025. We are also focused on expanding our rentals marketplace, which currently represents more than 20% of our revenue and is growing rapidly. The seamless transaction experience we have been building out on Zillow, the housing super app, is most fully experienced by customers in our enhanced markets. We have rolled out 43 enhanced markets thus far, surpassing our goal of reaching 40 by the end of this year. Heading into 2025, we expect to deepen our penetration in the existing markets and expand into more markets. We have been pleased with the progress we are making across the enhanced markets with this land and expand strategy, and we continue to expect enhanced markets to cover 20% of our connections by the end of this year. As of Q3, more than 80% of enhanced market connections are being managed through Follow-up Boss, an industry-leading customer relationship management system we acquired about a year ago. Follow-up Boss is used by many real estate agents and teams and manages 25 million leads each year. Our efforts to upgrade and integrate it are a key part of the Housing Super App experience we are building. For example, in Q3, we introduced new features including piloting in-app messaging to allow agents to communicate with buyers on Zillow, an in-app option to connect buyers directly to a loan officer with Zillow Home Loans, and new and improved client insights, allowing agents to tailor their services to an individual client's needs and interests. When the customer, agent, loan officer, and other services are connected through a common platform, movers have a more seamless experience, and real estate professionals can work more efficiently and serve their clients better. Overall, we are excited that our efforts in enhanced markets are beginning to deliver results. In February, we told you our first four enhanced markets had seen share gains of more than 50% since the beginning of 2023. Then in August, we told you it had risen to more than 80%. Now it has doubled since the beginning of 2023, and we are seeing similar trends in the enhanced markets we have launched since. As we land and expand in more enhanced markets and keep working across the business to increase connection and conversion rates, we expect to see share growth relative to the industry total transaction value, or TTV, in our residential and mortgages revenue. As you can see in the chart in our shareholder letter, our revenue per TTV has increased meaningfully over the past two years, a great proof point that our investments are having an impact on our business. Moving on to financing, we are building a substantial direct-to-consumer purchase mortgage origination business, integrated with our agent partner network, to offer the many mortgage seekers on Zillow financing options at the right point in their moving journey. Forty percent of all homebuyers start their home shopping journey looking for a mortgage, and more than 80% of those buyers do not yet have an agent. So when a high-intent customer comes to Zillow, whether they are starting with financing or starting by touring property and being connected with a great agent, we can help. Providing a more seamless experience for movers, agents, and loan officers helps identify high-intent customers in our funnel and drives conversion and revenue growth. Most notably, our efforts are accelerating mortgage growth. Origination revenue is beginning to scale, with purchase loan origination volume up 80% year over year in Q3, and mortgages revenue up 63% year over year to $39 million. In enhanced markets we have been in for more than six months, customer adoption rates for Zillow Home Loans are in the mid-teens, with newer markets trending similarly. At the same time, we are seeing higher transaction conversion rates for agent partners working with customers who choose Zillow Home Loans as we help agents and loan officers better serve customers together when they are ready to transact. We are also seeing an impact from our efforts to make booking a home tour as seamless as booking a restaurant reservation online. As we work to help more Zillow visitors transact, touring remains a critical focus area for us, both so we can identify high-intent buyers and so we can solve a process that has historically been full of friction, busy work, and back and forth. In 2021, we acquired ShowingTime, the industry leader in home touring technology, which facilitates five million showings a month across the country. Bringing ShowingTime onto Zillow's tech-enabled platform has uniquely positioned us to remove the friction in touring, helping high-intent buyers tour homes with ease and freeing up agents' time to focus on value-added services for movers. Our investments here are delivering improved connection rates, and today, more than 25% of our connections are coming through the digitized, improved, real-time touring experience, which is contributing to residential revenue outperformance. Meanwhile, our consumer-friendly touring agreement is helping agents adopt the new requirements stemming from the National Association of Realtors Settlement and is connecting them with higher-intent buyers who are more likely to take a tour. While agents are not required to use our touring agreement, it is available for more than 90% of our touring connections and is tailored by state. Our touring agreement process is automated and digital, setting a gold standard for the industry. This is an example of how we have adapted alongside the industry in a way that is positively evolving our business. We are also investing in seller solutions that not only make selling a home easier but also create real value for sellers and their agents. We are particularly excited about Zillow Showcase, which we made available nationwide beginning this year. As you will remember, Zillow Showcase elevates agents' brand presence on Zillow and provides a better shopping experience through our homegrown AI-powered rich media and floor plan technologies. There is truly nothing else like it on the market. Showcase listings are driving higher engagement compared to similar non-showcase listings on Zillow: more views, more shares, and more saves. Most important, however, is that Showcase listings are selling faster and for more money than similar non-showcase listings on our site. Zillow Showcase is already on nearly 1.5% of new for-sale listings nationwide, putting us on our way to achieving our intermediate-term goal of 5 to 10% listing coverage on Zillow. As we have said before, we believe a rising digital tide lifts all boats, which is why we continue to look for ways to improve and expand our offerings for the benefit of the broader residential real estate industry, whether through buying, building, or partnering. For example, last month, we acquired Virtual Staging AI, a company whose technology helps sellers, agents, and photographers create digitally staged listing images in seconds. And in October, we announced an agreement to share Zillow 3D home tours and interactive floor plans with Realtor.com, helping agents easily provide our leading immersive virtual content to more home shoppers. Finally, I will update you on our continued progress in rentals. As you know from our investor presentation six months ago, we have spent the past several years building a highly differentiated two-sided marketplace with a comprehensive suite of listings, combining multifamily properties with unique long-tailed properties, which we define as fewer than 25 units but primarily comprises single-family homes. As a result, Zillow is rapidly becoming the nationwide marketplace renters and landlords have sorely needed. And as we have said, we are in the best position to fix the fragmented rental experience because of our many years of success building great products for our massive audience of movers on the for-sale side. Renters on Zillow can shop, tour, apply, sign a lease, and pay rent securely. And property managers can list, book tours, screen applicants, create leases, sign them electronically, and collect rent payments all on one convenient platform: Zillow. These efforts to create a more seamless and convenient experience on both sides of the rental process are paying off, yielding growth in traffic, multifamily property count, and revenue. Our multifamily advertising campaign and our ongoing partnership to share rental listings with Realtor.com are also helping boost our success by contributing to increased customer awareness of Zillow Rentals. In Q3, our total average monthly rentals unique visitors were up 20% according to Comscore. We continue to expect multifamily to be the main engine of rentals revenue growth. We now have 47,000 multifamily properties on Zillow, having added close to 10,000 year to date, and multifamily revenue is up 38% year over year. As it stands today, with the combination of both long-tail and multifamily properties, we have the most rental listings in the country and consequently, the most users. With steady growth under our belts, we believe Zillow Rentals is well on its way toward the billion-dollar-plus revenue opportunity we see in front of us. Across the entire business, I am proud of the progress we are making to improve the experience of getting home. We have a much-loved and trusted brand, with the largest, most engaged audience of movers, a partner network made up of some of the best and most productive agents and teams in the country, a solid financial foundation, and deep tech expertise that allows us to invest in software solutions to benefit movers and the entire industry. Our business is increasingly diversified, and we have continued to outperform the industry while maintaining strong cost discipline. Looking ahead, we are focused on capturing a more meaningful share of the $30 billion accessible TAM in residential real estate, while continuing to deliver on behalf of our customers and shareholders. Thank you as always for being on this journey with us, and on that note, I will hand the mic over to CFO Jeremy Hofmann. Hey, John. This is Jeremy Wacksman. On real-time touring, we have not broken out real-time touring versus other touring types, but we have for a while talked about how the touring customer in general converts to transaction at about a 3x the rate. And the other color I can give is real-time touring is going to be north of 25% of our connections by the end of the year. That has been our goal, and we are going to be ahead of that. We did talk a bit in the prepared remarks about seeing conversion improvements generally. Touring is obviously a piece of that, and so that is driving obviously the increased conversion generally as a component. In terms of payment model and kind of business model mix, real-time touring actually is available across both. And, again, it just goes back to our strategy of trying to help identify higher intent customers. Real-time touring does a pretty big job of that. And then trying to help land them with our best agent partners. As a reminder, you know, we work with lots of agents, but they represent the top end of the industry, the top 20% of the industry is the majority of our Premier Agent base. So we are really pleased as we are able to identify and hand them higher intent customers. You are seeing the benefits that play out in conversion. Sure. So let me take Zillow Showcase first, and then maybe we will do in reverse order. So on Zillow Showcase, yeah, we said in the prepared remarks it is now nearly 1.5% share of new listings. We just rolled it out nationwide earlier this year, and so the growth while has some dispersion in markets. We have not given out any kind of market mix details. I will say across the board, we continue to be really impressed that the product market fit holds as we grow that scale. So that higher engagements that we talked about, you know, 80% more page views, 75% more saves, 75% more shares, those stats hold across markets as we grow availability. And we are continuing to see homes sell faster and for more money. So 2% more, which is about $9,000 on average per home. And we continue to see agents who use it, as we talked about in the remarks, win more listings. They are winning about 20% more than similar agents who are not using Zillow Showcase. So we are still really early. You know, we just went nationwide earlier this year. And we see a long runway ahead of us. We talked about a 5 to 10% total active listing goal over time. And I think as we get to that level, Brad, I think we will have more maturity in markets to talk about the machinations across price points or geographies. But right now, it is still really early. And then on the buyer's agreement, we do not have any concrete data to share other than to say, we look at it as really helpful friction for the buyer. It is an education process. It is getting them through a really necessary education step, and it better prepares them to meet the agent. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, it is available on more than 90% of touring connections nationwide, and we have worked really hard to customize it where necessary by state. And we see this as a really healthy evolution and processing all these settlement changes to help start to educate the buyers on how this process works to make sure when they meet these great agents, they are even more educated on what to expect both in the initial tour and then in what to expect in the relationship if they choose to move forward. Yeah. On the new sales leader, yes, that is the start of maybe more integration and scale for our sales organization to offer just a more seamless go-to-market to our agent community. And so you should expect to see us scale some of our products across that larger Salesforce and start to bring them to market in a more integrated fashion to date. We have been doing that in pockets and places, but our goal over time is to have, you know, one face to the industry to represent all of our products that will most notably show up in kind of our market-based pricing and showcase offerings. But over time, you can imagine that will scale beyond that. Yeah. Nick, happy to take that. So as we said a couple of times, it is early. We are really pleased at this early. We are at nearly 1.5% share of new listings. And the two things I would say we have learned so far is, you know, price which is variable by home price and geography, lands well with agents and teams. The big challenge is helping them work through their workflow and operations to scale listings across them. Right? So we have folks who have a listing at a time. We have folks who have hundreds of listings on their team and across our agent force. And just working with them to operationalize the change, it is new media, new media capture. It is a new client sales experience with sellers. That is what we are working through and doing that with different size types of teams across the country something we will continue to learn and mature as we go. We continue to see great results from it, I talked about the stats earlier. It continues to remain really engaging with buyers and with sellers, and we continue to see agents benefit from it to win more business. That is why we remain confident in that intermediate-term goal. Right? Our medium-term target is 5 to 10% of total active listings, and that is a $150 to $300 million annual business for us. And of course, we think there is potential beyond that. We want to give you all kind of a mile marker in the road. What excites us about Zillow Showcase and the tech powering it is once a buyer and a seller experience it, they do not really want to go back to traditional listing of just photos and text. They kind of have this expectation of that. That is how a listing should behave. They should be able to really immersively tour the home that way as a buyer, and a seller should be able to show off their home that way. So we get excited about the ability to drive adoption of the tech and the product far beyond the goal we have shared with you. That will, of course, take time to retrain the industry, but you can see the potential of it in the product. And as you guys do your channel checks with our agents who have experienced it, I think you will see the same. Yeah. This is Jeremy Wacksman. I will take that. We continue to look for ways to improve and expand our offerings, you know, for sellers and for buyers. And I just talked a bunch about Zillow Showcase as it exists today. Virtual Staging is a fantastic capability that we are excited to bring to both sellers and agents as well as their photographers. Right? Because you can digitally stage listing images in seconds, we are not sharing any changes to go to market other than I think you should expect us to bring that to market on listings in a broad way. You know, I will comment. We also announced an agreement to share our Zillow 3D home tours and interactive floor plans with Realtor.com this quarter as well. Again, just back to trying to get the technology out there and well understood by buyers and sellers as they enter the category, experience content, and create this new norm and expectation for what a digital listing should look like. Why do not I start on rentals, and then maybe, Jeremy, you could talk maybe how to think about the future. Yeah. We are, as Jeremy Hofmann said, we are really pleased with the results of our demand efforts here. That is both our multifamily advertising campaign and our partnership with Realtor.com. It is really helping develop and mature our strategy, right, which is the sustainable supply of unique listings to drive the largest audience. Right? And that audience, like you mentioned, largest audience of renters in the country, up 20% year over year and well ahead of the competition. And that in turn as a strategy bringing high-quality renters solving their major problem, which is finding as much inventory as possible. It is what is leading advertisers to want to get in front of that audience. And that is what is driving, not just the revenue growth, in rentals, but the multifamily revenue growth up 38% year over year. So we expect that growth to continue, you know, we saw strong growth in Q3. We expect to in Q4. And, Jeremy, I do not know if you want to talk at all about how to think about 2025. Happy to. Yeah. I outlined in our prepared remarks. I mean, our advocacy principles have been consistent for some time. They start with access. Zillow was founded to help turn on the lights and provide free access to buyers, sellers, and the real estate industry. And changes to rules and cooperation that would pull listings off MLS's so that Zillow and others could not share as many of them, that is just not good for buyers or sellers. It is also not good for agents. Putting listings in private networks means buyer's agents cannot show all the available inventory. So it is not as much of a business issue for us right now, especially as the largest audience and the largest brand, we will always find ways to get our share of inventory to create that experience for buyers, sellers, and connect them with great agents. It is more about the consumer good for the industry. You know, the US real estate market is the most transparent market in the world because of policies like this, and we would love to see those policies strengthen so we can build great businesses and consumer experiences on top of them versus weakened so that some can benefit from trying to pull a pretty small share of listings behind a velvet rope for their own benefit. Maybe I will hit adoption and Hofmann, you can hit the second piece. Yeah. John, we are seeing really great success with Follow-up Boss. As you remember, it is really a two-part strategy. One is just continuing to help the Follow-up Boss team grow. Their efforts to attract more agent teams. Having the power of Zillow behind them and helping them grow and onboard more partners broadly. That is a big part of the strategy. And then the other strategy is to help get our enhanced market partners using Follow-up Boss as we start to build really good integrations between Zillow customers and them as our enhanced market partners. And we shared, you know, 80% of connections in our enhanced markets now are flowing through Follow-up Boss. So you are just seeing the adoption of Follow-up Boss by the lion's share of those partners right alongside just healthy organic Follow-up Boss growth. So it is just now coming up on a year since acquisition, and we are just so pleased both with how the team is executing on that dual charter mandate and how the integration has gone. And you know, we continue to hear just great feedback from our agent partners on how Follow-up Boss is helping them power their business. I just want to close by saying thank you all. We really appreciate your time this quarter. Thanks for all the questions, and we will see you all next quarter."

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time, you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Brad, you may begin.\nBradley Berning: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Zillow Group's second quarter 2024 call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Zillow Group's Co-Founder and Co-Executive Chairman, Rich Barton; newly appointed CEO, Jeremy Wacksman; and CFO, Jeremy Hofmann. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements about our future performance and operating plans based on current expectations and assumptions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and we encourage you to consider the risk factors described in our SEC filings for additional information. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events, except as required by law. This call is being broadcast on the Internet and is accessible on our Investor Relations website. A recording of the call will be available later today. During the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, which we refer to as EBITDA. We encourage you to read our Shareholder Letter and earnings release, which can be found on our Investor Relations website as they contain important information about our GAAP and non-GAAP results, including reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures. We will now open the call with remarks followed by live Q&A. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich.\nRichard Barton: Thanks, Brad. Good afternoon, and good evening to everyone dialing in to hear our second quarter 2024 results. We delivered another strong quarter in an ongoing challenging real estate macroenvironment, exceeding our outlook for revenue and EBITDA as we continue to successfully execute on our growth strategy. Today, we also announced, Jeremy Wacksman has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer of Zillow Group, and I will serve as Co-exec Chair of the Board of Directors alongside my Co-founder, Lloyd Frank. I have been CEO and/or Chairman since the day Lloyd and I seed-funded the Company in 2004 and will remain engaged. My role however will shift to supporting and counseling Jeremy Wacksman and the leadership team rather than daily operational leadership. Before talking about Jeremy and the team, let me talk about the state of the Company. The short version is that Zillow business is in great shape financially, strategically, operationally, and organizationally. We are executing well and are consistently outperforming the broader residential real estate industry as we methodically ship great software and services to digitize and integrate home buying, selling, financing, and renting, empowering consumers and partners alike. We have done this inside the Zillow-branded housing super app, the integrated consumer and partner experience we are rolling out in markets across the country and we continue to increase the breadth of our market coverage and the depth of transaction penetration within those markets. I am pleased with where we are in this effort and the opportunity we see for many years of growth ahead. We have also increasingly leveraged our brand trust and massive audience to diversify our revenue streams. We've leaned hard into the obvious and adjacent rentals and purchase mortgage opportunities, both of which are now exciting growth businesses for Zillow. Rentals now account for one-fifth of total Company revenue and Zillow Home Loans purchase mortgage origination volume grew more than 100% year-over-year again this quarter. Rentals has plenty of room to run and the mortgages opportunity for us is wide open and large. Additionally, we have built and acquired, then integrated, a quietly exciting set of products and services that we offer to the broader industry, brokers, MLSs, and the whole of the professional agent community. We are investing in broad industry-wide adoption of our suite of increasingly integrated digital content and workflow tools, including incredible products like our ShowingTime home touring solution, Follow Up Boss Agent CRM, DotLoop forms and document management, and Showcase 3D interactive listings. Our conviction is that a rising digital tide lifts all boats. A more digital industry using our software is better for consumers, better for our partners, and ultimately better for Zillow Group. We have unique ambition here and unique talent and resources to conjure it into reality. And through all of this innovation and expansion, the leadership team has maintained real cost discipline that is delivering improvements in EBITDA margins. Executing well against big, complex, interconnected opportunities requires amazing talent who have a clear strategy, high accountability, and high trust in one another, which leads me to Jeremy Wacksman, our new CEO, and the person we organized most of the Company around three years ago when we promoted him to COO. He has been supported by an exceptional team and has successfully positioned the Company to go after these multiple large opportunities as I have laid out. Jeremy is a familiar voice to you all on this call, but allow me to share some of his history. He has an engineering degree, which is not required here at Zillow, but it's nice. He also got his MBA many years ago, which the engineers don't hold against him. We found Jeremy at Microsoft in 2009 when Zillow was very small and recruited him into a product and marketing role. Throughout his time at Zillow, Jeremy has worn many hats. His responsibilities have steadily gained scope, spanning product, marketing, and operations. He has been a key strategic partner throughout his tenure, advising Lloyd and me on major strategy and product decisions. Early on, he helped pioneer mobile real estate shopping with the launch of the Zillow app. Later as CMO, he was critical to leading Zillow's consumer marketing strategy, establishing a high bar and a branding framework for what has become a rare, loved, and trusted household brand. His tenure as COO the past three years with all product, engineering, design, marketing, sales, IT, and go-to-market business operations reporting to him, has been a time of particularly impressive innovation for Zillow, which has put the Company back on an accelerating growth path following pandemic dislocation from which the industry has yet to recover. Jeremy operationalized Zillow's housing super app strategy while maintaining strong cost discipline, diversifying our revenue base, and growing the rentals and mortgages businesses. He successfully championed the Follow Up Boss and ShowingTime acquisitions, helping us deliver on our goal to provide agent partners and the broader industry with the best software solutions to power their businesses. He also organized, elevated, and recruited talent that makes up Zillow's world-class R&D organizations and increasingly critical sales and marketing operations. Jeremy's product-forward, consumer-first leadership, operational experience, and technology orientation make him right and ready to be CEO of Zillow now. I am confident in his judgment and his leadership, and I am excited to support him as he leads Zillow's next chapter. And with that, I'll now hand the mic over to Zillow Group's new Chief Executive Officer, Jeremy Wacksman.\nJeremy Wacksman: Thanks, Rich. Having spent the past 15 years at Zillow, I can honestly say, taking on this role is the honor of my career. I love this Company and I love this team, and I believe deeply in the digital future of real estate we're building for the benefit of buyers, sellers, renters, agents, the broader industry, and our shareholders. Zillow has a huge audience, a partner network comprising some of the best agent teams in the business, and tech and product prowess that is unmatched in residential real estate. With an increasingly diversified and growing business, we are primed to capitalize on the strength of the Zillow brand and capture a meaningful slice of the $30 billion accessible TAM in real estate, a slice that more closely reflects our reach in the category. And our results show we're making great headway. I'm excited to share that Zillow had another strong quarter, reporting better-than-expected revenue growth across the business. Q2 revenue was $572 million, up 13% year-over-year, which marks the eighth consecutive quarter our total revenue results have outperformed the residential real estate industry. We delivered double-digit year-over-year revenue growth and demonstrated cost discipline while continuing to invest to deliver solid EBITDA margin expansion year-over-year. Q2 residential revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $409 million. Rentals continued its strong growth with $117 million revenue in Q2, up 29% year-over-year. Multifamily revenue is up 44% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our multifamily property count, with 44,000 properties at the end of Q2, up from 40,000 at the end of Q1. We also continued to make strong progress in mortgages, with Q2 revenue of $34 million, up 42% year-over-year, and purchase mortgage origination volume growing 125% year-over-year. These successes come despite a persistently challenging mortgage rate environment, as evidenced by our estimate of total industry purchase loan origination volume being down mid-single digits year-over-year in Q2. We continue to believe our most important investments are in tech innovations that improve the customer experience, which has helped us earn and maintain our strong brand position and massive engaged audience of movers. In Q2, we reported 231 million average monthly unique users across the Zillow ecosystem of apps and sites. As you'll remember from previous calls and our February investor presentation, about 80% of our users come to us organically, and they're using our app three times more than anyone else in the category. Another way to measure traffic and brand strength is through Comscore, which is widely viewed among internet brands as a reliable, transparent third-party source because it aims to capture the number of unique visitors while deduping cookies. According to Comscore, Zillow Group's apps and sites had 116 million average monthly unique visitors in Q2. We're pleased with the progress we're making to transform and digitize the moving experience on behalf of buyers, sellers, renters, agents, and the broader industry. Since 2022, we've been building the digitally integrated transaction experience and testing it in our Enhanced Markets across the country. Through this year, we've been increasing our breadth of coverage across more markets, and our depth of penetration in those markets as we drive towards sustainable profitable growth. As of the end of Q2, we're in 19 Enhanced Markets, expanding to 36 by the end of August, well on our way to achieving our goal of 40 by the end of 2024. As we've said, Zillow is the housing super app, and we are continually adding updates and improvements to it, guided by our five for-sale growth pillars: touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network, and integrating our services. Our for-sale growth pillars mark the pathway to meeting our goals to increase customer transaction share to 6% by the end of 2025. We are also focused on building up Rentals, which currently represents 20% of our revenue and is growing rapidly. First up is touring. Integrating our touring solutions into our buyer flow is meaningfully improving our ability to identify high-intent customers and connect them with our Premier Agent partners. We've seen that those touring connections convert at three times the rate of other actions on Zillow. Last month, we nearly doubled the number of markets with Real Time Touring, and we're seeing positive early results from being better able to connect higher-intent customers with our Premier Agent partners. In fact, we have already achieved our end-of-year target of approximately 20% of our connections coming from Real Time Touring, as well as improved transaction conversion. As one of the many product improvements we're making to this part of the customer journey, as a leader in touring software, last quarter we introduced a Touring Agreement that instills more transparency into the process. The early indicators of success we saw in our pilot gave us the confidence to integrate it into Zillow's touring experience, and just last week, the agreement became part of the \"request a tour\" flow on Zillow for nearly 80% of our tour connections. We plan to roll it out to remaining tour connections in the coming months. Facilitating consumer-friendly agreements earlier in the funnel is not only an opportunity for us to help educate consumers and agents navigate the industry rule changes, but it also helps us identify higher-intent customers, send more qualified connections to our Premier Agent partners, and drive conversion rates. I'll now move on to financing. We have been working to integrate Zillow Home Loans more seamlessly with our Premier Agent partner network and throughout the customer journey. Overall, customer adoption rates in our nine most mature Enhanced Markets have reached the mid-teens, and nearly 60% of our Zillow Home Loan originations are represented by a Premier Agent partner. To further capture buyers' attention, we've also launched innovative tools through Zillow Home Loans to help them more accurately understand what they can afford. In Q2, we introduced a feature called BuyAbility, which gives buyers a personalized, real-time estimate of the home price and monthly payment that fit within their budget, powered by mortgage rates through Zillow Home Loans and available to check regularly in the Zillow app. Our efforts have accelerated purchase mortgage growth, with $756 million in purchase loan origination volume in Q2, a 125% year-over-year increase. We expect continued purchase mortgage growth for Zillow Home Loans as we launch more Enhanced Markets and continue to improve our go-to-market integration with our Premier Agent partners. For our seller solutions update, I'll focus on Zillow Showcase, a unique offering unlike anything else available today that not only makes selling a home easier, but also creates real value for sellers and their agents. Zillow Showcase elevates agents' brand presence on Zillow and provides an enhanced shopping experience through our AI-powered homegrown rich media and floor plan technology. Showcase listings drive higher engagement compared to similar non-Showcase listings on Zillow, more views, more saves, and more shares. But even more importantly, homes that list with Showcase are selling faster and for more money. Showcase listings typically sell for 2% more than similar non-Showcase listings on Zillow, a bonus of more than $9,000 on a home sold at the average home sale price. Homes listed with Showcase are also more likely to secure an accepted offer within 14 days. And what's more, we've observed that agents who use Zillow Showcase are winning 20% more listings than similar agents on Zillow. These results have made it an attractive offering for real estate professionals. Zillow Showcase is available to agents in every market after launching nationwide earlier this year. Even though it's early days, we are pleased to share that more than 1% of all new listings nationwide are now using Showcase. We are on our way to our goal of 5% to 10% listing coverage, which represents a $150 million to $300 million annual revenue opportunity. And we believe there is potential for future growth beyond that. This takes me to our next update, enhancing our partner network. Our Premier Agent partners represent some of the best, most professional agents in real estate who we believe are poised to take share in the evolution the industry is experiencing. Recall that not every real estate agent is a Zillow Premier Agent partner. In fact, since 2015, we've shrunk our active partner base by roughly 60%, while our Premier Agent revenue has grown by more than 2.5 times over the same timeframe. We've oriented Premier Agent around some of the best agent teams, those that we believe provide superior customer service, understand the industry and their local market, have a proven ability to scale and make the most money to invest alongside us. The top 20% of agent teams handle 80% of transactions and nearly four in five of those Premier Agent partners are in that top tier. We are supporting our partners by providing them with some of the best digital tools and solutions. For example, we're really pleased with the early results eight months after our acquisition of Follow Up Boss, one of real estate's leading customer relationship management systems. More than 70% of our connections in Enhanced Markets are being managed through Follow Up Boss. And those substantial adoption rates set the stage for us to build and improve features and services that help those partners gain share. And finally, integrating our services, where the for-sale growth pillars come together in the Zillow Housing super app experience. Providing high-intent customers with valuable solutions, working with some of the best agents, and providing those agents with some of the best tools, has paid off for us. In our first four Enhanced Markets, we've seen revenue growth per total transaction value increase by more than 80% since the beginning of 2023, compared with the more than 50% growth we reported back on the February call. And as we expand, we are consistently seeing signs of repeatable success. In the 13 Enhanced Markets we were in at the end of Q1, we are seeing gains in revenue per total transaction value. We see an opportunity to increase conversion and revenue per total transaction value even more from here as we launch the remaining Enhanced Markets this year. Now, turning our focus to rentals. Last quarter, we released an investor presentation and talked through the massive opportunity in front of us. Today, there is no nationwide marketplace containing all rental listings, resulting in a fragmented experience for renters. We are building a two-sided marketplace with a comprehensive suite of listings, both multifamily and longtail that enables renters to more easily shop, tour, apply, sign a lease, and pay rent securely, all on one convenient platform, Zillow. Having more rental listings and multifamily properties, and ramping up our marketing, have both helped drive customer awareness of rentals on Zillow. In June, our total Rentals Unique Visitors were up more than 20% year over year according to Comscore, widening our margin as the leading online rentals brand, with the largest audience and No. 1 preference among renters. We expect multifamily to be the primary driver of our Rentals revenue growth, and we made great progress in Q2. Zillow now has 44,000 multifamily properties, 38% more than a year ago. And our exclusive partnership with Realtor.com is further boosting exposure for our multifamily listings, helping our partners reach even more renters. We have a lot of work ahead, but with multifamily revenue up 44% year-over-year, we are on our way, with a billion-dollar-plus revenue opportunity in front of us. Before handing it over to Jeremy Hofmann, I want to congratulate the exceptional Zillow team on our eighth consecutive quarter of total revenue outperformance. It's their dedication and expertise that continue to drive our business forward as we work to deliver exceptional products and services for consumers, agents, and the broader industry. Our successes to date give me a great deal of confidence in our future. We are on track to meet our expectations for 2024 to deliver double-digit revenue growth and modestly expand our EBITDA margins. And we believe we are on our way to strong GAAP profitability over time that benefits all of us as shareholders. Thank you for being on this journey with us. I will now pass the line over to Jeremy Hofmann.\nJeremy Hofmann: Thanks, Jeremy, and congratulations. I'm really excited for you and for us as you lead us through this next chapter for the Company. I will start with our Q2, 2024 results, which exceeded expectations for revenue and EBITDA. Revenue in Q2 was up 13% year-over-year to $572 million, which was $39 million above the midpoint of our outlook range. Our strategy is working and we are seeing our investments drive outperformance across each of our revenue categories, including residential, rentals, and mortgages. For the quarter, we outperformed the broader residential real-estate industry growth of 3% according to data from the NAR. Additionally, we estimate that the total purchase loan volume for mortgage buyers, which is more aligned with our customer base for Premier Agent was down mid-single digits year-over-year in Q2 and underperformed the overall market. On a GAAP basis, Q2 net loss was $17 million, representing 3% of our revenue. EBITDA was $134 million for the quarter, resulting in a 23% EBITDA margin, a year-over-year margin expansion of more than 100 basis points. The combination of our revenue outperformance and effective cost management delivered the improved year-over-year EBITDA results. Q2 residential revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $409 million, outperforming our outlook range. Our Premier Agent revenue benefited from the ongoing investments in our top and mid-funnel experiences that drove improvements in our overall connection rates, and we also saw better-than-expected conversion rates. Looking at our relative performance, the investments we have made since the beginning of 2022 throughout our funnel have paid off. Over the last two years, we have increased our ability to connect customers with Partner Agents by over 2,000 basis points. This has led to residential revenue in Q2 growing 4% when compared to the same period in 2022 or more than 2,000 basis points better than the industry, which is down approximately 20% over the same time period. Rentals revenue grew 29% year-over-year in Q2 to $117 million, primarily driven by our multifamily revenue, which grew 44% year-over-year. We are executing well on our rental strategy to develop a two-sided marketplace with the most comprehensive set of rentals listings. We saw the number of multifamily properties on our apps and sites grow 38% year-over-year, reaching an all-time high of 44,000 multifamily properties as of the end of Q2. Total active listings across our entire rentals marketplace were up more than 16% year-over-year to an industry-leading 1.9 million listings in June. Mortgages revenue growth accelerated in Q2, up 42% year-over-year to $34 million as revenue growth begins to more closely align with Zillow Home Loan's growth. ZHL purchase loan origination volume grew 125% year-over-year to $756 million in Q2. Our mortgage strategy to provide consumers greater financing choice with greater ease from a brand they trust is leading to more customers choosing financing through Zillow Home Loans. EBITDA expenses in Q2 totaled $438 million, in line with our outlook as a result of our ongoing focus on cost management. We ended Q2 with $2.6 billion of cash and investments, down from $2.9 billion at the end of Q1. Positive net operating cash flow was more than offset by $88 million of repurchases of convertible senior notes due in 2025 and the repurchase of $292 million of our shares at a weighted average price of roughly $42. As of the end of Q2, we had $1.5 billion of outstanding convertible debt, which includes $608 million that is due in September of this year and $419 million that is due in May of 2025. We expect to settle the principal balances in cash and any conversion premiums in shares of Class C capital stock. After backing out our convertible debt, we had a net cash and investments balance of $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter, which gives us continued financial flexibility going forward. Turning to our outlook for Q3, we expect residential revenue to be between $375 million and $385 million. Our residential revenue outlook for Q3 is driven by the normal seasonality of Premier Agent as well as continued strong contributions from our ShowingTime Plus, New Construction, and Follow Up Boss product offerings. We expect rentals revenue to grow in the mid-20% range year-over-year in Q3. We expect multifamily revenue to grow faster than rentals revenue overall as we benefit from our sales execution, our National Brand Awareness campaign, and our partnership with Realtor.com. For mortgages, we expect a similar year-over-year revenue growth rate to what we reported in Q2, 2024. We remain on track to further integrate Premier Agent and Zillow Home Loans with our planned enhanced market expansion in Q3. We expect total revenue to be between $545 million and $560 million in Q3, implying a year-over-year increase of 11% at the midpoint of our outlook range. This compares to our estimates for the residential real-estate industry total transaction value to be in the mid-single-digit year-over-year growth range for Q3. We expect EBITDA to be between $95 million and $110 million in Q3, equating to a 19% margin at the midpoint of our outlook range. This implies EBITDA expenses will increase from $438 million in Q2 to an estimated $450 million in Q3. The sequential increase in EBITDA expenses is driven by an uptick in our brand marketing spend related to our Rental Brand campaign. We expect EBITDA costs to decline sequentially from Q3 to Q4 as marketing spend decreases in line with typical seasonal media spend. Moving to the full year, I want to reiterate that we expect to drive double-digit revenue growth for 2024 with modest EBITDA margin expansion, primarily driven by our growth pillars. Our annual fixed-cost run-rate is approximately $1 billion, consistent with where we stood at the end of 2023. We continue to believe our fixed investments are at the right level, which should result in our fixed costs growing modestly with inflation. Consistent with previous quarters, our variable costs are expected to grow ahead of revenue initially as we ramp new hires to be fully productive. Advertising spend is a lever we view as separate and distinct from the rest of the cost base and one we will pull depending on the growth opportunities we see in front of us. We are demonstrating the benefit of pulling this advertising lever in our rentals marketplace, given the growth we are seeing in traffic and revenue, and we are pleased with the early results. To close, it is clear we are executing on our strategy. We are growing across every part of our business. We are seeing great results from our growth pillars in our Enhanced Markets that we'll continue to roll out this year and we are on track to grow revenue by double-digits and expand margins in 2024. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ronald Josey from Citi.\nRonald Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. This is new. Making sure you can hear me okay, guys. Rich, Jeremy, Jeremy, can you hear me?\nRichard Barton: We got you, Ron. We got you.\nRonald Josey: All right, cool. So, congrats on the new roles, Jeremy, specifically, and Rich, back to Chairman. You mentioned in your conversation up front just how Zillow is in great shape financially, strategically, operationally, organizationally, and why now is the right time. At the same time, the industry is going through a change. So, just a little more insights on why now would be helpful. And then, more importantly, I guess, when we have Enhanced Markets now in 36 markets by the end of August, 40 by the end of the year, I think accounting for around, call it 40% of total connections, we get a lot of questions around the benefits of Enhanced Markets. So, can you take a step back and just remind us on the benefits of Enhanced Markets as we get to that, call it, 6% of transactions? I'd love to hear more about what you're seeing in some of the markets. And then, given the structural change in the industry, how does Enhanced Markets sort of impact that or benefit from it? Thanks, guys, and congrats again.\nRichard Barton: Thanks, Ron. So, maybe I'll take the first bit, Jeremy Wacksman, and you can comment on the second. That sound good?\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes.\nRichard Barton: Yes, okay. Yes, I mean, it's incredibly impressive to me, Ron, how well we are executing as a Company, despite all of the kind of stormy weather that is -- that constitutes the real estate macro. I mean, we're just posting terrific numbers. We have, for three years now, since Jeremy Wacksman was promoted to COO, running most of the Company and all the lines of business, we have talked about our housing super app strategy and our rental strategy and our mortgages strategy. And I would say, you all, as investors, have been like, okay, show me that that is actually going to work as a way to digitize and integrate this transaction and create a really big long-term growth opportunity. And I would say now that strategically, we have kind of de-risked the concept of what we're building here. We have a long way to go to execute and fulfill what I see as our ultimate right of market share and claiming that and growth, but strategically, we are in really good shape. And that is in no small part due to Jeremy Wacksman's leadership over the last few years, getting this all together. And so, that is why the time is right. Jeremy is ready, the company is ready, and Ron, personally, I am ready as well. I'm not going anywhere, I'm not doing anything else, but I'm really excited to be moving to a role of coach and advisor rather than the daily field general. Thank you. But maybe I'll have our new Chief Executive Officer, Jeremy Wacksman, answer the second part of your question.\nJeremy Wacksman: Absolutely. Thanks, Ron. On Enhanced Markets, just a reminder, since you asked, the metrics there, it's market share, and we measure that in terms of revenue per total transaction value, and then it's also revenue per transaction, right? So, NUM transactions and revenue per transaction gets you to that, and 17 -- 36 markets by the end of August, on our way to 40 by the end of the year, that in each of those markets, we're not serving 100% of customers. So, I think we gave a stat earlier this year, that's going to be about 20% of all customers will get that experience, and that experience allows them to get real-time touring and a touring experience, Zillow Home Loans as a financing option if they choose it, and then most importantly, the Enhanced Partner Network, the hand-picked set of partners that Jeremy Hofmann talked about in his prepared remarks, that really deliver a great job, provide great customer service, run professionalized businesses for the modern internet consumer. So, that's what the Enhanced Market experience is. As we bring that to more and more customers, we are seeing in the markets we're in revenue per total transaction value gains, and we expect those gains to contribute to more of our residential and total Company revenue as we get to that 20% of customers and then into next year, more of those customers. And so, the land and expand strategy is working well. We're really excited to accelerate to 36 markets by the end of August and be at 40 markets by the end of the year.\nRonald Josey: Thank you, Jeremy. Thank you, Rich.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Erickson from RBC. Your line is open, Brad. Feel free to unmute. All right, why don't we return to -- we'll come back. So, we'll go to Nick Jones from Citizens JMP.\nNicholas Jones: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations, Jeremy. I have two questions. First, can you maybe double-click on the rentals business? 44% growth in multifamily is impressive. Can you maybe speak to the key drivers behind the success? How are the conversations evolving with the multifamily operators, giving you the confidence to go to kind of spend after that $1 billion revenue opportunity you've hung out? And then the second question may be on traffic volumes. You called out three times more app users. I think, as the competitive environment heats up around residential, folks are increasingly focused on some of these engagement metrics. Can you maybe speak to the -- or remind us of the benefits of the app as opposed to web traffic or mobile web? Thank you.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Nick. Thanks for the questions. On rentals, yes, as I said, a little bit in my prepared remarks, and we shared for those that were on in February, a more detailed investor presentation on our rental strategy. We're so excited about our rental strategy because it's really unique and it really solves the consumer problem, right? What renters want is to find all the inventory. There is no one place for all the inventory. There is no MLS for rentals. So, they end up having to shop everywhere during a really compressed timeframe. It's super stressful. And so, we set out years ago to try and assemble as much of the inventory as possible, both multifamily, the big buildings we all know, and long tail. The millions of homes and small unit properties that are out there for rent that turn over infrequently by a long tail of owners. And we've done that. We now have the most listings. We still don't have them all. Every year we try and go after more and we're growing our listing count. But we have the most inventory of anyone out there. And that has yielded us the most audience, the biggest audience of renters, right? So, Zillow's rental network is the largest audience. It just grew 20% year-over-year this last month. And it continues to grow because renters want that product. And so, that two-sided marketplace now gives way to the monetization growth you're seeing coming from multifamily. And so, that's the stats I gave in my prepared remarks. 44,000 buildings on Zillow now, up from 40,000 last quarter. That's driving the 29% revenue growth you're seeing, which 44% revenue growth in multifamily, that's coming from that property count and that engagement with the advertisers. So, that's what gets us so excited. It's this really great win-win marketplace where the consumer's getting a better and better experience as the supply comes online. And that then in turn drives the demand and makes the product better for the renters and vice versa. So, that's why you've heard Jeremy Hofmann talk about using advertising as a lever to help stimulate demand, to help continue to make that marketplace spin. And that's what gives us the excitement, not just in Q2's growth and in the guide for rentals, but in the $1 billion-plus business opportunity we see in front of us. And then on traffic, yes, I mean, we have talked long about how the most important part of audience is the engagement with that audience. And I talked in my prepared remarks, you can measure cookies and devices in people many ways, but what matters is, do people know who you are? Do they use you to shop? Do they find a light in your services? And Zillow has long believed that the best way to drive audience is great products, great innovative products amplified by marketing. And you see that in the mix of our traffic, right? 80% of our audience comes to us brand-direct. They come to us because they know who we are and they choose to use us. And app usage is a good measure of that, right? And so that's why I talked about the app being used three times more than the others in the category. It's just a great measure of really healthy, deep engagement. If you're buying a home, if you're actually trying to shop, you're going to use an app and you're going to use a desktop website that ties to that app. And you're going to use us as a shopping experience and you're going to use an agent that you find from us and that's going to lead you down the funnel to these transactions. So, that's why for us, brand engagement and health of traffic is so important. It is the start of this transaction strategy we're on. And as we talk a lot about, our goal is to take all that great app usage engagement with audience and turn that into more transactions, right? Our goal of 6% transaction share comes from taking this 60%, 70% audience share we have and getting more of them to use us and use our housing super app to actually buy, rent, finance, or sell their home.\nNicholas Jones: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question, we'll return to Brad Erickson from RBC.\nBradley Erickson: Hi, can you guys hear me?\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes, we got you, Brad.\nBradley Erickson: Technology is hard. Couple of questions just on the -- I have to ask the obligatory commission question. Just first, just latest and greatest views on kind of the changes coming and any noticeable observations yet and kind of what feedback are you getting from your PAs as we head into August 17th. And then second, I guess if we assume that, any effect of the regulatory changes may vary a lot up and down kind of the spectrum of the market. Talk about how you view Zillow's exposure, particularly to do that to the degree that there is any change with commissions. Thanks.\nJeremy Hofmann: Yes, Brad, it's Jeremy Hofmann. I'll take that one. I think we can't really speak to broad commission trends just because 80% of our Premier Agent base is in that top 20% of all producers. So, we're working with the top agents versus a broad swath of professionals. That said, across our business, we've seen commission rates stay in a pretty tight band over the past three years. 2024 is down a few basis points versus 2023, but in line with 2022 levels. And I think just stepping back, we've been pretty consistent here for a while. We believe we and our partners are the outsized beneficiaries of these changes coming in the industry. We have the most customers, we work with the best partners, we provide the most technology, and we expect our PAs will deliver and get paid because they provide great service and they, and we, we think will be sharetakers in any future evolution or dispersion of the industry. So, that's how we're seeing it. That's been very consistent for a while now, and nothing has really changed our minds on that based on the latest things that we can see.\nBradley Erickson: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore.\nMark Mahaney: Two things. One, I just want to wish you, Rich, the best at whatever you're going to do operationally going forward. So, just congrats on all the success with the Company over the years, and best of luck to you too, Jeremy, in the new CEO role. I just want to ask one question about the customer transactions share. So, I know the goal has long been to get to the 6%. And could you just quantify, are there lead markets where you think you're -- are there any lead markets now where you think you're within spitting distance of that, of the different Enhanced Markets that you're in? I know you've provided some data around, but I just wanted to focus just on that number. Are there other markets where you think you're within a point or a point and a half of that? Thanks a lot.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. Thanks, Mark. I'll -- on the market share gains, I think I said my prepared remarks -- I said my prepared remarks, the way we're measuring that is revenue per total transaction value growth. And in the first, in the oldest Enhanced Markets where we have the most data and we have good year-over-years, which we've given you an update on earlier this year, we said we were up 50% year-over-year. That growth has accelerated to 80% year-over-year in those first four. And then in the 13 that we've been in since Q1, we don't have year-over-years yet, but the early trend line is gains in revenue per total transaction value across those 13. So, that curve looks similar to us. As we get into next year, we'll have year-over-years on more markets. So, that's what gives us confidence that as we take this recipe, this housing super app integrated experience to more partners in each market and to more markets, we'll see that same trend line of share in revenue per total transaction value grow the way we're seeing it in our four original markets.\nJeremy Hofmann: Yes, and Mark, I'll just pile on a bit. It's Jeremy Hofmann. Jeremy Wacksman said it, we were at 50% in the first four markets, we grew revenue in 2023, 50% versus total transaction value. And we're now at 80% through 18 months of that. So, you're seeing a consistent steady growth. And then on top of that, we saw really good results in our oldest markets, which we put in the investor deck we did in February, where in Phoenix and Atlanta over call it two-year period, we saw 80% and 90% transaction growth during that period of time, which is effectively -- is close to double. So, those are the types of proof points that make us feel quite good. And why you see us accelerating the way that we have going from 19 to 36 pretty quickly is just because we keep seeing really solid results that we think sets us up quite well for continued future growth.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thank you very much.\nJeremy Wacksman: Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan McKeveny from Zelman.\nRyan McKeveny: Hey guys, congrats, Jeremy and Rich, nice job on the quarter. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask, from a macro perspective around first-time buyers. So, there's been periods in the past where that was called out as a tailwind. Last quarter, it was mentioned as a headwind within the guidance. And obviously, you strongly outperformed that. So, is your sense that this quarter's results came in where they were in spite of a drag that did exist from that first-time buyer dynamic? Or did something maybe change beneath the surface where that just didn't turn out to be the headwind you might've expected? And kind of part two of that is just any views on this dynamic into the third quarter and kind of what's embedded within the guidance there?\nJeremy Hofmann: Yes, sure. Ryan, I'll take it. It's Jeremy Hofmann. I think the mortgages market was challenged in Q2. We called that out in the May call and it persisted. So, we think that it was down mid-single digits year-over-year versus 3% up for the housing market. So, there was a headwind there. We just happened to perform quite well throughout it. And that's a great story for us. It's one that we feel quite good about. And that's a function really of us outperforming across the business. I think we really performed well. On the residential side, we had a soft pocket in late March and early April when rates spiked, but then they normalized. And as a result, our MVP marketplace got healthier throughout the quarter, both on new sales and lower term. And then additionally, the conversion across Premier Agent, both MVP and Flex was stronger than we anticipated. And that flowed through right to revenue. And then on the rest of the residential side, Showcase is growing nicely. The New Construction marketplace is growing nicely, and Follow Up Boss is outperforming what we expected in early days of the acquisition. And then you have mortgages and rentals. Obviously, Jeremy's talked a bit about that already, but rentals was up 29%, multifamily was up 44%. And then CHL grew 125%. So, really when we look across all of the business in Q2, it felt quite good regardless of what's going on in the first-time home buyer market. And then I'd be sufficed to say like on the EBITDA front, we're pretty proud of the consistent ability to accurately forecast and hold ourselves accountable on costs. As we tell the team, when we're in a market like this, revenue is harder to forecast, which makes it even more important to be really good on the cost line. And for Q2, we expected $440 million of costs. We came in at 438 million. So, when we outperform on the revenue front, it all flowed through to the EBITDA line.\nRyan McKeveny: That's very helpful. Thank you, Jeremy. And also on the mortgage piece. So, obviously some momentum under the surface there sequentially and year-over-year growing nicely. I know there are some moving pieces with the very significant growth in purchase origination volume, but some of the offset on the marketplace side. Can you just remind us where the marketplace stands at this point, both strategically in terms of where that fits in, maybe in terms of loan products or differences against ZHL and just kind of how you think of that mix between ZHL and marketplace moving forward?\nJeremy Hofmann: Yes, Ryan, I can take it as Jeremy Hofmann and then Jeremy Wacksman may pile in as well. But I think that you're right that the bulk of the business going forward is going to be Zillow Home Loans. So, you see the mortgage category start to more accurately map to the Zillow Home Loans growth. That's not to say the marketplace isn't important too. It's just secondary. There are going to be -- inevitably there are going to be times in which we can't service a customer through Zillow Home Loans and we like having the marketplace as a way to serve customers regardless, right? We're always about customer choice and making sure that in financing, we're providing customer choice as well. So, we feel quite good about both of those businesses, but the vast majority of the focus going forward is going to be in Zillow Home Loans.\nRyan McKeveny: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Campbell from Stephens.\nJohn Campbell: Hey guys and Rich, congrats on helping position the business for a pretty promising setup here in the years ahead. Glad you'll be able to see it through on the board seat. And then of course, congrats to you, Jeremy, well-deserved. But a two-part question here, first on the touring agreement. You guys called out early indicators of success in your pilot. I think you also for the last couple of years have said that touring connections have converted at three times the rate. I've got to believe that touring agreement probably boosts that conversion rates. It's obviously signaling even more or greater intent. Maybe if you could talk, go a little bit deeper into what you're seeing this far. And then, I've got one more quick one on Zillow Home Loans.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes. Thanks, John. Thanks for the congrats. And on touring, you're right. We continue to see touring actions convert higher than any other action on Zillow. And our expectation is, the touring agreement will be a net benefit to conversion because it's in the flow post-introduction. And so, it's just education and it's helpful qualification. And the pilot was small. We saw basically no negative to like likely positive impact there as we started to engage consumers. And so that's what gave us the confidence to roll it out, to take it to now almost 80% of connections. And we expect to get to all eventually. So, I think you nailed the idea of education to the consumer done in a consumer-friendly way helps get that consumer more informed before they get to the tour and makes it more likely that they'll want to work with the agent. As you know, having worked with us and followed us for a long time, the lag on seeing that data in transactions is long, right? So, a pilot market, a tour experience, measuring transaction rates with those agents is going to be a period of quarters and quarters and quarters. But the early indicator data gave us confidence that this is a good thing. And that's why we proceeded so rapidly to roll it out.\nJohn Campbell: Okay, that's great to hear. And then on the Zillow Home Loans, I mean, obviously refi was, I think about half of your origination mix two years ago, that dropped to 1% last year. So, I think it's probably a good problem you're having as far as like capacity issues. It seems like you got an exorbitant amount of demand on purchase, but I'm just curious about how you're thinking about the staffing, how you're thinking about if there is a degree of a mini refi wave, if you feel like you can participate in that in a year or so ahead.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes, I mean, our focus has been on purchase, not just because of where the refi market was. And I think it will remain on purchase. And that's just because of what we've talked about as our opportunity, right? You've heard us talk a lot about -- I mean, everything we've said about the integrated transaction and the benefits for the consumer, it is for the home buyer. And our ability to go have more and more customers who either start by asking that purchase financing question or ask that go shop question, end up getting exposure to our great agents and our great financing options. That's demand that we won't tap out of for a long time. And that's what we're methodically scaling, both in our Enhanced Market strategy as we roll out more Enhanced Markets, but also digitally to our consumers that come to the website and actually want to start with a, what can I afford? This is a tough market question. So, we are, I think, in a privileged position to be able to go build durable growth in the mortgage business, really focused on purchase. And we're excited about how we did in Q2. And we're excited about our plans for Q3.\nJohn Campbell: Indeed. Thanks for the time, guys.\nJeremy Wacksman: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Colantuoni from Jefferies.\nJohn Colantuoni: Hey, can you hear me?\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes, we got you, John.\nJohn Colantuoni: Okay, great. Thanks for the questions. So, I wanted to just start with the housing market. I was hoping you could unpack the outlook for mid-single-digit growth in residential housing transactions during the third quarter, with pending sales down 8% in June. I'm just curious if your outlook incorporates an assumption that the market bounces back a bit in August and September, based on a potentially recent pickup in activity. And second, it looks like your outlook for the residential revenue segment implies a bit of underperformance for the Premier Agent business relative to your mid-single-digit housing market outlook, if you exclude the M&A tailwind from follow-up loss. Can you just talk about the drivers of that underperformance and maybe if you've embedded some room for upside in that assumption? Thanks.\nJeremy Hofmann: Yes. Thanks, John. It's Jeremy Hofmann, so I'll take it. Similar to what we've said in the past, we don't really over-focus on the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, given how fluid macro has been and will continue to be. We're pleased that we've outperformed the industry by 2,000 basis points in residential over the last two years, and that's really a credit to the product experiences that we're driving, the conversion gains we're driving, and the partner experiences that we're driving. At the same time, we are seeing healthy growth versus that mortgage market, so that was called out earlier in the call. That's where we tend to index, our customer base tends to index, and those folks are struggling comparatively. So, they -- the first-time homebuyer, if you measure it by the mortgage market, is underperforming 800 to 1,000 basis points per -- in Q2, and we think those trends probably continue into Q3. So, I think we feel all-in quite good about where the business is, knowing that that's out there. And I think most important is just the consistent outperformance we've had across both residential and the total company. We expect to continue to do so as we roll out our Enhanced Markets and see success there. Jeremy's talked a lot about that, but that's a really important piece to the future story, and we're just getting started rolling markets out. And I will kind of step back and remind you all, Q1, we were up 13% year-over-year. As a Company, Q2, we were up 13% year-over-year. Our outlook calls for a revenue range of 10% to 13% for Q3. We're clearly well on our way to double-digit revenue growth in 2024 and margin expansion, and it's been a rough housing market. So, we sit there and feel like the business is really well-positioned despite all that.\nJohn Colantuoni: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Champion from Piper Sandler.\nThomas Champion: Hi guys, good afternoon. Hopefully, you can hear me as well. Jeremy, as you take the baton as CEO, what's your top goal for the business over the medium term? What are you looking to achieve? And then maybe for Jeremy Hofmann, can you talk about the margin profile associated with Enhanced Markets? Does this get you closer to GAAP profitability? Thanks.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yes, I'll start, Tom. And maybe, Jeremy, you can hit margin profile. I mean, Tom, it's going to sound a little boring, but my focus and strategy is more of what we've been doing. And I think accelerating and continuing to roll out our Enhanced Market strategy, continuing to grow our rentals business into the opportunity we've laid out for you all, continuing to build mortgage into the big business we know it can be, and then powering all that with the amazing software and technology we are building to help rewire the real estate industry for agents, teams, and brokers writ large. Like that has been our strategy we've talked to you all about for the last however many calls. You're seeing the early signs and results of that play out in the output numbers. And we're really excited to have more of this come to light so you see more of it in the output numbers in the years to come as we grow into the share target we have for you all and then grow our business beyond that. So, oftentimes when there's a leadership change, there's like a what's going to change question. And the answer is, not much is going to change. We're going to focus on continuing to execute, deliver, scale, and accelerate this into the future.\nJeremy Hofmann: Yes, and then I can take the margin question. I think it's less about Enhanced Markets. On our march to get profitability, it's really around the cost structure we've laid out. So, we have roughly $1 billion in fixed costs today. We feel like we're pretty well invested there to at least get to our 2025 share targets. And so, we expect that to grow kind of modestly with inflation. Variable is 25% to 30% of revenue. That will scale a little faster than revenue when we ramp up, but ultimately that's a good profile. And then the balance is in marketing and advertising. So, we feel good that if we are controlled on the fixed side, we can grow revenue faster than cost on the EBITDA front. And you're seeing that in the margin expansion you've seen throughout this year so far. And then going forward on the GAAP side, the next thing that's really important to us is getting stock-based compensation in a good spot. So, we've committed to shrinking SBC total dollars year-over-year in 2024 versus 2023, and then even more so as a percentage of revenue. And it's important to remember that 90% of our SBC cost sits in that fixed bucket. So, as we keep our eyes really, really focused on that, we're going to get more and more leverage on SBC over time. And that puts us on a nice path to get to GAAP profitability.\nThomas Champion: Thank you, both.\nOperator: This completes the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Rich Barton for any closing remarks.\nRichard Barton: Hey, thank you all. As you guys can see, the Company is really doing well. The Company is on firm footing. And as you can also see demonstrated in this call and on many calls before, Jeremy Wacksman is ready to lead and the broader leadership team is ready as well. And so, I'm super excited. There is a ton of clean water in front of the Company, lots of opportunity. Maybe the wind will change direction and come behind us one of these days, but we certainly don't need it. But I'm sure it'll happen at some point. I want to thank you all for being on the journey with us. We'll talk to you soon.",

            "name": "Jeremy Hofmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremy, and congratulations. I'm really excited for you and for us as you lead us through this next chapter for the Company. I will start with our Q2, 2024 results, which exceeded expectations for revenue and EBITDA. Revenue in Q2 was up 13% year-over-year to $572 million, which was $39 million above the midpoint of our outlook range. Our strategy is working and we are seeing our investments drive outperformance across each of our revenue categories, including residential, rentals, and mortgages. For the quarter, we outperformed the broader residential real-estate industry growth of 3% according to data from the NAR. Additionally, we estimate that the total purchase loan volume for mortgage buyers, which is more aligned with our customer base for Premier Agent was down mid-single digits year-over-year in Q2 and underperformed the overall market. On a GAAP basis, Q2 net loss was $17 million, representing 3% of our revenue. EBITDA was $134 million for the quarter, resulting in a 23% EBITDA margin, a year-over-year margin expansion of more than 100 basis points. The combination of our revenue outperformance and effective cost management delivered the improved year-over-year EBITDA results. Q2 residential revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $409 million, outperforming our outlook range. Our Premier Agent revenue benefited from the ongoing investments in our top and mid-funnel experiences that drove improvements in our overall connection rates, and we also saw better-than-expected conversion rates. Looking at our relative performance, the investments we have made since the beginning of 2022 throughout our funnel have paid off. Over the last two years, we have increased our ability to connect customers with Partner Agents by over 2,000 basis points. This has led to residential revenue in Q2 growing 4% when compared to the same period in 2022 or more than 2,000 basis points better than the industry, which is down approximately 20% over the same time period. Rentals revenue grew 29% year-over-year in Q2 to $117 million, primarily driven by our multifamily revenue, which grew 44% year-over-year. We are executing well on our rental strategy to develop a two-sided marketplace with the most comprehensive set of rentals listings. We saw the number of multifamily properties on our apps and sites grow 38% year-over-year, reaching an all-time high of 44,000 multifamily properties as of the end of Q2. Total active listings across our entire rentals marketplace were up more than 16% year-over-year to an industry-leading 1.9 million listings in June. Mortgages revenue growth accelerated in Q2, up 42% year-over-year to $34 million as revenue growth begins to more closely align with Zillow Home Loan's growth. ZHL purchase loan origination volume grew 125% year-over-year to $756 million in Q2. Our mortgage strategy to provide consumers greater financing choice with greater ease from a brand they trust is leading to more customers choosing financing through Zillow Home Loans. EBITDA expenses in Q2 totaled $438 million, in line with our outlook as a result of our ongoing focus on cost management. We ended Q2 with $2.6 billion of cash and investments, down from $2.9 billion at the end of Q1. Positive net operating cash flow was more than offset by $88 million of repurchases of convertible senior notes due in 2025 and the repurchase of $292 million of our shares at a weighted average price of roughly $42. As of the end of Q2, we had $1.5 billion of outstanding convertible debt, which includes $608 million that is due in September of this year and $419 million that is due in May of 2025. We expect to settle the principal balances in cash and any conversion premiums in shares of Class C capital stock. After backing out our convertible debt, we had a net cash and investments balance of $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter, which gives us continued financial flexibility going forward. Turning to our outlook for Q3, we expect residential revenue to be between $375 million and $385 million. Our residential revenue outlook for Q3 is driven by the normal seasonality of Premier Agent as well as continued strong contributions from our ShowingTime Plus, New Construction, and Follow Up Boss product offerings. We expect rentals revenue to grow in the mid-20% range year-over-year in Q3. We expect multifamily revenue to grow faster than rentals revenue overall as we benefit from our sales execution, our National Brand Awareness campaign, and our partnership with Realtor.com. For mortgages, we expect a similar year-over-year revenue growth rate to what we reported in Q2, 2024. We remain on track to further integrate Premier Agent and Zillow Home Loans with our planned enhanced market expansion in Q3. We expect total revenue to be between $545 million and $560 million in Q3, implying a year-over-year increase of 11% at the midpoint of our outlook range. This compares to our estimates for the residential real-estate industry total transaction value to be in the mid-single-digit year-over-year growth range for Q3. We expect EBITDA to be between $95 million and $110 million in Q3, equating to a 19% margin at the midpoint of our outlook range. This implies EBITDA expenses will increase from $438 million in Q2 to an estimated $450 million in Q3. The sequential increase in EBITDA expenses is driven by an uptick in our brand marketing spend related to our Rental Brand campaign. We expect EBITDA costs to decline sequentially from Q3 to Q4 as marketing spend decreases in line with typical seasonal media spend. Moving to the full year, I want to reiterate that we expect to drive double-digit revenue growth for 2024 with modest EBITDA margin expansion, primarily driven by our growth pillars. Our annual fixed-cost run-rate is approximately $1 billion, consistent with where we stood at the end of 2023. We continue to believe our fixed investments are at the right level, which should result in our fixed costs growing modestly with inflation. Consistent with previous quarters, our variable costs are expected to grow ahead of revenue initially as we ramp new hires to be fully productive. Advertising spend is a lever we view as separate and distinct from the rest of the cost base and one we will pull depending on the growth opportunities we see in front of us. We are demonstrating the benefit of pulling this advertising lever in our rentals marketplace, given the growth we are seeing in traffic and revenue, and we are pleased with the early results. To close, it is clear we are executing on our strategy. We are growing across every part of our business. We are seeing great results from our growth pillars in our Enhanced Markets that we'll continue to roll out this year and we are on track to grow revenue by double-digits and expand margins in 2024. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. Yes, Brad, it's Jeremy Hofmann. I'll take that one. I think we can't really speak to broad commission trends just because 80% of our Premier Agent base is in that top 20% of all producers. So, we're working with the top agents versus a broad swath of professionals. That said, across our business, we've seen commission rates stay in a pretty tight band over the past three years. 2024 is down a few basis points versus 2023, but in line with 2022 levels. And I think just stepping back, we've been pretty consistent here for a while. We believe we and our partners are the outsized beneficiaries of these changes coming in the industry. We have the most customers, we work with the best partners, we provide the most technology, and we expect our PAs will deliver and get paid because they provide great service and they, and we, we think will be sharetakers in any future evolution or dispersion of the industry. So, that's how we're seeing it. That's been very consistent for a while now, and nothing has really changed our minds on that based on the latest things that we can see. Yes, and Mark, I'll just pile on a bit. It's Jeremy Hofmann. Jeremy Wacksman said it, we were at 50% in the first four markets, we grew revenue in 2023, 50% versus total transaction value. And we're now at 80% through 18 months of that. So, you're seeing a consistent steady growth. And then on top of that, we saw really good results in our oldest markets, which we put in the investor deck we did in February, where in Phoenix and Atlanta over call it two-year period, we saw 80% and 90% transaction growth during that period of time, which is effectively -- is close to double. So, those are the types of proof points that make us feel quite good. And why you see us accelerating the way that we have going from 19 to 36 pretty quickly is just because we keep seeing really solid results that we think sets us up quite well for continued future growth. Yes, sure. Ryan, I'll take it. It's Jeremy Hofmann. I think the mortgages market was challenged in Q2. We called that out in the May call and it persisted. So, we think that it was down mid-single digits year-over-year versus 3% up for the housing market. So, there was a headwind there. We just happened to perform quite well throughout it. And that's a great story for us. It's one that we feel quite good about. And that's a function really of us outperforming across the business. I think we really performed well. On the residential side, we had a soft pocket in late March and early April when rates spiked, but then they normalized. And as a result, our MVP marketplace got healthier throughout the quarter, both on new sales and lower term. And then additionally, the conversion across Premier Agent, both MVP and Flex was stronger than we anticipated. And that flowed through right to revenue. And then on the rest of the residential side, Showcase is growing nicely. The New Construction marketplace is growing nicely, and Follow Up Boss is outperforming what we expected in early days of the acquisition. And then you have mortgages and rentals. Obviously, Jeremy's talked a bit about that already, but rentals was up 29%, multifamily was up 44%. And then CHL grew 125%. So, really when we look across all of the business in Q2, it felt quite good regardless of what's going on in the first-time home buyer market. And then I'd be sufficed to say like on the EBITDA front, we're pretty proud of the consistent ability to accurately forecast and hold ourselves accountable on costs. As we tell the team, when we're in a market like this, revenue is harder to forecast, which makes it even more important to be really good on the cost line. And for Q2, we expected $440 million of costs. We came in at 438 million. So, when we outperform on the revenue front, it all flowed through to the EBITDA line. Yes, Ryan, I can take it as Jeremy Hofmann and then Jeremy Wacksman may pile in as well. But I think that you're right that the bulk of the business going forward is going to be Zillow Home Loans. So, you see the mortgage category start to more accurately map to the Zillow Home Loans growth. That's not to say the marketplace isn't important too. It's just secondary. There are going to be -- inevitably there are going to be times in which we can't service a customer through Zillow Home Loans and we like having the marketplace as a way to serve customers regardless, right? We're always about customer choice and making sure that in financing, we're providing customer choice as well. So, we feel quite good about both of those businesses, but the vast majority of the focus going forward is going to be in Zillow Home Loans. Yes. Thanks, John. It's Jeremy Hofmann, so I'll take it. Similar to what we've said in the past, we don't really over-focus on the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, given how fluid macro has been and will continue to be. We're pleased that we've outperformed the industry by 2,000 basis points in residential over the last two years, and that's really a credit to the product experiences that we're driving, the conversion gains we're driving, and the partner experiences that we're driving. At the same time, we are seeing healthy growth versus that mortgage market, so that was called out earlier in the call. That's where we tend to index, our customer base tends to index, and those folks are struggling comparatively. So, they -- the first-time homebuyer, if you measure it by the mortgage market, is underperforming 800 to 1,000 basis points per -- in Q2, and we think those trends probably continue into Q3. So, I think we feel all-in quite good about where the business is, knowing that that's out there. And I think most important is just the consistent outperformance we've had across both residential and the total company. We expect to continue to do so as we roll out our Enhanced Markets and see success there. Jeremy's talked a lot about that, but that's a really important piece to the future story, and we're just getting started rolling markets out. And I will kind of step back and remind you all, Q1, we were up 13% year-over-year. As a Company, Q2, we were up 13% year-over-year. Our outlook calls for a revenue range of 10% to 13% for Q3. We're clearly well on our way to double-digit revenue growth in 2024 and margin expansion, and it's been a rough housing market. So, we sit there and feel like the business is really well-positioned despite all that. Yes, and then I can take the margin question. I think it's less about Enhanced Markets. On our march to get profitability, it's really around the cost structure we've laid out. So, we have roughly $1 billion in fixed costs today. We feel like we're pretty well invested there to at least get to our 2025 share targets. And so, we expect that to grow kind of modestly with inflation. Variable is 25% to 30% of revenue.

            "name": "Richard Barton",
            "content": "Thanks, Brad. Good afternoon, and good evening to everyone dialing in to hear our second quarter 2024 results. We delivered another strong quarter in an ongoing challenging real estate macroenvironment, exceeding our outlook for revenue and EBITDA as we continue to successfully execute on our growth strategy. Today, we also announced, Jeremy Wacksman has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer of Zillow Group, and I will serve as Co-exec Chair of the Board of Directors alongside my Co-founder, Lloyd Frank. I have been CEO and/or Chairman since the day Lloyd and I seed-funded the Company in 2004 and will remain engaged. My role however will shift to supporting and counseling Jeremy Wacksman and the leadership team rather than daily operational leadership. Before talking about Jeremy and the team, let me talk about the state of the Company. The short version is that Zillow business is in great shape financially, strategically, operationally, and organizationally. We are executing well and are consistently outperforming the broader residential real estate industry as we methodically ship great software and services to digitize and integrate home buying, selling, financing, and renting, empowering consumers and partners alike. We have done this inside the Zillow-branded housing super app, the integrated consumer and partner experience we are rolling out in markets across the country and we continue to increase the breadth of our market coverage and the depth of transaction penetration within those markets. I am pleased with where we are in this effort and the opportunity we see for many years of growth ahead. We have also increasingly leveraged our brand trust and massive audience to diversify our revenue streams. We've leaned hard into the obvious and adjacent rentals and purchase mortgage opportunities, both of which are now exciting growth businesses for Zillow. Rentals now account for one-fifth of total Company revenue and Zillow Home Loans purchase mortgage origination volume grew more than 100% year-over-year again this quarter. Rentals has plenty of room to run and the mortgages opportunity for us is wide open and large. Additionally, we have built and acquired, then integrated, a quietly exciting set of products and services that we offer to the broader industry, brokers, MLSs, and the whole of the professional agent community. We are investing in broad industry-wide adoption of our suite of increasingly integrated digital content and workflow tools, including incredible products like our ShowingTime home touring solution, Follow Up Boss Agent CRM, DotLoop forms and document management, and Showcase 3D interactive listings. Our conviction is that a rising digital tide lifts all boats. A more digital industry using our software is better for consumers, better for our partners, and ultimately better for Zillow Group. We have unique ambition here and unique talent and resources to conjure it into reality. And through all of this innovation and expansion, the leadership team has maintained real cost discipline that is delivering improvements in EBITDA margins. Executing well against big, complex, interconnected opportunities requires amazing talent who have a clear strategy, high accountability, and high trust in one another, which leads me to Jeremy Wacksman, our new CEO, and the person we organized most of the Company around three years ago when we promoted him to COO. He has been supported by an exceptional team and has successfully positioned the Company to go after these multiple large opportunities as I have laid out. Jeremy is a familiar voice to you all on this call, but allow me to share some of his history. He has an engineering degree, which is not required here at Zillow, but it's nice. He also got his MBA many years ago, which the engineers don't hold against him. We found Jeremy at Microsoft in 2009 when Zillow was very small and recruited him into a product and marketing role. Throughout his time at Zillow, Jeremy has worn many hats. His responsibilities have steadily gained scope, spanning product, marketing, and operations. He has been a key strategic partner throughout his tenure, advising Lloyd and me on major strategy and product decisions. Early on, he helped pioneer mobile real estate shopping with the launch of the Zillow app. Later as CMO, he was critical to leading Zillow's consumer marketing strategy, establishing a high bar and a branding framework for what has become a rare, loved, and trusted household brand. His tenure as COO the past three years with all product, engineering, design, marketing, sales, IT, and go-to-market business operations reporting to him, has been a time of particularly impressive innovation for Zillow, which has put the Company back on an accelerating growth path following pandemic dislocation from which the industry has yet to recover. Jeremy operationalized Zillow's housing super app strategy while maintaining strong cost discipline, diversifying our revenue base, and growing the rentals and mortgages businesses. He successfully championed the Follow Up Boss and ShowingTime acquisitions, helping us deliver on our goal to provide agent partners and the broader industry with the best software solutions to power their businesses. He also organized, elevated, and recruited talent that makes up Zillow's world-class R&D organizations and increasingly critical sales and marketing operations. Jeremy's product-forward, consumer-first leadership, operational experience, and technology orientation make him right and ready to be CEO of Zillow now. I am confident in his judgment and his leadership, and I am excited to support him as he leads Zillow's next chapter. And with that, I'll now hand the mic over to Zillow Group's new Chief Executive Officer, Jeremy Wacksman. We got you, Ron. We got you. Thanks, Ron. So, maybe I'll take the first bit, Jeremy Wacksman, and you can comment on the second. That sound good? Yes, okay. Yes, I mean, it's incredibly impressive to me, Ron, how well we are executing as a Company, despite all of the kind of stormy weather that is -- that constitutes the real estate macro. I mean, we're just posting terrific numbers. We have, for three years now, since Jeremy Wacksman was promoted to COO, running most of the Company and all the lines of business, we have talked about our housing super app strategy and our rental strategy and our mortgages strategy. And I would say, you all, as investors, have been like, okay, show me that that is actually going to work as a way to digitize and integrate this transaction and create a really big long-term growth opportunity. And I would say now that strategically, we have kind of de-risked the concept of what we're building here. We have a long way to go to execute and fulfill what I see as our ultimate right of market share and claiming that and growth, but strategically, we are in really good shape. And that is in no small part due to Jeremy Wacksman's leadership over the last few years, getting this all together. And so, that is why the time is right. Jeremy is ready, the company is ready, and Ron, personally, I am ready as well. I'm not going anywhere, I'm not doing anything else, but I'm really excited to be moving to a role of coach and advisor rather than the daily field general. Thank you. But maybe I'll have our new Chief Executive Officer, Jeremy Wacksman, answer the second part of your question. Hey, thank you all. As you guys can see, the Company is really doing well. The Company is on firm footing. And as you can also see demonstrated in this call and on many calls before, Jeremy Wacksman is ready to lead and the broader leadership team is ready as well. And so, I'm super excited. There is a ton of clean water in front of the Company, lots of opportunity. Maybe the wind will change direction and come behind us one of these days, but we certainly don't need it. But I'm sure it'll happen at some point. I want to thank you all for being on the journey with us. We'll talk to you soon."

            "name": "Jeremy Wacksman",
            "content": "Thanks, Rich. Having spent the past 15 years at Zillow, I can honestly say, taking on this role is the honor of my career. I love this Company and I love this team, and I believe deeply in the digital future of real estate we're building for the benefit of buyers, sellers, renters, agents, the broader industry, and our shareholders. Zillow has a huge audience, a partner network comprising some of the best agent teams in the business, and tech and product prowess that is unmatched in residential real estate. With an increasingly diversified and growing business, we are primed to capitalize on the strength of the Zillow brand and capture a meaningful slice of the $30 billion accessible TAM in real estate, a slice that more closely reflects our reach in the category. And our results show we're making great headway. I'm excited to share that Zillow had another strong quarter, reporting better-than-expected revenue growth across the business. Q2 revenue was $572 million, up 13% year-over-year, which marks the eighth consecutive quarter our total revenue results have outperformed the residential real estate industry. We delivered double-digit year-over-year revenue growth and demonstrated cost discipline while continuing to invest to deliver solid EBITDA margin expansion year-over-year. Q2 residential revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $409 million. Rentals continued its strong growth with $117 million revenue in Q2, up 29% year-over-year. Multifamily revenue is up 44% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our multifamily property count, with 44,000 properties at the end of Q2, up from 40,000 at the end of Q1. We also continued to make strong progress in mortgages, with Q2 revenue of $34 million, up 42% year-over-year, and purchase mortgage origination volume growing 125% year-over-year. These successes come despite a persistently challenging mortgage rate environment, as evidenced by our estimate of total industry purchase loan origination volume being down mid-single digits year-over-year in Q2. We continue to believe our most important investments are in tech innovations that improve the customer experience, which has helped us earn and maintain our strong brand position and massive engaged audience of movers. In Q2, we reported 231 million average monthly unique users across the Zillow ecosystem of apps and sites. As you'll remember from previous calls and our February investor presentation, about 80% of our users come to us organically, and they're using our app three times more than anyone else in the category. Another way to measure traffic and brand strength is through Comscore, which is widely viewed among internet brands as a reliable, transparent third-party source because it aims to capture the number of unique visitors while deduping cookies. According to Comscore, Zillow Group's apps and sites had 116 million average monthly unique visitors in Q2. We're pleased with the progress we're making to transform and digitize the moving experience on behalf of buyers, sellers, renters, agents, and the broader industry. Since 2022, we've been building the digitally integrated transaction experience and testing it in our Enhanced Markets across the country. Through this year, we've been increasing our breadth of coverage across more markets, and our depth of penetration in those markets as we drive towards sustainable profitable growth. As of the end of Q2, we're in 19 Enhanced Markets, expanding to 36 by the end of August, well on our way to achieving our goal of 40 by the end of 2024. As we've said, Zillow is the housing super app, and we are continually adding updates and improvements to it, guided by our five for-sale growth pillars: touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network, and integrating our services. Our for-sale growth pillars mark the pathway to meeting our goals to increase customer transaction share to 6% by the end of 2025. We are also focused on building up Rentals, which currently represents 20% of our revenue and is growing rapidly. First up is touring. Integrating our touring solutions into our buyer flow is meaningfully improving our ability to identify high-intent customers and connect them with our Premier Agent partners. We've seen that those touring connections convert at three times the rate of other actions on Zillow. Last month, we nearly doubled the number of markets with Real Time Touring, and we're seeing positive early results from being better able to connect higher-intent customers with our Premier Agent partners. In fact, we have already achieved our end-of-year target of approximately 20% of our connections coming from Real Time Touring, as well as improved transaction conversion. As one of the many product improvements we're making to this part of the customer journey, as a leader in touring software, last quarter we introduced a Touring Agreement that instills more transparency into the process. The early indicators of success we saw in our pilot gave us the confidence to integrate it into Zillow's touring experience, and just last week, the agreement became part of the \"request a tour\" flow on Zillow for nearly 80% of our tour connections. We plan to roll it out to remaining tour connections in the coming months. Facilitating consumer-friendly agreements earlier in the funnel is not only an opportunity for us to help educate consumers and agents navigate the industry rule changes, but it also helps us identify higher-intent customers, send more qualified connections to our Premier Agent partners, and drive conversion rates. I'll now move on to financing. We have been working to integrate Zillow Home Loans more seamlessly with our Premier Agent partner network and throughout the customer journey. Overall, customer adoption rates in our nine most mature Enhanced Markets have reached the mid-teens, and nearly 60% of our Zillow Home Loan originations are represented by a Premier Agent partner. To further capture buyers' attention, we've also launched innovative tools through Zillow Home Loans to help them more accurately understand what they can afford. In Q2, we introduced a feature called BuyAbility, which gives buyers a personalized, real-time estimate of the home price and monthly payment that fit within their budget, powered by mortgage rates through Zillow Home Loans and available to check regularly in the Zillow app. Our efforts have accelerated purchase mortgage growth, with $756 million in purchase loan origination volume in Q2, a 125% year-over-year increase. We expect continued purchase mortgage growth for Zillow Home Loans as we launch more Enhanced Markets and continue to improve our go-to-market integration with our Premier Agent partners. For our seller solutions update, I'll focus on Zillow Showcase, a unique offering unlike anything else available today that not only makes selling a home easier, but also creates real value for sellers and their agents. Zillow Showcase elevates agents' brand presence on Zillow and provides an enhanced shopping experience through our AI-powered homegrown rich media and floor plan technology. Showcase listings drive higher engagement compared to similar non-Showcase listings on Zillow, more views, more saves, and more shares. But even more importantly, homes that list with Showcase are selling faster and for more money. Showcase listings typically sell for 2% more than similar non-Showcase listings on Zillow, a bonus of more than $9,000 on a home sold at the average home sale price. Homes listed with Showcase are also more likely to secure an accepted offer within 14 days. And what's more, we've observed that agents who use Zillow Showcase are winning 20% more listings than similar agents on Zillow. These results have made it an attractive offering for real estate professionals. Zillow Showcase is available to agents in every market after launching nationwide earlier this year. Even though it's early days, we are pleased to share that more than 1% of all new listings nationwide are now using Showcase. We are on our way to our goal of 5% to 10% listing coverage, which represents a $150 million to $300 million annual revenue opportunity. And we believe there is potential for future growth beyond that. This takes me to our next update, enhancing our partner network. Our Premier Agent partners represent some of the best, most professional agents in real estate who we believe are poised to take share in the evolution the industry is experiencing. Recall that not every real estate agent is a Zillow Premier Agent partner. In fact, since 2015, we've shrunk our active partner base by roughly 60%, while our Premier Agent revenue has grown by more than 2.5 times over the same timeframe. We've oriented Premier Agent around some of the best agent teams, those that we believe provide superior customer service, understand the industry and their local market, have a proven ability to scale and make the most money to invest alongside us. The top 20% of agent teams handle 80% of transactions and nearly four in five of those Premier Agent partners are in that top tier. We are supporting our partners by providing them with some of the best digital tools and solutions. For example, we're really pleased with the early results eight months after our acquisition of Follow Up Boss, one of real estate's leading customer relationship management systems. More than 70% of our connections in Enhanced Markets are being managed through Follow Up Boss. And those substantial adoption rates set the stage for us to build and improve features and services that help those partners gain share. And finally, integrating our services, where the for-sale growth pillars come together in the Zillow Housing super app experience. Providing high-intent customers with valuable solutions, working with some of the best agents, and providing those agents with some of the best tools, has paid off for us. In our first four Enhanced Markets, we've seen revenue growth per total transaction value increase by more than 80% since the beginning of 2023, compared with the more than 50% growth we reported back on the February call. And as we expand, we are consistently seeing signs of repeatable success. In the 13 Enhanced Markets we were in at the end of Q1, we are seeing gains in revenue per total transaction value. We see an opportunity to increase conversion and revenue per total transaction value even more from here as we launch the remaining Enhanced Markets this year. Now, turning our focus to rentals. Last quarter, we released an investor presentation and talked through the massive opportunity in front of us. Today, there is no nationwide marketplace containing all rental listings, resulting in a fragmented experience for renters. We are building a two-sided marketplace with a comprehensive suite of listings, both multifamily and longtail that enables renters to more easily shop, tour, apply, sign a lease, and pay rent securely, all on one convenient platform, Zillow. Having more rental listings and multifamily properties, and ramping up our marketing, have both helped drive customer awareness of rentals on Zillow. In June, our total Rentals Unique Visitors were up more than 20% year over year according to Comscore, widening our margin as the leading online rentals brand, with the largest audience and No. 1 preference among renters. We expect multifamily to be the primary driver of our Rentals revenue growth, and we made great progress in Q2. Zillow now has 44,000 multifamily properties, 38% more than a year ago. And our exclusive partnership with Realtor.com is further boosting exposure for our multifamily listings, helping our partners reach even more renters. We have a lot of work ahead, but with multifamily revenue up 44% year-over-year, we are on our way, with a billion-dollar-plus revenue opportunity in front of us. Before handing it over to Jeremy Hofmann, I want to congratulate the exceptional Zillow team on our eighth consecutive quarter of total revenue outperformance. It's their dedication and expertise that continue to drive our business forward as we work to deliver exceptional products and services for consumers, agents, and the broader industry. Our successes to date give me a great deal of confidence in our future. We are on track to meet our expectations for 2024 to deliver double-digit revenue growth and modestly expand our EBITDA margins. And we believe we are on our way to strong GAAP profitability over time that benefits all of us as shareholders. Thank you for being on this journey with us. I will now pass the line over to Jeremy Hofmann. Yes. Absolutely. Thanks, Ron. On Enhanced Markets, just a reminder, since you asked, the metrics there, it's market share, and we measure that in terms of revenue per total transaction value, and then it's also revenue per transaction, right? So, NUM transactions and revenue per transaction gets you to that, and 17 -- 36 markets by the end of August, on our way to 40 by the end of the year, that in each of those markets, we're not serving 100% of customers. So, I think we gave a stat earlier this year, that's going to be about 20% of all customers will get that experience, and that experience allows them to get real-time touring and a touring experience, Zillow Home Loans as a financing option if they choose it, and then most importantly, the Enhanced Partner Network, the hand-picked set of partners that Jeremy Hofmann talked about in his prepared remarks, that really deliver a great job, provide great customer service, run professionalized businesses for the modern internet consumer. So, that's what the Enhanced Market experience is. As we bring that to more and more customers, we are seeing in the markets we're in revenue per total transaction value gains, and we expect those gains to contribute to more of our residential and total Company revenue as we get to that 20% of customers and then into next year, more of those customers. And so, the land and expand strategy is working well. We're really excited to accelerate to 36 markets by the end of August and be at 40 markets by the end of the year. Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Nick. Thanks for the questions. On rentals, yes, as I said, a little bit in my prepared remarks, and we shared for those that were on in February, a more detailed investor presentation on our rental strategy. We're so excited about our rental strategy because it's really unique and it really solves the consumer problem, right? What renters want is to find all the inventory. There is no one place for all the inventory. There is no MLS for rentals. So, they end up having to shop everywhere during a really compressed timeframe. It's super stressful. And so, we set out years ago to try and assemble as much of the inventory as possible, both multifamily, the big buildings we all know, and long tail. The millions of homes and small unit properties that are out there for rent that turn over infrequently by a long tail of owners. And we've done that. We now have the most listings. We still don't have them all. Every year we try and go after more and we're growing our listing count. But we have the most inventory of anyone out there. And that has yielded us the most audience, the biggest audience of renters, right? So, Zillow's rental network is the largest audience. It just grew 20% year-over-year this last month. And it continues to grow because renters want that product. And so, that two-sided marketplace now gives way to the monetization growth you're seeing coming from multifamily. And so, that's the stats I gave in my prepared remarks. 44,000 buildings on Zillow now, up from 40,000 last quarter. That's driving the 29% revenue growth you're seeing, which 44% revenue growth in multifamily, that's coming from that property count and that engagement with the advertisers. So, that's what gets us so excited. It's this really great win-win marketplace where the consumer's getting a better and better experience as the supply comes online. And that then in turn drives the demand and makes the product better for the renters and vice versa. So, that's why you've heard Jeremy Hofmann talk about using advertising as a lever to help stimulate demand, to help continue to make that marketplace spin. And that's what gives us the excitement, not just in Q2's growth and in the guide for rentals, but in the $1 billion-plus business opportunity we see in front of us. And then on traffic, yes, I mean, we have talked long about how the most important part of audience is the engagement with that audience. And I talked in my prepared remarks, you can measure cookies and devices in people many ways, but what matters is, do people know who you are? Do they use you to shop? Do they find a light in your services? And Zillow has long believed that the best way to drive audience is great products, great innovative products amplified by marketing. And you see that in the mix of our traffic, right? 80% of our audience comes to us brand-direct. They come to us because they know who we are and they choose to use us. And app usage is a good measure of that, right? And so that's why I talked about the app being used three times more than the others in the category. It's just a great measure of really healthy, deep engagement. If you're buying a home, if you're actually trying to shop, you're going to use an app and you're going to use a desktop website that ties to that app. And you're going to use us as a shopping experience and you're going to use an agent that you find from us and that's going to lead you down the funnel to these transactions. So, that's why for us, brand engagement and health of traffic is so important. It is the start of this transaction strategy we're on. And as we talk a lot about, our goal is to take all that great app usage engagement with audience and turn that into more transactions, right? Our goal of 6% transaction share comes from taking this 60%, 70% audience share we have and getting more of them to use us and use our housing super app to actually buy, rent, finance, or sell their home. Yes, we got you, Brad. Yes. Thanks, Mark. I'll -- on the market share gains, I think I said my prepared remarks -- I said my prepared remarks, the way we're measuring that is revenue per total transaction value growth. And in the first, in the oldest Enhanced Markets where we have the most data and we have good year-over-years, which we've given you an update on earlier this year, we said we were up 50% year-over-year. That growth has accelerated to 80% year-over-year in those first four. And then in the 13 that we've been in since Q1, we don't have year-over-years yet, but the early trend line is gains in revenue per total transaction value across those 13. So, that curve looks similar to us. As we get into next year, we'll have year-over-years on more markets. So, that's what gives us confidence that as we take this recipe, this housing super app integrated experience to more partners in each market and to more markets, we'll see that same trend line of share in revenue per total transaction value grow the way we're seeing it in our four original markets. Thanks, Mark. Yes. Thanks, John. Thanks for the congrats. And on touring, you're right. We continue to see touring actions convert higher than any other action on Zillow. And our expectation is, the touring agreement will be a net benefit to conversion because it's in the flow post-introduction. And so, it's just education and it's helpful qualification. And the pilot was small. We saw basically no negative to like likely positive impact there as we started to engage consumers. And so that's what gave us the confidence to roll it out, to take it to now almost 80% of connections. And we expect to get to all eventually. So, I think you nailed the idea of education to the consumer done in a consumer-friendly way helps get that consumer more informed before they get to the tour and makes it more likely that they'll want to work with the agent. As you know, having worked with us and followed us for a long time, the lag on seeing that data in transactions is long, right? So, a pilot market, a tour experience, measuring transaction rates with those agents is going to be a period of quarters and quarters and quarters. But the early indicator data gave us confidence that this is a good thing. And that's why we proceeded so rapidly to roll it out. Yes, I mean, our focus has been on purchase, not just because of where the refi market was. And I think it will remain on purchase. And that's just because of what we've talked about as our opportunity, right? You've heard us talk a lot about -- I mean, everything we've said about the integrated transaction and the benefits for the consumer, it is for the home buyer. And our ability to go have more and more customers who either start by asking that purchase financing question or ask that go shop question, end up getting exposure to our great agents and our great financing options. That's demand that we won't tap out of for a long time. And that's what we're methodically scaling, both in our Enhanced Market strategy as we roll out more Enhanced Markets, but also digitally to our consumers that come to the website and actually want to start with a, what can I afford? This is a tough market question. So, we are, I think, in a privileged position to be able to go build durable growth in the mortgage business, really focused on purchase. And we're excited about how we did in Q2. And we're excited about our plans for Q3. Thanks, John. Yes, we got you, John. Yes, I'll start, Tom. And maybe, Jeremy, you can hit margin profile. I mean, Tom, it's going to sound a little boring, but my focus and strategy is more of what we've been doing. And I think accelerating and continuing to roll out our Enhanced Market strategy, continuing to grow our rentals business into the opportunity we've laid out for you all, continuing to build mortgage into the big business we know it can be, and then powering all that with the amazing software and technology we are building to help rewire the real estate industry for agents, teams, and brokers writ large. Like that has been our strategy we've talked to you all about for the last however many calls. You're seeing the early signs and results of that play out in the output numbers. And we're really excited to have more of this come to light so you see more of it in the output numbers in the years to come as we grow into the share target we have for you all and then grow our business beyond that. So, oftentimes when there's a leadership change, there's like a what's going to change question. And the answer is, not much is going to change. We're going to focus on continuing to execute, deliver, scale, and accelerate this into the future."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Zillow Group First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Berning, Vice President, Strategic Affairs & Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nBradley Berning: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Zillow Group's first quarter 2024 conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Zillow Group's Co-Founder and CEO, Rich Barton; COO, Jeremy Wacksman; and CFO, Jeremy Hofmann. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements about our future performance and operating plans based on current expectations and assumptions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and we encourage you to consider the risk factors described in our SEC filings for additional information. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events, except as required by law. This call is being broadcast on the Internet and is accessible on our Investor Relations website. A recording of the call will be available later today. During the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, which we refer to as EBITDA. We encourage you to read our Shareholder Letter and earnings release, which can be found on our Investor Relations website as they contain important information about our GAAP and non-GAAP results, including reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures. We will now open the call with remarks followed by live Q&A. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich.\nRichard Barton: Thanks, Brad. Good afternoon, and good evening for those on the East Coast. Thanks for dialing-in to hear our first quarter 2024 results. We saw strong revenue numbers that flowed through to the bottom line, helping us outperform our outlook on revenue and EBITDA as we successfully execute on our growth strategy. We continue to upgrade and scale our housing super app, and we've seen further proof-points in our enhanced markets that support a continued push on both breadth of market coverage and depth of penetration within those markets for our integrated, digital moving solutions for consumers, their agents and their loan officers. Today, I'll remind us about what makes Zillow different and what makes me so confident in our growth plan. Jeremy Wacksman will then give a progress report on our growth pillars with a deep dive into our burgeoning Rentals business. Next, Jeremy Hofmann will discuss the numbers in more detail. And then, we'll open things up for Q&A. Beginning with our quarterly results, we reported better than expected revenue growth across the business. Q1 revenue of $529 million grew 13% year-over-year. Total revenue growth once again outperformed the residential real estate market. Rentals continued its strong growth with $97 million in revenue in Q1, up 31% year-over-year. We continue to grow our multifamily property count with 40,000 properties at the end of the quarter, up from 37,000 at the end of December. We are well-positioned for future Rentals' revenue growth as we detail in our new Investor Relations deck that is a deep-dive on our Rentals business. We published this new deck along with earnings today, and we'll discuss it in more detail later in this call. In an ongoing tough rate environment, we also continued to make strong progress in mortgages with Q1 revenue of $31 million, up 19% year-over-year and purchase mortgage origination volume growing more than 130% year-over-year. So in a hostile housing market and a noisy industry environment, why is Zillow outperforming? The simple answer is that Zillow is wholly-focused on solving real consumer problems with software in a giant industry that has historically had very little R&D investment. Digitally re-platforming and integrating a huge, disparate local industry where transactions are relatively infrequent is an audacious undertaking. No other company is really even attempting it. We are advantaged primarily because we are a product and technology company first, and are able to attract and retain the especially talented people, who know how to build market and support great software products. This enables us to focus completely on delighting our consumers and their valued partners in pursuit of the dream of using technology to make moving simple and joyful. Our product prowess over the years has put Zillow in the enviable position of having a large engaged audience, who come to us organically, an audience who love, trust and rely on our brand. This product-led organic marketing growth story is rare, but it is common for the great ones. Those are the products and brands we admire the most. Attracting a large organic audience has also given Zillow the space to experiment with business models. Those who followed us for a long time know how aggressive and innovative we have been methodically converting our sticky audience into revenue. We have built a substantial growing diverse and EBITDA profitable business, yet we still monetize only a small share of our audience. Our massive unconverted audience will drive years of growth ahead for Zillow as we grow into our rightful transaction share, continue to adjust our business models, and add and integrate new business lines. We have been pro-consumer, practical and nimble and we will continue to be so. The first era of Zillow involved amassing a large organic engaged consumer audience for whom we were providing valuable information via great sites and apps. Several years ago, we realized that our dream of digitizing the move and accessing the really big TAM in the category would involve getting much more directly involved in the transaction itself, applying software to every step of the workflow, refreshing our partner network to those who were higher performing and interested in automation and scale, and building out or acquiring key components of the move process ourselves all the way from listings photography and creation through tour booking, agent workflow, pre-approval, mortgage origination, document routing and closing end-to-end. To serve as an aspirational and consumer focused North Star, we created a product strategy that we call the Zillow Housing Super App, the experience that would integrate the whole of the complex, scary, expensive moving process. The Zillow Super App is working well. Jeremy Wacksman will soon walk you through a detailed report of our growth pillars, but we see very good progress across the Board on each pillar, touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network, integration and rentals. Amidst all of the fear speculation and noise, a steady focus on execution is what's working for us, delivering for our customers and partners. In terms of the noise, though, let me give some color commentary on what has transpired since our last quarterly call. The long running class action suit against NAR and select brokerages thankfully arrived at a proposed settlement in mid-March. And the judge just last week granted preliminary approval of that settlement. The substance of the settlement is what we characterized as a very reasonable middle path forward for the industry, where commissions are negotiated and communicated between sellers and buyers and both parties are better educated. This is a positive evolutionary step for the industry. It is not a revolution as some, who believe they might profit from chaos and disruption are proclaiming. Clear and negotiable compensation fits quite well with our published consumer advocacy marketplace principles of free access to listings, independent representation and negotiable compensation as outlined at advocacy.zillowgroup.com. There will continue to be sensational seeming news surrounding this settlement, no doubt. Given there remains several steps in having NAR and the industry put the settlement requirements into practice. And real-estate is generally a hot topic for hot takes given it is a $2 trillion to $3 trillion industry employing millions of people in all 50 states and is most Americans' most valuable and most cherished asset. However, Zillow is well-positioned to assist with and benefit from this evolution. So why do we expect to benefit from this evolution? For three reasons. First, we have the most and highest intent customers in residential real estate. Zillow is the most trusted brand with the largest, most engaged audience. This is a hard earned position that we built over the past 18 years. And our top of funnel advantage today has never been stronger. Zillow has searched more on Google than the category term real estate and 3 times more than the next brand in the category. 80% of our traffic is organic and our app usage is more than 3 times anyone else in the category. We have more than 217 million average monthly unique users across the Zillow ecosystem of apps and sites, and 109 million total unique visitors according to ComScore, a third-party data tracker that allows for comparison across sites. We've built and maintained such a strong brand position because of our relentless focus on delivering exceptional tech innovations and customer experiences, which we believe are our most important investments. Regardless of how the industry evolves, our brand and audience will thrive. The second reason we expect to benefit from the industry evolution, we work with the most productive agents in real estate. Of the approximately 1.5 million real-estate license holders, many handle only one or two transactions a year. These are not our premier agent partners. 80% of all real estate transactions across the U.S. are done by the top 20% of agents or teams. And today, nearly four in five Zillow Premier Agent partners fall into that Top Tier. Since 2015, we have shrunk our active partner base by roughly 60%, while at the same time, our premier agent revenue has grown by more than 2.5 times. Orienting our business around the best agent teams, those who provide superior customer experiences, have proven ability to scale and make the most money to invest alongside us positions us well for potential shifts within the profession. If and as more hobbyist agents drop out of the industry, the outsized beneficiaries of this shift to professionalism will be our premier agent partners. The third reason we benefit. Zillow provides exceptional technology to make agents more efficient at their jobs and do more transactions. Zillow is the leading product innovator with features like Real Time Touring, Listing Showcase, and a Digital Pre-Approval pilot launching within the next couple of weeks that will further delight customers and create high intent real buyer connections for our premier agent partners. Additionally, we have invested heavily in broad adoption foundational industry software solutions like our Follow Up Boss CRM, ShowingTime Touring software, our Showcase 3D home technology, Aryeo real estate photographers SaaS, and DotLoop document signing and routing. Over the past 10 years, between our own tech and dev budget and the acquisition capital we've deployed for industry software, we've spent $4.3 billion cumulatively investing in technology for the real estate industry. Agents who work with our high intent customers and use our industry software tools are the best positioned to accelerate their share in every version of an industry evolution from here. So the short answer for why Zillow benefits from the evolutionary changes we see coming from the NAR settlement, we have the most and highest intent customers in real estate. We work with the most productive agents and we provide them exceptional technology to make their lives more efficient. Before handing it to Jeremy Wacksman, let me repeat for the whole of the great Zillow team in front of our investors, I'm impressed with the results you are achieving in your focused and relentless innovation for customers and partners in pursuit of a seamless, digital and joyful moving experience for all. We are all in a really tough housing market and a distracting industry environment, yet our hands are steady on the wheel as we drive Zillow's business and the industry forward. Okay. Jeremy?\nJeremy Wacksman: Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been an exciting few years at Zillow, and we're pleased with the progress we're making on our strategy to transform the way people buy, sell, rent and finance homes. Since 2022, we've been building the integrated transaction experience and testing it in our enhanced markets. Now we are pressing on the accelerator to increase our breadth of coverage across more markets and our depth of penetration in those markets, as we drive towards sustainable, profitable growth. Zillow's Housing Super app is the container into which we're continually adding updates and improvements guided by five for-sale growth pillars; touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network, and integrating our services. Our for-sale growth pillars mark the pathway to meeting our goals to grow customer transaction share from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025 and grow our revenue alongside that transaction share growth. I'll kick off our growth pillar update with touring and how we are integrating the anticipated rule changes coming from the NAR settlement into our customer experience. Touring is a critical focus area for us for two reasons. First, historically, the process of booking a home tour has been burdensome. Second, when a customer raises their hand to tour a home they've been looking at on Zillow, it's a strong signal of a serious intent to transact. Our touring products, powered by ShowingTime are meaningfully improving our ability to connect high-intent customers to our premier agent partners. As you may recall, touring connections convert at 3x the rate of other actions on Zillow. We're pleased to share that real-time touring is rolling out to an additional 34 markets by the end of May, which will bring us to a total of 124 markets. As we outlined in February, as we expand real-time touring, we expect it will account for approximately 20% of connections by the end of the year, and we are on track to deliver. One key provision of the proposed NAR settlement calls for more prominence of buyer agent agreements introduced at the time of the physical tour. Such agreements can help educate buyers about what services they're paying for, which is a good thing, and they have the added benefit of helping identify high intent buyers. In fact, we've been advocating for these agreements in our home state of Washington and across the country. By facilitating the use of consumer-friendly agreements earlier in the funnel, we see an opportunity to improve conversion rates. As an example, in Connecticut, where buyer agency agreements are required before taking a buyer on a tour, we've observed 20% higher conversion rates compared to our national average. We are testing buyer agreement product flows now within Zillow. And just this week, we launched a pilot of a consumer-friendly buyer agreement and our touring experience with a few 100 premier agent partners. Offering solutions digitally on Zillow is a natural and logical addition to the end-to-end experience we're providing customers and agents. Meanwhile, we are also enabling nearly limitless virtual touring that will continually get closer and closer to reality with our proprietary technology powering 3D home tours and showcase listings. Leveling up physical touring alongside our investment in virtual touring is a great combination for the industry benefiting all participants. I'll now move on to financing, another critical focus area for us because serving more high-intent customers with financing drives conversion and increases our addressable market. By integrating Zillow Home Loans with our Premier Agent partner network, we are providing a more seamless experience for customers, agents and loan officers. Our efforts to integrate financing throughout the customer journey have accelerated purchase mortgage growth with $601 million in purchase loan origination volume in Q1, a more than 130% year-over-year increase despite a persistently challenging mortgage rate environment. We expect continued purchase mortgage growth as we expand integration with Premier Agent partners and roll out more enhanced markets. Across the combined 13 enhanced markets we had at the end of Q1, Zillow Home Loans continues to see double-digit adoption rates, which contributes to growing revenue per transaction year-over-year. These signals reinforce our confidence that our strategy is working. And I'm pleased to share that this month we are expanding to a total of 19 enhanced markets and we are on track to reach our target of 40 by the end of the year. On the sell-side of the transaction, we continue to ramp up solutions that not only make selling a home easier but also create real value for sellers and their agents. I'll spend a minute on Listing Showcase specifically. Listing Showcase is our AI powered product that elevates agents' brand presence on Zillow and provides a better shopper experience through our homegrown rich media and floor plan technology. It's unlike anything else available today. We continue to be excited about Listing Showcase and the progress we are making across the country. Showcase listings drive higher engagement on Zillow compared to similar non-showcase listings, more views, more shares and more saves. But even more importantly, homes that list with Showcase are selling faster and for more money. Showcase listings typically sell for 2% more than similar non-showcase listings on Zillow, a bonus of $9,000 on the average home. Homes listed with Showcase are also 20% more likely to secure an accepted offer within 14 days. What's more, we've observed that agents who use Listing Showcase are winning 20% more listings, making it an attractive offering for real estate professionals. Listing showcase is currently available to agents in every market and we are actively working to reach 5% to 10% listing coverage, which represents a $150 million to $300 million annual revenue opportunity, and we believe there is potential for future growth beyond that. We are working to increase engagement with the best agents on both sides of the transaction, which leads me to our next growth pillar update, enhancing our partner network. As Rich highlighted earlier, Premier Agent partners represent the best of the industry, and we help them provide even better service to our shared customers to grow both their business and ours. We're excited that we continue to see transaction share gains across our 13 enhanced markets on a revenue per total transaction dollar basis. And now a couple of quarters after we closed our acquisition of Follow Up Boss, we're even more excited about the opportunity for further conversion gains from here. In addition to our five for-sale growth pillars, I want to turn the spotlight on to Rentals. Rentals is a fast growing business that represents nearly one-fifth of our total revenue with a lot of opportunity in front of it. To bring our great progress in Rentals out of the shadow of our first sale efforts, we've released a standalone investor presentation that provides a better understanding of what we've built, where we are headed and why we are so well-positioned to build a comprehensive two-sided marketplace that is unlike anything else in the industry today. Like, we do with all parts of Zillow, we start our Rentals' journey from the perspective of the consumer. In this case, the $17 million annual renters in the U.S., which is 3 times more movers than on the for-sale side. When renters search for a rental, they want the process to be enjoyable, trustworthy and easy, but instead, it's fragmented and frustrating. That's because no single platform provides a comprehensive marketplace with anywhere near complete coverage of available rental inventory. There is no MLS for rentals. This forces renters to shop across different platforms, each with varying levels of accuracy, transparency and selection, and encounter dead ends when searching for inventory. That fragmentation is the big problem and the big opportunity. Renters and property managers want and need one centralized place where they can see all the rental listings available. This is an incredibly simple and obvious concept, but an incredibly hard challenge. It's a challenge Zillow is best positioned to solve because of our success over many years of building great products for our massive audience of movers on the for-sale side. The early years of Zillow Rentals made clear that our customers wanted to come to us to shop for rentals. So in 2018, we turned our focus and ramped up our investment to build it out and create the richest most complete Rentals marketplace. We started with Longtail Rentals, which we define as less than 25 units, but primarily comprises single-family homes because data and interest in single-family was a core strength of Zillow. Because these properties were hard to find, this offered an opportunity for us to build a unique inventory asset. It may also come as a surprise to you, but Longtail Rentals are actually the majority of inventory in the Rentals market. Longtail Rentals are a classic go-to-market problem, small, fragmented and local. You simply cannot efficiently deploy a sales force to go out and find all the supply. Because Zillow was already the most trusted name in residential real estate, many of these Longtail property managers were already familiar with us, and asking for these solutions. Many of them may only own one or two homes. So they're looking for a product that gets their listings in front of the most potential tenants and makes renting out their properties easier. Today, our Longtail product experience is unmatched. On Zillow, renters can search, book tours, apply for properties, sign a lease and pay their rents securely, and apply for renters insurance. Similarly, Longtail property managers on Zillow can list, book tours, screen applicants, create leases, sign them electronically and collect rent payments. It's a true end-to-end solution that's highly useful to both renters and property managers alike. These investments in great products starting in 2018 powered Zillow to the top traffic ranking in rentals and made us the preferred brand for renters. Today, Zillow is the most searched rentals marketplace according to Google Trends, searched nearly 1.5 times more than the next company in the category, and we have the leading rentals traffic with very limited marketing spend. After our success in Longtail, in 2022, we turned our attention to the more commodity supply sub-segment of rentals Multifamily, big apartment buildings with 25 or more units. This is the easier-to-reach segment investors have historically thought of as the rentals category with professional property managers, who have marketing and software budgets to help them acquire renters and manage buildings. Since we turned our focus to the multifamily space, we have driven a 30% compounded annual growth rate in our Multifamily properties from 27,000 to 40,000 at the end of Q1, and a more than 30% CAGR in our Multifamily revenue on the back of just $15 million total marketing dollars spent on Zillow Rentals. Combining unique Longtail listings with more commodity Multifamily listings allows consumers a more seamless experience where they can see all types of available rental listings in one place and give Zillow a highly differentiated rentals marketplace experience in which we are now ramping up our investments. In addition, many movers are dual-track shopping, shopping for a home to buy while also considering their rental options. Zillow's integrated shopping experience and singular brand excels here. As it stands today, we estimate that Zillow has more than 50% of all rental listings in the country, more than any other site and many of them are unique to Zillow. But that still accounts for only 60% of all Longtail listings and 35% of Multifamily listings across the country. So we are investing in our Rentals products, services and sales to drive further growth. For example, in March, we entered into a strategic partnership with Realtor.com to provide all the Multifamily listings on their site and we recently launched our first national marketing campaign after a successful pilot last year in a few markets, which tested well to grow our audience. As with other parts of our business, 2024 is a year to scale up our breadth and depth in rentals to drive continued growth in listings, both Longtail and importantly, in Multifamily. With the largest audience of renters on the market, a 42% revenue CAGR since 2015 and a $1 billion plus revenue opportunity in front of us, Zillow Rentals is digitally organizing a large fragmented local marketplace highly valued by all participants. One quarter into the year, we are pleased with our execution and controlling what we can against a noisy external backdrop. And with that, I will now pass the microphone to Jeremy Hofmann, who will provide a closer look at our results.\nJeremy Hofmann: Thanks, Jeremy, and hello, everyone. As you heard from Rich and Jeremy, we are pleased with how we are executing on our strategy and our results once again demonstrate that our strategy is working well. I will start with our Q1 2024 results, which exceeded expectations across the business for revenue and EBITDA. Revenue growth accelerated in Q1, up 13% year-over-year to $529 million, which was $26 million above the midpoint of our outlook range. The broader residential real estate industry grew 4% in the quarter according to data from NAR, meaning that we outperformed the category by 900 basis points. Each of our revenue categories across residential, mortgages and rentals contributed to our outperformance. On a GAAP basis, Q1 net loss was $23 million, representing 4% of our revenue. EBITDA was $125 million for the quarter, resulting in a 24% EBITDA margin, a year-over-year margin expansion of 200 basis points. The combination of our revenue outperformance and effective cost management delivered the improved year-over-year EBITDA results despite a macro housing environment that remains constrained. Our Q1 residential revenue of $393 million outperformed our outlook range and revenue growth accelerated to 9% year-over-year. Premier Agent benefited from the ongoing investments in our top and mid-funnel experiences that drove improvements in our overall connection rates. Additionally, our growth was driven by accelerating growth in our new construction business, growth in ShowingTime+ as we began our nationwide rollout of Listing Showcase with additional contributions from Follow Up Boss. Rentals revenue grew 31% year-over-year in Q1 to $97 million, primarily driven by our Multifamily revenue, which grew 46% year-over-year. Our Rentals strategy is working well and our team is executing on growing the number of Multifamily properties on our apps and sites, which reached an all-time high of 40,000 Multifamily properties as of the end of Q1. Total listings across our entire Rentals marketplace were up 20% year-over-year to an industry-leading 1.8 million listings in March. Mortgages revenue of $31 million in Q1 was up 19% year-over-year with purchase loan origination volume growing more than 130% year-over-year to $601 million. Our mortgage strategy is to help more of our customers get financing through Zillow Home Loans, which continues to drive our growing share of purchase origination even in a difficult macroeconomic environment, evidenced by total industry purchase loan originations being down 10% year-over-year per our internal data. EBITDA expenses in Q1 totaled $404 million, flat sequentially from Q4 and at the midpoint of our implied outlook range as a result of our ongoing focus on cost management. Cost of revenue, which is included in EBITDA expenses, increased $31 million or 34% year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in website development costs as we continued to test and release new products, as well as increases in mortgage loan processing costs due to higher purchase loan origination volume. We ended Q1 with $2.9 billion of cash and investments, up from $2.8 billion at the end of Q4, primarily driven by net cash provided by operating activities. As of the end of Q1, we had $1.6 billion of outstanding convertible debt. We repurchased $9 million of shares during Q1 and we were opportunistic in the month of April, repurchasing an additional 2.1 million shares for $91 million. Collectively, we have repurchased a total of $100 million of shares year-to-date. Turning to our outlook for Q2. We estimate the residential real-estate industry total transaction value will be roughly flat year-over-year, which is down sequentially from the 4% year-over-year growth we saw in Q1. We expect total company revenue to be between $525 million and $540 million, implying a year-over-year increase of 5% at the midpoint of our outlook range. For residential, we expect revenue to be between $372 million to $382 million. Our residential revenue outlook for Q2 is down sequentially based on two headwinds. The first is that first-time homebuyer activity has underperformed the overall mortgage buyer market year-to-date. A good indicator of first-time homebuyer activity is the MBA's FHA Mortgage Purchase Application Index. Because our customer base leans toward first-time homebuyers, this is an index we watch closely. Over the past six weeks, we have seen the index underperform the overall mortgage purchase index by over 800 basis points. The second is recent moves in interest rates. We have seen some headwinds as Premier Agent partners take a wait and see approach as interest rates have spiked by more than 50 basis points over the last few weeks and first-time homebuyers are a lower percentage of the overall home buying mix. Moving to Rentals. We expect our Rentals revenue to grow in the mid-20% range year-over-year as we continue to benefit from the strength of our execution, a favorable industry backdrop driving property manager demand for advertising, and the launch of our first national Rentals brand awareness campaign. Within Rentals, we expect Multifamily revenue to grow faster than the overall business as we add more properties, sell more subscription packages and benefit from the investments we are making in our renter experience. For mortgages, we expect accelerated year-over-year revenue growth in the high 20% range. We remain on track to further integrate Premier Agent and Zillow Home Loans with our planned enhanced market expansion. As capacity is built within these enhanced markets, we expect to send more of our mortgage leads to Zillow Home Loans directly, as well as drive engagement with more consumers on our apps and sites to grow our origination volumes. We expect origination revenue to become both a larger portion of mortgages revenue and a larger driver of the category's revenue growth going forward as a result. For Q2, we expect EBITDA to be between $85 million and $100 million, equating to a 17% margin at the midpoint of our outlook range. This implies EBITDA expenses will increase from $404 million in Q1 to an estimated $440 million in Q2, which is what we expected in our full year plan. Roughly 85% of the increase is being driven by a combination of a seasonal uptick in our brand marketing spend and increased marketing spend to accelerate our Rentals growth strategy. The balance of the increase is coming from staffing of variable headcount for sales, given the growth we expect in Rentals, Listing Showcase, and Zillow Home Loans throughout 2024. Moving on to the full year. I want to reiterate that we expect double-digit revenue growth for 2024, primarily driven by our growth pillars with modest EBITDA margin expansion for the year. Our announced Rentals brand campaign is something we had factored in when we initially provided this framework in February. Based on our Q1 results and our expected Q2 performance, we expect to outpace our internal plan for both revenue and EBITDA in the first half of 2024. On the cost side, we continue to believe our fixed investments are at the right level, which should result in our fixed costs growing modestly with inflation and our variable costs growing ahead of revenue initially as we ramp up new hires to be fully productive. Advertising spend is a lever we treat as separate and distinct from the rest of the cost base and one we will pull depending on the growth opportunities we see in front of us. Clearly, Rentals is an opportunity we think deserves amplified marketing dollars and we are excited about what the campaign will bring for our future growth. To close, it is clear we are executing on our strategy. We are seeing growth across residential, rentals, and mortgages. We are also seeing great results from our growth pillars in our enhanced markets that will continue to rollout throughout this year. We are on track to grow revenue double-digits and expand margins, all against a macro backdrop that is worse than many forecasted. And with that, operator, we'll open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brad Erickson with RBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBradley Erickson: Yeah. Thanks. I guess two for me. One, obviously, sounds like the residential business has slowed down here. You mentioned the full year guide though hasn't really changed. So I guess, steeper second half ramp implied. Clearly, you guys are investing in Rentals and that was baked in. But I think relative to last quarter, maybe just talk about your confidence in that second half ramp. And besides Rentals, what else is kind of instructing that confidence on maintaining the guidance?\nJeremy Hofmann: Yeah. Thanks, Brad. It's Jeremy Hofmann. I'll take that one. I think similar to what we've said in the past, we don't overfocus on quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, just given how fluid macro has been and will continue to be. What gives us confidence is, we're outperforming our internal plan. We expect to do so with what we guided for the second quarter and expect to do so for the first half of the year on both revenue and EBITDA. And when I look at our strategy and what we're executing across, we feel really confident that the second half is going to accelerate and will grow double-digits against the flattish housing market. And that comes from a few factors. So I think first, more contributions from our enhanced markets will come in the second half as they come online, and that's all back half weighted. We're seeing continued share gains and positive signals in the 13 enhanced markets to date. Jeremy hit that earlier, but across revenue per total transaction value and customer adoption rate, so we feel good there. Mortgages, we expect to continue to accelerate showcases rolling out nationwide and accelerating. And then, obviously, Rentals is growing quite nicely and we expect that to continue as well. So that's what gives us the confidence around the reacceleration that we expect to see in the second half.\nBradley Erickson: Got it. That's helpful. And then just secondarily on the regulatory front, specifically around the buyer's agreement, you mentioned that arrangement, the product you announced, I guess it was yesterday, leading to maybe higher conversion rates. I think there's some investor concern out there where there's still going to be some friction, maybe higher up in the funnel. Can you kind of talk about how you manage that part of it? And maybe why it's not a headwind relative to kind of how the old way used to work? Thanks.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yeah. Hey, Brad. It's Jeremy Wacksman. Yeah. As I said earlier, I mean, we see this as a great opportunity. What we're testing is post connection, right? So after a consumer has already requested or in the Real Time Touring case, booked a tour, can we help educate them and provide them a really consumer friendly digital education agreement. And we see that as better educating the customer and also expectation setting the customer for when they meet the agent as what to expect from the agent, both in that initial relationship, but in what they might expect in a buyer agency agreement generally. And anytime we can help educate a customer that typically leads to a higher quality customer for our agents. We've seen that as we've built things like Touring and Real Time Touring. And I gave this example earlier. In states that have been using agreements earlier in the funnel, you typically see higher conversion rates. The Connecticut example is a good one. 90% of buyers are using buyer's agents and the conversion rates are higher. So I think important to frame it in the context of this is down in the funnel once a customer has already raised their hand, really declared their intent, we work with them to make sure we're getting them to the right place. They've had this magical book a tour experience, and they're getting ready to go. And this is an additional education opportunity. It's not friction.\nBradley Erickson: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: We now turn to John Campbell with Stephens. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Campbell: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Just back to the new Zillow touring agreement, That's a pretty clever development. Congrats on getting that to market. I want to touch on two items related to that. So first, if there are agents that are unwilling to adopt that new touring agreement, will those agents simply lose the ability to get tour requests through ShowingTime? And then secondly, just more broadly, how important do you feel the role of touring is for your journey of moving from 3% of transactions to 6%.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yeah. This is Jeremy. I'll hit both. I think it's optional, right? So it's not something that Zillow is required to do. That's why I said we see it as opportunity. It's an educational step. At some point in the experience, the agent is going to have a conversation with the customer about services and start an agreement and a relationship. We're trying to help facilitate that. So we don't expect any fall-off for friction because it's an optional experience. Now that said, we're prototyping and testing. We'll learn a lot as we work with our first couple hundred agent partners and customers and we'll iterate from there. So and then, to your second question. We see touring as again, as we've talked about for a while, it's the number one thing customers want to do. That's why we're so excited about it. It's why it's one of our growth pillars and one of the drivers of the performance gains we've seen in our enhanced markets to date and the overall share gains we expect to see as we roll out to more markets. Both -- that is both physical touring, which we've talked about here, and virtual touring, right? So getting customers a deeper sense of home, helping them figure out what they want to go see in person helps higher quality customers be more educated and informed when they raise their hand. That helps our agents win more of those customers when they meet them and drive transactions here. So we're excited about the opportunity, the changes, the evolution Rich talked about provide. This is one of the first ways in which we're trying to leverage and help make those marriages between consumers and agents happen.\nJohn Campbell: Okay. That's helpful. And then one more to tackle on here on Matterport. I mean, obviously, it looks like it's heading to one of your competitors. I know you're not going to probably comment on pending transaction or maybe what that ripple effect calls for the market, but maybe if you could just talk to your own 3D tour capabilities and how you feel that stacks up?\nJeremy Wacksman: Yeah. We are really excited about our own homegrown 3D Tech. We're excited about virtual touring generally. We support Matterport today. It's a small percentage of listings today, and our 3D technology is on a small percentage of listings today. And that virtual touring capability is going to continue to grow as consumers discover, love it, and as we all improve our own technologies. So we're really happy with our home grown effort. And as you know, that is what powers Listing Showcase and all of the really unique interactive floor plan AI-generated listings. I talked about earlier that drive a ton more buyer engagement and are helping listings go pending and sell faster and sell for more money. So we love the investment that we're making here and we really see this as where the consumer experience is going. But it's early and all of us are small. And retraining the consumer to allow more touring in the virtual world, we think complements the physical touring investments we're making. Again, back to the earlier conversation. Helping consumers find what they want to buy, helping them dream and shop more online in our app, and getting them into the hands of our great agent partners.\nJohn Campbell: Makes sense. Thanks for taking our questions, guys.\nOperator: We now turn to Ron Josey with Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nRonald Josey: All right. Thanks for taking the question. Rich, I wanted to ask on the Rentals business only because clearly it's a big strategic priority and the deck was very helpful. And we're on a $400 million run rate currently and I think the view is to get to that $1 billion, if I read the deck correctly, in revenue. So I wanted to maybe focus more on Multifamily growth. And we talked about, I think, 35% penetration of the, call it, those that are available properties to 40,000 properties today. Just talk to us about the lifecycle for getting these Multifamily properties onto the platform, the importance to rentals for first-time buyers. And then maybe as a quick follow up to that, how Rentals, it's been a big business for Zillow for a while, creates a deeper relationship with Zillow over called the entire housing process of a person. And I have a quick follow-up.\nRichard Barton: Hey, Ron. Guys, maybe I'll start out with a little bit of a strategy answer and then Jeremy Wacksman maybe talk about, or Jeremy Hofmann talk about the Multifamily question that Ron asked. Yeah. We -- I really love the Rentals play as you know, Ron. It is a textbook example of a two-sided digital marketplace opportunity. It's the kind of opportunity that our Board Director, Bill Gurley, who many of you know, who's really a thought leader on digital marketplaces, would really love. It turns out that I've been partly involved in -- intimately involved in building several kind of successful digital marketplaces since the dawn of the Internet as well. And it makes me excited. Let me just take through why. One, it's hyper-fragmented and locally distributed inventory on the supply side of the marketplace. Likewise, it's really fragmented on the renter or the demand side of the marketplace. Okay. Also, there is volatile pricing and volatile availability, which promotes market monitoring. So high engagement from both sides of the marketplace. Additionally, there is heavy shopper interest in content as both practical and for entertainment as part of the shopping process, which lends itself well to a digital marketplace. It's a very high gross margin, which we all, as investors, love. And finally, marketplaces have a positive network effect, which is more supply begets more demand, which begets more supply. So we're seeing all of those things in action here in our rental marketplace. We knew from the beginning that acquiring demand at a really reasonable price, basically near zero marginal expense, is key to making these kinds of marketplaces work, and that keeping the supply-side inventory acquisition costs very low was going to be key as well. And we feel very good on both of those. On the demand side, it's pretty simple. Zillow Rentals has kind of ridden the long and lovely coattails of the greater Zillow with our 200 million plus monthly uniques, and lots of them also interested in buying a home as well as renting. So we've been able to leverage that. And on the supply side, it took us many years of kind of toiling in the dark in the Longtail, where most of the rental inventory is in single-family homes in the Longtail. But now, after toiling for many years, we estimate we have about 60% of those, and they're unique. These are almost all listings that will only be showing up inside of Zillow Rentals, which is fantastic. So more recently, I'll hand it off to Jeremy here. We turned our guns to the kind of more obvious and more commodity apartments in tall buildings in cities market, you know, the Multifamily market. This is the market segment with real marketing budgets and professional managers. We have 40,000 buildings now. It's growing really rapidly. We love that. I'll -- why don't I? So I'll conclude by saying, yeah, we've got the expense of the supply side nailed and the inventory now kind of lit up, and we've certainly got the demand side in a terrific spot. And we're -- I'm personally excited to begin to really lean into this. Jeremy, do you want to chat a bit about Multifamily?\nJeremy Wacksman: Yeah. I mean, I think the answer is similar to the framework you gave around it being a two-sided marketplace. We have been building the overall organic traffic and listings for the renter experience, and that's driven the demand side broadly. Now we're focusing in on increasing demand, more specifically in Multifamily. And you're seeing that both in our partnership with Realtor.com, and in our advertising campaign following a really successful test last year. And that's on the demand side of Rich's two-sided marketplace. And then the supply side is bringing those high-intent renters to the professionals Rich talked about and increasing our sales efforts to go help those folks connect with our renters and get their -- get what they need from their advertising dollars. So it is really about the flywheel Rich talked about and it's just the focus in on Multifamily, on both the demand side and the supply side that we're now turning more focus and energy to.\nRonald Josey: That's great. Thank you, Rich. Thank you, Jeremy. I'll go back in the queue for another question.\nJeremy Wacksman: Thanks, Ron.\nOperator: Thanks. We now turn to Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Let me try a few, please. The Q2 guide, you don't have this kind of outpacing of real estate industry total transaction value that you've had pretty consistently for a while. Maybe you covered this before, but if not, could you please go through that? What -- why wouldn't you outpace? And then on the Showcase new listings, can you just talk about what kind of traction you're seeing with that? I know you covered a little bit in the Shareholder Letter, but reactions you've had to the pricing models that you rolled out at the beginning of the year? Thank you very much.\nJeremy Hofmann: Yeah. Thanks, Mark. It's Jeremy Hofmann. I'll take the first one on the guide. Yeah, we called out a few factors that are headwinds right now. One is first time homebuyers are just struggling in this market and we lean that way. So we're feeling that a bit. And then, additionally, just when rates spike like this as quickly as they did over the past few weeks, our premier agent partners just tend to be in a more of a wait-and-see environment. So we're feeling both of those at the moment. This is not dissimilar from what we felt this time two years ago where PA partners took a bit of a wait-and-see approach when rates spiked and then, ultimately we worked through it. So like, I said earlier, not necessarily too focused on the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, and just reiterating that we think revenue reaccelerates in the back half of the year to get us that double-digit revenue growth against the flattish housing market. We continue to feel good there for a variety of reasons just the way that we're executing across residential, mortgages, showcase, and rentals as well. And then, Jeremy, maybe I'll pass it to you.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yeah. I can hit Listing Showcase. Yeah. I mean, as I said earlier, we're really excited that the increased engagement from the buyers continues, right? So more page views, saves and shares as we get showcased out there more and more. We're also now seeing seller benefit, which I talked about. So homes are selling faster, 20% more likely to accept an offer in 14 days, and they're selling for more money, 2% more money. And most importantly, agents who are using Listing Showcase are winning more listings. So all that says to us that as we've been rolling this out and scaling this up and offering in more locations, we're seeing a really good product market fit, both with -- we knew with buyers, we're now seeing with sellers and with sellers agents. And that's why we're so excited about the intermediate-term goal we've talked to you all about and getting ourselves to 5% to 10% total active listings because then we think there's potentially more to do once this gets to that state.\nMark Mahaney: Do you have markets where that coverage is materially higher like a lead market where it's materially higher than 5% to 10%?\nJeremy Wacksman: Not yet. I mean, we've talked to you all about it for a while now, but it's important to remember it's only been live for a couple quarters and it's only been live nationally since February. So, team has grown, as Jeremy talked about. We have staffed up sales folks to start to hit more coverage and talk to agents in more places. But, as much as we're excited about, as much as we see a really exciting product here, it is still really early in our journey.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thank you, Jeremy. Thank you, Jeremy.\nOperator: We now turn to Ryan McKeveny with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nRyan McKeveny: Thank you very much. On Follow Up Boss, you mentioned in the letter being even more excited about the opportunity for conversion gains. I guess if you can provide kind of two sides of an update, one would just be initial receptiveness and maybe retention of legacy Follow Up Boss customers post the acquisition. And then secondarily, I know it's only been a handful of months. But where does integration stand with the PA business? And anything to call out about any benefits to conversion rates thus far or is that more opportunity as we move forward? Thank you.\nJeremy Wacksman: Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. I think on initial reception, we've been really pleased with the retention of the core customers of Follow Up Boss as we've gotten through closing and integration and starting to work together now for a couple quarters. And we're really pleased to just see the continued positive agent feedback on the Follow Up Boss product. I still get anecdotes all the time talking to agents about how much they love it and how much they're excited about our ability to help the Follow Up Boss team grow and invest more in this team focused CRM that they've built their business on. So we continue to be pleased with the post-close, post-acquisition performance of the Follow Up Boss agent base. And then on your second question, I would say it's still a lot of opportunity. I think you heard both me and Jeremy talk about in the prepared remarks. They're starting to ship things for all advertising partners or, sorry, all agent partners. And we're also starting to think about ways to help from your agent partners use Follow Up Boss to better convert their business, both their Zillow customers but their entire customers. So not too much more to share in terms of roadmap, but a whole lot of excited folks internally in both the Follow Up Boss team and our Zillow consumer and Zillow agent teams ideating and working together on how can we help our agents use technology to convert more customers and deliver better service. And we see a long road ahead for that initiative.\nRyan McKeveny: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just to follow up on the 2Q revenue guide in residential and the comment about some partners taking a wait-and-see approach. I guess if I step back, there's the industry noise related to all the litigation and everything that's going on. There's noise on the competitive side of things, neither of which seem to be kind of the called-out headwinds. So maybe just help us think through that disaggregation of the headwinds in a bit more detail, like, is there any change on the margin coming from competitive/industry types of dynamics or at this point in time is the best estimation that it's largely kind of macro-related factors at this point in time? Thank you.\nJeremy Hofmann: Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. It's Jeremy Hofmann. I think we monitor our sales funnel really, really closely, and we have software that sits over top of it, monitoring agent calls and agent sentiment and just telling us what they're hearing. And the situation right now is just -- it's a temporary rate shock. We've been through that before. It happened in the spring of 2022, and we know how to navigate through it. We want to be there for our partners during this time, and not necessarily going to push too hard as a result of that. And then with respect to NAR and competitive, we're just not seeing that in any data that we see. We just don't see impact from either of those. So it really has been much more macro-related and macro in a way that we think is navigable. And again, coming back to the full year, we just continue to feel quite good about the ability to accelerate revenue over the course of the year and let us get through the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, just given how fluid the macro is.\nRyan McKeveny: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We now turn to Chris Kuntarich with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nChris Kuntarich: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two-parter on the Rentals business. Just as we think about this billion-dollar-plus opportunity for Rentals, last quarter, you'd frame Listing Showcase as kind of a medium-term, $150 million to $300 million opportunity. Should we be thinking about this also as a medium-term, or is this more of a kind of a longer-term opportunity? And second part of the question would be, just as we think about the pace of Rentals' growth in '24, how should we be thinking about pricing as a lever you could potentially pull? Thanks.\nJeremy Hofmann: Yeah. I'll take it. It's Jeremy Hofmann. I think on the billion-dollar-plus opportunity, I think the key word there is sustainable. We think it's a sustainable billion-dollar plus opportunity and we've built the business that way. Rich walked through a bunch of why we like the strategy so much, but we also like it as a multi-decade type opportunity. So with respect to timing, we're not going to commit to anything there. We just believe there's a lot more for us to do. And we think what we're building is differentiated versus anybody else. And we have an opportunity to be the place where all renters come and all property managers come as well, whether that's in the single-family or multifamily category. That's what we think the opportunity is. And it's done under one brand, Zillow, right, that's already known for housing. So that's what we're focused on. Just want to give you a sense for what we see over time. And then secondly, on 2024 for Rentals, the goal is really keep adding more and more properties and bringing more demand alongside. So we think of it as more of an effort that way than pushing on price. It's really we just see a pretty substantial opportunity in front of us and we want to make sure we continue to add properties at the way that we have been and then also bringing the consumer demand to satisfy those properties. So the organic efforts that we have, the Realtor.com partnership, which went live today, and then this national marketing campaign, we're quite excited about as well. All in the vein of how do we make sure we build something really sustainable over time? And we think we're on that path.\nChris Kuntarich: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Dae Lee with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDae K Lee: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. So back to the NAR settlement, I mean, is this something that your partners are anticipating having a meaningful disruption around the time of implementation or could this be more of a change that takes a while for you guys to see?\nJeremy Wacksman: This is Jeremy. I can hit that. I mean, I think, no, I think as Rich outlined earlier, we don't see a ton of revolutionary change here. We see more evolutionary change that results in more educated and more transparent consumers, which we see as leading to higher quality, higher intent leads and connections for our partners. And I think we're seeing that already start to play out in the early innings after all the news is cleared of how partners are processing connections and how they're learning to work with those consumers. And as I talked about, just take our Touring pilot here as an example of leaning in on consumer education in a consumer friendly way to help them understand what they're going to be dealing with. And in the states that have been doing that, we're seeing still fairly ubiquitous independent representation and higher conversion rates. So as folks like us and others roll out more buy-side agreements, again, back to our principles, we think a more educated consumer who can understand what they're getting from their representation that they choose and understanding that the compensation is fair and negotiable and can be negotiated, that leads to a better conversation with professionals. And we think that leads to our professionals, which as Rich talked about are a small subset of the most productive agents winning more business. And so, we see that anecdotally today and we see that in some of the states that we're further ahead on this today and we expect to see that continue as more folks rollout changes to deal with the evolution.\nDae K Lee: Got it. And as a follow-up, I don't know if you addressed this, but like what's driving the first-time homebuyer activity underperformance? I mean, is it just related to the mortgage rate hike or is there something else happening? And those are 2Q, I assume activities at these levels?\nJeremy Hofmann: Yeah. It's Jeremy Hofmann, just to make sure I heard it. Yeah, I mean, really it is the rate shock that we felt. It's less about the absolute interest rate level, it's more the shock. And when rates spike by 50 basis points over a couple of week period, first-time homebuyers are the folks that feel that the most, and they're underperforming pretty significantly. We don't expect that to be forever, but it is a temporal thing. And as a result, it's a bit of a headwind for us, but one that we think we can navigate through pretty seamlessly.\nDae K Lee: All right. Understand. Thank you.\nOperator: This completes the allotted time for questions. I'll now turn the call back over to Rich Barton for any closing remarks.\nRichard Barton: All right. Thanks, everybody. Hey, look, it's noisy out there and there is a lot of confusion and there's a lot of distraction. And I'll tell you, we're calm. We're driving forward. We're putting up numbers. The product is getting better and better. And we have a long road ahead of us because of all of this incredible kind of pent-up potential transaction energy that lives inside of our wonderful marketplace. So you know, it's noisy, but we're feeling really good. Thanks for being on the road with us. We'll talk to you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeremy Hofmann",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremy, and hello, everyone. As you heard from Rich and Jeremy, we are pleased with how we are executing on our strategy and our results once again demonstrate that our strategy is working well. I will start with our Q1 2024 results, which exceeded expectations across the business for revenue and EBITDA. Revenue growth accelerated in Q1, up 13% year-over-year to $529 million, which was $26 million above the midpoint of our outlook range. The broader residential real estate industry grew 4% in the quarter according to data from NAR, meaning that we outperformed the category by 900 basis points. Each of our revenue categories across residential, mortgages and rentals contributed to our outperformance. On a GAAP basis, Q1 net loss was $23 million, representing 4% of our revenue. EBITDA was $125 million for the quarter, resulting in a 24% EBITDA margin, a year-over-year margin expansion of 200 basis points. The combination of our revenue outperformance and effective cost management delivered the improved year-over-year EBITDA results despite a macro housing environment that remains constrained. Our Q1 residential revenue of $393 million outperformed our outlook range and revenue growth accelerated to 9% year-over-year. Premier Agent benefited from the ongoing investments in our top and mid-funnel experiences that drove improvements in our overall connection rates. Additionally, our growth was driven by accelerating growth in our new construction business, growth in ShowingTime+ as we began our nationwide rollout of Listing Showcase with additional contributions from Follow Up Boss. Rentals revenue grew 31% year-over-year in Q1 to $97 million, primarily driven by our Multifamily revenue, which grew 46% year-over-year. Our Rentals strategy is working well and our team is executing on growing the number of Multifamily properties on our apps and sites, which reached an all-time high of 40,000 Multifamily properties as of the end of Q1. Total listings across our entire Rentals marketplace were up 20% year-over-year to an industry-leading 1.8 million listings in March. Mortgages revenue of $31 million in Q1 was up 19% year-over-year with purchase loan origination volume growing more than 130% year-over-year to $601 million. Our mortgage strategy is to help more of our customers get financing through Zillow Home Loans, which continues to drive our growing share of purchase origination even in a difficult macroeconomic environment, evidenced by total industry purchase loan originations being down 10% year-over-year per our internal data. EBITDA expenses in Q1 totaled $404 million, flat sequentially from Q4 and at the midpoint of our implied outlook range as a result of our ongoing focus on cost management. Cost of revenue, which is included in EBITDA expenses, increased $31 million or 34% year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in website development costs as we continued to test and release new products, as well as increases in mortgage loan processing costs due to higher purchase loan origination volume. We ended Q1 with $2.9 billion of cash and investments, up from $2.8 billion at the end of Q4, primarily driven by net cash provided by operating activities. As of the end of Q1, we had $1.6 billion of outstanding convertible debt. We repurchased $9 million of shares during Q1 and we were opportunistic in the month of April, repurchasing an additional 2.1 million shares for $91 million. Collectively, we have repurchased a total of $100 million of shares year-to-date. Turning to our outlook for Q2. We estimate the residential real-estate industry total transaction value will be roughly flat year-over-year, which is down sequentially from the 4% year-over-year growth we saw in Q1. We expect total company revenue to be between $525 million and $540 million, implying a year-over-year increase of 5% at the midpoint of our outlook range. For residential, we expect revenue to be between $372 million to $382 million. Our residential revenue outlook for Q2 is down sequentially based on two headwinds. The first is that first-time homebuyer activity has underperformed the overall mortgage buyer market year-to-date. A good indicator of first-time homebuyer activity is the MBA's FHA Mortgage Purchase Application Index. Because our customer base leans toward first-time homebuyers, this is an index we watch closely. Over the past six weeks, we have seen the index underperform the overall mortgage purchase index by over 800 basis points. The second is recent moves in interest rates. We have seen some headwinds as Premier Agent partners take a wait and see approach as interest rates have spiked by more than 50 basis points over the last few weeks and first-time homebuyers are a lower percentage of the overall home buying mix. Moving to Rentals. We expect our Rentals revenue to grow in the mid-20% range year-over-year as we continue to benefit from the strength of our execution, a favorable industry backdrop driving property manager demand for advertising, and the launch of our first national Rentals brand awareness campaign. Within Rentals, we expect Multifamily revenue to grow faster than the overall business as we add more properties, sell more subscription packages and benefit from the investments we are making in our renter experience. For mortgages, we expect accelerated year-over-year revenue growth in the high 20% range. We remain on track to further integrate Premier Agent and Zillow Home Loans with our planned enhanced market expansion. As capacity is built within these enhanced markets, we expect to send more of our mortgage leads to Zillow Home Loans directly, as well as drive engagement with more consumers on our apps and sites to grow our origination volumes. We expect origination revenue to become both a larger portion of mortgages revenue and a larger driver of the category's revenue growth going forward as a result. For Q2, we expect EBITDA to be between $85 million and $100 million, equating to a 17% margin at the midpoint of our outlook range. This implies EBITDA expenses will increase from $404 million in Q1 to an estimated $440 million in Q2, which is what we expected in our full year plan. Roughly 85% of the increase is being driven by a combination of a seasonal uptick in our brand marketing spend and increased marketing spend to accelerate our Rentals growth strategy. The balance of the increase is coming from staffing of variable headcount for sales, given the growth we expect in Rentals, Listing Showcase, and Zillow Home Loans throughout 2024. Moving on to the full year. I want to reiterate that we expect double-digit revenue growth for 2024, primarily driven by our growth pillars with modest EBITDA margin expansion for the year. Our announced Rentals brand campaign is something we had factored in when we initially provided this framework in February. Based on our Q1 results and our expected Q2 performance, we expect to outpace our internal plan for both revenue and EBITDA in the first half of 2024. On the cost side, we continue to believe our fixed investments are at the right level, which should result in our fixed costs growing modestly with inflation and our variable costs growing ahead of revenue initially as we ramp up new hires to be fully productive. Advertising spend is a lever we treat as separate and distinct from the rest of the cost base and one we will pull depending on the growth opportunities we see in front of us. Clearly, Rentals is an opportunity we think deserves amplified marketing dollars and we are excited about what the campaign will bring for our future growth. To close, it is clear we are executing on our strategy. We are seeing growth across residential, rentals, and mortgages. We are also seeing great results from our growth pillars in our enhanced markets that will continue to rollout throughout this year. We are on track to grow revenue double-digits and expand margins, all against a macro backdrop that is worse than many forecasted. And with that, operator, we'll open up the line for questions. Yeah. Thanks, Brad. It's Jeremy Hofmann. I'll take that one. I think similar to what we've said in the past, we don't overfocus on quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, just given how fluid macro has been and will continue to be. What gives us confidence is, we're outperforming our internal plan. We expect to do so with what we guided for the second quarter and expect to do so for the first half of the year on both revenue and EBITDA. And when I look at our strategy and what we're executing across, we feel really confident that the second half is going to accelerate and will grow double-digits against the flattish housing market. And that comes from a few factors. So I think first, more contributions from our enhanced markets will come in the second half as they come online, and that's all back half weighted. We're seeing continued share gains and positive signals in the 13 enhanced markets to date. Jeremy hit that earlier, but across revenue per total transaction value and customer adoption rate, so we feel good there. Mortgages, we expect to continue to accelerate showcases rolling out nationwide and accelerating. And then, obviously, Rentals is growing quite nicely and we expect that to continue as well. So that's what gives us the confidence around the reacceleration that we expect to see in the second half. Yeah. Thanks, Mark. It's Jeremy Hofmann. I'll take the first one on the guide. Yeah, we called out a few factors that are headwinds right now. One is first time homebuyers are just struggling in this market and we lean that way. So we're feeling that a bit. And then, additionally, just when rates spike like this as quickly as they did over the past few weeks, our premier agent partners just tend to be in a more of a wait-and-see environment. So we're feeling both of those at the moment. This is not dissimilar from what we felt this time two years ago where PA partners took a bit of a wait-and-see approach when rates spiked and then, ultimately we worked through it. So like, I said earlier, not necessarily too focused on the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, and just reiterating that we think revenue reaccelerates in the back half of the year to get us that double-digit revenue growth against the flattish housing market. We continue to feel good there for a variety of reasons just the way that we're executing across residential, mortgages, showcase, and rentals as well. And then, Jeremy, maybe I'll pass it to you. Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. It's Jeremy Hofmann. I think we monitor our sales funnel really, really closely, and we have software that sits over top of it, monitoring agent calls and agent sentiment and just telling us what they're hearing. And the situation right now is just -- it's a temporary rate shock. We've been through that before. It happened in the spring of 2022, and we know how to navigate through it.

Yeah. I'll take it. It's Jeremy Hofmann. I think on the billion-dollar-plus opportunity, I think the key word there is sustainable. We think it's a sustainable billion-dollar plus opportunity and we've built the business that way. Rich walked through a bunch of why we like the strategy so much, but we also like it as a multi-decade type opportunity. So with respect to timing, we're not going to commit to anything there. We just believe there's a lot more for us to do. And we think what we're building is differentiated versus anybody else.

            "name": "Richard Barton",
            "content": "Thanks, Brad. Good afternoon, and good evening for those on the East Coast. Thanks for dialing-in to hear our first quarter 2024 results. We saw strong revenue numbers that flowed through to the bottom line, helping us outperform our outlook on revenue and EBITDA as we successfully execute on our growth strategy. We continue to upgrade and scale our housing super app, and we've seen further proof-points in our enhanced markets that support a continued push on both breadth of market coverage and depth of penetration within those markets for our integrated, digital moving solutions for consumers, their agents and their loan officers. Today, I'll remind us about what makes Zillow different and what makes me so confident in our growth plan. Jeremy Wacksman will then give a progress report on our growth pillars with a deep dive into our burgeoning Rentals business. Next, Jeremy Hofmann will discuss the numbers in more detail. And then, we'll open things up for Q&A. Beginning with our quarterly results, we reported better than expected revenue growth across the business. Q1 revenue of $529 million grew 13% year-over-year. Total revenue growth once again outperformed the residential real estate market. Rentals continued its strong growth with $97 million in revenue in Q1, up 31% year-over-year. We continue to grow our multifamily property count with 40,000 properties at the end of the quarter, up from 37,000 at the end of December. We are well-positioned for future Rentals' revenue growth as we detail in our new Investor Relations deck that is a deep-dive on our Rentals business. We published this new deck along with earnings today, and we'll discuss it in more detail later in this call. In an ongoing tough rate environment, we also continued to make strong progress in mortgages with Q1 revenue of $31 million, up 19% year-over-year and purchase mortgage origination volume growing more than 130% year-over-year. So in a hostile housing market and a noisy industry environment, why is Zillow outperforming? The simple answer is that Zillow is wholly-focused on solving real consumer problems with software in a giant industry that has historically had very little R&D investment. Digitally re-platforming and integrating a huge, disparate local industry where transactions are relatively infrequent is an audacious undertaking. No other company is really even attempting it. We are advantaged primarily because we are a product and technology company first, and are able to attract and retain the especially talented people, who know how to build market and support great software products. This enables us to focus completely on delighting our consumers and their valued partners in pursuit of the dream of using technology to make moving simple and joyful. Our product prowess over the years has put Zillow in the enviable position of having a large engaged audience, who come to us organically, an audience who love, trust and rely on our brand. This product-led organic marketing growth story is rare, but it is common for the great ones. Those are the products and brands we admire the most. Attracting a large organic audience has also given Zillow the space to experiment with business models. Those who followed us for a long time know how aggressive and innovative we have been methodically converting our sticky audience into revenue. We have built a substantial growing diverse and EBITDA profitable business, yet we still monetize only a small share of our audience. Our massive unconverted audience will drive years of growth ahead for Zillow as we grow into our rightful transaction share, continue to adjust our business models, and add and integrate new business lines. We have been pro-consumer, practical and nimble and we will continue to be so. The first era of Zillow involved amassing a large organic engaged consumer audience for whom we were providing valuable information via great sites and apps. Several years ago, we realized that our dream of digitizing the move and accessing the really big TAM in the category would involve getting much more directly involved in the transaction itself, applying software to every step of the workflow, refreshing our partner network to those who were higher performing and interested in automation and scale, and building out or acquiring key components of the move process ourselves all the way from listings photography and creation through tour booking, agent workflow, pre-approval, mortgage origination, document routing and closing end-to-end. To serve as an aspirational and consumer focused North Star, we created a product strategy that we call the Zillow Housing Super App, the experience that would integrate the whole of the complex, scary, expensive moving process. The Zillow Super App is working well. Jeremy Wacksman will soon walk you through a detailed report of our growth pillars, but we see very good progress across the Board on each pillar, touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network, integration and rentals. Amidst all of the fear speculation and noise, a steady focus on execution is what's working for us, delivering for our customers and partners. In terms of the noise, though, let me give some color commentary on what has transpired since our last quarterly call. The long running class action suit against NAR and select brokerages thankfully arrived at a proposed settlement in mid-March. And the judge just last week granted preliminary approval of that settlement. The substance of the settlement is what we characterized as a very reasonable middle path forward for the industry, where commissions are negotiated and communicated between sellers and buyers and both parties are better educated. This is a positive evolutionary step for the industry. It is not a revolution as some, who believe they might profit from chaos and disruption are proclaiming. Clear and negotiable compensation fits quite well with our published consumer advocacy marketplace principles of free access to listings, independent representation and negotiable compensation as outlined at advocacy.zillowgroup.com. There will continue to be sensational seeming news surrounding this settlement, no doubt. Given there remains several steps in having NAR and the industry put the settlement requirements into practice. And real-estate is generally a hot topic for hot takes given it is a $2 trillion to $3 trillion industry employing millions of people in all 50 states and is most Americans' most valuable and most cherished asset. However, Zillow is well-positioned to assist with and benefit from this evolution. So why do we expect to benefit from this evolution? For three reasons. First, we have the most and highest intent customers in residential real estate. Zillow is the most trusted brand with the largest, most engaged audience. This is a hard earned position that we built over the past 18 years. And our top of funnel advantage today has never been stronger. Zillow has searched more on Google than the category term real estate and 3 times more than the next brand in the category. 80% of our traffic is organic and our app usage is more than 3 times anyone else in the category. We have more than 217 million average monthly unique users across the Zillow ecosystem of apps and sites, and 109 million total unique visitors according to ComScore, a third-party data tracker that allows for comparison across sites. We've built and maintained such a strong brand position because of our relentless focus on delivering exceptional tech innovations and customer experiences, which we believe are our most important investments. Regardless of how the industry evolves, our brand and audience will thrive. The second reason we expect to benefit from the industry evolution, we work with the most productive agents in real estate. Of the approximately 1.5 million real-estate license holders, many handle only one or two transactions a year. These are not our premier agent partners. 80% of all real estate transactions across the U.S. are done by the top 20% of agents or teams. And today, nearly four in five Zillow Premier Agent partners fall into that Top Tier. Since 2015, we have shrunk our active partner base by roughly 60%, while at the same time, our premier agent revenue has grown by more than 2.5 times. Orienting our business around the best agent teams, those who provide superior customer experiences, have proven ability to scale and make the most money to invest alongside us positions us well for potential shifts within the profession. If and as more hobbyist agents drop out of the industry, the outsized beneficiaries of this shift to professionalism will be our premier agent partners. The third reason we benefit. Zillow provides exceptional technology to make agents more efficient at their jobs and do more transactions. Zillow is the leading product innovator with features like Real Time Touring, Listing Showcase, and a Digital Pre-Approval pilot launching within the next couple of weeks that will further delight customers and create high intent real buyer connections for our premier agent partners. Additionally, we have invested heavily in broad adoption foundational industry software solutions like our Follow Up Boss CRM, ShowingTime Touring software, our Showcase 3D home technology, Aryeo real estate photographers SaaS, and DotLoop document signing and routing. Over the past 10 years, between our own tech and dev budget and the acquisition capital we've deployed for industry software, we've spent $4.3 billion cumulatively investing in technology for the real estate industry. Agents who work with our high intent customers and use our industry software tools are the best positioned to accelerate their share in every version of an industry evolution from here. So the short answer for why Zillow benefits from the evolutionary changes we see coming from the NAR settlement, we have the most and highest intent customers in real estate. We work with the most productive agents and we provide them exceptional technology to make their lives more efficient. Before handing it to Jeremy Wacksman, let me repeat for the whole of the great Zillow team in front of our investors, I'm impressed with the results you are achieving in your focused and relentless innovation for customers and partners in pursuit of a seamless, digital and joyful moving experience for all. We are all in a really tough housing market and a distracting industry environment, yet our hands are steady on the wheel as we drive Zillow's business and the industry forward. Okay. Jeremy? Hey, Ron. Guys, maybe I'll start out with a little bit of a strategy answer and then Jeremy Wacksman maybe talk about, or Jeremy Hofmann talk about the Multifamily question that Ron asked. Yeah. We -- I really love the Rentals play as you know, Ron. It is a textbook example of a two-sided digital marketplace opportunity. It's the kind of opportunity that our Board Director, Bill Gurley, who many of you know, who's really a thought leader on digital marketplaces, would really love. It turns out that I've been partly involved in -- intimately involved in building several kind of successful digital marketplaces since the dawn of the Internet as well. And it makes me excited. Let me just take through why. One, it's hyper-fragmented and locally distributed inventory on the supply side of the marketplace. Likewise, it's really fragmented on the renter or the demand side of the marketplace. Okay. Also, there is volatile pricing and volatile availability, which promotes market monitoring. So high engagement from both sides of the marketplace. Additionally, there is heavy shopper interest in content as both practical and for entertainment as part of the shopping process, which lends itself well to a digital marketplace. It's a very high gross margin, which we all, as investors, love. And finally, marketplaces have a positive network effect, which is more supply begets more demand, which begets more supply. So we're seeing all of those things in action here in our rental marketplace. We knew from the beginning that acquiring demand at a really reasonable price, basically near zero marginal expense, is key to making these kinds of marketplaces work, and that keeping the supply-side inventory acquisition costs very low was going to be key as well. And we feel very good on both of those. On the demand side, it's pretty simple. Zillow Rentals has kind of ridden the long and lovely coattails of the greater Zillow with our 200 million plus monthly uniques, and lots of them also interested in buying a home as well as renting. So we've been able to leverage that. And on the supply side, it took us many years of kind of toiling in the dark in the Longtail, where most of the rental inventory is in single-family homes in the Longtail. But now, after toiling for many years, we estimate we have about 60% of those, and they're unique. These are almost all listings that will only be showing up inside of Zillow Rentals, which is fantastic. So more recently, I'll hand it off to Jeremy here. We turned our guns to the kind of more obvious and more commodity apartments in tall buildings in cities market, you know, the Multifamily market. This is the market segment with real marketing budgets and professional managers. We have 40,000 buildings now. It's growing really rapidly. We love that. I'll -- why don't I? So I'll conclude by saying, yeah, we've got the expense of the supply side nailed and the inventory now kind of lit up, and we've certainly got the demand side in a terrific spot. And we're -- I'm personally excited to begin to really lean into this. Jeremy, do you want to chat a bit about Multifamily? All right. Thanks, everybody. Hey, look, it's noisy out there and there is a lot of confusion and there's a lot of distraction. And I'll tell you, we're calm. We're driving forward. We're putting up numbers. The product is getting better and better. And we have a long road ahead of us because of all of this incredible kind of pent-up potential transaction energy that lives inside of our wonderful marketplace. So you know, it's noisy, but we're feeling really good. Thanks for being on the road with us. We'll talk to you soon."

It's been an exciting few years at Zillow, and we're pleased with the progress we're making on our strategy to transform the way people buy, sell, rent and finance homes. Since 2022, we've been building the integrated transaction experience and testing it in our enhanced markets. Now we are pressing on the accelerator to increase our breadth of coverage across more markets and our depth of penetration in those markets, as we drive towards sustainable, profitable growth. Zillow's Housing Super app is the container into which we're continually adding updates and improvements guided by five for-sale growth pillars; touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network, and integrating our services. Our for-sale growth pillars mark the pathway to meeting our goals to grow customer transaction share from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025 and grow our revenue alongside that transaction share growth. I'll kick off our growth pillar update with touring and how we are integrating the anticipated rule changes coming from the NAR settlement into our customer experience. Touring is a critical focus area for us for two reasons. First, historically, the process of booking a home tour has been burdensome. Second, when a customer raises their hand to tour a home they've been looking at on Zillow, it's a strong signal of a serious intent to transact. Our touring products, powered by ShowingTime are meaningfully improving our ability to connect high-intent customers to our premier agent partners. As you may recall, touring connections convert at 3x the rate of other actions on Zillow. We're pleased to share that real-time touring is rolling out to an additional 34 markets by the end of May, which will bring us to a total of 124 markets. As we outlined in February, as we expand real-time touring, we expect it will account for approximately 20% of connections by the end of the year, and we are on track to deliver. One key provision of the proposed NAR settlement calls for more prominence of buyer agent agreements introduced at the time of the physical tour. Such agreements can help educate buyers about what services they're paying for, which is a good thing, and they have the added benefit of helping identify high intent buyers. In fact, we've been advocating for these agreements in our home state of Washington and across the country. By facilitating the use of consumer-friendly agreements earlier in the funnel, we see an opportunity to improve conversion rates. As an example, in Connecticut, where buyer agency agreements are required before taking a buyer on a tour, we've observed 20% higher conversion rates compared to our national average. We are testing buyer agreement product flows now within Zillow. And just this week, we launched a pilot of a consumer-friendly buyer agreement and our touring experience with a few 100 premier agent partners. Offering solutions digitally on Zillow is a natural and logical addition to the end-to-end experience we're providing customers and agents. Meanwhile, we are also enabling nearly limitless virtual touring that will continually get closer and closer to reality with our proprietary technology powering 3D home tours and showcase listings. Leveling up physical touring alongside our investment in virtual touring is a great combination for the industry benefiting all participants. I'll now move on to financing, another critical focus area for us because serving more high-intent customers with financing drives conversion and increases our addressable market. By integrating Zillow Home Loans with our Premier Agent partner network, we are providing a more seamless experience for customers, agents and loan officers. Our efforts to integrate financing throughout the customer journey have accelerated purchase mortgage growth with $601 million in purchase loan origination volume in Q1, a more than 130% year-over-year increase despite a persistently challenging mortgage rate environment. We expect continued purchase mortgage growth as we expand integration with Premier Agent partners and roll out more enhanced markets. Across the combined 13 enhanced markets we had at the end of Q1, Zillow Home Loans continues to see double-digit adoption rates, which contributes to growing revenue per transaction year-over-year. These signals reinforce our confidence that our strategy is working. And I'm pleased to share that this month we are expanding to a total of 19 enhanced markets and we are on track to reach our target of 40 by the end of the year. On the sell-side of the transaction, we continue to ramp up solutions that not only make selling a home easier but also create real value for sellers and their agents. I'll spend a minute on Listing Showcase specifically. Listing Showcase is our AI powered product that elevates agents' brand presence on Zillow and provides a better shopper experience through our homegrown rich media and floor plan technology. It's unlike anything else available today. We continue to be excited about Listing Showcase and the progress we are making across the country. Showcase listings drive higher engagement on Zillow compared to similar non-showcase listings, more views, more shares and more saves. But even more importantly, homes that list with Showcase are selling faster and for more money. Showcase listings typically sell for 2% more than similar non-showcase listings on Zillow, a bonus of $9,000 on the average home. Homes listed with Showcase are also 20% more likely to secure an accepted offer within 14 days. What's more, we've observed that agents who use Listing Showcase are winning 20% more listings, making it an attractive offering for real estate professionals. Listing showcase is currently available to agents in every market and we are actively working to reach 5% to 10% listing coverage, which represents a $150 million to $300 million annual revenue opportunity, and we believe there is potential for future growth beyond that. We are working to increase engagement with the best agents on both sides of the transaction, which leads me to our next growth pillar update, enhancing our partner network. As Rich highlighted earlier, Premier Agent partners represent the best of the industry, and we help them provide even better service to our shared customers to grow both their business and ours. We're excited that we continue to see transaction share gains across our 13 enhanced markets on a revenue per total transaction dollar basis. And now a couple of quarters after we closed our acquisition of Follow Up Boss, we're even more excited about the opportunity for further conversion gains from here. In addition to our five for-sale growth pillars, I want to turn the spotlight on to Rentals. Rentals is a fast growing business that represents nearly one-fifth of our total revenue with a lot of opportunity in front of it. To bring our great progress in Rentals out of the shadow of our first sale efforts, we've released a standalone investor presentation that provides a better understanding of what we've built, where we are headed and why we are so well-positioned to build a comprehensive two-sided marketplace that is unlike anything else in the industry today. Like, we do with all parts of Zillow, we start our Rentals' journey from the perspective of the consumer. In this case, the $17 million annual renters in the U.S., which is 3 times more movers than on the for-sale side. When renters search for a rental, they want the process to be enjoyable, trustworthy and easy, but instead, it's fragmented and frustrating. That's because no single platform provides a comprehensive marketplace with anywhere near complete coverage of available rental inventory. There is no MLS for rentals. This forces renters to shop across different platforms, each with varying levels of accuracy, transparency and selection, and encounter dead ends when searching for inventory. That fragmentation is the big problem and the big opportunity. Renters and property managers want and need one centralized place where they can see all the rental listings available. This is an incredibly simple and obvious concept, but an incredibly hard challenge. It's a challenge Zillow is best positioned to solve because of our success over many years of building great products for our massive audience of movers on the for-sale side. The early years of Zillow Rentals made clear that our customers wanted to come to us to shop for rentals. So in 2018, we turned our focus and ramped up our investment to build it out and create the richest most complete Rentals marketplace. We started with Longtail Rentals, which we define as less than 25 units, but primarily comprises single-family homes because data and interest in single-family was a core strength of Zillow. Because these properties were hard to find, this offered an opportunity for us to build a unique inventory asset. It may also come as a surprise to you, but Longtail Rentals are actually the majority of inventory in the Rentals market. Longtail Rentals are a classic go-to-market problem, small, fragmented and local. You simply cannot efficiently deploy a sales force to go out and find all the supply. Because Zillow was already the most trusted name in residential real estate, many of these Longtail property managers were already familiar with us, and asking for these solutions. Many of them may only own one or two homes. So they're looking for a product that gets their listings in front of the most potential tenants and makes renting out their properties easier. Today, our Longtail product experience is unmatched. On Zillow, renters can search, book tours, apply for properties, sign a lease and pay their rents securely, and apply for renters insurance. Similarly, Longtail property managers on Zillow can list, book tours, screen applicants, create leases, sign them electronically and collect rent payments. It's a true end-to-end solution that's highly useful to both renters and property managers alike. These investments in great products starting in 2018 powered Zillow to the top traffic ranking in rentals and made us the preferred brand for renters. Today, Zillow is the most searched rentals marketplace according to Google Trends, searched nearly 1.5 times more than the next company in the category, and we have the leading rentals traffic with very limited marketing spend. After our success in Longtail, in 2022, we turned our attention to the more commodity supply sub-segment of rentals Multifamily, big apartment buildings with 25 or more units. This is the easier-to-reach segment investors have historically thought of as the rentals category with professional property managers, who have marketing and software budgets to help them acquire renters and manage buildings. Since we turned our focus to the multifamily space, we have driven a 30% compounded annual growth rate in our Multifamily properties from 27,000 to 40,000 at the end of Q1, and a more than 30% CAGR in our Multifamily revenue on the back of just $15 million total marketing dollars spent on Zillow Rentals. Combining unique Longtail listings with more commodity Multifamily listings allows consumers a more seamless experience where they can see all types of available rental listings in one place and give Zillow a highly differentiated rentals marketplace experience in which we are now ramping up our investments. In addition, many movers are dual-track shopping, shopping for a home to buy while also considering their rental options. Zillow's integrated shopping experience and singular brand excels here. As it stands today, we estimate that Zillow has more than 50% of all rental listings in the country, more than any other site and many of them are unique to Zillow. But that still accounts for only 60% of all Longtail listings and 35% of Multifamily listings across the country. So we are investing in our Rentals products, services and sales to drive further growth. For example, in March, we entered into a strategic partnership with Realtor.com to provide all the Multifamily listings on their site and we recently launched our first national marketing campaign after a successful pilot last year in a few markets, which tested well to grow our audience. As with other parts of our business, 2024 is a year to scale up our breadth and depth in rentals to drive continued growth in listings, both Longtail and importantly, in Multifamily. With the largest audience of renters on the market, a 42% revenue CAGR since 2015 and a $1 billion plus revenue opportunity in front of us, Zillow Rentals is digitally organizing a large fragmented local marketplace highly valued by all participants. One quarter into the year, we are pleased with our execution and controlling what we can against a noisy external backdrop. And with that, I will now pass the microphone to Jeremy Hofmann, who will provide a closer look at our results. Yeah. Hey, Brad. It's Jeremy Wacksman. Yeah. As I said earlier, I mean, we see this as a great opportunity. What we're testing is post connection, right? So after a consumer has already requested or in the Real Time Touring case, booked a tour, can we help educate them and provide them a really consumer friendly digital education agreement. And we see that as better educating the customer and also expectation setting the customer for when they meet the agent as what to expect from the agent, both in that initial relationship, but in what they might expect in a buyer agency agreement generally. And anytime we can help educate a customer that typically leads to a higher quality customer for our agents. We've seen that as we've built things like Touring and Real Time Touring. And I gave this example earlier. In states that have been using agreements earlier in the funnel, you typically see higher conversion rates. The Connecticut example is a good one. 90% of buyers are using buyer's agents and the conversion rates are higher. So I think important to frame it in the context of this is down in the funnel once a customer has already raised their hand, really declared their intent, we work with them to make sure we're getting them to the right place. They've had this magical book a tour experience, and they're getting ready to go. And this is an additional education opportunity. It's not friction. Yeah. This is Jeremy. I'll hit both. I think it's optional, right? So it's not something that Zillow is required to do. That's why I said we see it as opportunity. It's an educational step. At some point in the experience, the agent is going to have a conversation with the customer about services and start an agreement and a relationship. We're trying to help facilitate that. So we don't expect any fall-off for friction because it's an optional experience. Now that said, we're prototyping and testing. We'll learn a lot as we work with our first couple hundred agent partners and customers and we'll iterate from there. So and then, to your second question. We see touring as again, as we've talked about for a while, it's the number one thing customers want to do. That's why we're so excited about it. It's why it's one of our growth pillars and one of the drivers of the performance gains we've seen in our enhanced markets to date and the overall share gains we expect to see as we roll out to more markets. Both -- that is both physical touring, which we've talked about here, and virtual touring, right? So getting customers a deeper sense of home, helping them figure out what they want to go see in person helps higher quality customers be more educated and informed when they raise their hand. That helps our agents win more of those customers when they meet them and drive transactions here. So we're excited about the opportunity, the changes, the evolution Rich talked about provide. This is one of the first ways in which we're trying to leverage and help make those marriages between consumers and agents happen. Yeah. We are really excited about our own homegrown 3D Tech. We're excited about virtual touring generally. We support Matterport today. It's a small percentage of listings today, and our 3D technology is on a small percentage of listings today. And that virtual touring capability is going to continue to grow as consumers discover, love it, and as we all improve our own technologies. So we're really happy with our home grown effort. And as you know, that is what powers Listing Showcase and all of the really unique interactive floor plan AI-generated listings. I talked about earlier that drive a ton more buyer engagement and are helping listings go pending and sell faster and sell for more money. So we love the investment that we're making here and we really see this as where the consumer experience is going. But it's early and all of us are small. And retraining the consumer to allow more touring in the virtual world, we think complements the physical touring investments we're making. Again, back to the earlier conversation. Helping consumers find what they want to buy, helping them dream and shop more online in our app, and getting them into the hands of our great agent partners. Yeah. I mean, I think the answer is similar to the framework you gave around it being a two-sided marketplace. We have been building the overall organic traffic and listings for the renter experience, and that's driven the demand side broadly. Now we're focusing in on increasing demand, more specifically in Multifamily. And you're seeing that both in our partnership with Realtor.com, and in our advertising campaign following a really successful test last year. And that's on the demand side of Rich's two-sided marketplace. And then the supply side is bringing those high-intent renters to the professionals Rich talked about and increasing our sales efforts to go help those folks connect with our renters and get their -- get what they need from their advertising dollars. So it is really about the flywheel Rich talked about and it's just the focus in on Multifamily, on both the demand side and the supply side that we're now turning more focus and energy to. Thanks, Ron. Yeah. I can hit Listing Showcase. Yeah. I mean, as I said earlier, we're really excited that the increased engagement from the buyers continues, right? So more page views, saves and shares as we get showcased out there more and more. We're also now seeing seller benefit, which I talked about. So homes are selling faster, 20% more likely to accept an offer in 14 days, and they're selling for more money, 2% more money. And most importantly, agents who are using Listing Showcase are winning more listings. So all that says to us that as we've been rolling this out and scaling this up and offering in more locations, we're seeing a really good product market fit, both with -- we knew with buyers, we're now seeing with sellers and with sellers agents. And that's why we're so excited about the intermediate-term goal we've talked to you all about and getting ourselves to 5% to 10% total active listings because then we think there's potentially more to do once this gets to that state. Not yet. I mean, we've talked to you all about it for a while now, but it's important to remember it's only been live for a couple quarters and it's only been live nationally since February. So, team has grown, as Jeremy talked about. We have staffed up sales folks to start to hit more coverage and talk to agents in more places. But, as much as we're excited about, as much as we see a really exciting product here, it is still really early in our journey. Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. I think on initial reception, we've been really pleased with the retention of the core customers of Follow Up Boss as we've gotten through closing and integration and starting to work together now for a couple quarters. And we're really pleased to just see the continued positive agent feedback on the Follow Up Boss product. I still get anecdotes all the time talking to agents about how much they love it and how much they're excited about our ability to help the Follow Up Boss team grow and invest more in this team focused CRM that they've built their business on. So we continue to be pleased with the post-close, post-acquisition performance of the Follow Up Boss agent base. And then on your second question, I would say it's still a lot of opportunity. I think you heard both me and Jeremy talk about in the prepared remarks. They're starting to ship things for all advertising partners or, sorry, all agent partners. And we're also starting to think about ways to help from your agent partners use Follow Up Boss to better convert their business, both their Zillow customers but their entire customers. So not too much more to share in terms of roadmap, but a whole lot of excited folks internally in both the Follow Up Boss team and our Zillow consumer and Zillow agent teams ideating and working together on how can we help our agents use technology to convert more customers and deliver better service. And we see a long road ahead for that initiative. This is Jeremy. I can hit that. I mean, I think, no, I think as Rich outlined earlier, we don't see a ton of revolutionary change here. We see more evolutionary change that results in more educated and more transparent consumers, which we see as leading to higher quality, higher intent leads and connections for our partners. And I think we're seeing that already start to play out in the early innings after all the news is cleared of how partners are processing connections and how they're learning to work with those consumers. And as I talked about, just take our Touring pilot here as an example of leaning in on consumer education in a consumer friendly way to help them understand what they're going to be dealing with. And in the states that have been doing that, we're seeing still fairly ubiquitous independent representation and higher conversion rates. So as folks like us and others roll out more buy-side agreements, again, back to our principles, we think a more educated consumer who can understand what they're getting from their representation that they choose and understanding that the compensation is fair and negotiable and can be negotiated, that leads to a better conversation with professionals. And we think that leads to our professionals, which as Rich talked about are a small subset of the most productive agents winning more business. And so, we see that anecdotally today and we see that in some of the states that we're further ahead on this today and we expect to see that continue as more folks rollout changes to deal with the evolution."
