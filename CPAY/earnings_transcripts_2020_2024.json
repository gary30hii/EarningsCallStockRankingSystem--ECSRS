        "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. \n I would like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations for FLEETCOR Technologies. Thank you. You may begin. \nJames Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Charles Freund, our CFO. Following the prepared comments, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then that you can get in line for questions. \n Please note, our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com. \n Now throughout this call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appear in today's press release and on our website, as previously described. \n Now before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everybody that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our recovery, outlook, new products and acquisitions and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. \n These expected results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC and available at sec.gov. \n With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? \nRonald F. Clarke: Okay. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q4 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects: First, I'll provide my take on our Q4 finish; second, I'll put a bow on full year 2020; third, I'll share our 2021 outlook; and lastly, provide a bit of an update on our transformation plan, which is intended to accelerate the company's growth. \n Okay. Let me turn to our Q4 results. So today, we reported revenue of $617 million, that's down 12%, and cash EPS of $3.01, that's down 5% versus last year. These results, both better than anticipated. Volume recovered a bit more in the quarter than we forecasted, and we did manage our operating expenses down 14% against the prior year. Organic revenue growth overall, minus 8%. But most importantly are the trends in Q4, really quite good sales strengthened to over 90% of last year's level. Same-store sales or client volume softness improved to minus 6%. Credit loss of $6 million, although helped by a reserve release, and retention continued steady at 92%. \n We did have a fantastic beyond highlight in Brazil in the quarter. We added 175,000 new urban or city users in Q4. That represents 30% of all the new tags we sold in the quarter. So it demonstrates there's real demand among the non-toll segment in Brazil for this RFID purchasing network, including fueling, parking and now even fast-food locations. \n So look, the conclusion of Q4 is really in the sequential trends of the business. If you look at Page 7 of our earnings supplement, you can see that every Q4 metric is improving from the Q2 low: Revenue up from $525 million to $617 million; cash EPS up $2.28 to $3.01; sales up from 55% to now over 90% of last year's level; same-store sales volume getting better from minus 17% to minus 6%; credit losses from $21 million to $6 million; and then lastly, retention holding steady at 92%. So to us, evidence that the business continues to recover from the earlier year lows. \n Okay. Over to 2020. So from a financial perspective, 2020, not our best year. Revenue finished at approximately $2.4 billion, that's down 10% versus '19, and cash EPS finishing at $11.09, down 6% against 2019. \n COVID and the shutdowns did manage to vanquish over $400 million of revenue that we planned in 2020 really in 3 ways. So first, client softness, we had a number of COVID-impacted clients that used less of our services. COVID reset the macro environment in Q2, driving down fuel prices and weakening international currencies. And then third, for a while, COVID reduced our 2020 new sales mostly due to the market being distracted. \n The good news is despite the fact that COVID is going on, that we're still living with COVID, is the financial impacts on us appear to be lessening. So we've now recovered in Q4 about half of the client softness, revenue loss that we experienced in Q2, so half of it back already. Post the macro reset, we've seen relative stability in fuel prices and FX rates. And lastly, the demand for our services, clearly recovering as sales reach 90% of prior year levels. \n So despite not having the greatest financial performance in 2020, we did manage to accomplish a few things. So credit, I'm just delighted with our credit performance in 2020. Expenses, tough times, but we did manage expenses down over 10% in Q2, 3 and 4. We signed 4 acquisitions in 2020. Our guys ran IT exceptionally well, had the best overall system uptime in the history of the company. \n And lastly, we were able to replan the business in the second half. We conducted a replanning exercise in the summer, and the actuals came in a smidge better than the replan. So reminds us again that fleet's a business you can plan. I really do want to give a shout-out to all FLEETCOR people who hung in there and kept the company going through very unsettling times. \n Okay. Let me make the turn to 2021 and outline our initial guidance for the year, along with the assumptions behind it. Clearly, a higher beta in our 2021 numbers. But we'd say that our setup is generally positive. So first, volume and revenue trends strengthening through 2020, so the potential to continue that into '21. Sales production improving, thus the amount we expect to get of the in-year revenue from new business. And as I mentioned a bit ago, very solid client retention and credit trends. \n We're also hopeful that we'll get additional client softness recovery in '21, although we're the first to admit that, that's hard to forecast. So in our guidance, we're planning to recover about 1/3 of our Q4 exit revenue softness that's still outstanding now. So if we get that, that recovery would provide about 4% to 5% of incremental revenue lift in the second half. \n So with that, our guidance for '21 would be as follows. Revenue of $2.650 billion at the midpoint, that reflects an 11% increase. Overall organic revenue in the same range, kind of 9% to 13%. But I do want to emphasize that, that assumes 3% to 4% of softness recovery from today's level. We're anticipating significant sales growth, over 30% this year, which would be a record level of sales for the company. And profit guide at the midpoint, $12.40 of cash EPS for the core business. We are planning about $0.10 of dilution from the Roger acquisition. So that would put our consolidated number at $12.30 at the midpoint. Lastly, assuming now a May 1 close for the AFEX acquisition, accretion could be approximately $0.20 for the year. So if that happens on time, that could take consolidated cash EPS to $12.50. Chuck will speak further about how the guidance rolls out across the quarters. But I do want to point out that our guidance outlooks Q2, 3 and 4, revenue and profit growth to be back into the high teens. \n Okay. Let me transition now to my last subjects, which is the company's transformation plan. So really, our transformation plan is intended to accelerate growth by doing 2 things. So first, the portfolio, deciding what businesses we want to be in and not be in and constantly reworking that to have a more diverse set of faster-growing businesses. But the second way we transform the company is through our Beyond strategy, which we do utilize in all 4 of our major existing businesses. So in this Beyond strategy, we're really trying to do 2 things. First, identify new segments of the market that we can extend the business into. So we ask who else can we serve. \n And then second, we identify additional or adjacent services that we can cross-sell back to the client base. So if you look at Page 11 of our earnings supplement, you'll see the current Beyond initiatives for each of our 4 businesses. \n We do continue to make progress against our Beyond strategy. Just an example to call out, in our lodging business in 2020, we now settled 25% of all proprietary hotel payments with our virtual card in which we earn interchange. So that's up from -- literally from 0 a few years ago. But today, we begin implementation of maybe our most exciting Beyond initiative of all with the acquisition of Roger. So this begins the move of our corporate payments business down market into the SMB space, along with the opportunity to offer full online bill pay to our global SMB fuel car base. You can see that on Pages 11 and 12 of our supplement. \n So this single bill pay initiative has the potential to dramatically accelerate growth rates in both our corporate pay and fuel card businesses. We feel like it's a pretty unique position that we're in because of the special set of assets that we have. So a large global SMB client base numbering in the hundreds of thousands. We've got working SMB sales channels that historically have acquired 30,000 new clients per quarter. We've got scaled virtual card processing capability. We generated over $30 billion in annualized spend last year. We've got a very large merchant database that allows us to monetize virtual card, and now we've got some modern cloud software to provide the bill pay functionality along with a pretty cool user interface. \n So look, in conclusion today, I'm hoping to provide just a few takeaways. So Q4, again, not our best quarter from an absolute perspective, but clear evidence of improving trends in the business. 2020, we did manage to perform better as the year went on and certainly learned some new tricks around how to manage credit, expenses, IT, even sales in a remote environment. '21, again, our setup, we think, looks pretty good, only a slightly unfavorable macro to deal with, but improving trends coming into the year. And certainly, the wildcard that I mentioned of what happens with the incremental softness recovery. And lastly, transformation, our Beyond strategy now progressing -- providing some traction. But today's online SMB bill pay initiative may be the biggest of them all. \n So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter and our outlook. Chuck? \nCharles Freund: Thanks, Ron. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of $617 million, down 12%, GAAP net income down 11% to $210 million and GAAP net income per diluted share down 6% to $2.44. The quarter was again affected by COVID-related business slowdowns, although we showed improvement over last quarter in most of our businesses. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased 10% to $258 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share decreased 5% to $3.01. We continue to manage expenses in line with revenue performance. Please see Exhibit 1 of our press release for a reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial metrics. \n Organic revenue in the quarter was down 8% overall, primarily due to same-store sales being down 6% year-over-year. Organic revenue neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads and includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed mid-period. Our fuel category was down organically about 10% versus Q4 last year. Our domestic fuel businesses were stable to improving in the quarter, whereas the international fuel businesses were affected by the renewed COVID-related closures, especially in Western Europe. \n The corporate payments category was down approximately 6% in the fourth quarter. Approximately 6 points of decline was again driven by the 100 most affected customers we discussed last quarter. Lower spending on our T&E product drove another 2 points of organic drag. \n Virtual card volumes were up 12% for the quarter, which was an improvement from flat last quarter as continued political spend and the benefit of new customers offset the drag from the highly affected customers. Cross-border or FX-related volumes were down 1% as payment volumes are still being affected by lower invoice levels, specifically in manufacturing and wholesale trade. Full AP continued to perform very well with volume up 14%. New sales of full AP were very strong as full year 2020 sales were more than double 2019's results. We continue to invest here and have enabled 10 new ERP integrations in 2020 with plans for another 10 or so in 2021. \n Tolls continued to be our most resilient business and grew organically 7% in the fourth quarter, up 4% from last quarter. Active toll tags were up 6% in the quarter, with urban tags accounting for 25% of all new tags sold during 2020. The lodging category was down 25% organically in the fourth quarter, with 20 points of drag caused by the inclusion of acquired airline lodging businesses in the year ago period. Our workforce lodging business has improved with volumes down in the mid-single digits. Airline lodging volumes have also improved in line with flight activity but still remain well below last year's levels. \n Looking further down the income statement. Our total operating expenses were down 14% for the fourth quarter of 2020 to $323 million. We performed in line with the high end of our target reduction compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume-related costs, lower employee-related costs, including head count, sales commissions, bonuses and stock compensation. We also saw lower T&E expenses in addition to the impact of foreign exchange rates. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 52.4%, a roughly 240-basis-point improvement from last quarter. \n Bad debt expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $6 million or 2 basis points, which includes a reserve release of $5 million. Bad debt was only 4 basis points, excluding the reserve release. Our bad debt levels continue to be good, and our aging roll rates remain very favorable. There is still uncertainty around the timing, level and duration of government stimulus and various responses to increasing COVID cases around the world. So that's still a consideration on our reserve. \n Interest expense decreased 13% to $30.3 million, driven primarily by decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt. This was partially offset by the impact of additional borrowing for share buybacks earlier in the year. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 20.3% with a reduction from last year driven primarily by incremental excess tax benefit on stock option exercises. \n Now turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $1.9 billion of total liquidity, consisting of available cash on the balance sheet and our undrawn revolver at quarter end. We ended the quarter just shy of $1.5 billion in total cash, of which approximately $542 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. We had $3.6 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $700 million borrowed in our securitization facility. We remain committed to a consistent program of capital allocation, using our free cash flow for acquisitions and buybacks. \n In the quarter, we repurchased roughly 181,000 shares in connection with employee sales. In total for 2020, we spent $850 million on share buybacks. We believe that we have ample liquidity to pursue any near-term M&A opportunities while still opportunistically buying back shares when it makes sense. For the quarter, we had approximately $23.4 million of capital expenditures, and we finished with a leverage ratio of 2.67x trailing 12-month EBITDA as of December 31. \n Now let me share some thoughts on our outlook. Looking ahead, we're expecting Q1 2020 adjusted net income per share to be between $2.60 and $2.80, which, at the midpoint, is approximately $0.31 or 10% lower than what we reported in Q4 of 2020. About half of the difference is attributable to revenue seasonality. You see, while some of our businesses like gift have seasonally strong fourth quarters, most of our businesses have seasonally weak first quarters. Of course, volume-related expenses will slightly offset this revenue seasonality impact. \n Roughly 1/3 of the difference is due to the normalization of certain expenses. For example, in Q4 of 2020, we released $5 million of our bad debt reserve, which we do not expect to repeat in Q1. As sales performance has continued to recover throughout 2020, we expect bad debt to gradually increase sequentially as those customers' balances age. Additionally, when the impact of the COVID-related shutdowns became clearer in 2020, we proactively reduced our annual incentive target payouts by 50% and accrued to those lower targets for the remainder of the year. As our business has recovered meaningfully, we plan to return incentive targets to 2021 to normal levels. We also expect our effective tax rate in Q1 of 2021 to be about 80 to 100 basis points higher than the rate we reported in Q4 of 2020. Lastly, the acquisition of Roger and incremental sales and marketing investments are slightly dilutive to the quarter sequentially. \n Now looking beyond Q1 to full year 2021, we feel it's important to help you understand how we're thinking about the outlook and providing some ranges around possible outcomes, even though those ranges are a bit wider than what they had been in the past. For 2021, we're guiding revenues to be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $11.90 and $12.70, inclusive of the Roger acquisition. We're still faced with substantial uncertainty regarding the pace of economic recovery and the impact it will have on our financial performance. That said, we've developed a 2021 budget which incorporates everything we know now, including revenue and expense run rates, current macro environmental factors, planned sales contributions and expected attrition impacts. In addition, our guidance assumes a continued rollout of the vaccines that will allow gradual volume and revenue improvement in the first half of the year with an acceleration in the back half of the year, as client softness and new sales performance improve sequentially. \n As I mentioned earlier, we expect several expense lines to normalize higher in 2021 compared with 2020. As our business recovers, stock and bonus accruals as well as sales commission expenses will be higher. T&E will rise as our salespeople get back on the road, and volume-related expenses will also rise with increased business activity. Bad debt expense is expected to normalize as we've reopened credit and our sales performance continues to improve. We're also making incremental investments in sales, marketing and IT to support our growth aspirations and to deliver a 2021 sales production plan that's more than 30% higher than 2020's results. \n We're extremely excited with the Roger acquisition, and a disproportionate share of our incremental sales and marketing investments will be directed towards that business. As such, the fully loaded acquisition will be an estimated $0.10 drag to adjusted net income per diluted share in 2021. As we've demonstrated time and again, we do take a balanced approach on expenses, and we'll adjust accordingly if we see revenues begin to deviate from our expectations. \n And lastly, we continue to work through the approvals on AFEX, which have been slowed by Brexit and virus-related shutdowns. While we still expect the deal to be accretive in 2021, we now believe it is more likely to close in Q2 versus our original expectation of Q1. And just for clarity, AFEX is not included in the guidance ranges I provided earlier. \n And now, operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks for all the color on the trends and the guidance. But just to drill down on the guidance a little bit. When I think about the ranges on the extreme ends, could you maybe, Charles, just talk about sort of what's baked into one end versus the other? \nCharles Freund: Yes. So appreciate you joining, and thanks for the question. So in terms of the high end, I'd say that, that would be a perfect scenario, right? So as Ron mentioned, we are assuming recovery in terms of the COVID softness that we've experienced. The timing and the magnitude of that is super hard to suggest. If it all came roaring back, if our sales were perfect, we maybe could get there. So it's a pretty broad range, as you can see. \n On the downside, I mean, who knows what's going to happen with COVID, right? So if things weren't to come back, it could be a problem. We just think -- we think that we're being reasonably optimistic in that regard given everything that the news says: The economy, the vaccines, the Biden administration mentioning things will be back in by Q3. So we're optimistic in that regard, but I'd say that the range is broad because we just really don't know. \nRonald F. Clarke: Sanjay, it's Ron. Let me just add on to Chuck's comment, which -- the second thing would be the sales. So we've got a pretty steep sales plan increase for '21. And so the amount of that, that we get in year in revenue, both the backlog and the pace at which that comes in, that will also have a pretty big swing on the range we gave. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Got it. And then Ron, you guys are obviously flushed with quite a bit of liquidity. I mean, as you sit here and you think about the next year, how do you envision utilizing it? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I think our philosophy, Sanjay, is kind of steady as she goes, right? Our first use is accretive acquisitions, and we're sitting here today with 3 or 4 interesting active deals in the pipeline. So that's always our first and highest use. And then to your point, given the leverage ratio and stuff, if our stock doesn't trade where we think it should, obviously, we've indicated we'll buy stock back. So acquisitions, one; and stock buybacks, depending on the price, two. \nOperator: Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: I want to say, I guess, the new sales were encouraging. Your reinstating guidance, that's also encouraging. Any way to think about the level of conservatism in the outlook? Kind of like what Sanjay was asking about the range, I think I understand it. But just I'm thinking there could be some pent-up demand on new sales. The trends are clearly improving. You're excited about this SMB bill pay, which makes some sense. So I'm just trying to understand conservatism versus maybe excitement about the chance to get back to double-digit plus growth here. \nRonald F. Clarke: Tien-Tsin, it's Ron. I'd say that we try to build these plans to what we call the most likely, right, and then figure out how wide a range around it. And so I think the confidence part comes from looking at the trends Q2, 3 and 4. I don't know if you picked it up in my remarks, but we've literally gotten half of it back between Q2 and Q4, which is obviously quite significant. And it's still a pretty big number, right, when you look at the total softness we had for all of 2020. So I'd say that there's no precision in this. We -- I think we caveat-ed this as many ways as we could about the wildcard of softness recovery. So I'd say that we provide ranges to try to keep it in the midpoint. So we don't know, but I'd say kind of at the midpoint guide are the most likely. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Okay. And you talked about with Roger bill pay being potentially pretty big from an opportunity standpoint. So what's the timetable or the steps to get to a point where it becomes needle-moving? What steps need to take place? What should we be tracking? \nCharles Freund: Yes. I mean, it's a great question. I'd say we'll probably -- they're obviously in the market on a stand-alone basis and even here in the U.S. So the first 2 things that we're on is: one, cross-selling that product back to our North America base; and then I'd say in 90 days, we should be launched with our own channels, our own digital, our own deal and phone people selling it to new prospects. So by the time we talk next time, we'll hopefully have some news for you. \nOperator: Our next question is from Steven Wald with Morgan Stanley. \nSteven Wald: Maybe just following up on Tien-Tsin's question on Roger and thinking about the investment. I was just curious if you could speak to the timing for the investment. It sounds like it might be somewhat front-loaded. And how you're thinking about that dilution as it's planned over -- I guess, relative to 1Q guide versus the full year? And then what that envisions for 2022, if you're able to sort of frame out the potential contribution from Roger? \nCharles Freund: Yes. So some of it is just obviously deal-related, right? We picked up their people, 50. So we've got some dilution happening immediately. We are investing, even in advance now, at the corporate level to support that acquisition as well as building out those sales channels. So we'll see that ramp up. \n In terms of the contribution for next year, I'd say we haven't fully modeled it yet. But it's roughly going to be still a little dilutive to kind of flat until we fully scale the channels. So we want to obviously see what works before we pour too much in. But nonetheless, I'd say that the things about -- it is a very small acquisition, $1 million-some-odd, a couple of million in terms of revenue. So it's got a long way to go, but we're pouring a lot of sales and marketing kind of upfront to get it going. \n It's a real bet for us. It was a real deal. We're investing to retain the people that are there because they've helped to build this product, and we're going to need their help to continue. So we've built some extra cost in there as well. So in terms of the magnitude of what it could be next year, it's really going to depend on how much more we pour into the investments. \nSteven Wald: I appreciate that. And then maybe just switching gears towards some of the things you outlined on Slide 11 and 12 with the Beyond strategies. I know you talked through a few of the main -- the key areas that you're directing investment. But clearly, it seems like the corporate payments and then layering that into the fuel business are a couple of the main areas beyond the toll business that has its own growth plan. I'm curious how you're thinking about the lodging business and investment dollar priorities coming out of the pandemic. Clearly, there are going to be some permanent behavior shifts, and I guess that one strikes me as probably the most obvious area. But I'm curious if you could sort of stack rank for us how you're thinking about Beyond as it relates to investment priorities. You've got a lot of liquidity, as has been pointed out. But certainly, there's got to be some level of priority that you guys are thinking of. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Steven, it's Ron again. So yes, I think you called it out right. Clearly, corporate pay would be one, and fuel would be 2 because of the size of the business, but it's still 40%, 50% of the company. \n In lodging, the one thing I would say is, remember, our FLEETCOR lodging business is workforce: Translation, blue-collar utility guys going to a new city, tree cutters cleaning up. And so that thing is way back. I mean, I looked at the January volume numbers earlier today, and I believe month-to-month, that thing is down 3% to 5% now year-over-year. And so that lodging business looks completely different than the kind of lodging business we people on this call are thinking about. \n So the airline part of that is a completely different call. To your point, that thing is running kind of 50% of volumes of a year ago. But that's the one, I'd say, has the snap, bounce back possibility. So we've cut -- took a ton of money out of that business, particularly out of the airline portion of the business, to kind of wait here to see if it's going to snap back. But it would be number three, but we still like it. I think we lay out on that Page 11, there's a couple of interesting verticals beyond workforce and beyond airline that we're looking at that we like a lot, that leverage everything we have, the systems, the network and stuff. \n So I want to be clear, we like that business, and we will keep investing. And we may buy some additional things in the business. Let me be clear: It's not white-collar T&E kind of a lodging business. \nOperator: Our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask about Brazil, and that was a pretty impressive statistic in terms of how many new users you're signing up. I wanted to ask about the merchant acceptance side of that equation. Do you kind of have what you need now to basically continue building out that product? Or is there a pipeline of new merchants or verticals in Brazil that you could see yourselves kind of getting involved with, along the lines of McDonald's or Petrobras or these other merchants you have great partnerships with? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Ramsey, that's a good question. I think we're mostly focused on the 3 or 4 city locations that we mentioned: fueling, parking, fast food and then condos, effectively access right for people back in the city. And so the plan, we put a fair amount of capital actually in the '21 plan to build out particularly the fueling footprint there because it's the biggest TAM, right? The dollars spent on fuel are massive. \n And so the bit of the delay was not only COVID, but our guys tinkered and came up with 2 or 3 different hardware-software configurations for the fueling locations that improve reliability like super high. So the car gets in, the thing knows it's the right car and doesn't make mistakes and to dramatically reduce the cost. And so that business is going to be on a super-duper, hurry-up drill even now, even in the first half of the year, trying to add stations across the board. So we should see those transaction counts, usage of the thing, grow a lot as we move into the second half. \nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. And then on a separate topic, I wanted to ask generally about the kind of credit aperture across your business and whether it's sort of opened back up again. I mean, obviously, it has to some degree. But was there a revenue headwind in the quarter from sort of tighter credit standards, given we're still in a challenging kind of macro environment? And how should we think about that in terms of maybe potentially even opening further as we go forward? Or is that largely -- kind of narrative largely sort of played out? \nRonald F. Clarke: Another good question. So I'll start the answer to that one of we overreacted, right? So when the thing happened, we kind of pulled pretty far back, which clearly reduced revenue. We even pulled back on existing accounts, right, trimming lines, accelerating payment terms and stuff. So we went at it pretty hard. And now we've reported out for the year. And I think Chuck even mentioned the forward roll rates, so we've got the, I think, the lowest credit loss, as low as I can remember, and certainly as the base is against spend. And so we rotated back. \n I'd say in the fuel card business, we are 100% back. So whatever credit policies we had pre-COVID, I'd say, if you went and looked at our fuel card businesses, we are right back to fully open, still balanced, but fully open. \n I'd say the one place where we're still being a little cautious is in the corporate pay. And the reason is the spend per client there is so significant, if you think about it. And so we're still being careful. There's certain industries sitting in the corporate pay space that have been pretty impacted. So I'd say we've moved that one back but still not all the way back because it's more high line, what we call internally, high-line risk of a couple of BKs for some significant amount of money. So I think there's still upside as we roll through '21, as those 3 or 4 industries were cautious on kind of come back. \nOperator: Our next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. \nDavid Togut: Just following up, Ron, on your comments on corporate pay. Can you give us some sense of the ranges you're thinking about for the T&E card for 2021? That seems to be the biggest swing factor within that business since most of the other categories are holding up reasonably well. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. David, good question. So the overall corporate pay business sitting inside the guidance we gave is high teens. So if you take the entire line of business sitting in our plans, we're out looking at high teens for that. I think inside of that, the T&E, which has now shrunk down, is probably in the mid- to high single digits. And if you remember, what we call kind of the multicard, kind of walk around plastics there that buy supplies, even fuel, and they're even used as P-Cards as a form of vendor payables, that line of business, that plastics or multicard, I think the last time I looked, is down to about 20% of it now being white-collar T&E, like us. \n And so fortunately, kind of 80% of that business is kind of okay. It's buying fuels. It's buying supplies. It's paying vendors. And so it's not going to decline, if you will. It's not going to drag down really the growth rate as much because it shrunk down in 2020. So fortunately, it will have less impact on the total corporate pay business this year. \nDavid Togut: Got it. And then just a final question on the gift card business. Is the view that you're going to hang on to that for quite some time, just given the cash that you generate from it, even though it appears to be a declining business? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I'd say the short answer to that is yes. So obviously, retail as a category was super impacted in 2020, brought our gift card business pretty far down at the opening kind of in Q2. Surprisingly, the thing has come back quite well. People still, obviously, if you look for the word gift cards, are still ordering gift cards. And the digital portion of those, David, has gone way crazy high. And we bought a business a year ago to help our retailers manage online, pretty timely as they've rotated over to more online sales. So surprisingly, that business is getting healthier from some of those digital initiatives. \n And so what I'd say is we'll kind of see how this year goes. Their plan is actually up, obviously, off of the softness for '21. So I think we're probably taking another peek at the business as we get late into this year. \nOperator: Our next question is from Pete Christiansen with Citigroup. \nPeter Christiansen: I'm just thinking through the incremental investment on some of the IT initiatives here. Can you give us some of the time tables for your key goals here? And have you considered whether or not, given that we are in a recovery year, that -- possibly accelerating some of those investments? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Pete, it's Ron. I'm not sure that we're accelerating through the recovery year. I think we're doing 2 things. One, we're trying to invest in projects that drive growth. So we've kept the capital plan kind of up a bit, $15 million, $20 million, Chuck, I think, over the prior year. \n And then second, we made a decision, Pete, to pour more money into, what we call, IT transformation or modernization, whatever the word is. So we're pretty hard on the trail of consolidating some of the apps, updating obviously some of the hardware and software and stuff. And so we're pouring money into simplifying kind of our technology footprint, while we're obviously still making investments in digital and things like Roger, new analytics packages, new mobile interfaces. So we're spending money on things that we should be but also on the transformation side. \nPeter Christiansen: That's helpful. And then, Ron, a little bit of a longer-term question here. The drumbeat on EVs has kind of picked up recently with Ford and GM making some announcements and the Biden administration looking to switch over the federal fleet. I mean, does this change how you think about the fuel card business longer term and perhaps on how FLEETCOR intends to manage any broader changes industry-wise there? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, I think, Pete, a bit, I think we've been on for all kinds of reasons, not only EV but just TAM and growth rate and long-term potential of the company of diversifying things that we do that share the same model. And so I don't know where we're at, 60% now, I guess. So we're moving anyway. But I said a little bit in the call the last time on the EV thing that our perspective on the thing is: a, it's way farther out, even if the acceleration of EV sales is pretty dramatic because of the size of the installed base and the useful life. Our models show the same number of commercial vehicles, the combustion engine vehicles in 10 years here in the U.S. and in the U.K., our 2 biggest markets in 10 years as today because of the growth rate of sales and again over the life. \n But the more important point I mentioned last time is, it's less about the fuel card buying fuel or the fleet card buying electricity. I think what we're learning, particularly in Europe and in the U.K., is we're getting paid by our clients as they move to some EV. They're paying us card fees, for example, for the EV vehicle the same way. And there's this new opportunity of, we're going from, call it, 150,000 gas stations in the United States to having millions of charging points at employees' homes. And so the employers look like they want us to play a role in the hardware and software and the measuring of all of those new charge points and all the reimbursement. \n And so it's early days. But I'd say to you guys that doing what we do of measuring and helping pay and reimburse employee expenditures in and around vehicles, we think we're still going to get paid a fair amount of money both in the transition to mixed fleet and even when people get over to EV. So we're going to have a little bit of a teach-in maybe in 90 days on this subject, with the takeaway hopefully being: a, it's way long or out there for the old combustion engine; and b, what FLEETCOR's economics may look like even in a pure EV world. \nOperator: Our next question is from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. \nAshish Sabadra: Congrats on a pretty good result, considering the difficult macro environment we are in. My question was on the sales front, pretty good acceleration there, going back to 92%. You called out full AP sales doubled. I was wondering if you can also talk about the sales growth in other segments. And also, as we think about next year on a 30% -- expectation for a 30% higher sales compared to this year, areas where we can see more strength. I guess SMB bill pay will definitely be one of the areas, but any incremental color will be helpful. \nCharles Freund: Ashish, this is Charles. So yes, in terms of the sales performance, as Ron had mentioned, we exited Q4 at over 90% of the prior year. It is mixed. So I'd say Brazil had an unbelievable sales year. Overall, in the fourth quarter, really outperformed versus prior year. So they were well up -- well above, call it, 15-or-so-percent above last year. There's still a couple of the businesses that are lagging a bit. And particularly, our North America fuel business is still catching up. It's on an upward swing, but it just hasn't recovered quite as quickly. Our lodging business has actually come in kind of right around last year. So that's performed okay. \n So it's mixed, I'd say. But nonetheless, they've all kind of come back from Q2 through Q3 and exiting Q4 at a better place. And looking forward to next year, we've got pretty robust ambitions and plans. We're going to have the -- we have the biggest sales plan in the company's history, and we're planning to be up 30% versus where we finished this year. So we've got a lot to do. We're pretty excited about the possibility there. \nRonald F. Clarke: Ashish, it's Ron. Just to jump on to what Chuck said. One of the things helping us is the market is kind of coming back, right? We study surges of the categories. And so some of the results we're reporting Q4 is the world just kind of getting used to this and kind of getting on with things. And so we think as that keeps moving our way, where businesses are interested in the kind of things we do, that, that helps. And then, b, of course, we're going to invest more, right? We're going to have more FTEs, more digital spend. We've got some new products that we've talked about. So we're super excited. I mean, first of all, we've got super soft comps in Q2 when sales almost closed down. \n And so to Chuck's point, this is a super big deal for '22. I know most people on the call are interested in this year, in '21. But my headline to you guys is that if we make the sales plan, which is super big, both against the prior year and absolute, it's -- that will pour all kinds of revenue into '22, which is part of the softness that we're dealing with here in '21, right, that we basically took a 1.5 quarters out of selling. And so you don't get the same wave of revenue rolling into the forward year. So I just don't want people to miss the importance of the sales plan for next year. \nCharles Freund: I'd also just comment that when COVID hit and we took our foot off the accelerator in certain areas, right, because we weren't going to pour incremental sales investment when the market wasn't listening and they were distracted, so we slowed down some of those incremental investments. We're shifting gears now in preparation for a big year next year and the reopening of the economy, fingers crossed. And so we're investing ahead of that. And I think that's also putting a little pressure on our forward guidance in terms of earnings, right? Because we're making sales investments again in a big way. So I think we should be mindful of that. \nAshish Sabadra: Yes. No, that's very helpful color. Sorry. Just maybe a follow-up question on the SMB bill pay opportunity. Obviously, that's a large opportunity. A lot of players are going after it. And congrats on the Roger AI acquisition. So I was just -- maybe a follow-up question to earlier questions there. You obviously have a very warm lead, which positions you much better. But can you just talk about how long are those sales cycles, implementation times? And how do you plan to leverage your existing sales force and the warm leads that you have to maybe accelerate and double down on that opportunity? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Ashish, another super good question. So one of the attractive things about the SMB bill pay is what you said, it's the instamatic sale and sign up and get going. The card business that we have today, which is in the middle market, has a pretty prolonged kind of implementation cycle. It's almost like a project to get a $200 million company to connect with you and get the merchants in place and all that kind of stuff. And so the first good news is that sales and revenue will be more connected in the SMB corporate pay business than they are in the middle market. \n And I think the point that -- the question you asked, the point that we make is a super good one, which is the missing capability, I think Napoli asked me this in the last call, but I couldn't tell them, \"Hey, Ron, what are you missing to really be a gorilla here in corporate pay?\" And I didn't want to say, the answer is an SMB killer software app that works for the little company because we have the rest of the stuff. We acquire tons of clients with our sales channels. We've got capital. We've got processing capability. We've got the merchant networks to monetize. So we -- obviously, clients, the sell-up they do, they'll listen to us. \n And so unlike Roger, when I met the principals there who were kind of on the road with a super good product kind of hanging out on their own, you take their super good product and you embed it into these sets of things we have. I mean, we are -- I said it, half kiddingly in the remarks that this could be kind of the biggest deal of all because finally, we have a product that matches up with some of our capabilities. I mean, no one ever asked me before, but how funny that FLEETCOR built the corporate payments business in the middle market when the whole company was an SMB company. And so it just took us a while to pair up the corporate payments business with the business that we built over the last 20 years. \n And so the headline is, we've arrived. We have it. So I think without getting way over the skis here that this is a super big deal directionally for the company over the next 3 to 5 years of just building this thing out, where both walk-around plastic and payables sit inside the same client, where we stitch together effectively our fuel card business and our corporate payments business in the same client. It's not a small idea in our mind. It's a big idea. \nOperator: Our next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. \nRobert Napoli: Appreciate the call-out there, Ron. Just a quick question, I know we're getting at the end here. But the sales -- the increase in sales investment that you're making in, is this something that is onetime in nature? Or is the idea here in conjunction with your transformation to accelerate growth, increase investment in sales that will ramp up the sales growth rate over the long term and in line with the transformation, focusing on the higher growth product lines? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes is the short answer. The increment is recurring. And then if you looked at our 3-year plans, you'd see a similar kind of increase, 15% plus in sales in our '22 plans. So yes, it's recurring. \n And I'd say the second part is it does come in a couple of forms. It comes in: a, the old fashion form of just more scale, so more outbound phone callers, more field people, more digital, Google search keywords. \n But I'd say that the nuance that's different is we're going to make more investments kind of in digital, kind of at the top of the funnel. So we're going to spend more money to create more engagement as we have this broader product set now. And so having more things to sell, I think, allows us to spend some money earlier in people's decision cycle than at the end. So we tested that in Q4 last year, and it's working. And so that's some decent part of the step-up in '21, kind of a different kind of spend, Bob, for us than historically. \nOperator: Our next question is from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. \nTrevor Williams: I just wanted to ask on expenses. So just maybe for Charles, regardless of where you end up in the organic range, I mean, should we expect expense growth really to look similar to whatever you end up doing on the top line? Or could there be a level at which you might start to see a little bit more op leverage? So I'm just trying to think about how much we could see flow through to earnings if you do get a big snapback in volumes in the second half. \nCharles Freund: Yes. So I think when you look at our Q1 guidance, you see a bit of a reset of certain line items, whether it's the bad debt reserve or our anticipation of bad debt kind of eking out through the quarters and commensurate with our sales performance. Some of the snapback in terms of T&E, right? When the world opens up, are people going to travel like others do? Our bonus accruals and such. There's kind of like a re-level-set in this Q1 and then moving forward from there. So that's part of it. \n To your point, though, when the volume does come back that's COVID-related and that revenue does pour in, it will come in at a higher margin level. But offsetting that are some of these incremental investments that Ron mentioned, right? We're layering in more sales and marketing for our core products. We're hiring in a lot of sales and marketing for Roger and our cross-sell efforts. So I'd say it's going to be pretty balanced in my view as we go through the quarters of the year. \nTrevor Williams: Okay. Got it. That's really helpful. And then just a quick clarification on the guide. I mean, it looks like you're implying the share count to be roughly flat year-over-year, so really no buybacks baked in, at least to the earnings guide. So just curious if there's any reason in particular why we shouldn't expect you to be buying back stock next year? Or if there's just some element of conservatism that's baked in there? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. It's Ron. So clearly, we build plans in terms of our capital allocation as though we're going to basically retire debt, right, take the principal down. And so to your point, to the extent the capital allocation results in another transaction, another acquisition where we buy earnings, or b, we buy back stock, to your point, the capital allocation can take up our earnings. So the guidance that we have now assumes that the roughly $1 billion of cash flow would basically retire debt during the year, which my guess is that I'm hoping to a year from today, Trevor, that's not what we do, to your point, the next 12 months. But since those 2 decisions are in the future, we plan what we know, which is to pay down debt. \nOperator: I believe this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back over to management for closing remarks. \nJames Eglseder: Yes. Thanks, everybody. Apologize if we didn't get to your question, but let us know if you have any incremental questions. And we look forward to working together in the quarter. That's all. \nOperator: This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Charles Freund",
            "content": "Thanks, Ron. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of $617 million, down 12%, GAAP net income down 11% to $210 million and GAAP net income per diluted share down 6% to $2.44. The quarter was again affected by COVID-related business slowdowns, although we showed improvement over last quarter in most of our businesses. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased 10% to $258 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share decreased 5% to $3.01. We continue to manage expenses in line with revenue performance. Please see Exhibit 1 of our press release for a reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial metrics. \n Organic revenue in the quarter was down 8% overall, primarily due to same-store sales being down 6% year-over-year. Organic revenue neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads and includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed mid-period. Our fuel category was down organically about 10% versus Q4 last year. Our domestic fuel businesses were stable to improving in the quarter, whereas the international fuel businesses were affected by the renewed COVID-related closures, especially in Western Europe. \n The corporate payments category was down approximately 6% in the fourth quarter. Approximately 6 points of decline was again driven by the 100 most affected customers we discussed last quarter. Lower spending on our T&E product drove another 2 points of organic drag. \n Virtual card volumes were up 12% for the quarter, which was an improvement from flat last quarter as continued political spend and the benefit of new customers offset the drag from the highly affected customers. Cross-border or FX-related volumes were down 1% as payment volumes are still being affected by lower invoice levels, specifically in manufacturing and wholesale trade. Full AP continued to perform very well with volume up 14%. New sales of full AP were very strong as full year 2020 sales were more than double 2019's results. We continue to invest here and have enabled 10 new ERP integrations in 2020 with plans for another 10 or so in 2021. \n Tolls continued to be our most resilient business and grew organically 7% in the fourth quarter, up 4% from last quarter. Active toll tags were up 6% in the quarter, with urban tags accounting for 25% of all new tags sold during 2020. The lodging category was down 25% organically in the fourth quarter, with 20 points of drag caused by the inclusion of acquired airline lodging businesses in the year ago period. Our workforce lodging business has improved with volumes down in the mid-single digits. Airline lodging volumes have also improved in line with flight activity but still remain well below last year's levels. \n Looking further down the income statement. Our total operating expenses were down 14% for the fourth quarter of 2020 to $323 million. We performed in line with the high end of our target reduction compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume-related costs, lower employee-related costs, including head count, sales commissions, bonuses and stock compensation. We also saw lower T&E expenses in addition to the impact of foreign exchange rates. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 52.4%, a roughly 240-basis-point improvement from last quarter. \n Bad debt expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $6 million or 2 basis points, which includes a reserve release of $5 million. Bad debt was only 4 basis points, excluding the reserve release. Our bad debt levels continue to be good, and our aging roll rates remain very favorable. There is still uncertainty around the timing, level and duration of government stimulus and various responses to increasing COVID cases around the world. So that's still a consideration on our reserve. \n Interest expense decreased 13% to $30.3 million, driven primarily by decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt. This was partially offset by the impact of additional borrowing for share buybacks earlier in the year. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 20.3% with a reduction from last year driven primarily by incremental excess tax benefit on stock option exercises. \n Now turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $1.9 billion of total liquidity, consisting of available cash on the balance sheet and our undrawn revolver at quarter end. We ended the quarter just shy of $1.5 billion in total cash, of which approximately $542 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. We had $3.6 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $700 million borrowed in our securitization facility. We remain committed to a consistent program of capital allocation, using our free cash flow for acquisitions and buybacks. \n In the quarter, we repurchased roughly 181,000 shares in connection with employee sales. In total for 2020, we spent $850 million on share buybacks. We believe that we have ample liquidity to pursue any near-term M&A opportunities while still opportunistically buying back shares when it makes sense. For the quarter, we had approximately $23.4 million of capital expenditures, and we finished with a leverage ratio of 2.67x trailing 12-month EBITDA as of December 31. \n Now let me share some thoughts on our outlook. Looking ahead, we're expecting Q1 2020 adjusted net income per share to be between $2.60 and $2.80, which, at the midpoint, is approximately $0.31 or 10% lower than what we reported in Q4 of 2020. About half of the difference is attributable to revenue seasonality. You see, while some of our businesses like gift have seasonally strong fourth quarters, most of our businesses have seasonally weak first quarters. Of course, volume-related expenses will slightly offset this revenue seasonality impact. \n Roughly 1/3 of the difference is due to the normalization of certain expenses. For example, in Q4 of 2020, we released $5 million of our bad debt reserve, which we do not expect to repeat in Q1. As sales performance has continued to recover throughout 2020, we expect bad debt to gradually increase sequentially as those customers' balances age. Additionally, when the impact of the COVID-related shutdowns became clearer in 2020, we proactively reduced our annual incentive target payouts by 50% and accrued to those lower targets for the remainder of the year. As our business has recovered meaningfully, we plan to return incentive targets to 2021 to normal levels. We also expect our effective tax rate in Q1 of 2021 to be about 80 to 100 basis points higher than the rate we reported in Q4 of 2020. Lastly, the acquisition of Roger and incremental sales and marketing investments are slightly dilutive to the quarter sequentially. \n Now looking beyond Q1 to full year 2021, we feel it's important to help you understand how we're thinking about the outlook and providing some ranges around possible outcomes, even though those ranges are a bit wider than what they had been in the past. For 2021, we're guiding revenues to be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $11.90 and $12.70, inclusive of the Roger acquisition. We're still faced with substantial uncertainty regarding the pace of economic recovery and the impact it will have on our financial performance. That said, we've developed a 2021 budget which incorporates everything we know now, including revenue and expense run rates, current macro environmental factors, planned sales contributions and expected attrition impacts. In addition, our guidance assumes a continued rollout of the vaccines that will allow gradual volume and revenue improvement in the first half of the year with an acceleration in the back half of the year, as client softness and new sales performance improve sequentially. \n As I mentioned earlier, we expect several expense lines to normalize higher in 2021 compared with 2020. As our business recovers, stock and bonus accruals as well as sales commission expenses will be higher. T&E will rise as our salespeople get back on the road, and volume-related expenses will also rise with increased business activity. Bad debt expense is expected to normalize as we've reopened credit and our sales performance continues to improve. We're also making incremental investments in sales, marketing and IT to support our growth aspirations and to deliver a 2021 sales production plan that's more than 30% higher than 2020's results. \n We're extremely excited with the Roger acquisition, and a disproportionate share of our incremental sales and marketing investments will be directed towards that business. As such, the fully loaded acquisition will be an estimated $0.10 drag to adjusted net income per diluted share in 2021. As we've demonstrated time and again, we do take a balanced approach on expenses, and we'll adjust accordingly if we see revenues begin to deviate from our expectations. \n And lastly, we continue to work through the approvals on AFEX, which have been slowed by Brexit and virus-related shutdowns. While we still expect the deal to be accretive in 2021, we now believe it is more likely to close in Q2 versus our original expectation of Q1. And just for clarity, AFEX is not included in the guidance ranges I provided earlier. \n And now, operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. Yes. So appreciate you joining, and thanks for the question. So in terms of the high end, I'd say that, that would be a perfect scenario, right? So as Ron mentioned, we are assuming recovery in terms of the COVID softness that we've experienced. The timing and the magnitude of that is super hard to suggest. If it all came roaring back, if our sales were perfect, we maybe could get there. So it's a pretty broad range, as you can see. \n On the downside, I mean, who knows what's going to happen with COVID, right? So if things weren't to come back, it could be a problem. We just think -- we think that we're being reasonably optimistic in that regard given everything that the news says: The economy, the vaccines, the Biden administration mentioning things will be back in by Q3. So we're optimistic in that regard, but I'd say that the range is broad because we just really don't know. Yes. I mean, it's a great question. I'd say we'll probably -- they're obviously in the market on a stand-alone basis and even here in the U.S. So the first 2 things that we're on is: one, cross-selling that product back to our North America base; and then I'd say in 90 days, we should be launched with our own channels, our own digital, our own deal and phone people selling it to new prospects. So by the time we talk next time, we'll hopefully have some news for you. Yes. So some of it is just obviously deal-related, right? We picked up their people, 50. So we've got some dilution happening immediately. We are investing, even in advance now, at the corporate level to support that acquisition as well as building out those sales channels. So we'll see that ramp up. \n In terms of the contribution for next year, I'd say we haven't fully modeled it yet. But it's roughly going to be still a little dilutive to kind of flat until we fully scale the channels. So we want to obviously see what works before we pour too much in. But nonetheless, I'd say that the things about -- it is a very small acquisition, $1 million-some-odd, a couple of million in terms of revenue. So it's got a long way to go, but we're pouring a lot of sales and marketing kind of upfront to get it going. \n It's a real bet for us. It was a real deal. We're investing to retain the people that are there because they've helped to build this product, and we're going to need their help to continue. So we've built some extra cost in there as well. So in terms of the magnitude of what it could be next year, it's really going to depend on how much more we pour into the investments. Ashish, this is Charles. So yes, in terms of the sales performance, as Ron had mentioned, we exited Q4 at over 90% of the prior year. It is mixed. So I'd say Brazil had an unbelievable sales year. Overall, in the fourth quarter, really outperformed versus prior year. So they were well up -- well above, call it, 15-or-so-percent above last year. There's still a couple of the businesses that are lagging a bit. And particularly, our North America fuel business is still catching up. It's on an upward swing, but it just hasn't recovered quite as quickly. Our lodging business has actually come in kind of right around last year. So that's performed okay. \n So it's mixed, I'd say. But nonetheless, they've all kind of come back from Q2 through Q3 and exiting Q4 at a better place. And looking forward to next year, we've got pretty robust ambitions and plans. We're going to have the -- we have the biggest sales plan in the company's history, and we're planning to be up 30% versus where we finished this year. So we've got a lot to do. We're pretty excited about the possibility there. I'd also just comment that when COVID hit and we took our foot off the accelerator in certain areas, right, because we weren't going to pour incremental sales investment when the market wasn't listening and they were distracted, so we slowed down some of those incremental investments. We're shifting gears now in preparation for a big year next year and the reopening of the economy, fingers crossed. And so we're investing ahead of that. And I think that's also putting a little pressure on our forward guidance in terms of earnings, right? Because we're making sales investments again in a big way. So I think we should be mindful of that. Yes. So I think when you look at our Q1 guidance, you see a bit of a reset of certain line items, whether it's the bad debt reserve or our anticipation of bad debt kind of eking out through the quarters and commensurate with our sales performance. Some of the snapback in terms of T&E, right? When the world opens up, are people going to travel like others do? Our bonus accruals and such. There's kind of like a re-level-set in this Q1 and then moving forward from there. So that's part of it. \n To your point, though, when the volume does come back that's COVID-related and that revenue does pour in, it will come in at a higher margin level. But offsetting that are some of these incremental investments that Ron mentioned, right? We're layering in more sales and marketing for our core products. We're hiring in a lot of sales and marketing for Roger and our cross-sell efforts. So I'd say it's going to be pretty balanced in my view as we go through the quarters of the year."

            "name": "Ronald F. Clarke",
            "content": "Okay. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q4 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects: First, I'll provide my take on our Q4 finish; second, I'll put a bow on full year 2020; third, I'll share our 2021 outlook; and lastly, provide a bit of an update on our transformation plan, which is intended to accelerate the company's growth. \n Okay. Let me turn to our Q4 results. So today, we reported revenue of $617 million, that's down 12%, and cash EPS of $3.01, that's down 5% versus last year. These results, both better than anticipated. Volume recovered a bit more in the quarter than we forecasted, and we did manage our operating expenses down 14% against the prior year. Organic revenue growth overall, minus 8%. But most importantly are the trends in Q4, really quite good sales strengthened to over 90% of last year's level. Same-store sales or client volume softness improved to minus 6%. Credit loss of $6 million, although helped by a reserve release, and retention continued steady at 92%. \n We did have a fantastic beyond highlight in Brazil in the quarter. We added 175,000 new urban or city users in Q4. That represents 30% of all the new tags we sold in the quarter. So it demonstrates there's real demand among the non-toll segment in Brazil for this RFID purchasing network, including fueling, parking and now even fast-food locations. \n So look, the conclusion of Q4 is really in the sequential trends of the business. If you look at Page 7 of our earnings supplement, you can see that every Q4 metric is improving from the Q2 low: Revenue up from $525 million to $617 million; cash EPS up $2.28 to $3.01; sales up from 55% to now over 90% of last year's level; same-store sales volume getting better from minus 17% to minus 6%; credit losses from $21 million to $6 million; and then lastly, retention holding steady at 92%. So to us, evidence that the business continues to recover from the earlier year lows. \n Okay. Over to 2020. So from a financial perspective, 2020, not our best year. Revenue finished at approximately $2.4 billion, that's down 10% versus '19, and cash EPS finishing at $11.09, down 6% against 2019. \n COVID and the shutdowns did manage to vanquish over $400 million of revenue that we planned in 2020 really in 3 ways. So first, client softness, we had a number of COVID-impacted clients that used less of our services. COVID reset the macro environment in Q2, driving down fuel prices and weakening international currencies. And then third, for a while, COVID reduced our 2020 new sales mostly due to the market being distracted. \n The good news is despite the fact that COVID is going on, that we're still living with COVID, is the financial impacts on us appear to be lessening. So we've now recovered in Q4 about half of the client softness, revenue loss that we experienced in Q2, so half of it back already. Post the macro reset, we've seen relative stability in fuel prices and FX rates. And lastly, the demand for our services, clearly recovering as sales reach 90% of prior year levels. \n So despite not having the greatest financial performance in 2020, we did manage to accomplish a few things. So credit, I'm just delighted with our credit performance in 2020. Expenses, tough times, but we did manage expenses down over 10% in Q2, 3 and 4. We signed 4 acquisitions in 2020. Our guys ran IT exceptionally well, had the best overall system uptime in the history of the company. \n And lastly, we were able to replan the business in the second half. We conducted a replanning exercise in the summer, and the actuals came in a smidge better than the replan. So reminds us again that fleet's a business you can plan. I really do want to give a shout-out to all FLEETCOR people who hung in there and kept the company going through very unsettling times. \n Okay. Let me make the turn to 2021 and outline our initial guidance for the year, along with the assumptions behind it. Clearly, a higher beta in our 2021 numbers. But we'd say that our setup is generally positive. So first, volume and revenue trends strengthening through 2020, so the potential to continue that into '21. Sales production improving, thus the amount we expect to get of the in-year revenue from new business. And as I mentioned a bit ago, very solid client retention and credit trends. \n We're also hopeful that we'll get additional client softness recovery in '21, although we're the first to admit that, that's hard to forecast. So in our guidance, we're planning to recover about 1/3 of our Q4 exit revenue softness that's still outstanding now. So if we get that, that recovery would provide about 4% to 5% of incremental revenue lift in the second half. \n So with that, our guidance for '21 would be as follows. Revenue of $2.650 billion at the midpoint, that reflects an 11% increase. Overall organic revenue in the same range, kind of 9% to 13%. But I do want to emphasize that, that assumes 3% to 4% of softness recovery from today's level. We're anticipating significant sales growth, over 30% this year, which would be a record level of sales for the company. And profit guide at the midpoint, $12.40 of cash EPS for the core business. We are planning about $0.10 of dilution from the Roger acquisition. So that would put our consolidated number at $12.30 at the midpoint. Lastly, assuming now a May 1 close for the AFEX acquisition, accretion could be approximately $0.20 for the year. So if that happens on time, that could take consolidated cash EPS to $12.50. Chuck will speak further about how the guidance rolls out across the quarters. But I do want to point out that our guidance outlooks Q2, 3 and 4, revenue and profit growth to be back into the high teens. \n Okay. Let me transition now to my last subjects, which is the company's transformation plan. So really, our transformation plan is intended to accelerate growth by doing 2 things. So first, the portfolio, deciding what businesses we want to be in and not be in and constantly reworking that to have a more diverse set of faster-growing businesses. But the second way we transform the company is through our Beyond strategy, which we do utilize in all 4 of our major existing businesses. So in this Beyond strategy, we're really trying to do 2 things. First, identify new segments of the market that we can extend the business into. So we ask who else can we serve. \n And then second, we identify additional or adjacent services that we can cross-sell back to the client base. So if you look at Page 11 of our earnings supplement, you'll see the current Beyond initiatives for each of our 4 businesses. \n We do continue to make progress against our Beyond strategy. Just an example to call out, in our lodging business in 2020, we now settled 25% of all proprietary hotel payments with our virtual card in which we earn interchange. So that's up from -- literally from 0 a few years ago. But today, we begin implementation of maybe our most exciting Beyond initiative of all with the acquisition of Roger. So this begins the move of our corporate payments business down market into the SMB space, along with the opportunity to offer full online bill pay to our global SMB fuel car base. You can see that on Pages 11 and 12 of our supplement. \n So this single bill pay initiative has the potential to dramatically accelerate growth rates in both our corporate pay and fuel card businesses. We feel like it's a pretty unique position that we're in because of the special set of assets that we have. So a large global SMB client base numbering in the hundreds of thousands. We've got working SMB sales channels that historically have acquired 30,000 new clients per quarter. We've got scaled virtual card processing capability. We generated over $30 billion in annualized spend last year. We've got a very large merchant database that allows us to monetize virtual card, and now we've got some modern cloud software to provide the bill pay functionality along with a pretty cool user interface. \n So look, in conclusion today, I'm hoping to provide just a few takeaways. So Q4, again, not our best quarter from an absolute perspective, but clear evidence of improving trends in the business. 2020, we did manage to perform better as the year went on and certainly learned some new tricks around how to manage credit, expenses, IT, even sales in a remote environment. '21, again, our setup, we think, looks pretty good, only a slightly unfavorable macro to deal with, but improving trends coming into the year. And certainly, the wildcard that I mentioned of what happens with the incremental softness recovery. And lastly, transformation, our Beyond strategy now progressing -- providing some traction. But today's online SMB bill pay initiative may be the biggest of them all. \n So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter and our outlook. Chuck? Sanjay, it's Ron. Let me just add on to Chuck's comment, which -- the second thing would be the sales. So we've got a pretty steep sales plan increase for '21. And so the amount of that, that we get in year in revenue, both the backlog and the pace at which that comes in, that will also have a pretty big swing on the range we gave. Yes. I think our philosophy, Sanjay, is kind of steady as she goes, right? Our first use is accretive acquisitions, and we're sitting here today with 3 or 4 interesting active deals in the pipeline. So that's always our first and highest use. And then to your point, given the leverage ratio and stuff, if our stock doesn't trade where we think it should, obviously, we've indicated we'll buy stock back. So acquisitions, one; and stock buybacks, depending on the price, two. Tien-Tsin, it's Ron. I'd say that we try to build these plans to what we call the most likely, right, and then figure out how wide a range around it. And so I think the confidence part comes from looking at the trends Q2, 3 and 4. I don't know if you picked it up in my remarks, but we've literally gotten half of it back between Q2 and Q4, which is obviously quite significant. And it's still a pretty big number, right, when you look at the total softness we had for all of 2020. So I'd say that there's no precision in this. We -- I think we caveat-ed this as many ways as we could about the wildcard of softness recovery. So I'd say that we provide ranges to try to keep it in the midpoint. So we don't know, but I'd say kind of at the midpoint guide are the most likely. Yes. Steven, it's Ron again. So yes, I think you called it out right. Clearly, corporate pay would be one, and fuel would be 2 because of the size of the business, but it's still 40%, 50% of the company. \n In lodging, the one thing I would say is, remember, our FLEETCOR lodging business is workforce: Translation, blue-collar utility guys going to a new city, tree cutters cleaning up. And so that thing is way back. I mean, I looked at the January volume numbers earlier today, and I believe month-to-month, that thing is down 3% to 5% now year-over-year. And so that lodging business looks completely different than the kind of lodging business we people on this call are thinking about. \n So the airline part of that is a completely different call. To your point, that thing is running kind of 50% of volumes of a year ago. But that's the one, I'd say, has the snap, bounce back possibility. So we've cut -- took a ton of money out of that business, particularly out of the airline portion of the business, to kind of wait here to see if it's going to snap back. But it would be number three, but we still like it. I think we lay out on that Page 11, there's a couple of interesting verticals beyond workforce and beyond airline that we're looking at that we like a lot, that leverage everything we have, the systems, the network and stuff. \n So I want to be clear, we like that business, and we will keep investing. And we may buy some additional things in the business. Let me be clear: It's not white-collar T&E kind of a lodging business. Yes. Ramsey, that's a good question. I think we're mostly focused on the 3 or 4 city locations that we mentioned: fueling, parking, fast food and then condos, effectively access right for people back in the city. And so the plan, we put a fair amount of capital actually in the '21 plan to build out particularly the fueling footprint there because it's the biggest TAM, right? The dollars spent on fuel are massive. \n And so the bit of the delay was not only COVID, but our guys tinkered and came up with 2 or 3 different hardware-software configurations for the fueling locations that improve reliability like super high. So the car gets in, the thing knows it's the right car and doesn't make mistakes and to dramatically reduce the cost. And so that business is going to be on a super-duper, hurry-up drill even now, even in the first half of the year, trying to add stations across the board. So we should see those transaction counts, usage of the thing, grow a lot as we move into the second half. Another good question. So I'll start the answer to that one of we overreacted, right? So when the thing happened, we kind of pulled pretty far back, which clearly reduced revenue. We even pulled back on existing accounts, right, trimming lines, accelerating payment terms and stuff. So we went at it pretty hard. And now we've reported out for the year. And I think Chuck even mentioned the forward roll rates, so we've got the, I think, the lowest credit loss, as low as I can remember, and certainly as the base is against spend. And so we rotated back. \n I'd say in the fuel card business, we are 100% back. So whatever credit policies we had pre-COVID, I'd say, if you went and looked at our fuel card businesses, we are right back to fully open, still balanced, but fully open. \n I'd say the one place where we're still being a little cautious is in the corporate pay. And the reason is the spend per client there is so significant, if you think about it. And so we're still being careful. There's certain industries sitting in the corporate pay space that have been pretty impacted. So I'd say we've moved that one back but still not all the way back because it's more high line, what we call internally, high-line risk of a couple of BKs for some significant amount of money. So I think there's still upside as we roll through '21, as those 3 or 4 industries were cautious on kind of come back. Yes. David, good question. So the overall corporate pay business sitting inside the guidance we gave is high teens. So if you take the entire line of business sitting in our plans, we're out looking at high teens for that. I think inside of that, the T&E, which has now shrunk down, is probably in the mid- to high single digits. And if you remember, what we call kind of the multicard, kind of walk around plastics there that buy supplies, even fuel, and they're even used as P-Cards as a form of vendor payables, that line of business, that plastics or multicard, I think the last time I looked, is down to about 20% of it now being white-collar T&E, like us. \n And so fortunately, kind of 80% of that business is kind of okay. It's buying fuels. It's buying supplies. It's paying vendors. And so it's not going to decline, if you will. It's not going to drag down really the growth rate as much because it shrunk down in 2020. So fortunately, it will have less impact on the total corporate pay business this year. Yes. I'd say the short answer to that is yes. So obviously, retail as a category was super impacted in 2020, brought our gift card business pretty far down at the opening kind of in Q2. Surprisingly, the thing has come back quite well. People still, obviously, if you look for the word gift cards, are still ordering gift cards. And the digital portion of those, David, has gone way crazy high. And we bought a business a year ago to help our retailers manage online, pretty timely as they've rotated over to more online sales. So surprisingly, that business is getting healthier from some of those digital initiatives. \n And so what I'd say is we'll kind of see how this year goes. Their plan is actually up, obviously, off of the softness for '21. So I think we're probably taking another peek at the business as we get late into this year. Yes. Pete, it's Ron. I'm not sure that we're accelerating through the recovery year. I think we're doing 2 things. One, we're trying to invest in projects that drive growth. So we've kept the capital plan kind of up a bit, $15 million, $20 million, Chuck, I think, over the prior year. \n And then second, we made a decision, Pete, to pour more money into, what we call, IT transformation or modernization, whatever the word is. So we're pretty hard on the trail of consolidating some of the apps, updating obviously some of the hardware and software and stuff. And so we're pouring money into simplifying kind of our technology footprint, while we're obviously still making investments in digital and things like Roger, new analytics packages, new mobile interfaces. So we're spending money on things that we should be but also on the transformation side. Yes. I mean, I think, Pete, a bit, I think we've been on for all kinds of reasons, not only EV but just TAM and growth rate and long-term potential of the company of diversifying things that we do that share the same model. And so I don't know where we're at, 60% now, I guess. So we're moving anyway. But I said a little bit in the call the last time on the EV thing that our perspective on the thing is: a, it's way farther out, even if the acceleration of EV sales is pretty dramatic because of the size of the installed base and the useful life. Our models show the same number of commercial vehicles, the combustion engine vehicles in 10 years here in the U.S. and in the U.K., our 2 biggest markets in 10 years as today because of the growth rate of sales and again over the life. \n But the more important point I mentioned last time is, it's less about the fuel card buying fuel or the fleet card buying electricity. I think what we're learning, particularly in Europe and in the U.K., is we're getting paid by our clients as they move to some EV. They're paying us card fees, for example, for the EV vehicle the same way. And there's this new opportunity of, we're going from, call it, 150,000 gas stations in the United States to having millions of charging points at employees' homes. And so the employers look like they want us to play a role in the hardware and software and the measuring of all of those new charge points and all the reimbursement. \n And so it's early days. But I'd say to you guys that doing what we do of measuring and helping pay and reimburse employee expenditures in and around vehicles, we think we're still going to get paid a fair amount of money both in the transition to mixed fleet and even when people get over to EV. So we're going to have a little bit of a teach-in maybe in 90 days on this subject, with the takeaway hopefully being: a, it's way long or out there for the old combustion engine; and b, what FLEETCOR's economics may look like even in a pure EV world. Ashish, it's Ron. Just to jump on to what Chuck said. One of the things helping us is the market is kind of coming back, right? We study surges of the categories. And so some of the results we're reporting Q4 is the world just kind of getting used to this and kind of getting on with things. And so we think as that keeps moving our way, where businesses are interested in the kind of things we do, that, that helps. And then, b, of course, we're going to invest more, right? We're going to have more FTEs, more digital spend. We've got some new products that we've talked about. So we're super excited. I mean, first of all, we've got super soft comps in Q2 when sales almost closed down. \n And so to Chuck's point, this is a super big deal for '22. I know most people on the call are interested in this year, in '21. But my headline to you guys is that if we make the sales plan, which is super big, both against the prior year and absolute, it's -- that will pour all kinds of revenue into '22, which is part of the softness that we're dealing with here in '21, right, that we basically took a 1.5 quarters out of selling. And so you don't get the same wave of revenue rolling into the forward year. So I just don't want people to miss the importance of the sales plan for next year. Yes. Ashish, another super good question. So one of the attractive things about the SMB bill pay is what you said, it's the instamatic sale and sign up and get going. The card business that we have today, which is in the middle market, has a pretty prolonged kind of implementation cycle. It's almost like a project to get a $200 million company to connect with you and get the merchants in place and all that kind of stuff. And so the first good news is that sales and revenue will be more connected in the SMB corporate pay business than they are in the middle market. \n And I think the point that -- the question you asked, the point that we make is a super good one, which is the missing capability, I think Napoli asked me this in the last call, but I couldn't tell them, \"Hey, Ron, what are you missing to really be a gorilla here in corporate pay?\" And I didn't want to say, the answer is an SMB killer software app that works for the little company because we have the rest of the stuff. We acquire tons of clients with our sales channels. We've got capital. We've got processing capability. We've got the merchant networks to monetize. So we -- obviously, clients, the sell-up they do, they'll listen to us. \n And so unlike Roger, when I met the principals there who were kind of on the road with a super good product kind of hanging out on their own, you take their super good product and you embed it into these sets of things we have. I mean, we are -- I said it, half kiddingly in the remarks that this could be kind of the biggest deal of all because finally, we have a product that matches up with some of our capabilities. I mean, no one ever asked me before, but how funny that FLEETCOR built the corporate payments business in the middle market when the whole company was an SMB company. And so it just took us a while to pair up the corporate payments business with the business that we built over the last 20 years. \n And so the headline is, we've arrived. We have it. So I think without getting way over the skis here that this is a super big deal directionally for the company over the next 3 to 5 years of just building this thing out, where both walk-around plastic and payables sit inside the same client, where we stitch together effectively our fuel card business and our corporate payments business in the same client. It's not a small idea in our mind. It's a big idea. Yes is the short answer. The increment is recurring. And then if you looked at our 3-year plans, you'd see a similar kind of increase, 15% plus in sales in our '22 plans. So yes, it's recurring. \n And I'd say the second part is it does come in a couple of forms. It comes in: a, the old fashion form of just more scale, so more outbound phone callers, more field people, more digital, Google search keywords. \n But I'd say that the nuance that's different is we're going to make more investments kind of in digital, kind of at the top of the funnel. So we're going to spend more money to create more engagement as we have this broader product set now. And so having more things to sell, I think, allows us to spend some money earlier in people's decision cycle than at the end. So we tested that in Q4 last year, and it's working. And so that's some decent part of the step-up in '21, kind of a different kind of spend, Bob, for us than historically. Yes. It's Ron. So clearly, we build plans in terms of our capital allocation as though we're going to basically retire debt, right, take the principal down. And so to your point, to the extent the capital allocation results in another transaction, another acquisition where we buy earnings, or b, we buy back stock, to your point, the capital allocation can take up our earnings. So the guidance that we have now assumes that the roughly $1 billion of cash flow would basically retire debt during the year, which my guess is that I'm hoping to a year from today, Trevor, that's not what we do, to your point, the next 12 months. But since those 2 decisions are in the future, we plan what we know, which is to pay down debt."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\n I would like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations for FLEETCOR Technologies. Thank you. You may begin. \nJames Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2020 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Charles Freund, our CFO.\n [Operator Instructions] Please note, our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section on our website at fleetcor.com.\n Throughout this call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described.\n Now before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. This includes statements about our recovery and outlook, new products and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions, among others. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance upon them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.\n Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release, on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov.\n With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? \nRonald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim. Thanks. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call. Upfront here, I plan to cover 4 subjects, so first, provide my perspective on Q3 and our Q4 outlook; second, provide an update on our AFEX cross-border acquisition; third, I'll discuss our plans for pivoting the work of the company in getting back on offense; and then finally, I'll close with some preliminary thoughts on next year.\n Okay. So let's start with our Q3 results. So earlier, we reported Q3 revenue of $585 million, that's down 14%, and cash EPS at $2.80, that's down 10% versus last year.\n We did manage operating expenses down 9% in Q3 versus last year, obviously, to minimize the impact on our bottom line. The macro, not helpful in the quarter, primarily weaker Brazilian FX, we estimate that it depressed our Q3 print revenue by approximately $33 million. Organic revenue growth, overall in the quarter, down 12% versus last year, but that is a sequential improvement of 5% from Q2. \n Corporate pay also improved sequentially, their revenue, down 11% in Q3 versus was down 17% in Q2. We did see a step rate improvement in what we call same-store sales or client softness between Q2 and Q3. So softness improved to minus 8% in the quarter versus minus 17% in Q2. So that's a pretty significant softness recovery point-to-point, or said another way, increased client usage.\n Good news on the client retention front, we improved a point there to 92%, highlights to us again that all of the weakness is attributable to client softness. Sales recovering further here in Q3, finishing at 80% of the prior year. That's up from 54% of the prior year in Q2. Inside of that, our corporate pay sales in the quarter finished at 100% of the prior year, so nice rebound there. \n Credit performance, nothing short of outstanding. Our Q3 credit losses finishing lower than last year and even $8 million better sequentially than Q2. \n So look, in summary, Q3 clearly a better quarter for us than Q2. Volumes, step rate recovery, client softness, rebounded client retention, even in these wacky times ticking up a point. Sales starting to get back to normal, recovering to 80% of last year. We are managing expenses down. And our credit performance, again, really strong. Really pleased with credit. So all in all, an improving performance. \n So in terms of transitioning to expectations for Q4, really just share a couple of thoughts. Historically, FLEETCOR's Q3 and Q4 performance has been pretty similar in terms of revenue and earnings because weakness from seasonality or fewer business days is generally offset by the business growth that comes online throughout the year. But this quarter, I mean, we're really not sure what to expect, whether volumes will further recover or whether they'll just flatten and plateau where they are. \n So we are planning a couple of things. We're going to manage operating expenses down about 10% to 12% below last year. And we are forecasting sales to further strengthen, hopefully coming in more than 90% of the prior year. So it's a bit of a wait and see. \n Okay. Let me make the turn to AFEX, the B2B cross-border payment company that we signed up and announced in September. So it's a bit of a Cambridge look-alike. About 2/3 the size of Cambridge in revenue, although far less profitable, was a grower, growing preteens pre-COVID, and it's outlook in 2020 performance to be about flat with 2019. The rationale for the deal, really pretty straightforward. It's a business that we know and like. It's a business growing on its own, with obviously a big TAM. And as we mentioned in the press release, a business that's quite complementary to ours as it strengthens our position in Europe and Asia. \n So our conviction in the AFEX synergy plan is quite high, having just run this drill a few years ago with Cambridge. And so once closed, integrated and really fully run-rated, we're expecting accretion in the $0.25 to $0.50 cash EPS range, so we think a good contributor. So in terms of timing, we're still tracking to a Q1 2021 close, obviously subject to customary regulatory and antitrust approvals. \n Okay. My next-up subject is kind of pivoting the work of the company and getting back on offense. So like lots of companies, we've been quite consumed with our COVID response work, lots of energy against that, and feeling we're coming out the other side, and now we can kind of redirect our energies to certain things. And so those certain things are, one, sales. Super focused on getting sales back, and you see a bit of the recovery, kind of 50% sales production versus last year in Q2, 80% this quarter, Q3, and hopefully getting to above 90%. So some evidence that sales performance is returning to normalized levels. We are making investments now in anticipation of next year, adding salespeople and making some select digital investments. And we have, since we talked last, reopened credit to pre-COVID levels across a lot of our businesses in an effort to improve our approval rates. \n We're back on the tech front. We've stepped back up investments in tech, particularly around digital tech investments. So we've developed and launched a new client UI, getting very favorable user experience scores back. It's a mobile-centric platform. So really, a big improvement in the client-facing front end. We're getting better at using API layers to speed, interfaces and connections to partners and accounting systems, which helps us with our ERP integrations that contributes a lot of leads in our corporate payments business. So tech, back on. \n Interestingly, we've begun to embrace electric vehicle recharging in Europe. We've actually added EV networks in the U.K., the Netherlands and Germany. And these EV networks basically complement the traditional fueling networks because the clients are keen to have their program, their total purchases consolidated across their mixed fleet, and they want that data all in one place. \n So surprisingly, the economics are kind of okay of EV. And mixed fleets, it's literally almost neutral to us. We continue to get card fees for the electric vehicles. We get higher MDR rates when they're in the charging network. And we even get subscription fees to monitor and report on at-home and at-work charging. So look, at least initially here, we seem advantaged as an integrator or consolidator as clients transition their fleets to EV. \n And then in terms of acquisitions, we're back pretty aggressively on the acquisitions front. So in addition to AFEX, we are chasing a couple new deals that are in and around our corporate payment space. And so comfortable with our liquidity and management capacity to get after those. \n Okay. So last up today is really us looking into next year, into 2021. So I do want to point out a few signs of optimism for us in the setup. So one, we obviously had a big impact from COVID on client softness. So we do expect further COVID recovery of volumes and revenue from existing clients, and that's incremental to what we've -- the recovery that we've already seen. \n Two, again, sales, we do expect those to be up significantly. Already seeing some of that, and that will contribute way more in-year revenue from new business. Third, we're back resuming our Beyond initiatives, which are cross-sell efforts really to get additional revenues out of existing clients. So we expect, again, incremental contribution from that. \n Fourth, our trends, particularly client retention and credit, roll forward into next year. So super, super helpful as we outlook '21 performance. And then lastly, on the deal front, we will -- we do expect to close the AFEX acquisition and, as I mentioned, maybe even a couple of more. So some new deals maybe in the mix in 2021. So look, all in all, some -- we think, some positive factors in our setup for next year. \n So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Chuck? \nCharles Freund: Thank you, Ron. I'm happy to be here on my first earnings call as CFO. I'd like to note that in an effort to streamline my prepared remarks, all of my rates of change are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. So let's get into it. \n The third quarter of 2020 was affected by COVID-related business slowdowns, but to a lesser degree than what we experienced last quarter. As such, we reported revenue of $585 million, down 14%. GAAP net income decreased 16% to $189 million, and GAAP net income per diluted share decreased 12% to $2.19. \n As usual, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial metrics, such as adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, and a reconciliation to GAAP numbers is provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. \n Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2020 decreased 14% to $242 million. And adjusted net income per diluted share decreased 10% to $2.80. We're well-positioned to bring business back in conjunction with economic recoveries. I'm pleased with our ability to effectively manage expenses and minimize the negative impacts on our bottom line. \n From a macro perspective, third quarter of 2020 results reflect the negative year-over-year impact of approximately $33 million in revenue. The macro was driven mostly by lower foreign exchange rates, primarily the Brazilian real, which we believe had a negative impact of approximately $28 million. \n Fuel prices were also down year-over-year for the quarter, which we estimate had a negative impact on revenue of approximately $9 million, while fuel spreads had an estimated $4 million favorable impact. Organic revenue in the quarter was down 12% overall, primarily due to same-store sales being down 8%. Our fuel category was down organically about 11%, net of the impact of the unfavorable macro. There are a lot of moving parts in our fuel businesses around the world, but as you can see on Page 8 of the supplement, volumes in our international businesses have recovered more than volumes in the U.S. fuel businesses generally, as the international economies had reopened to a greater degree than here in the U.S. \n The corporate payments category was down approximately 11% in the third quarter. Approximately 8 points of the decline was driven by significant softness in a small portion of our over 9,000 customers. These 100 customers exhibited the highest percentage year-over-year decline in revenue during the COVID pandemic. Lower spending on our T&E product drove the other 3 points of the organic drag. \n You'll notice in the earnings supplement that we've included a new slide on Page 9 to clearly illustrate this point. And that aside from those 100 customers and T&E card activity that have been overly affected by COVID, our corporate payments business is actually flat to last year, so holding up quite well. \n Now looking at the corporate payments category by the nature of our offerings, virtual card volumes were flat for the quarter, which was an improvement from down 12% last quarter as political spend and the benefit of new customers offset the drag from the highly affected customers. Cross-border or FX-related volumes were still down in the mid-single-digit range as payment volumes are still being affected by lower invoice levels, specifically in manufacturing and wholesale trade. \n It's important to note here that our cross-border business is very different from that of Visa and MasterCard, which is mostly focused on consumers who are traveling between countries. Our cross-border business is facilitating payment for international trade and not dependent on a recovery in travel. \n Full AP continued to perform very well, with volume up 20%. New sales of Full AP were very strong as we sold more than 3x compared with last year, due to both direct and reseller wins. \n Now moving to tolls, which continues to be our most resilient business, and grew organically at 3% in the third quarter, stable with last quarter, as the subscription-based revenue model has not been significantly impacted by the COVID-driven slowdown in the Brazilian economy. Active toll tags were up 5% in the quarter, as our new approaches to tag sales, including selling at the toll plazas again and the introduction of our low frequency plans, are offsetting the lower sales in the malls and stores. Parking volumes have declined due to work-from-home, but fuel and drive-through volumes have begun to recover as residents have started to resume normal activities. \n The lodging category was down 32% organically in the third quarter, with 9 points of the drag caused by the inclusion of the acquired airline lodging business in the year ago period. Our workforce business has outperformed our airline business as we expect workforce to see continued improvement as business activity recovers. We did see lower margins in the quarter as the large enterprise accounts with lower rates recovered faster than small business accounts. \n Additionally, we saw some rate compression as hotels cut prices due to slow business and low occupancy levels, which also affected revenues. As for the airline lodging business, that recovery will likely be slower, and it is linked to the recovery of the airline industry. \n Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses were down 9% for the third quarter of 2020 to $321 million. Our target was to reduce expenses in the high single-digit range year-over-year, which is exactly what we delivered. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume-related costs, lower employee-related costs, from reduced headcount, lower sales commissions and lower T&E expenses in addition to the impact of foreign exchange rates. \n As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 54.8%, a roughly 470 basis point improvement from last quarter. Bad debt expense in the third quarter of 2020 was $13.5 million or 6 basis points compared to $14.6 million or 5 basis points in the third quarter of 2019. Bad debt levels continued to be good and our aging roll rates are very favorable. That said, the uncertainty around the timing and level of government stimulus and various responses to increasing COVID cases around the world is still a consideration. \n Interest expense decreased 14% to $31.4 million, driven by decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt and lower borrowings on our securitization facility as a result of both lower volumes and lower fuel prices in the third quarter. This was partially offset by the impact of additional borrowings for share buybacks. \n Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020 was 19.8%, with a reduction from last year, driven primarily by incremental excess tax benefit on stock option exercises. \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.37 billion in total cash, of which approximately $582 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. As of September 30, 2020, we had $3.8 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, and $688 million borrowed in our securitization facility. \n I would note that in the quarter, we received a commitment to extend our $1 billion securitization facility for another year upon expiration in November. So we have plenty of capacity to support future growth. In total, we have approximately $1.6 billion of total liquidity, consisting of available cash on the balance sheet and our undrawn revolver at quarter end. \n The primary change in liquidity from last quarter was the termination of the short-term $250 million bridge loan we had put in place, which we terminated due to lack of need for the incremental liquidity at this time. We remain committed to a consistent program of capital allocation using our free cash flow for acquisitions and buybacks. In the quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares at an average price of $238, which essentially used the free cash flow we generated in the quarter. \n We also announced the acquisition of AFEX for $450 million that Ron discussed earlier. Some of you may have thought we forgot how to do M&A the FLEETCOR way. Clearly, that is not the case. We view this as a classic FLEETCOR deal that you've come to expect from us. We're disciplined, so deals will remain lumpy. \n As we've shown, we believe that we have ample liquidity to pursue any near-term M&A opportunities, while still opportunistically buying back shares when it makes sense, like we did this quarter. I would also note that in October, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. \n And lastly, we had approximately $18.1 million of CapEx in the quarter, and finished with a leverage ratio of 2.77x trailing 12-month EBITDA as of September 30. \n Finally, I want to remind everyone that our businesses are very resilient. They have all declined due to the COVID pandemic, and they've also recovered substantially from their low points. But due to the uncertainty we're seeing currently around reopenings versus shutdowns globally, we are still not in a position to provide guidance at this point. We do expect to manage expenses 10% to 12% below the fourth quarter of last year in order to balance current profitability with investment for future growth. \n Operator, we'll now open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: Could you provide some inter-quarter -- common intra-quarter trend commentary kind of what you're seeing in the business right now relative to Q3 levels? \nCharles Freund: Ramsey, this is Charles. Pleasure speaking with you this evening. So what we've seen inter-quarter is a bit lumpy. So we've got some stuff that's moving up, some stuff that's moving down. Hard to say kind of consistently what's going to go on here. \n So Q3, I'd say, it was a good step up versus Q2. So pleased with that result, and quite frankly, did a bit better than what we initially had thought back in Q2. But in terms of inter-quarter trends, hard to really put a measure on it there. \nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. Fair enough. Could you also give us some kind of updated commentary on what you're seeing in terms of rates of recovery and your kind of larger versus smaller customers? I know that, that differential in rates of recovery was having an impact on kind of revenue yields. But I'm just curious what you're seeing in your business now in terms of those smaller customers potentially starting to come back a little stronger or what have you? \nCharles Freund: Yes. It depends on the line of business. In our fuel business, we have seen a bit more recovery, particularly in trucking in the small fleet segment. Keeping in mind that the small fleets dipped down quite a bit more than the large fleets, so they've been coming back faster, but they're still not at the level of recovery of the large fleets. In our lodging space here in the U.S., we are still seeing that phenomenon, though, but the small customers are lagging the large customer recovery pretty significantly. \nOperator: And our next question is from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. \nDavid Togut: Good to see the corporate payments bookings reached 100% of year-ago levels. Can you frame for us whether this business might get back to meaningful growth in 2021? This historically has been your best growth engine, yet you called out the bookings performance and yet, about 100 clients or so are still quite weak. So can you help us think about the year ahead and where you might land in this business? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, David, it's Ron. I think it hinges totally on the kind of sick client group that we laid out in the supplement. So the sickest client in the T&E business way, way down, which is having that thing penciled out at minus 11% for the quarter, kind of flat without those. \n So clearly, the non-T&E, non-sick people will be a growing business in 2021 as we look at the plans. The wildcard is how much of that softness that we're seeing still here in Q3 will come back. So that's the debate we're having, and we're obviously watching it closely. To Chuck's point, we saw a little encouraging sign intra-quarter there in virtual cars. It looked like it was getting a little bit healthier. \n So I'd say -- it's not a super answer, but I'd say, if you park the 2 sick portions for sure, you will see, again, mid- to high-teens growth for the rest of that business. To your point, based on the sales and the forecast we have for Q4 is another good one. So the sales are clearly there to grow that business. \nDavid Togut: Got it. Appreciate that. And then just as a follow-up on capital allocation, you increased the buyback authorization by $1 billion and you're about to complete AFEX. How should we think about the year ahead in terms of share repurchase versus other meaningful M&A? \nRonald F. Clarke: I'd say, probably, the philosophy, David, is the same as always. We do have a number of deals that we're working on, and I think we called it out in the press release, including a couple that are close-in, kind of late stage. So we're always balanced and right the liquidity that we need for the deals in front of us versus opportunistic on the share price. So I'd say, it's, a, function of those 2 things. If there's a lot of deals we like, we've got conviction in, we'll spend the money on that. And if people trade our stock to a price that -- where buyers will buy it back. So the goal was to give us the management, the flexibility to make those calls. But I think, Chuck, our liquidity or availability is still well north of $1 billion? \nCharles Freund: Yes. Yes. \nRonald F. Clarke: So we do have plenty to go, and obviously, the ability, David, to borrow more money. So capital [ isn't ] the main question for us. \nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang Wang with JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: So I want to ask, Ron, on the new sales, the bookings also. Just I'm curious, do you see some pent-up demand there potentially? And I'm just curious on your confidence in being able to replenish the pipeline now that you get to some kind of new normal and new rhythm on selling in this -- during this pandemic, as you see it. What's going on in the ground there? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I'm not sure on the sales thing. It's -- I used the word tension, but It's pent-up demand. I'd say that it's 2 things. One, that the marketplace, the prospect universe is kind of getting back to listening again. They're less distracted. So what we do, we go in and analyze and that Google Analytics package, search volumes across all of our categories against baselines. And we see in that outside-in data the planet getting more receptive again to the kinds of things that we offer. So that's point one, which is obviously super important. \n And then point two, I think we finally have the rhythm of how to sell. We all ran home and fuel people became phone people, and we remixed more money to digital. And we shrunk credit, now we've opened credit. So I think we ying-ed and yang-ed in our various channels, and now we've got kind of a sense of how to do it, how to play the game as it is now. \n And so this 80% number, which was pretty good in lots of places, particularly in corporate pay, I'm looking at a forecast that's over 90% for Q4. We've obviously got one of the months in the can. So I'd say of all the areas, that's the one where I feel like we have more control over our future. We stay in this kind of a place, the fact that we can continue to move that number up as we roll forward, so pretty confident. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Okay. I got you. Because I know in the past, you said you can -- you're pretty -- when you're confident, you throw in dollars on the sales side and you'll get the return. I know you're talking about double-digit OpEx savings. But does that signal that you're not quite ready to deploy capital towards the sales and marketing point? Or is that a different discussion? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. We are -- the reason -- I don't know on the disclosures how much detail we give you, but one of the reasons it looks like there's not a step-up in sales and marketing is the commission rolls are soft, right, because of the bad performance in Q2 and now just improving performance. \n But we made the call probably 60 days ago to start to step-up investments, both in people, on the recruiting front and a certain kind of new digital campaign. So no, it's -- again, it's the one -- it's the key to the company, right? When you get all done with this softness, sickness thing of who is healthy and who is not, we still have a business you can plan, right? Whatever you give me, that baseline and then we lap whatever the softness or hardness is, we got a business that we can run 10% on the top. And so we're back at that game trying to build a sales plan for next year that keeps the company rolling in that fashion. And it's -- I mean, what I'd say back is that's a bunch of words, but more importantly, when 90%, 50%, 80%, and we're forecasting above 90%, so there's real evidence that it's working. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Okay. No, I'm sure that's the case. Last quick one, I'm sorry for asking a third one. Just the Cambridge playbook applied to AFEX. I mean is it very similar? I mean you sound pretty confident in getting that level of the normal accretion with AFEX. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean we -- this is a thing called down the fairway. But number one, that playbook, which is part of our model for every deal, worked quite well. I mean I think we reported or in one of these calls, I told you that we've more than doubled the profitability of Cambridge between '17 and '19. And so the first point is, yes, we'll reinstitute that same playbook for AFEX. \n But then the second one is, that there's 2 businesses now that look the same. So there's a second bite of synergies in the combinations that we didn't have obviously in the Cambridge deal. So that's why we gave the range. Obviously, our thinking is the 2 steps of thing, make sure we understand it. So we'll run them. And we started the planning for that thing to get to first phase. And then as we get smarter, for example, they've done a small business in North America in a management layer, call it, the last 10%, 15% of the Cambridge business we have. So we'll clearly assimilate things like that, and they have way stronger positions in Asia. So it sets up really well, both to grow the business and to make it way more profitable, so we like it. \nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Steven Wald with Morgan Stanley. \nSteven Wald: Maybe coming back to the corporate payments, I know we've asked a lot about this, but from a different angle. You guys had previously said, I think, back in September, Charles, you were talking about sort of working through some of the backlogs on previous bookings and getting those up and running at a faster clip than perhaps it would typically be done at over a sort of 12-month-plus period. \n I'm curious how we're thinking with a large chunk of the business outside of T&E being back to pre-COVID levels. How are you thinking about the potential for that to hockey stick up, now having gotten back to even from the onboarding of those volumes? It seems like there's a natural beneficial mix shift away from T&E just by virtue of the fact that it's subdued in activity. So what are you thinking in terms of the next 3 to 9 months from those faster implementations? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, that's, Steven, a super, super good question. I mean I think some of the softness this year at 2020 is not only sales, but what you said in that business implementations, because we kind of sell the year before and then implement the year after. And so a number of implementations in that business have been stalled, slowed as we certainly went through the second quarter and are starting to kind of reactivate. So the million-dollar question there, just like David's earlier is, how many of those implementations will hold? Will people stay with them if they agree to do the thing 3 or 6 months ago? And will they be away from their distractions where they could work hand and hand with us to implement the thing?\n So I think it's the same -- a bit of the same question, which is we've got a book of business that we can convert into revenue there, but we need cooperation of the clients that have agreed. So to the extent that they're agreeable, that, back to your point, will accelerate some of the recovery next year. And to the extent that it doesn't, they quit on the thing or they continue to back burner it, then that won't be helpful. So I think we're just seeing now signs in the last month or 2 of those implementations kind of getting back to a targeted level. \nSteven Wald: Very helpful. And then just squeezing in a quick follow-up here. You mentioned at the beginning of the call, getting back to work on the Beyond initiatives. And I think it's pretty straightforward, with the fuel piece in terms of cross-selling sort of more attached to those customers. But could you just speak to the conditions on the ground you're seeing on the Brazil side for Beyond? And obviously, there's been quite the disruption from the pandemic there. I'm kind of curious what the ability is to have those conversations and get the uptake in Beyond in Brazil. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I think the Brazil and the other ones, we did slow things down mostly around our credit paranoia back when this thing first broke. So we've obviously relaxed that, and then be just their population getting back out and about, right, driving around, refueling, going to fast food places, going back into the city, and they had a big closure like we did here in terms of their malls and stuff. So it was a real slowdown in the Beyond areas, right, of fueling, parking and fast food. \n That's kind of recovered. They've kind of reopened the country. So we're seeing those transaction volumes tick back up. And we're also seeing it on new sales. I think you've heard that a big part of that initiative is to attract people that are kind of in the city that aren't toll people that want to use those things. Well, obviously, when there's no need to use those things, it's not as interesting a pitch. So we're seeing it in the last month or 2 that gets resonating again as the activities picked up. So I wouldn't say it's all the way back to pre-levels, but it is way back from where they were in Q2. \nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. \nAshish Sabadra: I also would like to focus on the corporate payment. But I would like to go back to the Slide 8, where we have the volume trends by individual segment. My understanding was virtual card and FX were like almost 40% each, and then T&E and full AP at 10% each of that business. So when we do a bottom-up, we don't see the kind of 18% volume decline or 11% revenue weakness. What could we be missing when we think about it, about that weakness there? \nJames Eglseder: Yes, Ashish, we're probably going to have you back you on that and do some math. This is Jim. Happy to do that, but I'm not sure that we have the disconnect [indiscernible] \nRonald F. Clarke: Say the question -- Ashish, it's Ron, just so I got it again? \nAshish Sabadra: Maybe a broader question would be just within the segment, I understand you talked about some of the weakness in the top 100 customers. But within the subsegment, were there any particular areas other than T&E, which has been relatively weak, which has been like weighing on the growth in that segment? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. You're saying the difference between the volume recovery versus the revenue? I mean I'd say in the virtual card business, a lot of it is mix that some of our channel partners that have lower revenue to us per spend dollar have recovered more, think of the people that are investing lots in sales and marketing. And then obviously, we have, again, some series of sicker clients and the -- unfortunately for us, they used to pay us more. \n So I'd say that probably the biggest delta between that exhibit would be the mix. There's a fair number of pretty large clients on both sides of that wheel, some clients that are going up, like health care, as an example, would be like a perfect example. That had a, I don't have it in front of me, but a dramatic step up Q2 to Q3. It's kind of elective surgery and kind of normal hospital stuff kind of came back. And our margins in that health care business are way worse than in kind of the more traditional horizontal kind of a business. So that would be the partners, if you will, the wholesale business and the health care business have recovered better than some of the other businesses that pay us more. \nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color, Ron. And then maybe just on the fuel. One of the questions that we get a lot from investors is the difference in the growth between your fleet -- fuel business versus what WEX has been reporting in terms of gallons. I was wondering if you could just provide any color on the difference. Is it more the customer mix? Any color on that front. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, I keep saying -- I mean obviously, it's a super strange time and stuff. But I think if you said what's the most surprising thing to us is how well those businesses, both our domestic and international fuel have recovered. I mean the softness recovery, I'm not sure I have it in front of me, but literally, I think our international business existing clients, we call same-store sales, was down 25% or something literally in Q2, and recovered a ton. Again, I don't have it in front of me, but I think it is to 5%, picked up kind of 20 points or something in the improvement. So that would be something. And then even in the U.S., I think it's improved. If it was down 15% or 20%, it's down 10% or something. So that is what I'd say is the biggest thing. \n Our applications are way up again because that Google outside-in, the world is more interested in searching again on fuel cards and fleet cards, so we're beneficiaries of that. Although, again, I think in the new business, we're still being a bit more careful in credit with the super small accounts, which tend to be in our fuel card business, is where we have smaller accounts. So we're still concerned with fraud and stuff. So we're being -- our approval rates are still lower in that line of business. \n But it's doing, Ashish, I think, significantly better, particularly in the third quarter on the strength of the -- really, again, the clients coming back and the forecast from our guys are even more recovery there. So it's doing well. \nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Matt O'Neill from Goldman Sachs. \nMatthew O'Neill: Ron and Chuck, I was hoping I could first ask just to clarify a little bit further on the re-extension of credit. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you're back to pre-COVID levels across a lot of the businesses. Was that still -- was that sort of a quarter end comment or kind of on average across the quarter? I'm just trying to think about how close we are to being back to normal? \n And then as a follow-up, on the 10% to 12% expense reductions that you've discussed as far as balancing profitability this year, is there any expectation around parsing some of those that would be more permanent as we go forward versus are they predominantly transitory things? Isn't this year like T&E being down as a result of COVID, et cetera? \nRonald F. Clarke: Let me, Matt, this is Ron, take the first half on credit, and then Chuck could take the expenses. I'd say that, no, it wasn't a green light at the beginning of the quarter where we turned the thing on. It's been very segmented. So we've moved at different speeds with different businesses. We've moved at different speeds with existing clients versus new clients. And we've moved at different speeds for super small clients, like we get in the fuel card business. \n So when I said in the comment that we were kind of back, I'd say, we are. We've gone back to medium and large clients, and re-extended their terms, days to pay and stuff that we had shortened. We've increased some of the credit lines again, so we could get more greater share of their business. But we continue to be careful on some of the Beyond because obviously, that increases our credit exposure, our credit limits within a single client, right, which we view as a bit more risk. \n And we continue to be cautious on the digital new business because they're coming in not as well as green as if they run through our people and they're smaller. So I'd say, it happened over the last 4 or 5 months, and sitting here today, it's probably, Chuck, I don't know, 80% or 85% back to normal with this Beyond and the small digital being the couple of exceptions. \nCharles Freund: This is Charles. Just the other point is we've kept some verticals that we know are still quite challenged due to the pandemic. We've kept them shut for credit purposes. Things that you would think of, right off the bat, heavy, heavy travel kind of industries, we're just not focused on them at this moment. \nRonald F. Clarke: But we are tradable, Matt. When we see credit losses come in the way they have the last 2 quarters, we look and we see roll rates and all kinds of stuff that we look at and were like, huh, I guess we, along with some other people, maybe overreacted to the credit risk. And part of it is the essential nature, again, right, of what we do to people want to get our programs because it's part of their day-to-day jobs. \n And then, b, the velocity of what our receivables are, we have all kinds of stuff like daily terms, daily net buys and stuff and trucking. So our terms are quite rapid. So we've been, again, just super fortunate. And so we're now trying to lean back towards the growth side and saying, okay, we're open to taking a bit more credit risk now that we see it's controlled. \nCharles Freund: And then, Matt, to your other question on the expense reductions and what's permanent or not, some of this is from volume. So as our volumes bounce back, whether it's the base coming back or enhanced sales, as Ron was saying, some of that volume-based expense will come back. Some of it is driven by FX rates. So it hurts us on revenue, but we save on expenses. And so unless we see the Brazilian real turn around, some of that's going to stick around for a while. \n And we also mentioned our bad debt is running low, and the aging is also staying well below what it has been historically. And so you could see that kind of continuing to run at a low rate for some time. \n I'd say, going forward into next year, we're going to continue to manage expenses, but look for opportunities, as Ron has said, to shift to growth and get on offense. So we'll look to deploy some of the things that -- some of the savings that we have this year to focus more on sales and marketing and get the top line where we want it. \nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. \nRobert Napoli: So the corporate payments business seems to be the key long-term driver to being able to hit the targets that you've had historically, Ron. What is the key -- strategically, what do you need to add to that business? I mean the opportunity is so large. And where are you investing? Because there's a lot of innovation going on in the corporate payment space. Where are you investing? What do you need to add? What are you looking at M&A-wise? What is most strategically important to keep that growth -- to make that business multiples the size it is today over the long term? \nRonald F. Clarke: Bob, it's Ron. It's a good question. I think we described this business to you before, we look at it kind of like as a game board, so kind of chessboard, and it's got segments on it. So it's got kind of small, medium and large companies, and then it's got off to different verticals and stuff. And so if you look at the early days of the corporate pay or payables business, players are kind of going after certain cell. So some guy is focus on some verticals like us even, take construction, is a big part of our business. Some people like our pals, Bill.com, focused on super small clients and so on. \n So the first thing I'd say to you is, we're acutely aware and focused on those, if you look at that game board, which ones were capable to be good at today and then what capabilities would we need to be good as some of the cells were not in. So there's a few verticals that we like, that I like a lot, that we'd like to be in, where there's connections to ERPs and client references that we need, so some opportunities maybe to buy into some of those. And then the same on size, right? One of the things we've debated is do we take our full AP product that's a super good product, but target it in the mid-market and make a down-market version, so that we can chase that to the 500,000 little clients we have with it.\n So I'd say that, that's -- the primary thing is widening the capabilities to play in more of those segments. And then, b, I think I told you in the prior calls, the running up the value chain, like, for example, getting good at invoice automation. So the client doesn't have to open 100 invoices and tear them open and somehow get them into their system, and then we help them pay it, but maybe be more helpful to them as they pull those invoices and digitize those invoices. \n So those are the 2 games. We're going to get wider in the segments, and I'm hoping you'll hear more about that, and we'll get kind of broader in the value chain of the adjacency. So a year or 2 from now, you'll see us more in those 2 spots. \nRobert Napoli: Are you building the invoice automation piece internally? Or is that something that you need to acquire? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I'm not going to answer that, other than say, obviously, we always look at the made by, so we're analyzing all of those options. All I can tell you is, we'll have this. We're committed, to your point, to this space, and we're looking at the various ways to get wider in this game and we will be wider in this game. \nOperator: And our next question is from the line of John Coffey with Susquehanna. \nJohn Coffey: One -- sort of 2 questions, one of which is fairly basic. Looking at Slide 8, this is a little bit differently set up than it was last quarter. So I was just wondering, in this -- again, maybe obvious, the last column of growth, is this sequential growth from Q2 to Q3? I just want to make sure I understood that right. Or is it some other kind of maybe, I don't know, an early October number? \n And then I'll just give you my second question right off the bat, is on the next slide. When I look at the declines that you see from the 100 most effective customers, would a lot of that be primarily driven by the T&E cards? Or would some of this be virtual cards as well? \nCharles Freund: John, this is Charles. So on Slide 8, what you're seeing there, the volume trends Q2 year-over-year and Q3 year-over-year, that third column is really the difference between Q2 and Q3. So sequentially, right, we improved, say as an example, in the local fuel business, from minus 17% to minus 12%, we improved 500 basis points. And so you can see kind of the recovery that we're seeing sequentially quarter versus quarter, Q2 to Q3 this year. \n And then in terms of the 100 customers, in that slide, which is Slide 9, we're actually explicitly removing the T&E card product and looking at that separately. So the 100 most affected customers would be those that are using our payment products, either our virtual card or our cross-border and AFEX services. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, I don't know, John, whether we're making this point clear why we put this thing in here. Again, no one understands this better than you guys of how COVID and shutdowns have helped some companies and hurt some companies and then super hurt some companies, the whole distribution. \n I guess the headline we're trying to give is that partitioning of impact sits in our client base. So when we look at the business that we built, it's a function of the health of our clients. And so just like the investments that you guys look at, we have some set in all of our businesses of super sick clients that we didn't know could get so sick, using fuel cards or corporate pay products. \n And so the softness and the down performance of our company is really, as we've said, mostly now just a function of the health of a narrow group of our clients because we're back selling, our retention is fine, our credit's fine. And so the other parts of our business that allow our business to go forward, fortunately, are kind of okay again. So it's really just -- the point of it is really just we have, in our 800,000 clients, ones that were massively impacted by this thing and continue to be. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. \nGeorgios Mihalos: Ron, just wanted to ask, I know it's early days around sort of EV and the like, and you talked about some networks overseas. I'm just curious on your thoughts about that kind of migrating to the States. Maybe how far behind are we to that playing a bigger role? And then just secondly, it sounds like you're, at least for now, somewhat encouraged on the economics. Just your thoughts around the ability to sustain that? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Let me start, George, with the second question first and then come back to the U.S. I'd say this is another one a bit like our credit thing. Probably all of you were like, oh, sheez, FLEETCOR's got fuel cards, and oh my god, it's going to be electric vehicles and oh, they won't have any business or whatever. Okay. So we're like, oh my god, I wondered when a client that's got 20 plumbing trucks gets 2 or 3 electric vehicles, while our business go down 10% or 15%.\n So what I was really trying to report now that we're in the game is no. That example of a mixed fleet, our business is basically flat. And I'm studying this over the last 6 months. I'm like -- what is going on here, guys? And the answer is that the business wants to know about their vehicles and usage and purchases and what the people are doing, frankly, across the entire 20 vehicle population in that example. \n And so having a card in a way that the 20 people can still all buy and get reported on one account, I guess we didn't really realize how valuable that was to companies, and they're willing to pay. They're still paying card fees on those 3 electric plumbing trucks and they're -- obviously, we're getting paid for the new networks we've established. And they even want to know when those things are getting charged because they have admin to do with their employees, right? Their employees want to kind of get reimbursed, if you will, for at-home charging, the gadgets and the electricity and stuff. And so the headline for everybody is, at least initially, while the fleets are mixed, it's not a big -- we don't view it as a big drag, which, to me, I want to tell that story because we think it's pretty good news. \n On the second question, I think it's as much a government question as anything. Look, the reason that some of the countries we're in, in Europe are ahead in EV is the government has set it up that way, right, in terms of incentives and targets and stuff that they've set up. So maybe we'll know something tonight or tomorrow here about our government. But I think a lot of it, the pace at which the U.S. will try to catch up, I think, is going to be a function really of the incentives that are put out there, how high a priority it is. But again, my guess is the behaviors will be probably pretty similar to what we're seeing. Networks will get billed, networks that work will get billed, and we'll probably copy the same playbook for a while. So to me, it just keeps pushing out the electric vehicle impact on our company. \nGeorgios Mihalos: Okay. That's great. That's very encouraging. And then, Charles, if I could sneak one more in, just looking at the full AP business, I think you grew 20% in the third quarter, that's good growth. But I think in July, volumes were up 27%. So I guess, you're sort of exiting the third quarter in the teens. Anything to kind of call out there and how maybe we should be thinking about that business near term? \nCharles Freund: Yes. So in terms of the 20% growth, I'm assuming you're referring to Slide 8, that is embedded volume growth. The business -- we are lapping some synergies that we put into place a year ago. So when we acquired the business, they had some payments that they were doing. But what we did is we basically tied that product to our vendor database, and so we could take a bunch of the payments they were making through other modalities and turn them on to our MasterCard virtual card. \n And so we saw a lot of MasterCard spend suddenly come into the system. We're now lapping those synergies. And so what you're going to see basically in that business going forward is really just organic growth. It's sales pouring in. And in this case, it's transaction volume overcoming COVID softness in the base, since that big sales that we keep telling you about is layering on. And so we're going to have this kind of, call it, high teens, 20% kind of growth rate in this business, provided the sales continued. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Trevor Williams from Jefferies. \nTrevor Williams: And I just wanted to follow up, Charles, with you just a little bit on the expense comments you made to Matt's question earlier. I mean it sounds like you guys are going to start pouring some more fuel on the fire when you start to get more of a reacceleration on the top line. With that kind of framework, I mean, should we be thinking that maybe your incremental margins run a bit lower than the 70% level that we've historically thought about when revenues start to come back on the upswing? \nCharles Freund: No, I'd say, we're pretty disciplined and balanced. So it's not -- when you say pouring fuel on the fire, everything we do is going to be incremental. It will be balanced. But what we try to do as a company is shift what we call calories. So I can make certain investments in back office stuff. I can make investments in sales and marketing. I much prefer the latter versus the former. \n And so we're very, very disciplined in cost control in all of our operations. And that way, we can put some disproportionate investment in sales and marketing, while still managing the bottom line effectively. So I would not anticipate any kind of dramatic changes in that regard. It's more of a shift in spending versus big incremental investment. \nTrevor Williams: Okay. Got it. That's very helpful. And just one other clarification question for me. Ron, I mean you -- when you're talking about the fourth quarter, you're hoping to get sales up to 90% of last year's level. I just want to make sure I'm understanding that comment correctly. Is that new sales you're referencing? Or is that -- you're talking about revenue growth being down 10% or hopefully a little bit better for the fourth quarter? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, that's new sales, Trevor. So we keep track of what we call annualized new business. We sign up 30,000 clients in the quarter, how much revenue will they create. And so we have a system that measures that. So yes. So I say, hey, we were 50% of new business. Now Q3, we're at 80%, and we hope to be at 90% or 90%-plus, that's comparing new business we got in Q3 this year to the amount of new business we got in Q3 last year. \nTrevor Williams: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. That's why I asked. Appreciate it. \nRonald F. Clarke: I mean let me go back to what I said earlier that Togut asked, which is, once you normalize this base softness or wherever it is, this is -- I want to make sure everyone gets it, this is the game. If you could get sales, right, to be more than attrition, and we said retention ticked up a point, it is the key to planning this machine running forward. So we will lap the softness, even though we're recovering some. So I don't want people to miss how important this metric is to us and to the revenue growth going forward. \nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. \nMihir Bhatia: I just had one quick one, hopefully, on fuel card -- on the fuel card segment. Thanks for the incremental disclosure on the corporate payment side. I was wondering if you could do something similar for us, like just at a high level, maybe on the fuel card side. Are there particular customers or segments that are just not recovering while everything else is getting better? \n And then just relatedly, I was curious about your views just in terms of -- with parts of Europe and, I guess, the U.K. is talking about shutting down again or at least putting some kinds of movement restrictions in place. How should we be thinking about the headwinds from that for you next quarter? \nCharles Freund: So on the fuel card business, Mihir, we are still seeing some of that softness still in the small businesses, as we mentioned earlier, so that's still -- waiting for that to come back. In terms of some of the industries, manufacturing has been a bit slow. Obviously, transportation as such, public transportation, things of that nature has been a little slow in our local fuel business. \n The Europe stuff had bounced back more, as shown in our volume exhibits. To your point, we're watching the lockdowns. I think in terms of the nature of those lockdowns, they don't seem quite as severe, at least is what I've read in the press regarding how far they're going to shut down. So we're still waiting to see what that impact will look like. So I'd say, to be determined. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Let me just add to what Chuck said. The answer is yes to are there super sick clients like we show in corporate pay. We run the distributions of the clients. So let's say we had 100,000 clients, we basically put them in layers, call it, 5 or 6 layers, hey, 25,000 of the 100,000 have grown, hey, 25,000 are down like 5% or 10%, hey, 25,000 are down 20% to 30%, and then 6,000 are down 80% or more. \n So we see the whole distribution of super impacted industries versus industries that were nicked by, we're going to have one less plumber because some homes won't accept them. So it's not quite as stark as it is in the corporate pay business. And again, it's why we've seen actually more recovery, if you will, of our same-store sales in the fuel business than in the corporate pay, because we have retailers and maritime payroll and hotels, things that don't move that have been shuttered that are in our corporate pay business. So we were just dealt a more impacted set of clients, effectively sitting in that business. \nOperator: And there are no further questions in the queue at this time. I will now turn the call back over for closing remarks. \nCharles Freund: Nothing further on our end, guys. Let me know if you need anything else, I'm always available. So have a good evening. \nRonald F. Clarke: Thanks, everybody. \nOperator: That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you, and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Charles Freund",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron. I'm happy to be here on my first earnings call as CFO. I'd like to note that in an effort to streamline my prepared remarks, all of my rates of change are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. So let's get into it. \n The third quarter of 2020 was affected by COVID-related business slowdowns, but to a lesser degree than what we experienced last quarter. As such, we reported revenue of $585 million, down 14%. GAAP net income decreased 16% to $189 million, and GAAP net income per diluted share decreased 12% to $2.19. \n As usual, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial metrics, such as adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, and a reconciliation to GAAP numbers is provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. \n Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2020 decreased 14% to $242 million. And adjusted net income per diluted share decreased 10% to $2.80. We're well-positioned to bring business back in conjunction with economic recoveries. I'm pleased with our ability to effectively manage expenses and minimize the negative impacts on our bottom line. \n From a macro perspective, third quarter of 2020 results reflect the negative year-over-year impact of approximately $33 million in revenue. The macro was driven mostly by lower foreign exchange rates, primarily the Brazilian real, which we believe had a negative impact of approximately $28 million. \n Fuel prices were also down year-over-year for the quarter, which we estimate had a negative impact on revenue of approximately $9 million, while fuel spreads had an estimated $4 million favorable impact. Organic revenue in the quarter was down 12% overall, primarily due to same-store sales being down 8%. Our fuel category was down organically about 11%, net of the impact of the unfavorable macro. There are a lot of moving parts in our fuel businesses around the world, but as you can see on Page 8 of the supplement, volumes in our international businesses have recovered more than volumes in the U.S. fuel businesses generally, as the international economies had reopened to a greater degree than here in the U.S. \n The corporate payments category was down approximately 11% in the third quarter. Approximately 8 points of the decline was driven by significant softness in a small portion of our over 9,000 customers. These 100 customers exhibited the highest percentage year-over-year decline in revenue during the COVID pandemic. Lower spending on our T&E product drove the other 3 points of the organic drag. \n You'll notice in the earnings supplement that we've included a new slide on Page 9 to clearly illustrate this point. And that aside from those 100 customers and T&E card activity that have been overly affected by COVID, our corporate payments business is actually flat to last year, so holding up quite well. \n Now looking at the corporate payments category by the nature of our offerings, virtual card volumes were flat for the quarter, which was an improvement from down 12% last quarter as political spend and the benefit of new customers offset the drag from the highly affected customers. Cross-border or FX-related volumes were still down in the mid-single-digit range as payment volumes are still being affected by lower invoice levels, specifically in manufacturing and wholesale trade. \n It's important to note here that our cross-border business is very different from that of Visa and MasterCard, which is mostly focused on consumers who are traveling between countries. Our cross-border business is facilitating payment for international trade and not dependent on a recovery in travel. \n Full AP continued to perform very well, with volume up 20%. New sales of Full AP were very strong as we sold more than 3x compared with last year, due to both direct and reseller wins. \n Now moving to tolls, which continues to be our most resilient business, and grew organically at 3% in the third quarter, stable with last quarter, as the subscription-based revenue model has not been significantly impacted by the COVID-driven slowdown in the Brazilian economy. Active toll tags were up 5% in the quarter, as our new approaches to tag sales, including selling at the toll plazas again and the introduction of our low frequency plans, are offsetting the lower sales in the malls and stores. Parking volumes have declined due to work-from-home, but fuel and drive-through volumes have begun to recover as residents have started to resume normal activities. \n The lodging category was down 32% organically in the third quarter, with 9 points of the drag caused by the inclusion of the acquired airline lodging business in the year ago period. Our workforce business has outperformed our airline business as we expect workforce to see continued improvement as business activity recovers. We did see lower margins in the quarter as the large enterprise accounts with lower rates recovered faster than small business accounts. \n Additionally, we saw some rate compression as hotels cut prices due to slow business and low occupancy levels, which also affected revenues. As for the airline lodging business, that recovery will likely be slower, and it is linked to the recovery of the airline industry. \n Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses were down 9% for the third quarter of 2020 to $321 million. Our target was to reduce expenses in the high single-digit range year-over-year, which is exactly what we delivered. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume-related costs, lower employee-related costs, from reduced headcount, lower sales commissions and lower T&E expenses in addition to the impact of foreign exchange rates. \n As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 54.8%, a roughly 470 basis point improvement from last quarter. Bad debt expense in the third quarter of 2020 was $13.5 million or 6 basis points compared to $14.6 million or 5 basis points in the third quarter of 2019. Bad debt levels continued to be good and our aging roll rates are very favorable. That said, the uncertainty around the timing and level of government stimulus and various responses to increasing COVID cases around the world is still a consideration. \n Interest expense decreased 14% to $31.4 million, driven by decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt and lower borrowings on our securitization facility as a result of both lower volumes and lower fuel prices in the third quarter. This was partially offset by the impact of additional borrowings for share buybacks. \n Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020 was 19.8%, with a reduction from last year, driven primarily by incremental excess tax benefit on stock option exercises. \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.37 billion in total cash, of which approximately $582 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. As of September 30, 2020, we had $3.8 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, and $688 million borrowed in our securitization facility. \n I would note that in the quarter, we received a commitment to extend our $1 billion securitization facility for another year upon expiration in November. So we have plenty of capacity to support future growth. In total, we have approximately $1.6 billion of total liquidity, consisting of available cash on the balance sheet and our undrawn revolver at quarter end. \n The primary change in liquidity from last quarter was the termination of the short-term $250 million bridge loan we had put in place, which we terminated due to lack of need for the incremental liquidity at this time. We remain committed to a consistent program of capital allocation using our free cash flow for acquisitions and buybacks. In the quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares at an average price of $238, which essentially used the free cash flow we generated in the quarter. \n We also announced the acquisition of AFEX for $450 million that Ron discussed earlier. Some of you may have thought we forgot how to do M&A the FLEETCOR way. Clearly, that is not the case. We view this as a classic FLEETCOR deal that you've come to expect from us. We're disciplined, so deals will remain lumpy. \n As we've shown, we believe that we have ample liquidity to pursue any near-term M&A opportunities, while still opportunistically buying back shares when it makes sense, like we did this quarter. I would also note that in October, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. \n And lastly, we had approximately $18.1 million of CapEx in the quarter, and finished with a leverage ratio of 2.77x trailing 12-month EBITDA as of September 30. \n Finally, I want to remind everyone that our businesses are very resilient. They have all declined due to the COVID pandemic, and they've also recovered substantially from their low points. But due to the uncertainty we're seeing currently around reopenings versus shutdowns globally, we are still not in a position to provide guidance at this point. We do expect to manage expenses 10% to 12% below the fourth quarter of last year in order to balance current profitability with investment for future growth. \n Operator, we'll now open it up for questions. Ramsey, this is Charles. Pleasure speaking with you this evening. So what we've seen inter-quarter is a bit lumpy. So we've got some stuff that's moving up, some stuff that's moving down. Hard to say kind of consistently what's going to go on here. \n So Q3, I'd say, it was a good step up versus Q2. So pleased with that result, and quite frankly, did a bit better than what we initially had thought back in Q2. But in terms of inter-quarter trends, hard to really put a measure on it there. Yes. It depends on the line of business. In our fuel business, we have seen a bit more recovery, particularly in trucking in the small fleet segment. Keeping in mind that the small fleets dipped down quite a bit more than the large fleets, so they've been coming back faster, but they're still not at the level of recovery of the large fleets. In our lodging space here in the U.S., we are still seeing that phenomenon, though, but the small customers are lagging the large customer recovery pretty significantly. Yes. Yes. This is Charles. Just the other point is we've kept some verticals that we know are still quite challenged due to the pandemic. We've kept them shut for credit purposes. Things that you would think of, right off the bat, heavy, heavy travel kind of industries, we're just not focused on them at this moment. And then, Matt, to your other question on the expense reductions and what's permanent or not, some of this is from volume. So as our volumes bounce back, whether it's the base coming back or enhanced sales, as Ron was saying, some of that volume-based expense will come back. Some of it is driven by FX rates. So it hurts us on revenue, but we save on expenses. And so unless we see the Brazilian real turn around, some of that's going to stick around for a while. \n And we also mentioned our bad debt is running low, and the aging is also staying well below what it has been historically. And so you could see that kind of continuing to run at a low rate for some time. \n I'd say, going forward into next year, we're going to continue to manage expenses, but look for opportunities, as Ron has said, to shift to growth and get on offense. So we'll look to deploy some of the things that -- some of the savings that we have this year to focus more on sales and marketing and get the top line where we want it. John, this is Charles. So on Slide 8, what you're seeing there, the volume trends Q2 year-over-year and Q3 year-over-year, that third column is really the difference between Q2 and Q3. So sequentially, right, we improved, say as an example, in the local fuel business, from minus 17% to minus 12%, we improved 500 basis points. And so you can see kind of the recovery that we're seeing sequentially quarter versus quarter, Q2 to Q3 this year. \n And then in terms of the 100 customers, in that slide, which is Slide 9, we're actually explicitly removing the T&E card product and looking at that separately. So the 100 most affected customers would be those that are using our payment products, either our virtual card or our cross-border and AFEX services. Yes. So in terms of the 20% growth, I'm assuming you're referring to Slide 8, that is embedded volume growth. The business -- we are lapping some synergies that we put into place a year ago. So when we acquired the business, they had some payments that they were doing. But what we did is we basically tied that product to our vendor database, and so we could take a bunch of the payments they were making through other modalities and turn them on to our MasterCard virtual card. \n And so we saw a lot of MasterCard spend suddenly come into the system. We're now lapping those synergies. And so what you're going to see basically in that business going forward is really just organic growth. It's sales pouring in. And in this case, it's transaction volume overcoming COVID softness in the base, since that big sales that we keep telling you about is layering on. And so we're going to have this kind of, call it, high teens, 20% kind of growth rate in this business, provided the sales continued. No, I'd say, we're pretty disciplined and balanced. So it's not -- when you say pouring fuel on the fire, everything we do is going to be incremental. It will be balanced. But what we try to do as a company is shift what we call calories. So I can make certain investments in back office stuff. I can make investments in sales and marketing. I much prefer the latter versus the former. \n And so we're very, very disciplined in cost control in all of our operations. And that way, we can put some disproportionate investment in sales and marketing, while still managing the bottom line effectively. So I would not anticipate any kind of dramatic changes in that regard. It's more of a shift in spending versus big incremental investment. So on the fuel card business, Mihir, we are still seeing some of that softness still in the small businesses, as we mentioned earlier, so that's still -- waiting for that to come back. In terms of some of the industries, manufacturing has been a bit slow. Obviously, transportation as such, public transportation, things of that nature has been a little slow in our local fuel business. \n The Europe stuff had bounced back more, as shown in our volume exhibits. To your point, we're watching the lockdowns. I think in terms of the nature of those lockdowns, they don't seem quite as severe, at least is what I've read in the press regarding how far they're going to shut down. So we're still waiting to see what that impact will look like. So I'd say, to be determined. Nothing further on our end, guys. Let me know if you need anything else, I'm always available. So have a good evening."

Upfront here, I plan to cover 4 subjects, so first, provide my perspective on Q3 and our Q4 outlook; second, provide an update on our AFEX cross-border acquisition; third, I'll discuss our plans for pivoting the work of the company in getting back on offense; and then finally, I'll close with some preliminary thoughts on next year.\n Okay. So let's start with our Q3 results. So earlier, we reported Q3 revenue of $585 million, that's down 14%, and cash EPS at $2.80, that's down 10% versus last year.\n We did manage operating expenses down 9% in Q3 versus last year, obviously, to minimize the impact on our bottom line. The macro, not helpful in the quarter, primarily weaker Brazilian FX, we estimate that it depressed our Q3 print revenue by approximately $33 million. Organic revenue growth, overall in the quarter, down 12% versus last year, but that is a sequential improvement of 5% from Q2. \n Corporate pay also improved sequentially, their revenue, down 11% in Q3 versus was down 17% in Q2. We did see a step rate improvement in what we call same-store sales or client softness between Q2 and Q3. So softness improved to minus 8% in the quarter versus minus 17% in Q2. So that's a pretty significant softness recovery point-to-point, or said another way, increased client usage.\n Good news on the client retention front, we improved a point there to 92%, highlights to us again that all of the weakness is attributable to client softness. Sales recovering further here in Q3, finishing at 80% of the prior year. That's up from 54% of the prior year in Q2. Inside of that, our corporate pay sales in the quarter finished at 100% of the prior year, so nice rebound there. \n Credit performance, nothing short of outstanding. Our Q3 credit losses finishing lower than last year and even $8 million better sequentially than Q2. \n So look, in summary, Q3 clearly a better quarter for us than Q2. Volumes, step rate recovery, client softness, rebounded client retention, even in these wacky times ticking up a point. Sales starting to get back to normal, recovering to 80% of last year. We are managing expenses down. And our credit performance, again, really strong. Really pleased with credit. So all in all, an improving performance. \n So in terms of transitioning to expectations for Q4, really just share a couple of thoughts. Historically, FLEETCOR's Q3 and Q4 performance has been pretty similar in terms of revenue and earnings because weakness from seasonality or fewer business days is generally offset by the business growth that comes online throughout the year. But this quarter, I mean, we're really not sure what to expect, whether volumes will further recover or whether they'll just flatten and plateau where they are. \n So we are planning a couple of things. We're going to manage operating expenses down about 10% to 12% below last year. And we are forecasting sales to further strengthen, hopefully coming in more than 90% of the prior year. So it's a bit of a wait and see. \n Okay. Let me make the turn to AFEX, the B2B cross-border payment company that we signed up and announced in September. So it's a bit of a Cambridge look-alike. About 2/3 the size of Cambridge in revenue, although far less profitable, was a grower, growing preteens pre-COVID, and it's outlook in 2020 performance to be about flat with 2019. The rationale for the deal, really pretty straightforward. It's a business that we know and like. It's a business growing on its own, with obviously a big TAM. And as we mentioned in the press release, a business that's quite complementary to ours as it strengthens our position in Europe and Asia. \n So our conviction in the AFEX synergy plan is quite high, having just run this drill a few years ago with Cambridge. And so once closed, integrated and really fully run-rated, we're expecting accretion in the $0.25 to $0.50 cash EPS range, so we think a good contributor. So in terms of timing, we're still tracking to a Q1 2021 close, obviously subject to customary regulatory and antitrust approvals. \n Okay. My next-up subject is kind of pivoting the work of the company and getting back on offense. So like lots of companies, we've been quite consumed with our COVID response work, lots of energy against that, and feeling we're coming out the other side, and now we can kind of redirect our energies to certain things. And so those certain things are, one, sales. Super focused on getting sales back, and you see a bit of the recovery, kind of 50% sales production versus last year in Q2, 80% this quarter, Q3, and hopefully getting to above 90%. So some evidence that sales performance is returning to normalized levels. We are making investments now in anticipation of next year, adding salespeople and making some select digital investments. And we have, since we talked last, reopened credit to pre-COVID levels across a lot of our businesses in an effort to improve our approval rates. \n We're back on the tech front. We've stepped back up investments in tech, particularly around digital tech investments. So we've developed and launched a new client UI, getting very favorable user experience scores back. It's a mobile-centric platform. So really, a big improvement in the client-facing front end. We're getting better at using API layers to speed, interfaces and connections to partners and accounting systems, which helps us with our ERP integrations that contributes a lot of leads in our corporate payments business. So tech, back on. \n Interestingly, we've begun to embrace electric vehicle recharging in Europe. We've actually added EV networks in the U.K., the Netherlands and Germany. And these EV networks basically complement the traditional fueling networks because the clients are keen to have their program, their total purchases consolidated across their mixed fleet, and they want that data all in one place. \n So surprisingly, the economics are kind of okay of EV. And mixed fleets, it's literally almost neutral to us. We continue to get card fees for the electric vehicles. We get higher MDR rates when they're in the charging network. And we even get subscription fees to monitor and report on at-home and at-work charging. So look, at least initially here, we seem advantaged as an integrator or consolidator as clients transition their fleets to EV. \n And then in terms of acquisitions, we're back pretty aggressively on the acquisitions front. So in addition to AFEX, we are chasing a couple new deals that are in and around our corporate payment space. And so comfortable with our liquidity and management capacity to get after those. \n Okay. So last up today is really us looking into next year, into 2021. So I do want to point out a few signs of optimism for us in the setup. So one, we obviously had a big impact from COVID on client softness. So we do expect further COVID recovery of volumes and revenue from existing clients, and that's incremental to what we've -- the recovery that we've already seen. \n Two, again, sales, we do expect those to be up significantly. Already seeing some of that, and that will contribute way more in-year revenue from new business. Third, we're back resuming our Beyond initiatives, which are cross-sell efforts really to get additional revenues out of existing clients. So we expect, again, incremental contribution from that. \n Fourth, our trends, particularly client retention and credit, roll forward into next year. So super, super helpful as we outlook '21 performance. And then lastly, on the deal front, we will -- we do expect to close the AFEX acquisition and, as I mentioned, maybe even a couple of more. So some new deals maybe in the mix in 2021. So look, all in all, some -- we think, some positive factors in our setup for next year. \n So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Chuck? Yes, David, it's Ron. I think it hinges totally on the kind of sick client group that we laid out in the supplement. So the sickest client in the T&E business way, way down, which is having that thing penciled out at minus 11% for the quarter, kind of flat without those. \n So clearly, the non-T&E, non-sick people will be a growing business in 2021 as we look at the plans. The wildcard is how much of that softness that we're seeing still here in Q3 will come back. So that's the debate we're having, and we're obviously watching it closely. To Chuck's point, we saw a little encouraging sign intra-quarter there in virtual cars. It looked like it was getting a little bit healthier. \n So I'd say -- it's not a super answer, but I'd say, if you park the 2 sick portions for sure, you will see, again, mid- to high-teens growth for the rest of that business. To your point, based on the sales and the forecast we have for Q4 is another good one. So the sales are clearly there to grow that business. I'd say, probably, the philosophy, David, is the same as always. We do have a number of deals that we're working on, and I think we called it out in the press release, including a couple that are close-in, kind of late stage. So we're always balanced and right the liquidity that we need for the deals in front of us versus opportunistic on the share price. So I'd say, it's, a, function of those 2 things. If there's a lot of deals we like, we've got conviction in, we'll spend the money on that. And if people trade our stock to a price that -- where buyers will buy it back. So the goal was to give us the management, the flexibility to make those calls. But I think, Chuck, our liquidity or availability is still well north of $1 billion? So we do have plenty to go, and obviously, the ability, David, to borrow more money. So capital [ isn't ] the main question for us. Yes. I'm not sure on the sales thing. It's -- I used the word tension, but It's pent-up demand. I'd say that it's 2 things. One, that the marketplace, the prospect universe is kind of getting back to listening again. They're less distracted. So what we do, we go in and analyze and that Google Analytics package, search volumes across all of our categories against baselines. And we see in that outside-in data the planet getting more receptive again to the kinds of things that we offer. So that's point one, which is obviously super important. \n And then point two, I think we finally have the rhythm of how to sell. We all ran home and fuel people became phone people, and we remixed more money to digital. And we shrunk credit, now we've opened credit. So I think we ying-ed and yang-ed in our various channels, and now we've got kind of a sense of how to do it, how to play the game as it is now. \n And so this 80% number, which was pretty good in lots of places, particularly in corporate pay, I'm looking at a forecast that's over 90% for Q4. We've obviously got one of the months in the can. So I'd say of all the areas, that's the one where I feel like we have more control over our future. We stay in this kind of a place, the fact that we can continue to move that number up as we roll forward, so pretty confident. Yes. We are -- the reason -- I don't know on the disclosures how much detail we give you, but one of the reasons it looks like there's not a step-up in sales and marketing is the commission rolls are soft, right, because of the bad performance in Q2 and now just improving performance. \n But we made the call probably 60 days ago to start to step-up investments, both in people, on the recruiting front and a certain kind of new digital campaign. So no, it's -- again, it's the one -- it's the key to the company, right? When you get all done with this softness, sickness thing of who is healthy and who is not, we still have a business you can plan, right? Whatever you give me, that baseline and then we lap whatever the softness or hardness is, we got a business that we can run 10% on the top. And so we're back at that game trying to build a sales plan for next year that keeps the company rolling in that fashion. And it's -- I mean, what I'd say back is that's a bunch of words, but more importantly, when 90%, 50%, 80%, and we're forecasting above 90%, so there's real evidence that it's working. Yes. I mean we -- this is a thing called down the fairway. But number one, that playbook, which is part of our model for every deal, worked quite well. I mean I think we reported or in one of these calls, I told you that we've more than doubled the profitability of Cambridge between '17 and '19. And so the first point is, yes, we'll reinstitute that same playbook for AFEX. \n But then the second one is, that there's 2 businesses now that look the same. So there's a second bite of synergies in the combinations that we didn't have obviously in the Cambridge deal. So that's why we gave the range. Obviously, our thinking is the 2 steps of thing, make sure we understand it. So we'll run them. And we started the planning for that thing to get to first phase. And then as we get smarter, for example, they've done a small business in North America in a management layer, call it, the last 10%, 15% of the Cambridge business we have. So we'll clearly assimilate things like that, and they have way stronger positions in Asia. So it sets up really well, both to grow the business and to make it way more profitable, so we like it. Yes, that's, Steven, a super, super good question. I mean I think some of the softness this year at 2020 is not only sales, but what you said in that business implementations, because we kind of sell the year before and then implement the year after. And so a number of implementations in that business have been stalled, slowed as we certainly went through the second quarter and are starting to kind of reactivate. So the million-dollar question there, just like David's earlier is, how many of those implementations will hold? Will people stay with them if they agree to do the thing 3 or 6 months ago? And will they be away from their distractions where they could work hand and hand with us to implement the thing?\n So I think it's the same -- a bit of the same question, which is we've got a book of business that we can convert into revenue there, but we need cooperation of the clients that have agreed. So to the extent that they're agreeable, that, back to your point, will accelerate some of the recovery next year. And to the extent that it doesn't, they quit on the thing or they continue to back burner it, then that won't be helpful. So I think we're just seeing now signs in the last month or 2 of those implementations kind of getting back to a targeted level. Yes. I think the Brazil and the other ones, we did slow things down mostly around our credit paranoia back when this thing first broke. So we've obviously relaxed that, and then be just their population getting back out and about, right, driving around, refueling, going to fast food places, going back into the city, and they had a big closure like we did here in terms of their malls and stuff. So it was a real slowdown in the Beyond areas, right, of fueling, parking and fast food. \n That's kind of recovered. They've kind of reopened the country. So we're seeing those transaction volumes tick back up. And we're also seeing it on new sales. I think you've heard that a big part of that initiative is to attract people that are kind of in the city that aren't toll people that want to use those things. Well, obviously, when there's no need to use those things, it's not as interesting a pitch. So we're seeing it in the last month or 2 that gets resonating again as the activities picked up. So I wouldn't say it's all the way back to pre-levels, but it is way back from where they were in Q2. Say the question -- Ashish, it's Ron, just so I got it again? Yes. You're saying the difference between the volume recovery versus the revenue? I mean I'd say in the virtual card business, a lot of it is mix that some of our channel partners that have lower revenue to us per spend dollar have recovered more, think of the people that are investing lots in sales and marketing. And then obviously, we have, again, some series of sicker clients and the -- unfortunately for us, they used to pay us more. \n So I'd say that probably the biggest delta between that exhibit would be the mix. There's a fair number of pretty large clients on both sides of that wheel, some clients that are going up, like health care, as an example, would be like a perfect example. That had a, I don't have it in front of me, but a dramatic step up Q2 to Q3. It's kind of elective surgery and kind of normal hospital stuff kind of came back. And our margins in that health care business are way worse than in kind of the more traditional horizontal kind of a business. So that would be the partners, if you will, the wholesale business and the health care business have recovered better than some of the other businesses that pay us more. Yes, I keep saying -- I mean obviously, it's a super strange time and stuff. But I think if you said what's the most surprising thing to us is how well those businesses, both our domestic and international fuel have recovered. I mean the softness recovery, I'm not sure I have it in front of me, but literally, I think our international business existing clients, we call same-store sales, was down 25% or something literally in Q2, and recovered a ton. Again, I don't have it in front of me, but I think it is to 5%, picked up kind of 20 points or something in the improvement. So that would be something. And then even in the U.S., I think it's improved. If it was down 15% or 20%, it's down 10% or something. So that is what I'd say is the biggest thing. \n Our applications are way up again because that Google outside-in, the world is more interested in searching again on fuel cards and fleet cards, so we're beneficiaries of that. Although, again, I think in the new business, we're still being a bit more careful in credit with the super small accounts, which tend to be in our fuel card business, is where we have smaller accounts. So we're still concerned with fraud and stuff. So we're being -- our approval rates are still lower in that line of business. \n But it's doing, Ashish, I think, significantly better, particularly in the third quarter on the strength of the -- really, again, the clients coming back and the forecast from our guys are even more recovery there. So it's doing well. Let me, Matt, this is Ron, take the first half on credit, and then Chuck could take the expenses. I'd say that, no, it wasn't a green light at the beginning of the quarter where we turned the thing on. It's been very segmented. So we've moved at different speeds with different businesses. We've moved at different speeds with existing clients versus new clients. And we've moved at different speeds for super small clients, like we get in the fuel card business. \n So when I said in the comment that we were kind of back, I'd say, we are. We've gone back to medium and large clients, and re-extended their terms, days to pay and stuff that we had shortened. We've increased some of the credit lines again, so we could get more greater share of their business. But we continue to be careful on some of the Beyond because obviously, that increases our credit exposure, our credit limits within a single client, right, which we view as a bit more risk. \n And we continue to be cautious on the digital new business because they're coming in not as well as green as if they run through our people and they're smaller. So I'd say, it happened over the last 4 or 5 months, and sitting here today, it's probably, Chuck, I don't know, 80% or 85% back to normal with this Beyond and the small digital being the couple of exceptions. But we are tradable, Matt. When we see credit losses come in the way they have the last 2 quarters, we look and we see roll rates and all kinds of stuff that we look at and were like, huh, I guess we, along with some other people, maybe overreacted to the credit risk. And part of it is the essential nature, again, right, of what we do to people want to get our programs because it's part of their day-to-day jobs. \n And then, b, the velocity of what our receivables are, we have all kinds of stuff like daily terms, daily net buys and stuff and trucking. So our terms are quite rapid. So we've been, again, just super fortunate. And so we're now trying to lean back towards the growth side and saying, okay, we're open to taking a bit more credit risk now that we see it's controlled. Bob, it's Ron. It's a good question. I think we described this business to you before, we look at it kind of like as a game board, so kind of chessboard, and it's got segments on it. So it's got kind of small, medium and large companies, and then it's got off to different verticals and stuff. And so if you look at the early days of the corporate pay or payables business, players are kind of going after certain cell. So some guy is focus on some verticals like us even, take construction, is a big part of our business. Some people like our pals, Bill.com, focused on super small clients and so on. \n So the first thing I'd say to you is, we're acutely aware and focused on those, if you look at that game board, which ones were capable to be good at today and then what capabilities would we need to be good as some of the cells were not in. So there's a few verticals that we like, that I like a lot, that we'd like to be in, where there's connections to ERPs and client references that we need, so some opportunities maybe to buy into some of those. And then the same on size, right? One of the things we've debated is do we take our full AP product that's a super good product, but target it in the mid-market and make a down-market version, so that we can chase that to the 500,000 little clients we have with it.\n So I'd say that, that's -- the primary thing is widening the capabilities to play in more of those segments. And then, b, I think I told you in the prior calls, the running up the value chain, like, for example, getting good at invoice automation. So the client doesn't have to open 100 invoices and tear them open and somehow get them into their system, and then we help them pay it, but maybe be more helpful to them as they pull those invoices and digitize those invoices. \n So those are the 2 games. We're going to get wider in the segments, and I'm hoping you'll hear more about that, and we'll get kind of broader in the value chain of the adjacency. So a year or 2 from now, you'll see us more in those 2 spots. Yes. I'm not going to answer that, other than say, obviously, we always look at the made by, so we're analyzing all of those options. All I can tell you is, we'll have this. We're committed, to your point, to this space, and we're looking at the various ways to get wider in this game and we will be wider in this game. Yes, I don't know, John, whether we're making this point clear why we put this thing in here. Again, no one understands this better than you guys of how COVID and shutdowns have helped some companies and hurt some companies and then super hurt some companies, the whole distribution. \n I guess the headline we're trying to give is that partitioning of impact sits in our client base. So when we look at the business that we built, it's a function of the health of our clients. And so just like the investments that you guys look at, we have some set in all of our businesses of super sick clients that we didn't know could get so sick, using fuel cards or corporate pay products. \n And so the softness and the down performance of our company is really, as we've said, mostly now just a function of the health of a narrow group of our clients because we're back selling, our retention is fine, our credit's fine. And so the other parts of our business that allow our business to go forward, fortunately, are kind of okay again. So it's really just -- the point of it is really just we have, in our 800,000 clients, ones that were massively impacted by this thing and continue to be. Yes. Let me start, George, with the second question first and then come back to the U.S. I'd say this is another one a bit like our credit thing. Probably all of you were like, oh, sheez, FLEETCOR's got fuel cards, and oh my god, it's going to be electric vehicles and oh, they won't have any business or whatever. Okay. So we're like, oh my god, I wondered when a client that's got 20 plumbing trucks gets 2 or 3 electric vehicles, while our business go down 10% or 15%.\n So what I was really trying to report now that we're in the game is no. That example of a mixed fleet, our business is basically flat. And I'm studying this over the last 6 months. I'm like -- what is going on here, guys? And the answer is that the business wants to know about their vehicles and usage and purchases and what the people are doing, frankly, across the entire 20 vehicle population in that example. \n And so having a card in a way that the 20 people can still all buy and get reported on one account, I guess we didn't really realize how valuable that was to companies, and they're willing to pay. They're still paying card fees on those 3 electric plumbing trucks and they're -- obviously, we're getting paid for the new networks we've established. And they even want to know when those things are getting charged because they have admin to do with their employees, right? Their employees want to kind of get reimbursed, if you will, for at-home charging, the gadgets and the electricity and stuff. And so the headline for everybody is, at least initially, while the fleets are mixed, it's not a big -- we don't view it as a big drag, which, to me, I want to tell that story because we think it's pretty good news. \n On the second question, I think it's as much a government question as anything. Look, the reason that some of the countries we're in, in Europe are ahead in EV is the government has set it up that way, right, in terms of incentives and targets and stuff that they've set up. So maybe we'll know something tonight or tomorrow here about our government. But I think a lot of it, the pace at which the U.S. will try to catch up, I think, is going to be a function really of the incentives that are put out there, how high a priority it is. But again, my guess is the behaviors will be probably pretty similar to what we're seeing. Networks will get billed, networks that work will get billed, and we'll probably copy the same playbook for a while. So to me, it just keeps pushing out the electric vehicle impact on our company. Yes, that's new sales, Trevor. So we keep track of what we call annualized new business. We sign up 30,000 clients in the quarter, how much revenue will they create. And so we have a system that measures that. So yes. So I say, hey, we were 50% of new business. Now Q3, we're at 80%, and we hope to be at 90% or 90%-plus, that's comparing new business we got in Q3 this year to the amount of new business we got in Q3 last year. I mean let me go back to what I said earlier that Togut asked, which is, once you normalize this base softness or wherever it is, this is -- I want to make sure everyone gets it, this is the game. If you could get sales, right, to be more than attrition, and we said retention ticked up a point, it is the key to planning this machine running forward. So we will lap the softness, even though we're recovering some. So I don't want people to miss how important this metric is to us and to the revenue growth going forward. Yes. Let me just add to what Chuck said. The answer is yes to are there super sick clients like we show in corporate pay. We run the distributions of the clients. So let's say we had 100,000 clients, we basically put them in layers, call it, 5 or 6 layers, hey, 25,000 of the 100,000 have grown, hey, 25,000 are down like 5% or 10%, hey, 25,000 are down 20% to 30%, and then 6,000 are down 80% or more. \n So we see the whole distribution of super impacted industries versus industries that were nicked by, we're going to have one less plumber because some homes won't accept them. So it's not quite as stark as it is in the corporate pay business. And again, it's why we've seen actually more recovery, if you will, of our same-store sales in the fuel business than in the corporate pay, because we have retailers and maritime payroll and hotels, things that don't move that have been shuttered that are in our corporate pay business. So we were just dealt a more impacted set of clients, effectively sitting in that business. Thanks, everybody."

So I can assure you, he'll be a terrific CFO. \n Okay. So back to my prepared remarks, in which I'll cover 4 subjects. So first, I'll report on the progress against the initial COVID response plan that we undertook. Second, I'll provide my perspective on Q2 results. Third, I'll speak to the trends, the line of business trends that we're seeing here in July, along with thoughts on rest of the year. And then lastly, I'll provide our perspective on Fleet's long-term prospects in a post-COVID world. \n Okay. So let me begin by summarizing the progress against the COVID response plan that we put into motion in Q2. It was focused against 6 areas. So first was safety. So very pleased to report today, we've had very few positive virus cases among our 8,000 global employees. And fortunately, no one seriously ill, so very, very happy with that. \n Two, on business continuity, we've been able to deliver our services in this new remote environment. And we can report again in Q2 that our systems performance and uptime were very good. \n Three, credit. We're delighted, honestly, with our Q2 credit results. Came in at, I think, $21 million, which was about our original loss plan and receivables aging continues to look quite good. So a real bright spot so far. \n Fourth, liquidity. We quickly tried to strengthen our liquidity back at the beginning of the quarter. We stepped up collections intensity. We repatriated cash. We even secured a bridge loan. So today, liquidity is quite good, $1.9 billion and our leverage ratio, 2.6x. \n Expenses, we anticipated, obviously, weakness in Q2 so we trimmed expenses. We actually managed our expenses $50 million lower, which is 20% lower than the original plan that we built, so that cushioned our Q2 profits. \n And then last is selling. We knew in this new remote world, we'd have to sell differently so lots of progress around targeting different kinds of companies, new ways to get leads, providing new tools for our salespeople to work at home, new monitoring approaches, so really a revamped selling model that started to rebound. \n So I do want to give a shout-out really to all the FLEETCOR employees who jumped on these set of things. It was quite urgent to get at these things. So IT, HR, credit, sales management, really good performance. \n Okay. Let me make the turn over to our Q2 results. So we reported Q2 revenue of $525 million, which is down 19% and cash EPS of $2.28, which is down 20% versus prior year. So our expense reduction actions helped narrow our profit decline. In terms of organic revenue for the quarter, finishing down 17% behind the prior year overall. Fuel coming in at minus 16% so about line average. Corporate pay at minus 17%. Lodging in total at minus 37% but the workforce portion, somewhere in the high 20s. And toll in the plus column, plus 3% for the quarter, driven by its subscription model. \n In terms of trends in Q2, obviously affected by COVID, same-store sales, the big one, declined 17% so about the same as our organic revenue growth as we saw client softness really across every business. Thankfully, client retention remains stable at 91%. And new sales weren't great, about half of last year's level for the quarter but clearly rebounding as we move through the quarter. \n So it's pretty hard to reflect on a quarter like this but kind of here is my conclusion. It's -- for us, it's really a story, Q2, of client softness. And client softness being way down as a result of COVID because if you look at other aspects of our business, they were generally kind of okay, retention stable at 91%. Feeling good about finding a new way to sell in this environment and confirm that we can keep selling our services in this environment. Credit didn't bite us, loss was about on plan. We flexed expenses down to keep profits kind of in line with revenue, right-sized the company. And we generated $200 million of free cash flow in the quarter. So a few bright spots. \n Okay, let me transition to the trends that we're seeing in July and how we're thinking about the rest of the year. So we've included in the earnings supplement a line of business volume chart that runs through the last few months, including July. And you'll see there that really every business we have has at least bottomed out, and many of the businesses are recovering and recovering a bit more quickly in July. They're affected really by the entire client distribution. So clients that are down a little bit, clients that are down a medium amount, clients that are down a super lot. When we look at those distributions, they're all moving up, so all clients are kind of moving back up, adding volume. \n So just a couple of callouts. You can see international fuel recovering very nicely as Europe out ahead of us on the COVID thing. And our high-growth businesses, full AP, tolls, Russia, simply just powering through their client softness because of lots of new business. So clearly, things getting better. \n In terms of rest of year, we do expect continued improvement but we will still have challenges here short term. So volume, we think, will continue to recover but unclear as to how quickly. Our second half revenues will recover more slowly than volume and that's mostly because of mix. We're seeing larger enterprise clients with lower rates recover faster than our small business portfolio. We expect the macro, particularly FX, to continue to weigh on our second half year versus prior year. We do expect sales to continue to recover to get better. We're hopeful of getting back to 90% of prior year as we exit 2020. And then lastly, expenses, we plan to continue to manage expenses down here in the second half, targeting about 10% lower expense levels than prior year. So in conclusion, Q3 and 4 will be better than Q2 but again still challenging. \n So last, let me transition here over to kind of a long-term view of FLEETCOR and how all of this impacts the company. I mean at the headline level, we think the new behaviors coming out of COVID will be a mixed bag. There's puts and takes. But the main point is we think that those new behaviors will impact us kind of at the margins, if you will, of our business. And at the core, because it's essential workers that keep powering on, that the core of our business will hold up quite well. So negative impacts that we expect long term is probably less white collar commuting long term, which again, will impact our European fuel card businesses a bit at the edges because some have white-collar fuel cards. Likely less business travel at least over the midterm, so that will dampen our T&E card business and our airline crew lodging business. And then the accelerated shift to digital and digital purchasing and away from face-to-face shopping will create pressure on our gift card business. \n On the positive front, the whole work-from-home, remote working model certainly will drive demand for outsourcing, outsourcing of everything generally. So that will lift our payables business, we think, our virtual card and our full AP prospects. And the preference for touchless and avoidance of attendance, we think, will lift demand for really almost all of our card businesses. So fuel cards, pay at the pump versus in-store; Brazil nonstop electric tolls versus cash booths; payroll cards that are reloadable versus payroll checks; virtual cards instead of printing AP checks. \n So look, again, the headline is that our view is that these impacts, we think, are at the margin and at the core of what we do is serve clients with essential workers and that there'll be continuing demand for good payment solutions for that group of clients. So what do we do? We wait for our clients and the world to recover here. We're going to stay focused on what we can control and what we can do. Namely, that's to advance the 3 main priorities, primary priorities of the company. \n So one is portfolio. We're continuing to look at things to reposition our portfolio, create fewer, bigger businesses, add more nonfuel businesses, add more faster-growing businesses and likely more adjacencies. \n Second, penetration of our big 4 businesses. We're working again to enhance our products, create more sales pressure, strengthen our cross-sell channels back to our clients. We're also pushing our Beyond strategy, which transforms our businesses and their TAM both through broadening what each business offers but more importantly maybe, the segments that each of our businesses can target. So for example, urban city dwellers in Brazil versus highway toll users or airline crew lodging versus only workforce people. \n And then lastly, we're working on strengthening the base capabilities of the company, a particular emphasis on tech, on technology. So you'll see us invest more in IT, more in IT transformation. We'll move more applications to the cloud. We'll improve digital UIs and DIs for clients. We'll continue to advance our cybersecurity protection, so we'll continue to get better at IT. \n So from our perspective, if we keep progressing these 3 priorities, portfolio, business penetration and our capabilities, it supports our ambition of a 15% to 20% profit growth company. \n So look, in closing, Q2 -- our Q2 performance, again, really a story of same-store sales, client softness as a result of COVID, again with other aspects of our business, particularly retention and credit holding up nicely. Second half, for sure, better than Q2, but again still challenging, we think, over the short term. But I think most importantly, longer term, the message from us today is that the core, the main thing that we do around the world, which is to serve clients essential services, payments needs, we think that, that remains quite good, quite robust. And that we see puts and takes again around the margins of our business as it relates to COVID. \n So with that, let me turn the call one more time back over to Eric to provide some additional details on the quarter. Eric? \nEric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. \n For the second quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of $525.1 million, down 19% compared to $647.1 million in the second quarter of 2019. GAAP net income decreased 39% to $158.5 million from $261.7 million. And GAAP net income per diluted share decreased 37% to $1.83 from $2.90 in the second quarter of 2019. However, there were a couple of unusual items in the quarter that I want to call out. The second quarter of 2020 was impacted by a $9.8 million discrete tax item related to a prior tax position and a gain on the company's investment in Bill.com of approximately $34 million. Also, in the second quarter of 2019 was a tax benefit of approximately $65 million related to the sale of the company's investment in Masternaut. Excluding these discrete items, net income decreased 28% and net income per diluted share decreased 25%. \n Non-GAAP financial metrics that we will be discussing are adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. And the reconciliation to GAAP numbers is provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2020 decreased 23% to $197.4 million compared to $256.7 million in the same period last year. And adjusted net income per diluted share decreased 20% to $2.28 compared to $2.85 in adjusted net income per diluted share in the second quarter of 2019. \n Second quarter of 2020 results reflect a negative year-over-year impact from the macroeconomic environment of approximately $22 million in revenue. The negative macro was driven mostly by lower foreign exchange rates, primarily in Brazil, when compared with the second quarter of 2019. We believe FX negatively impacted revenue by approximately $35 million. Fuel prices were down year-over-year for the full quarter, and although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe it unfavorably impacted revenue by approximately $13 million in the quarter. And finally, fuel spreads were quite favorable for most of the quarter and had about a $26 million favorable impact in the quarter. Organic revenue in the quarter was a negative 17% overall, driven primarily by same-store sales softness of 17%. \n All of our major product categories were impacted by the COVID pandemic in the quarter, some more than others. Our fuel category was down organically about 16%. There are a lot of moving parts to our fuel businesses around the world. Our fuel volumes in our international business were impacted more than the U.S. fuel businesses. Both geographies' volumes bottomed out in April, and we have been recovering in May, June and into July. Volumes should continue to improve over the remainder of the year, barring any setbacks in the reopening of the economy. And although volumes seemed they're recovering, revenues are recovering at a slower rate in the fuel category as large enterprise account volumes with lower rates are improving faster than our SMB accounts, which have higher revenue per gallon. \n The corporate payments category was down organically approximately 17% in the second quarter. As a reminder, our corporate payments business is made up of virtual cards, cross-border payments, full-service AP accounts and physical T&E plastic, cross-sold mostly to our virtual card customers. The same-store sales softness in corporate payments came mostly from accounts in the travel, oil and gas, retail and elective health care verticals. We are seeing some recovery in verticals other than travel and the retail verticals, which we expect will recover at a slower rate. \n Our full-service AP business continues to perform well and is growing in the mid- to high double-digit range. Our toll category has proven to be our most resilient business and grew organically at 3% in the second quarter. Most of the revenue in this category is subscription-based and has not been significantly impacted by the slowdown in the Brazilian economy due to COVID. The products that have been impacted are mostly the Beyond Toll products where we earn interchange, like parking, fuel and fast food, where volumes had decreased significantly. Our expectation is for these revenues to recover as the Brazilian economy starts to reopen and recover. \n The lodging category is made up of our legacy lodging business, which provides lodging accommodation services to workforce travelers and emergency service organizations such as FEMA and the Red Cross. This business was down 29% organically in the second quarter. And our airline lodging business, which provides lodging accommodation services primarily to the airline crew and distressed passenger segments was down 68% in the quarter. Our expectation is for our workforce lodging business to see continued improvement as this business mostly provides lodging for blue-collar workers who generally drive vehicles to the hotel. This business has been impacted much less than other travel-related businesses. However, we do expect revenue in the category to recover slower as large enterprise accounts with lower rates are recovering faster than our SMB accounts. We expect our airline lodging business recovery to be slower and is linked to the recovery of the airline industry. \n Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses were down 11% for the second quarter of 2020 to $312.3 million compared with $349.8 million in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in costs related to decreases in volume, cost cutting initiatives implemented in the second quarter and the impact of foreign exchange rates. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 59.5% compared to 54.1% in the second quarter of 2019. Bad debt expense in the second quarter of 2020 was $21.3 million or 7 basis points compared to $18 million or 7 basis points in the second quarter of 2019. Bad debt has been one of the more surprising bright spots as our agings are mostly normal, particularly given the environment we are in today. Any increase in bad debt has been driven mostly by one-off bankruptcies versus increases in aging categories. \n Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 12% to $62.2 million in the second quarter of 2020 from $70.9 million in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. Interest expense decreased 18% to $32.4 million compared to $39.5 million in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease in interest expense was due primarily to decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt, partially offset by the impact of additional borrowing for share buybacks and lower borrowings on our securitization facility due to lower volumes in the second quarter. \n Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2020 was 25.1% compared to a negative 1.7% for the second quarter of 2019. The second quarter of 2020 was impacted by a $9.8 million increase in the reserve for uncertain tax positions related to prior years. Also with the second quarter of 2019 was a tax benefit of approximately $65 million related to the sale of the company's investment in Masternaut. Excluding these discrete items, our tax rate would have been 20.4% in the second quarter of 2020, and the tax rate in the second quarter of 2019 would have been 23.6%. The decrease in the tax rate was due primarily to excess tax benefit on stock option exercises. \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.19 billion in total cash. Approximately $426 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. As of June 30, 2020, we had $3.8 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $654 million borrowed in our securitization facility. We believe that we have ample liquidity to weather any COVID scenario and to pursue any near-term M&A opportunities. In total, we have approximately $1.9 billion in total liquidity, consisting of cash on the balance sheet, undrawn revolver and the undrawn bridge loan. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 127,000 shares in connection with employee stock sales for $32.2 million as employees forfeited shares to cover taxes. And we have approximately $294 million in repurchase capacity remaining under our current authorization. As of June 30, 2020, our leverage ratio was 2.62x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA as calculated under our credit agreement. Finally, we spent approximately $19.4 million on CapEx during the second quarter of 2020. \n Now turning to the outlook for the balance of the year. I want to remind everyone that although our businesses are very resilient, our businesses have all been impacted by the COVID pandemic, some more than others. Our business models are primarily recurring revenue in nature. We have very broad customer bases and diversified businesses across industries and geographies. We are not reinstating our guidance at this point. There is simply too much uncertainty regarding the resumption of business activity around the world to accurately predict what our volumes could be the rest of the year. \n We do expect that second half of the year volume will continue to improve as the economy improves. However, we expect second half of the year revenues to recover more slowly than volume because larger enterprise accounts with lower rates will likely recover faster than our SMB portfolio. We also expect that the macro will continue to be a drag on revenue due to lower expected fuel prices and foreign exchange rates when compared to last year. \n And finally, before I turn the call over for questions, I want to thank Ron for his kind words earlier. It has been quite a ride over the last 18 years. I have spent some time thinking about my FLEETCOR journey and really cannot believe everything that we have accomplished over this period of time, and I cannot think of many things I would rather have done. I have known Charles for a long time and I can say that there is not a person better equipped to take over this challenging role. I will be around to help with the transition over the next several months and look forward to catching up with many of you before I head off into the next chapter of my life. \n And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Eric, let me add my thanks as well, it's been a fun ride. I can't believe it's been that long, so hopefully we can [ meet soon ]. \n My question -- I think my first question is just thinking about, Ron, your comments and the 3 priorities. And you mentioned adjacencies as being a probable area. I was hoping maybe you could expand on that. Do you think of adjacencies similar to what you did with entering the tolling business? Or is it more like entering the AP automation side of things? Just trying to think about how far you might go when you think about adjacencies. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Tien-Tsin, sitting here next to Mr. Sentimental, so I share your sentiment. I can't believe how long [ you have been with us ]. All good things come to an end. \n Yes. So the adjacency thing I mentioned, I guess, in the last call, so it came out of this idea of looking at the clients, kind of what they do before or after the payment. And so I gave the example last time in corporate pay and the payables business, all the front end of invoice, prep and workflow and approvals and all that stuff before we press the pay button. So we continue to look kind of at the front end of those things to see if we can be more helpful again to clients. \n And another example would be kind of in the core fuel card business. And particularly with SMBs, there are other kinds of software, a little bit what the acquirers have done, First Data and Global are the software that nests around what our small business guys do. And an old example [ of work rate is telematics ]. So we were trying to figure out if there was another service, another software service close to fuel cards that dealt with steel SMB people. So we have a couple of things that we're looking at there, where there's some software that's in the categories, in the verticals that we're in. \n So again, the thought of it is not only to be more helpful to the clients that we've got to do more for them but also from the selling perspective, right, that those adjacencies bring books of clients that we could cross-sell to so it may help us sell as well. So those would be a couple of examples. So in each one of [ the areas, we decided kind of the front and the back ] around our services. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Got you. Okay, that's good to know. My follow-up real quick and I'll get off the call. Just on the new sales visibility. Obviously, these new sales were impacted this quarter. Just as we think about replenishing in the second half of the year, how much visibility do you have there and just sort of the quality of the sales that you see as we -- as you get beyond the summer? \nRonald F. Clarke: Tien-Tsin, you broke out just a little. Can you -- if you can hear us well, can you repeat the question? \nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes, sorry. I know my cell signal's bad. I have no power on that. Just the new sales outlook and visibility and your confidence in replenishing that as you exit the year, any additional color there? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I think that -- I heard that now. I think it's a great question. So first thing is it's better already, right? So I think I reported that it was around half for the quarter, so it was a little better than June and we're starting to peak at the July numbers. So the first headline is it's better already. And I think second is we've kind of figured out the new things which took us some time in Q2, right? You've got to pitch different people. You got to find leads in different ways. You're not going to trade shows. So you're still making right in not calling face-to-face. So I think the toolkit for people and the cadence and the way of selling is starting to pay some returns early. And the forecast that we've got from people, again, is getting back to, call it, 90% as we head towards the end of the year. So -- I mean I got to tell you, we're delighted, honestly, that we found a way to engage people enclosed in this world. I mean it -- there was a point there where we weren't super sure. So now it's really just a question of whether we get sales kind of back to where they were. \n Again, it won't impact a ton our revenue in 2020. As you know, a number of our businesses, we sell, we contract in advance of implementation. So some businesses are more sell and go live, and other businesses are sell and go live a different day. So the key to it is to fill the end of the year, so that, that can [ forward to ] 2021. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Got you. Understood. \n And Eric, I promise, I won't ask you how to calculate the fuel spread in your retirement then. \nOperator: And we'll go next to Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: And Eric, also wish you the very best. I appreciate all your help over the years. \n I wanted to follow up on Tien-Tsin's question on M&A first. And irrespective of the deals that you'd like to do, it's such a strange environment where a lot of the valuations for some of the -- kind of your tech assets are really run. What is the pipeline looking like? Are there deals out there that you think are workable? Or is this sort of proven not to be the time for sort of opportunistic M&A? Just curious about the broader kind of M&A environment you're seeing there, Ron. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. It's a good question. So I guess I'd categorize the pipeline kind of into 3 buckets. So one is we continue to look at deals, right, in our big 4 categories, so there's other providers that do the same things. And so obviously, we're in conversations with other players that are in those spaces. And two, I think I mentioned the last time, there's a handful of kind of coveted assets that sit inside some distressed companies, so we're chasing a couple of things. I think I mentioned that wouldn't have been available probably a different day where it makes more sense for the companies to talk to us. \n And then last is going back to Tien-Tsin's question. We are engaged with a handful of companies in these adjacencies, which again, up to, call it, 4 or 5 months ago, we weren't. So we're kind of, I guess, working, if you will, chasing stuff in kind of 2 new buckets versus, call it, 6 months ago. \n Yes. I agree on the valuation question. We're talking about it in a review earlier this week that I guess when this happened 3 or 4 months ago, we thought valuations would be better. And I think many of them have come a lot of the way back. So we're back to the same playbook of finding synergies and finding ways that we can operate assets better than what we see as a way to be able to pay for them. So we continue to work that same angle of having a clearer way that we can improve profits to be able to pay full prices. \nRamsey El-Assal: Okay, that's helpful. And the other question I wanted to ask you was on just the credit performance in the quarter, which I thought was pretty outstanding. And I just want to get your impression about expectations in terms of how you -- how we should think about that metric kind of in the back half of the year. And also sort of when do you -- this is sort of a more broader question about your sort of philosophy on credit. When do you know how to open up that kind of credit aperture again to drive growth? But what to expect? And then sort of how do you approach opening up credit again [ and ] the questions? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. That's another, I think, great question. So I'd say, if anything, maybe we kind of overreacted initially. So when this thing happened and you looked at our balance sheet and the receivables we had to collect, I think we had 20 meetings literally over the course of the month tightening terms, cutting lines, doing things which frankly did impact our revenue and growth in Q2, but it was a risk we -- I was willing to take. And so we're like along the way happy with the credit with some of the banks have turned in, the reserves they put in. And effectively, we've come in on our credit loss plan. \n And again, just to remind people on the call, a lot of that is structural. We're charge cards. We have tons of short term, daily, a bunch in our payables businesses, credit insurance, tons of [ DDS ] in Europe. So the structure of how we collect money lends itself to kind of be able to collect it and being essential. For a lot of these field services workers, they need our product. So they basically need to pay us to kind of keep doing what they're doing. So I think we're, again, super happy with the result. \n In terms of the second question, we're kind of forecasting it kind of as she goes. We don't see anything in the aging or in the payment behaviors that make us think things are going to get worse. So that's part 2. And then part 3 is we're testing our way into it. So now that we've seen these results and the clients are able to repay us, we've started loosening up. So for example, we really clamped down on our companion card where we open up for Beyond Fuel and saw the people that still were on that were able to pay us. And we've locked it for new accounts and now we kind of reopened it for existing accounts but not yet for new accounts. So we're effectively kind of stepping our way into -- in the looser policies and making sure that we can see repayment happening. \nRamsey El-Assal: Best of luck, Eric. \nEric R. Dey: Thanks, Ramsey. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra of Deutsche Bank. \nAshish Sabadra: Eric, best wishes to you, and Charles, congrats to you. \n Question on corporate payment. The revenue growth there was softer than what we were expecting. And I -- my guess is most of the softness was in the FX, particularly in May and June, but we see that rebound pretty well in July. I was wondering if you could just provide some color on that front. It looks like it had started to improve by the end of April and then softened in May and June. So just what happened there and how should we think about it going forward? \nRonald F. Clarke: Ashish, it's Ron. So I'd say a few things, corporate pay in Q2. So the first one is, it's a function of our clients. So the reason, again, the business was softer was in sales, that line of business was actually 85% of plan in terms of its sales in the quarter, so we found a way to sell. There's still demand, actually quite robust demand. So it was having pockets of clients like retail clients and travel clients that were just way, way down, 70%, 80% down, and then other clients in that book that were either off or only down a little bit. So point 1, it's a function of who we had as clients because we never had a screen before of, \"Hey, don't sign up corporate pay clients that don't do good when things [ are at home ].\" We never knew that, that was something to be aware of. Second, I mentioned earlier, we tightened credit. And we cut lines down in that business, both in our hedging product and FX and obviously, in our core virtual card in terms of the terms that we offer to these midsized accounts. And then lastly, about 10% or 15% of our overall corporate pay business is really T&E cards, walk-around plastic, which are not all [ white collar ]. There's supplies for construction and other kinds of stuff. But that thing was just way down because travel went effectively to 0. \n So what I'd say back is it's spotty. There are parts of it that are way down, other parts that are healthy, and we're selling a lot. The things recover. I don't know if you had a chance to look, but we put out a supplement. \n I think, Eric, was it Page 9? \nEric R. Dey: Page 9. \nRonald F. Clarke: Page 9, Ashish, in there kind of shows the core virtual card thing kind of came back almost flat in July. So it's come back, really, a tremendous amount just the last 60 days. So look, our outlook on the thing is that the T&E thing will likely stay in the ditch for the rest of the year and we think the other pieces will recover. \nAshish Sabadra: That's great. That's good color, Ron. And maybe just a follow-up question on fuel cards. So that -- the volumes have rebounded pretty well. I was just wondering if you could give some more color around if there are industries which are doing better than others. And then also, there are a few states where we've seen a resurgence of virus. Have you seen any impact in those states where there has been an -- any impact in those states? \nEric R. Dey: Resurgence of what? Ashish, can you repeat that again? \nAshish Sabadra: Yes. So just on the fuel cards, the volume has improved. Any color on different industries which are doing better than others? And also states where there may have been a resurgence in virus, have you seen any impact? Some of those states have -- kind of economic recovery has slowed down. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, Ashish. So first of all, I think we were kind of pleased, I don't know if investors will be, that fuel cards, which are a bit of an on-the-go product, right, a mobility product, were down kind of line average, were soft at the same kind of level as the rest of the business. And I think what that points to again is that it's an essential blue collar, people try it around -- that are around people. So what we see when we look at it is a similar comment from the payables business of a huge mix. So historically, 40% or something of our fuel card clients would grow in a quarter, 20% would be down, 5%, another 20% would be down, 10% and then the remaining amount would be down something. So what we see is the whole curve has moved down. \n Now only 20% grew in the quarter and 40% were down, up to 20%. And then 10% or 15% were down 75%. And so when we look at the clients that are at the bottom and the biggest decline, they're in just what you'd expect these kind of impacted industries, even parts of construction, where those projects fell away, where other parts of construction were still at the top. And so it's just a complete mixed bag of what the clients we have do and how much their business was impacted. \n But the good news is we've seen the whole curve kind of move up, so not just the people down 5% or 10% getting a little bit healthier, but the people down 50% or the people down 75% all seem to be moving up over the last month. So that suggests to us the detail -- what will break is smaller. So -- that we expect, hopefully, as the plot turns, you're to get more of that business back. \nOperator: And we'll go next to Matt O'Neill with Goldman Sachs. \nMatthew O'Neill: And again, my congrats to Eric and Charles on your respective moves. \n I was hoping I just sort of dig in a little bit and follow up on Ramsey's question around credit and also Ashish's question on the sort of end market exposure. So on credit, again, very impressive sort of stability there. To what extent do you guys track? And are you thinking about the sort of government stimulus and Payroll Protection Programs (sic) [ Paycheck Protection Program ] and the potential impact for a lagged effect on the SMBs? And maybe you could remind us the kind of relative exposure to the smaller businesses versus the larger ones as you're thinking through the recovery in the back half being sort of driven first by volume with revenue lagging to help sort of flesh that out a little bit more for us. \nEric R. Dey: Matt, this is Eric. Yes, I mean, the good news is we're -- obviously, we're very pleased with the performance of bad debt, as Ron indicated earlier. Our agings look mostly kind of normal. And well, we do have some bad debt, that's unusual, it was mostly kind of one-off bankruptcies. As we get to the second half of the year, to answer your kind of question, our SMB portfolio is recovering a little bit slower than the enterprise volume as we've mentioned. Our SMB business as a percentage of volume is about 1/3 of our overall volume. \n So we do expect a continued lag effect there, but we're taking a very conservative approach to that customer portfolio. We're looking at them closely. We look at the agings daily to see if there's any inherent weakness in any particular industry or category. And obviously, when we see that, we treat those customers accordingly. And again, I think the good news is it just -- we're not seeing a whole lot. And so customers are beginning to pay us. \n From a stimulus perspective, again, I'm sure that it's helped a certain segment of customers. It's difficult for us to kind of track who's benefiting from that or not because we can't see that. But I would say we are keeping a very, very close watch on those that can be [ accounted ], particularly in certain, more impacted industries. \nRonald F. Clarke: Matt, it's Ron. We've got a credit score with this new impacted industry overlay. So I don't know, probably 60 days ago or something, we started to layer that over. And so we're not posting yet the mission accomplished signs despite the good performance in Q2. We're keeping credit still tight, and as I mentioned earlier, testing our way into opening it up. So we do think there's some risk when the government slows the thing down. But to Eric's point, we are eyes kind of all on it and not providing particular large amounts of credit to clients that are sitting in those industries. \nMatthew O'Neill: Got it. As a follow-up, I guess, a related basis, one of the growth drivers that I think we've collectively been getting incrementally excited about recently are some of the Beyond programs, particularly on Beyond Fuel with the pandemic now. Is there a little bit of a retrenchment, a reluctance to spend incremental credit and/or is the selling process a little bit more challenged? Or because it's typically being sold into existing clients, that can continue? Just sort of thinking through the cadence of the growth from that program, particularly. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Matt, it's Ron again. It's a good question. So again, what I'd say is we took the safety route first over the growth route to make sure that we're protecting the company and the liquidity. So we did dial back credit pretty significantly, whatever, 90 days ago. And so as I mentioned, now that we've seen the repayment performance, we've opened that back up, that Beyond Fuel for existing clients. So we had kind of frozen that, at least putting new fuel card clients on that program. So whether it was a good or bad idea, we did it with our eyes wide open. So look, let's protect the liquidity of the company. Let's get careful, and we can spring back into action in different days. So we're getting comfortable that we've seen some number of cycles now, and again, are starting to loosen things up. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Trevor Williams of Jefferies. \nTrevor Williams: Eric, congrats on a great run. \n On expenses, Ron, your comment about being down 10% year-over-year for the full year. First, I just want to make sure that I caught that correctly. And then any framework for how much of the decline in that is in variable versus fixed costs coming out that could end up being more permanent? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. So on the first part, you got it right. Against the prior year, expenses were, for Q2, I think, down -- Eric, 11? And I think, Trevor, I said that kind of our forecast, we're kind of planning a down 10%, high single digits kind of 8% to 10% for Q3 and Q4. And on that, what you said, some fair amount of it is variable. Obviously, with volume and revenue lower, you get money back. Sales commissions, you get money back. And then selectively, we slowed some projects that depend on outside parties, third parties that are distracted, doing other things. So it slowed some things where I didn't think we'd get the same kind of traction on them. And I guess we do get some help from FX. We got -- we had a bit of a headwind on the revenue side but clearly helping us on the expense side. But we haven't -- I think I said this before. We're trying to play the long game. So we're not carving lots of money out of client service or out of core tech or out of core sales. We're trying to protect those sets of capabilities for a different day. \nTrevor Williams: Okay, got it. That all makes sense. And then just my follow-up on corporate payments. So I think you're lapping a big Cambridge quarter from the third quarter last year. So just as we look at the supplement and the line that you've got on FX revenue, you had a big month-over-month acceleration from June to July. So I'm just wondering if we could even read into that as being better, if not for the tougher comp or if that number is actually just capturing the FX portion of Cambridge and not the entire piece with the cross-border element, too. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I think some of it is the comps or the difficult comps, but I think also some of it is people are a bit frozen when you have volatility and currencies, which we had kind of at the beginning of the quarter. The end of the first quarter, people act, and then I think they froze a bit wondering how things are going to move. So I think [ it froze a bit of the ] hedging product, which carries high margins. And then second, don't miss my credit comment. We did the same thing there in some of those products, where there's volatility and contracts to move out of the money. We -- I dialed those things back so we trimmed lines, which moves some of the share. We split share in that business across some clients. \n So again, I want to make sure everybody hears that there's clearly a pretty high [ R-squared ] between credit openness and growth even of existing clients. And we were, again, quite cautious at the beginning. And now that we've seen kind of that good report, I want everybody to hear me that we're starting to loosen. We're not going completely crazy back to where we are, but we're going to help enable basically the businesses to grab some of that share back. \nOperator: And we'll go next to Bob Napoli of William Blair. \nRobert Napoli: Eric, it's been great, wish you the best. \n On the corporate, where -- okay. So your balance sheet's in great shape, [ during a ] lot of interesting businesses. You've tightened credit. You're starting to loosen up. Where can we -- where can you go on offense and invest more? And the -- and I guess it's on the M&A side, but around corporate payments, virtual cards, organically expanding, I shouldn't -- isn't this a good time to be putting more money on offense, understanding so earnings will be lower in the back half of the year? But you want to come out of this -- this will be behind us in, what, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months. But where can you go on offense? Do you come out of this in\u2026 \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Bob, it's Ron. It's a good question. I think the answer is the full AP product line as we bought that business a year ago, and it is -- I mean, it's just blockbuster in front of me. It's up some crazy amount since we've owned it and up even a crazy amount in Q2. But more importantly, and in front of me, I think the sales were in the quarter -- in a quarter where we sold half, those sales were 50% or something above plan. So the demand, to your point, in the marketplace to be able to remotely pay bills, I don't know if it's going to stay at an all-time high, but it's certainly top of mind for people now sitting at their houses. \n So to your point, we're clearly going to spend more money on marketing and sales there and shift more energy. So for example, we used to sell virtual cards and then -- and also T&E cards to that same account, so we had some T&E cards in our portfolio. Well, we've kind of reoriented those people to pitch virtual card and then maybe -- oh, by the way, virtual card and full AP, but not T&E card. So we'll, for sure, step up the marketing and sales pressure against that line of business. \n And then second, clearly, on the transaction side. We certainly know all the assets in the space and we like the category. And I'm comfortable -- we're comfortable that we have money now. We've got, you said, $1.9 billion. And it's building, right? We generated cash flow. And I'm not so worried about the receivables and leverage is about 2.5x. So we're sitting in a place, and some of our pals that compete are not sitting as good a place, Bob. So I'd say we like where we are in terms of the pipeline there as well. So more marketing money and maybe use the balance sheet. \nRobert Napoli: Okay. And then -- I mean adjacencies, are there going to be adjacencies to corporate payments? Is that really where the focus is? Or are there other portions of the bigger sectors that you're looking at adjacencies? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. We're looking at all, right? We started this thing, as I mentioned, back kind of in the fall or winter last year, looking at our 4 big businesses and this whole construct of adjacency to particularly software adjacencies, their health with the clients. And so we've identified, as I mentioned to Tien-Tsin earlier, adjacencies both in payables, around invoicing, for example, and our other business as well. In lodging, we've got some adjacencies and, as I mentioned, in fuel card. \n So I'm saying it so that people aren't surprised if you see us transact in something that is not exactly in the 4 but obviously, super adjacent or tied to the 4 businesses we're in. But yes, we still like the other categories. I know you, someone who follows payables, likes it and we like it. But we like -- we really do like our other product lines quite a bit, too. If you look at [ our money, our non -- 2 lines ] have grown low mid-teens for years now, Bob. So we're happy with some of the other businesses, too. \nOperator: And we'll go next to George Mihalos of Cowen. \nGeorgios Mihalos: Eric, my congrats and best wishes as well. \n Ron, just wanted to follow up on the expense question, kind of the 8% to 10% OpEx reduction that you're thinking of for third and fourth quarter. I think last quarter, you were kind of thinking in the 5% range and then it's going to be more variable. I'm just curious, that 8% to 10%, is there a way to think of a portion of that, that may be permanently removed beyond what you're thinking for the back half of 2020? \nEric R. Dey: George, it's Eric. Yes. I mean I really wouldn't look at it that way. It's certainly not what we want to do long term. I mean we want to grow the business, so we want to invest in the business. I mean, certainly, over the short term, we are looking at ways to rightsize the business so we can maximize profitability over the short term. But we're also looking at ways to reinvest in the business so we can reaccelerate growth when we come out of this environment that we're in. So I would say over the medium term, short -- in the short term, I would say, \"Hey, we're going to have some cost savings over the medium term. We're going to reinvest back in the business and probably get around back to where we kind of were from a margin standpoint.\" \nGeorgios Mihalos: Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. Within the tolls business, I know the last couple of quarters, I think, sort of the tail end of last year, there were some free tags and some promotional activity that was in there. Did that have an impact on the tolls business at all in 2Q? And how are you thinking about those promotions on a go-forward basis? \nEric R. Dey: [ We need to do toll business within tech companies. The promotions, other people's promotions ]. \nRonald F. Clarke: Oh, are you asking about the -- promoting to sell new tags? \nGeorgios Mihalos: Yes, just basically some discounting as it relates to the toll business. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. So it's Ron. So yes, the short answer is when some of the competitors came into the toll business, [ we -- the time for our business is the gorilla ] is the -- it's the top of the line and has the most coverage, the best systems, the biggest network. So it was very hard for newbies with [ premier stuff ], in my opinion, to sell, so they went to price. And so we decided to match some of their kind of free-starting things to make sure that we kept a dominant share of the new business. So that's worked pretty well. We started to -- kind of at the end of the year and roll through 3 and 6 months kind of promotions. \n We tested some other ways of signing people up, for example, \"Hey, if you use the thing, you pay the monthly fee. And if you don't, [ we know ].\" So we've gotten creative. And so we're still selling a lot. The sales are still quite good in that business. And more importantly, the promotional stuff is converting into pay, which we studied quite a lot to the people that come on a free pass, actually convert to paying, and they do. So I'd say the approach, so far, so good. \nOperator: All right. And we'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Congrats to Eric and Charles as well from my side. \n Going back to the M&A question, I'm sorry, Ron. But when we think about valuation and adjacent areas, should we think about the IRRs being comparable to some of the deals that you've done in the past? Or will the complexion look different because they are different types of businesses and the valuation backdrop is different? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. So that's a super good question. I think the answer is it depends. I mean I'd say if the transaction is of any meaningful size, uses any meaningful amount of capital, we have to see our way to returns. So we look at returns the way you guys do money now and what we get back. And again, from that perspective, we study our thesis of things that we can do that can create better returns there. \n But I'd say in some of the smaller ones, we look at other effects like the ability to sell, for example. So if we added an adjacency in payables that help clients in the front end, do we hear back and do we see in the sales results better win rates in the pipeline because our package is a bit more complete? Do we see that in the feedback and the RFPs? And so I'd say to you, if it's a smaller kind of transactions, we would look at factors other than just the profit returns. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. And I guess following up on some of the questions, again, on the last -- sort of the SMB versus enterprise mix and its impact on revenues. Eric, is there a way to think through the actual quantification of the drag as we think about the second half? I mean is there any way to dimensionalize that as we think about the recovery and the actual impact? I'm just trying to make sure I understand that part. \nEric R. Dey: Yes, there's really a couple of business where we're seeing a little bit of a drag. That's obviously fuel that we called out earlier. A good percentage of our business there is SMB, and we're seeing a little bit on the lodging side as well. Actually, we got some very large enterprise accounts in that business. That's how that business was built. And we've got more down market over the years. So those -- again, those accounts as well are seeing a little bit of lag in terms of how it's coming back. \n In terms of quantifying it, I think we'd have to go back and actually try to put pencil to paper to come up with a better estimate. I wouldn't want to just throw something out over the phone. So if you want to get back to us, I think we may be able to come up with something. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Congrats again. \nOperator: And our final question will come from John Coffey with Susquehanna. \nJohn Coffey: My question for you is on the corporate payments segment. And I guess I was wondering -- I was looking at Slide 19 (sic) [ Slide 9 ], and I see that you have those 4 sublines: virtual card, T&E, full AP and FX. I was wondering if one were to look at the April, May and June months, and then you compare that to the 17% revenue decline, what would you be able -- what would you look at to say like, \"Okay, I see these figures on Slide 9 and that makes sense when I see the decline of 17%\"? Is really looking at virtual card the best way to figure out which way the wind is blowing because, clearly, full AP was up a lot. So I'm just trying to -- maybe the better way to say this, help understand the revenue contribution of each of those sublines a little bit better. \nEric R. Dey: That's just the revenue contribution, it'd be just these 4 top lines. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. We probably wouldn't share that other than I will make the point, which I think we did on Page 9 that if you look at the T&E card, along with a couple of other things, we called about the Brazil benefits and the airline thing, but collectively, those things are less than 4% or 5% of our revenue in July. So the headline is the T&E thing was not a super big part of the corporate payments business overall. And as you can see, it's down 40% volume, 50%, I think I told you, in revenue. And so it's not what's going to make the thing go. We think that thing's going to kind of sit where it's at. And that the growth -- the way to look at the thing is the delta between the virtual card performance, corporate pay performance and revenue in Q2 being down mid-teens and then seeing the virtual card volume recover in July, almost to flat. And so the corporate pay business is going to go as virtual card and FX goes because full AP is rocking and we're going to spend more money on it. The T&E thing will trade flat. So the recovery in virtual cards and clients getting comfortable again to make trades and FX, those will determine the pace of growth in the second half. \nOperator: And we have reached the end of our allotted time, so this will conclude today's conference. We appreciate everyone's participation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric R. Dey",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron. \n For the second quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of $525.1 million, down 19% compared to $647.1 million in the second quarter of 2019. GAAP net income decreased 39% to $158.5 million from $261.7 million. And GAAP net income per diluted share decreased 37% to $1.83 from $2.90 in the second quarter of 2019. However, there were a couple of unusual items in the quarter that I want to call out. The second quarter of 2020 was impacted by a $9.8 million discrete tax item related to a prior tax position and a gain on the company's investment in Bill.com of approximately $34 million. Also, in the second quarter of 2019 was a tax benefit of approximately $65 million related to the sale of the company's investment in Masternaut. Excluding these discrete items, net income decreased 28% and net income per diluted share decreased 25%. \n Non-GAAP financial metrics that we will be discussing are adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. And the reconciliation to GAAP numbers is provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2020 decreased 23% to $197.4 million compared to $256.7 million in the same period last year. And adjusted net income per diluted share decreased 20% to $2.28 compared to $2.85 in adjusted net income per diluted share in the second quarter of 2019. \n Second quarter of 2020 results reflect a negative year-over-year impact from the macroeconomic environment of approximately $22 million in revenue. The negative macro was driven mostly by lower foreign exchange rates, primarily in Brazil, when compared with the second quarter of 2019. We believe FX negatively impacted revenue by approximately $35 million. Fuel prices were down year-over-year for the full quarter, and although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe it unfavorably impacted revenue by approximately $13 million in the quarter. And finally, fuel spreads were quite favorable for most of the quarter and had about a $26 million favorable impact in the quarter. Organic revenue in the quarter was a negative 17% overall, driven primarily by same-store sales softness of 17%. \n All of our major product categories were impacted by the COVID pandemic in the quarter, some more than others. Our fuel category was down organically about 16%. There are a lot of moving parts to our fuel businesses around the world. Our fuel volumes in our international business were impacted more than the U.S. fuel businesses. Both geographies' volumes bottomed out in April, and we have been recovering in May, June and into July. Volumes should continue to improve over the remainder of the year, barring any setbacks in the reopening of the economy. And although volumes seemed they're recovering, revenues are recovering at a slower rate in the fuel category as large enterprise account volumes with lower rates are improving faster than our SMB accounts, which have higher revenue per gallon. \n The corporate payments category was down organically approximately 17% in the second quarter. As a reminder, our corporate payments business is made up of virtual cards, cross-border payments, full-service AP accounts and physical T&E plastic, cross-sold mostly to our virtual card customers. The same-store sales softness in corporate payments came mostly from accounts in the travel, oil and gas, retail and elective health care verticals. We are seeing some recovery in verticals other than travel and the retail verticals, which we expect will recover at a slower rate. \n Our full-service AP business continues to perform well and is growing in the mid- to high double-digit range. Our toll category has proven to be our most resilient business and grew organically at 3% in the second quarter. Most of the revenue in this category is subscription-based and has not been significantly impacted by the slowdown in the Brazilian economy due to COVID. The products that have been impacted are mostly the Beyond Toll products where we earn interchange, like parking, fuel and fast food, where volumes had decreased significantly. Our expectation is for these revenues to recover as the Brazilian economy starts to reopen and recover. \n The lodging category is made up of our legacy lodging business, which provides lodging accommodation services to workforce travelers and emergency service organizations such as FEMA and the Red Cross. This business was down 29% organically in the second quarter. And our airline lodging business, which provides lodging accommodation services primarily to the airline crew and distressed passenger segments was down 68% in the quarter. Our expectation is for our workforce lodging business to see continued improvement as this business mostly provides lodging for blue-collar workers who generally drive vehicles to the hotel. This business has been impacted much less than other travel-related businesses. However, we do expect revenue in the category to recover slower as large enterprise accounts with lower rates are recovering faster than our SMB accounts. We expect our airline lodging business recovery to be slower and is linked to the recovery of the airline industry. \n Now moving down the income statement. Total operating expenses were down 11% for the second quarter of 2020 to $312.3 million compared with $349.8 million in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in costs related to decreases in volume, cost cutting initiatives implemented in the second quarter and the impact of foreign exchange rates. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 59.5% compared to 54.1% in the second quarter of 2019. Bad debt expense in the second quarter of 2020 was $21.3 million or 7 basis points compared to $18 million or 7 basis points in the second quarter of 2019. Bad debt has been one of the more surprising bright spots as our agings are mostly normal, particularly given the environment we are in today. Any increase in bad debt has been driven mostly by one-off bankruptcies versus increases in aging categories. \n Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 12% to $62.2 million in the second quarter of 2020 from $70.9 million in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. Interest expense decreased 18% to $32.4 million compared to $39.5 million in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease in interest expense was due primarily to decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt, partially offset by the impact of additional borrowing for share buybacks and lower borrowings on our securitization facility due to lower volumes in the second quarter. \n Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2020 was 25.1% compared to a negative 1.7% for the second quarter of 2019. The second quarter of 2020 was impacted by a $9.8 million increase in the reserve for uncertain tax positions related to prior years. Also with the second quarter of 2019 was a tax benefit of approximately $65 million related to the sale of the company's investment in Masternaut. Excluding these discrete items, our tax rate would have been 20.4% in the second quarter of 2020, and the tax rate in the second quarter of 2019 would have been 23.6%. The decrease in the tax rate was due primarily to excess tax benefit on stock option exercises. \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.19 billion in total cash. Approximately $426 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. As of June 30, 2020, we had $3.8 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $654 million borrowed in our securitization facility. We believe that we have ample liquidity to weather any COVID scenario and to pursue any near-term M&A opportunities. In total, we have approximately $1.9 billion in total liquidity, consisting of cash on the balance sheet, undrawn revolver and the undrawn bridge loan. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 127,000 shares in connection with employee stock sales for $32.2 million as employees forfeited shares to cover taxes. And we have approximately $294 million in repurchase capacity remaining under our current authorization. As of June 30, 2020, our leverage ratio was 2.62x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA as calculated under our credit agreement. Finally, we spent approximately $19.4 million on CapEx during the second quarter of 2020. \n Now turning to the outlook for the balance of the year. I want to remind everyone that although our businesses are very resilient, our businesses have all been impacted by the COVID pandemic, some more than others. Our business models are primarily recurring revenue in nature. We have very broad customer bases and diversified businesses across industries and geographies. We are not reinstating our guidance at this point. There is simply too much uncertainty regarding the resumption of business activity around the world to accurately predict what our volumes could be the rest of the year. \n We do expect that second half of the year volume will continue to improve as the economy improves. However, we expect second half of the year revenues to recover more slowly than volume because larger enterprise accounts with lower rates will likely recover faster than our SMB portfolio. We also expect that the macro will continue to be a drag on revenue due to lower expected fuel prices and foreign exchange rates when compared to last year. \n And finally, before I turn the call over for questions, I want to thank Ron for his kind words earlier. It has been quite a ride over the last 18 years. I have spent some time thinking about my FLEETCOR journey and really cannot believe everything that we have accomplished over this period of time, and I cannot think of many things I would rather have done. I have known Charles for a long time and I can say that there is not a person better equipped to take over this challenging role. I will be around to help with the transition over the next several months and look forward to catching up with many of you before I head off into the next chapter of my life. \n And with that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. Thanks, Ramsey. Page 9. Resurgence of what? Ashish, can you repeat that again? Matt, this is Eric. Yes, I mean, the good news is we're -- obviously, we're very pleased with the performance of bad debt, as Ron indicated earlier. Our agings look mostly kind of normal. And well, we do have some bad debt, that's unusual, it was mostly kind of one-off bankruptcies. As we get to the second half of the year, to answer your kind of question, our SMB portfolio is recovering a little bit slower than the enterprise volume as we've mentioned. Our SMB business as a percentage of volume is about 1/3 of our overall volume. \n So we do expect a continued lag effect there, but we're taking a very conservative approach to that customer portfolio. We're looking at them closely. We look at the agings daily to see if there's any inherent weakness in any particular industry or category. And obviously, when we see that, we treat those customers accordingly. And again, I think the good news is it just -- we're not seeing a whole lot. And so customers are beginning to pay us. \n From a stimulus perspective, again, I'm sure that it's helped a certain segment of customers. It's difficult for us to kind of track who's benefiting from that or not because we can't see that. But I would say we are keeping a very, very close watch on those that can be [ accounted ], particularly in certain, more impacted industries. George, it's Eric. Yes. I mean I really wouldn't look at it that way. It's certainly not what we want to do long term. I mean we want to grow the business, so we want to invest in the business. I mean, certainly, over the short term, we are looking at ways to rightsize the business so we can maximize profitability over the short term. But we're also looking at ways to reinvest in the business so we can reaccelerate growth when we come out of this environment that we're in. So I would say over the medium term, short -- in the short term, I would say, \"Hey, we're going to have some cost savings over the medium term. We're going to reinvest back in the business and probably get around back to where we kind of were from a margin standpoint.\" [ We need to do toll business within tech companies. The promotions, other people's promotions ]. Yes, there's really a couple of business where we're seeing a little bit of a drag. That's obviously fuel that we called out earlier. A good percentage of our business there is SMB, and we're seeing a little bit on the lodging side as well. Actually, we got some very large enterprise accounts in that business. That's how that business was built. And we've got more down market over the years. So those -- again, those accounts as well are seeing a little bit of lag in terms of how it's coming back. \n In terms of quantifying it, I think we'd have to go back and actually try to put pencil to paper to come up with a better estimate. I wouldn't want to just throw something out over the phone. So if you want to get back to us, I think we may be able to come up with something. That's just the revenue contribution, it'd be just these 4 top lines."

            "content": "Okay. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our second quarter earnings call. \n Before I begin my opening remarks, I do want to say a big thank you to my pal, Eric Dey, for making the FLEETCOR journey with me almost from the beginning. I think we've had a pretty good time together and enjoyed some success along the way. So all of us will miss you, Eric. \n At the same time, I do want to welcome my other longtime partner, Chuck Freund, also with us from the very beginning, as he transitions into the new role of CFO. So Chuck's been involved in literally every aspect of the company. He's run some of our businesses. He's bought businesses. He's helped us plot the future. So I can assure you, he'll be a terrific CFO. \n Okay. So back to my prepared remarks, in which I'll cover 4 subjects. So first, I'll report on the progress against the initial COVID response plan that we undertook. Second, I'll provide my perspective on Q2 results. Third, I'll speak to the trends, the line of business trends that we're seeing here in July, along with thoughts on rest of the year. And then lastly, I'll provide our perspective on Fleet's long-term prospects in a post-COVID world. \n Okay. So let me begin by summarizing the progress against the COVID response plan that we put into motion in Q2. It was focused against 6 areas. So first was safety. So very pleased to report today, we've had very few positive virus cases among our 8,000 global employees. And fortunately, no one seriously ill, so very, very happy with that. \n Two, on business continuity, we've been able to deliver our services in this new remote environment. And we can report again in Q2 that our systems performance and uptime were very good. \n Three, credit. We're delighted, honestly, with our Q2 credit results. Came in at, I think, $21 million, which was about our original loss plan and receivables aging continues to look quite good. So a real bright spot so far. \n Fourth, liquidity. We quickly tried to strengthen our liquidity back at the beginning of the quarter. We stepped up collections intensity. We repatriated cash. We even secured a bridge loan. So today, liquidity is quite good, $1.9 billion and our leverage ratio, 2.6x. \n Expenses, we anticipated, obviously, weakness in Q2 so we trimmed expenses. We actually managed our expenses $50 million lower, which is 20% lower than the original plan that we built, so that cushioned our Q2 profits. \n And then last is selling. We knew in this new remote world, we'd have to sell differently so lots of progress around targeting different kinds of companies, new ways to get leads, providing new tools for our salespeople to work at home, new monitoring approaches, so really a revamped selling model that started to rebound. \n So I do want to give a shout-out really to all the FLEETCOR employees who jumped on these set of things. It was quite urgent to get at these things. So IT, HR, credit, sales management, really good performance. \n Okay. Let me make the turn over to our Q2 results. So we reported Q2 revenue of $525 million, which is down 19% and cash EPS of $2.28, which is down 20% versus prior year. So our expense reduction actions helped narrow our profit decline. In terms of organic revenue for the quarter, finishing down 17% behind the prior year overall. Fuel coming in at minus 16% so about line average. Corporate pay at minus 17%. Lodging in total at minus 37% but the workforce portion, somewhere in the high 20s. And toll in the plus column, plus 3% for the quarter, driven by its subscription model. \n In terms of trends in Q2, obviously affected by COVID, same-store sales, the big one, declined 17% so about the same as our organic revenue growth as we saw client softness really across every business. Thankfully, client retention remains stable at 91%. And new sales weren't great, about half of last year's level for the quarter but clearly rebounding as we move through the quarter. \n So it's pretty hard to reflect on a quarter like this but kind of here is my conclusion. It's -- for us, it's really a story, Q2, of client softness. And client softness being way down as a result of COVID because if you look at other aspects of our business, they were generally kind of okay, retention stable at 91%. Feeling good about finding a new way to sell in this environment and confirm that we can keep selling our services in this environment. Credit didn't bite us, loss was about on plan. We flexed expenses down to keep profits kind of in line with revenue, right-sized the company. And we generated $200 million of free cash flow in the quarter. So a few bright spots. \n Okay, let me transition to the trends that we're seeing in July and how we're thinking about the rest of the year. So we've included in the earnings supplement a line of business volume chart that runs through the last few months, including July. And you'll see there that really every business we have has at least bottomed out, and many of the businesses are recovering and recovering a bit more quickly in July. They're affected really by the entire client distribution. So clients that are down a little bit, clients that are down a medium amount, clients that are down a super lot. When we look at those distributions, they're all moving up, so all clients are kind of moving back up, adding volume. \n So just a couple of callouts. You can see international fuel recovering very nicely as Europe out ahead of us on the COVID thing. And our high-growth businesses, full AP, tolls, Russia, simply just powering through their client softness because of lots of new business. So clearly, things getting better. \n In terms of rest of year, we do expect continued improvement but we will still have challenges here short term. So volume, we think, will continue to recover but unclear as to how quickly. Our second half revenues will recover more slowly than volume and that's mostly because of mix. We're seeing larger enterprise clients with lower rates recover faster than our small business portfolio. We expect the macro, particularly FX, to continue to weigh on our second half year versus prior year. We do expect sales to continue to recover to get better. We're hopeful of getting back to 90% of prior year as we exit 2020. And then lastly, expenses, we plan to continue to manage expenses down here in the second half, targeting about 10% lower expense levels than prior year. So in conclusion, Q3 and 4 will be better than Q2 but again still challenging. \n So last, let me transition here over to kind of a long-term view of FLEETCOR and how all of this impacts the company. I mean at the headline level, we think the new behaviors coming out of COVID will be a mixed bag. There's puts and takes. But the main point is we think that those new behaviors will impact us kind of at the margins, if you will, of our business. And at the core, because it's essential workers that keep powering on, that the core of our business will hold up quite well. So negative impacts that we expect long term is probably less white collar commuting long term, which again, will impact our European fuel card businesses a bit at the edges because some have white-collar fuel cards. Likely less business travel at least over the midterm, so that will dampen our T&E card business and our airline crew lodging business. And then the accelerated shift to digital and digital purchasing and away from face-to-face shopping will create pressure on our gift card business. \n On the positive front, the whole work-from-home, remote working model certainly will drive demand for outsourcing, outsourcing of everything generally. So that will lift our payables business, we think, our virtual card and our full AP prospects. And the preference for touchless and avoidance of attendance, we think, will lift demand for really almost all of our card businesses. So fuel cards, pay at the pump versus in-store; Brazil nonstop electric tolls versus cash booths; payroll cards that are reloadable versus payroll checks; virtual cards instead of printing AP checks. \n So look, again, the headline is that our view is that these impacts, we think, are at the margin and at the core of what we do is serve clients with essential workers and that there'll be continuing demand for good payment solutions for that group of clients. So what do we do? We wait for our clients and the world to recover here. We're going to stay focused on what we can control and what we can do. Namely, that's to advance the 3 main priorities, primary priorities of the company. \n So one is portfolio. We're continuing to look at things to reposition our portfolio, create fewer, bigger businesses, add more nonfuel businesses, add more faster-growing businesses and likely more adjacencies. \n Second, penetration of our big 4 businesses. We're working again to enhance our products, create more sales pressure, strengthen our cross-sell channels back to our clients. We're also pushing our Beyond strategy, which transforms our businesses and their TAM both through broadening what each business offers but more importantly maybe, the segments that each of our businesses can target. So for example, urban city dwellers in Brazil versus highway toll users or airline crew lodging versus only workforce people. \n And then lastly, we're working on strengthening the base capabilities of the company, a particular emphasis on tech, on technology. So you'll see us invest more in IT, more in IT transformation. We'll move more applications to the cloud. We'll improve digital UIs and DIs for clients. We'll continue to advance our cybersecurity protection, so we'll continue to get better at IT. \n So from our perspective, if we keep progressing these 3 priorities, portfolio, business penetration and our capabilities, it supports our ambition of a 15% to 20% profit growth company. \n So look, in closing, Q2 -- our Q2 performance, again, really a story of same-store sales, client softness as a result of COVID, again with other aspects of our business, particularly retention and credit holding up nicely. Second half, for sure, better than Q2, but again still challenging, we think, over the short term. But I think most importantly, longer term, the message from us today is that the core, the main thing that we do around the world, which is to serve clients essential services, payments needs, we think that, that remains quite good, quite robust. And that we see puts and takes again around the margins of our business as it relates to COVID. \n So with that, let me turn the call one more time back over to Eric to provide some additional details on the quarter. Eric? Yes. Tien-Tsin, sitting here next to Mr. Sentimental, so I share your sentiment. I can't believe how long [ you have been with us ]. All good things come to an end. \n Yes. So the adjacency thing I mentioned, I guess, in the last call, so it came out of this idea of looking at the clients, kind of what they do before or after the payment. And so I gave the example last time in corporate pay and the payables business, all the front end of invoice, prep and workflow and approvals and all that stuff before we press the pay button. So we continue to look kind of at the front end of those things to see if we can be more helpful again to clients. \n And another example would be kind of in the core fuel card business. And particularly with SMBs, there are other kinds of software, a little bit what the acquirers have done, First Data and Global are the software that nests around what our small business guys do. And an old example [ of work rate is telematics ]. So we were trying to figure out if there was another service, another software service close to fuel cards that dealt with steel SMB people. So we have a couple of things that we're looking at there, where there's some software that's in the categories, in the verticals that we're in. \n So again, the thought of it is not only to be more helpful to the clients that we've got to do more for them but also from the selling perspective, right, that those adjacencies bring books of clients that we could cross-sell to so it may help us sell as well. So those would be a couple of examples. So in each one of [ the areas, we decided kind of the front and the back ] around our services. Tien-Tsin, you broke out just a little. Can you -- if you can hear us well, can you repeat the question? Yes. I think that -- I heard that now. I think it's a great question. So first thing is it's better already, right? So I think I reported that it was around half for the quarter, so it was a little better than June and we're starting to peak at the July numbers. So the first headline is it's better already. And I think second is we've kind of figured out the new things which took us some time in Q2, right? You've got to pitch different people. You got to find leads in different ways. You're not going to trade shows. So you're still making right in not calling face-to-face. So I think the toolkit for people and the cadence and the way of selling is starting to pay some returns early. And the forecast that we've got from people, again, is getting back to, call it, 90% as we head towards the end of the year. So -- I mean I got to tell you, we're delighted, honestly, that we found a way to engage people enclosed in this world. I mean it -- there was a point there where we weren't super sure. So now it's really just a question of whether we get sales kind of back to where they were. \n Again, it won't impact a ton our revenue in 2020. As you know, a number of our businesses, we sell, we contract in advance of implementation. So some businesses are more sell and go live, and other businesses are sell and go live a different day. So the key to it is to fill the end of the year, so that, that can [ forward to ] 2021. Yes. It's a good question. So I guess I'd categorize the pipeline kind of into 3 buckets. So one is we continue to look at deals, right, in our big 4 categories, so there's other providers that do the same things. And so obviously, we're in conversations with other players that are in those spaces. And two, I think I mentioned the last time, there's a handful of kind of coveted assets that sit inside some distressed companies, so we're chasing a couple of things. I think I mentioned that wouldn't have been available probably a different day where it makes more sense for the companies to talk to us. \n And then last is going back to Tien-Tsin's question. We are engaged with a handful of companies in these adjacencies, which again, up to, call it, 4 or 5 months ago, we weren't. So we're kind of, I guess, working, if you will, chasing stuff in kind of 2 new buckets versus, call it, 6 months ago. \n Yes. I agree on the valuation question. We're talking about it in a review earlier this week that I guess when this happened 3 or 4 months ago, we thought valuations would be better. And I think many of them have come a lot of the way back. So we're back to the same playbook of finding synergies and finding ways that we can operate assets better than what we see as a way to be able to pay for them. So we continue to work that same angle of having a clearer way that we can improve profits to be able to pay full prices. Yes. That's another, I think, great question. So I'd say, if anything, maybe we kind of overreacted initially. So when this thing happened and you looked at our balance sheet and the receivables we had to collect, I think we had 20 meetings literally over the course of the month tightening terms, cutting lines, doing things which frankly did impact our revenue and growth in Q2, but it was a risk we -- I was willing to take. And so we're like along the way happy with the credit with some of the banks have turned in, the reserves they put in. And effectively, we've come in on our credit loss plan. \n And again, just to remind people on the call, a lot of that is structural. We're charge cards. We have tons of short term, daily, a bunch in our payables businesses, credit insurance, tons of [ DDS ] in Europe. So the structure of how we collect money lends itself to kind of be able to collect it and being essential. For a lot of these field services workers, they need our product. So they basically need to pay us to kind of keep doing what they're doing. So I think we're, again, super happy with the result. \n In terms of the second question, we're kind of forecasting it kind of as she goes. We don't see anything in the aging or in the payment behaviors that make us think things are going to get worse. So that's part 2. And then part 3 is we're testing our way into it. So now that we've seen these results and the clients are able to repay us, we've started loosening up. So for example, we really clamped down on our companion card where we open up for Beyond Fuel and saw the people that still were on that were able to pay us. And we've locked it for new accounts and now we kind of reopened it for existing accounts but not yet for new accounts. So we're effectively kind of stepping our way into -- in the looser policies and making sure that we can see repayment happening. Ashish, it's Ron. So I'd say a few things, corporate pay in Q2. So the first one is, it's a function of our clients. So the reason, again, the business was softer was in sales, that line of business was actually 85% of plan in terms of its sales in the quarter, so we found a way to sell. There's still demand, actually quite robust demand. So it was having pockets of clients like retail clients and travel clients that were just way, way down, 70%, 80% down, and then other clients in that book that were either off or only down a little bit. So point 1, it's a function of who we had as clients because we never had a screen before of, \"Hey, don't sign up corporate pay clients that don't do good when things [ are at home ].\" We never knew that, that was something to be aware of. Second, I mentioned earlier, we tightened credit. And we cut lines down in that business, both in our hedging product and FX and obviously, in our core virtual card in terms of the terms that we offer to these midsized accounts. And then lastly, about 10% or 15% of our overall corporate pay business is really T&E cards, walk-around plastic, which are not all [ white collar ]. There's supplies for construction and other kinds of stuff. But that thing was just way down because travel went effectively to 0. \n So what I'd say back is it's spotty. There are parts of it that are way down, other parts that are healthy, and we're selling a lot. The things recover. I don't know if you had a chance to look, but we put out a supplement. \n I think, Eric, was it Page 9? Page 9, Ashish, in there kind of shows the core virtual card thing kind of came back almost flat in July. So it's come back, really, a tremendous amount just the last 60 days. So look, our outlook on the thing is that the T&E thing will likely stay in the ditch for the rest of the year and we think the other pieces will recover. Yes, Ashish. So first of all, I think we were kind of pleased, I don't know if investors will be, that fuel cards, which are a bit of an on-the-go product, right, a mobility product, were down kind of line average, were soft at the same kind of level as the rest of the business. And I think what that points to again is that it's an essential blue collar, people try it around -- that are around people. So what we see when we look at it is a similar comment from the payables business of a huge mix. So historically, 40% or something of our fuel card clients would grow in a quarter, 20% would be down, 5%, another 20% would be down, 10% and then the remaining amount would be down something. So what we see is the whole curve has moved down. \n Now only 20% grew in the quarter and 40% were down, up to 20%. And then 10% or 15% were down 75%. And so when we look at the clients that are at the bottom and the biggest decline, they're in just what you'd expect these kind of impacted industries, even parts of construction, where those projects fell away, where other parts of construction were still at the top. And so it's just a complete mixed bag of what the clients we have do and how much their business was impacted. \n But the good news is we've seen the whole curve kind of move up, so not just the people down 5% or 10% getting a little bit healthier, but the people down 50% or the people down 75% all seem to be moving up over the last month. So that suggests to us the detail -- what will break is smaller. So -- that we expect, hopefully, as the plot turns, you're to get more of that business back. Matt, it's Ron. We've got a credit score with this new impacted industry overlay. So I don't know, probably 60 days ago or something, we started to layer that over. And so we're not posting yet the mission accomplished signs despite the good performance in Q2. We're keeping credit still tight, and as I mentioned earlier, testing our way into opening it up. So we do think there's some risk when the government slows the thing down. But to Eric's point, we are eyes kind of all on it and not providing particular large amounts of credit to clients that are sitting in those industries. Yes. Matt, it's Ron again. It's a good question. So again, what I'd say is we took the safety route first over the growth route to make sure that we're protecting the company and the liquidity. So we did dial back credit pretty significantly, whatever, 90 days ago. And so as I mentioned, now that we've seen the repayment performance, we've opened that back up, that Beyond Fuel for existing clients. So we had kind of frozen that, at least putting new fuel card clients on that program. So whether it was a good or bad idea, we did it with our eyes wide open. So look, let's protect the liquidity of the company. Let's get careful, and we can spring back into action in different days. So we're getting comfortable that we've seen some number of cycles now, and again, are starting to loosen things up. Yes. So on the first part, you got it right. Against the prior year, expenses were, for Q2, I think, down -- Eric, 11? And I think, Trevor, I said that kind of our forecast, we're kind of planning a down 10%, high single digits kind of 8% to 10% for Q3 and Q4. And on that, what you said, some fair amount of it is variable. Obviously, with volume and revenue lower, you get money back. Sales commissions, you get money back. And then selectively, we slowed some projects that depend on outside parties, third parties that are distracted, doing other things. So it slowed some things where I didn't think we'd get the same kind of traction on them. And I guess we do get some help from FX. We got -- we had a bit of a headwind on the revenue side but clearly helping us on the expense side. But we haven't -- I think I said this before. We're trying to play the long game. So we're not carving lots of money out of client service or out of core tech or out of core sales. We're trying to protect those sets of capabilities for a different day. Yes. I think some of it is the comps or the difficult comps, but I think also some of it is people are a bit frozen when you have volatility and currencies, which we had kind of at the beginning of the quarter. The end of the first quarter, people act, and then I think they froze a bit wondering how things are going to move. So I think [ it froze a bit of the ] hedging product, which carries high margins. And then second, don't miss my credit comment. We did the same thing there in some of those products, where there's volatility and contracts to move out of the money. We -- I dialed those things back so we trimmed lines, which moves some of the share. We split share in that business across some clients. \n So again, I want to make sure everybody hears that there's clearly a pretty high [ R-squared ] between credit openness and growth even of existing clients. And we were, again, quite cautious at the beginning. And now that we've seen kind of that good report, I want everybody to hear me that we're starting to loosen. We're not going completely crazy back to where we are, but we're going to help enable basically the businesses to grab some of that share back. Yes. Bob, it's Ron. It's a good question. I think the answer is the full AP product line as we bought that business a year ago, and it is -- I mean, it's just blockbuster in front of me. It's up some crazy amount since we've owned it and up even a crazy amount in Q2. But more importantly, and in front of me, I think the sales were in the quarter -- in a quarter where we sold half, those sales were 50% or something above plan. So the demand, to your point, in the marketplace to be able to remotely pay bills, I don't know if it's going to stay at an all-time high, but it's certainly top of mind for people now sitting at their houses. \n So to your point, we're clearly going to spend more money on marketing and sales there and shift more energy. So for example, we used to sell virtual cards and then -- and also T&E cards to that same account, so we had some T&E cards in our portfolio. Well, we've kind of reoriented those people to pitch virtual card and then maybe -- oh, by the way, virtual card and full AP, but not T&E card. So we'll, for sure, step up the marketing and sales pressure against that line of business. \n And then second, clearly, on the transaction side. We certainly know all the assets in the space and we like the category. And I'm comfortable -- we're comfortable that we have money now. We've got, you said, $1.9 billion. And it's building, right? We generated cash flow. And I'm not so worried about the receivables and leverage is about 2.5x. So we're sitting in a place, and some of our pals that compete are not sitting as good a place, Bob. So I'd say we like where we are in terms of the pipeline there as well. So more marketing money and maybe use the balance sheet. Yes. We're looking at all, right? We started this thing, as I mentioned, back kind of in the fall or winter last year, looking at our 4 big businesses and this whole construct of adjacency to particularly software adjacencies, their health with the clients. And so we've identified, as I mentioned to Tien-Tsin earlier, adjacencies both in payables, around invoicing, for example, and our other business as well. In lodging, we've got some adjacencies and, as I mentioned, in fuel card. \n So I'm saying it so that people aren't surprised if you see us transact in something that is not exactly in the 4 but obviously, super adjacent or tied to the 4 businesses we're in. But yes, we still like the other categories. I know you, someone who follows payables, likes it and we like it. But we like -- we really do like our other product lines quite a bit, too. If you look at [ our money, our non -- 2 lines ] have grown low mid-teens for years now, Bob. So we're happy with some of the other businesses, too. Oh, are you asking about the -- promoting to sell new tags? Yes. So it's Ron. So yes, the short answer is when some of the competitors came into the toll business, [ we -- the time for our business is the gorilla ] is the -- it's the top of the line and has the most coverage, the best systems, the biggest network. So it was very hard for newbies with [ premier stuff ], in my opinion, to sell, so they went to price. And so we decided to match some of their kind of free-starting things to make sure that we kept a dominant share of the new business. So that's worked pretty well. We started to -- kind of at the end of the year and roll through 3 and 6 months kind of promotions. \n We tested some other ways of signing people up, for example, \"Hey, if you use the thing, you pay the monthly fee. And if you don't, [ we know ].\" So we've gotten creative. And so we're still selling a lot. The sales are still quite good in that business. And more importantly, the promotional stuff is converting into pay, which we studied quite a lot to the people that come on a free pass, actually convert to paying, and they do. So I'd say the approach, so far, so good. Yes. So that's a super good question. I think the answer is it depends. I mean I'd say if the transaction is of any meaningful size, uses any meaningful amount of capital, we have to see our way to returns. So we look at returns the way you guys do money now and what we get back. And again, from that perspective, we study our thesis of things that we can do that can create better returns there. \n But I'd say in some of the smaller ones, we look at other effects like the ability to sell, for example. So if we added an adjacency in payables that help clients in the front end, do we hear back and do we see in the sales results better win rates in the pipeline because our package is a bit more complete? Do we see that in the feedback and the RFPs? And so I'd say to you, if it's a smaller kind of transactions, we would look at factors other than just the profit returns. Yes. We probably wouldn't share that other than I will make the point, which I think we did on Page 9 that if you look at the T&E card, along with a couple of other things, we called about the Brazil benefits and the airline thing, but collectively, those things are less than 4% or 5% of our revenue in July. So the headline is the T&E thing was not a super big part of the corporate payments business overall. And as you can see, it's down 40% volume, 50%, I think I told you, in revenue. And so it's not what's going to make the thing go. We think that thing's going to kind of sit where it's at. And that the growth -- the way to look at the thing is the delta between the virtual card performance, corporate pay performance and revenue in Q2 being down mid-teens and then seeing the virtual card volume recover in July, almost to flat. And so the corporate pay business is going to go as virtual card and FX goes because full AP is rocking and we're going to spend more money on it. The T&E thing will trade flat. So the recovery in virtual cards and clients getting comfortable again to make trades and FX, those will determine the pace of growth in the second half."

You may begin. \nJames Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2020 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Eric Dey, our CFO. \n Following comments from both Ron and Eric, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions. Please note, our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website, fleetcor.com.  \n Throughout this call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appear in today's press release and on our website as previously described.  \n Now before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everybody that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about new products and fee initiatives and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance upon them. These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at www.sec.gov. \n With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? \nRonald F. Clarke: Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call. I plan to cover 4 subjects at the opening here: first, I'll comment on COVID and our response to the crisis; second, I'll share my perspective on Q1 results; third, I'll speak to the trends that we're seeing in our businesses in April; and lastly, I'll cover our framework for resetting priorities in the company.  \n Okay. Let me begin with some remarks about the COVID situation and what we're doing in response. So like many companies, we've taken a number of actions over the last couple of months. Safety. So, first, to ensure the safety of our 8,000-plus worldwide employees, we quickly transitioned the majority of our employees to work from home. I'd say that we're working our way through the new work-from-home model, trying to establish a new cadence for running the company, more teleconferences, more Zoom, more general employee communications, really relooking at people's priorities.\n Second thing, we focused on business continuity to assure our systems and payment products continue to work through this period. I'm pleased to report that in Q1, we delivered the highest system uptime and fewest client incidents in quite some time. So good news there. \n Third, we focused on and shored up our liquidity. We consolidated cash. We raised a bridge loan and we've taken our liquidity to about $1.5 billion. \n And lastly, credit. We've tightened credit lines and payment terms. We've shut down inactive lines, reduced unused line capacity, selectively reduced payment terms for distressed clients or industries, and we've repurposed staff to step up our collections intensity. \n So in this initial response phase, we've had some success managing the situation and learning how to operate within it.  \n Okay. Let me shift gears and talk a bit about our Q1 results. So we reported Q1 revenue of $661 million, up 6%, and cash EPS of $3, up 12%. Our Q1 revenue finished about $10 million lower than our expectations as our businesses began to contract in the second half of March when the shelter-in-place orders took effect. January revenue grew 8%, February revenue, 8%, and our March revenue, 3%, leading to overall print revenue growth of 6% for the quarter. \n In terms of organic revenue growth or what we call like-for-like revenue growth, Q1 finished at 5% overall. Inside of that, fuel coming in at 2%; corporate pay, quite good at 20%; toll at 10%; and lodging at 5%. All of our businesses were impacted by the sudden volume declines in late March, bringing our growth rates for the quarter below target.  \n Despite the softer -- slightly softer revenue in the quarter, our profits actually came in at the high end of our expectations, helped there by a lower tax rate and fewer outstanding shares. \n Our operating trends in Q1 also affected by COVID. Our same-store sales declined 2%, again related predominantly to the late March softening. Our new sales grew 2% versus last year. Again, the market began to get distracted in late March. But thankfully, our client retention remains stable at 91%. So look, given everything, a pretty good financial print for Q1. A good start in January and February helped us hold on to the Q1 performance.  \n Okay. Let me make a turn to the trends we're seeing in April and run through each of our businesses and the COVID impact on each. So first up is fuel. So here in North America, our fuel volumes are 20% to 25% behind last year in April. Our trucking business holding up a bit better than our local. Because many of our North America fuel businesses are essential services, it looks like our volume declines are leveling off. Our North America fuel revenue will be helped quite a bit by spreads in April as the fuel margins remain very wide.  \n In our international fuel card business, volume, weaker than it is here. Business is down 25% to 50% depending on the particular market, mostly because the Europe shutdown was earlier than here in the U.S., and also because in the U.K., in particular, there's a greater proportion of white-collar cardholders who have been more impacted by shelter-in-place orders. Generally, we expect both North America and international fuel revenue in April to be a bit better than the volumes, and that's because fuel revenues or fees, some of them are fixed in nature, think card fees, which tends to have revenue be a bit better than volume.  \n Okay, next up, corporate pay. So in corporate pay, our virtual card volumes off about 20% in April versus prior year. Again, we're expecting probably volumes to level off there as lots of our client AP is fixed. Some good news with our full service, full AP automation and outsourcing business, which we expect to be up in April. The remote capability, the ability to process AP outside of the office, it's resonating. And our cross-border business continuing to hold up and grow a bit in April, mostly due to the ongoing currency volatility. We did take a extraordinary loss -- credit loss in the cross-border business, which Eric will cover in some detail in his remarks.  \n Turning to our lodging business. We expect our core workforce business to be down about 25% versus prior year in April. Our rail, truckers, construction workers continue to need rooms even in this environment. And just as a reminder, most of our workforce lodging travelers drive to their hotels. They don't fly to their hotels. Our new Travelliance airline or crew lodging business will be way down in April, somewhere in the 75%-plus range, as airlines canceled most of their flights, fortunately, a much, much smaller part of our lodging business.  \n Brazil. Brazil toll, a bright spot for us. So despite toll transactions being down in April, we expect toll revenue to be roughly flat or even slightly up, and that's primarily because toll revenues are subscription-based. Lastly, our gift card business expected to be down about 50% in April as many of our brick-and-mortar retail clients are temporarily closed, moving much of the activity in that business to digital redemption.  \n So a few conclusions here. Our April volume and revenue impacts vary quite a bit by business. So some of our business not impacted much, some impacted in the down 25% range and some impacted down to the 50% or 50%-plus range. Fortunately, the businesses most affected, most impacted by COVID represent a smaller proportion of our overall business. \n We do expect April revenue to come in 20% to 25% behind the prior year. We do expect volumes to begin to flatten. We see it sequentially as we look through April. And because many of our cardholders are essential workers, first responders, health care workers, truckers, rail, construction, they keep right on doing what they do. Also important, most of our volume decline thus far is client softness, not client loss. So good news that it could come back on the other side. And lastly, we're a 50% EBITDA business so we can continue to make money and generate cash even at these distressed levels of volume.  \n Okay, let me transition over now to the company's priorities and how we're framing things. So we've basically looked at a reset here of priorities based on the changing environment. So Phase 1, the response phase, which I outlined earlier. We've taken, again, 4 actions already: safety, business continuity, liquidity and credit initially here to respond to the situation. And again, I think we've had decent success and report we're well underway here.  \n Phase 2, the shutdown phase, the place we're at now, where volumes are down and all of us are learning new behaviors. The priorities in this phase are expenses. So we're working to get our expenses down and better aligned to current volumes. We're cutting where we can, where it makes sense, but protecting, particularly the selling system and technology capabilities that we'll need when we come out the other side. \n Selling, we're changing -- modifying how we sell, targeting different prospects, surge industries, moving almost exclusively to digital contact, repositioning our message. So lots of work to progress selling.  \n Projects. We're reevaluating our project work, pushing projects that we can control and it makes sense while delaying other projects that rely on others to a different day.\n And then lastly, we look forward to a future to a phase where businesses begin to reopen and things begin to recover. So message here is we'll be ready. In that phase, the recovery phase, we'll plan to chase acquisitions that maybe, just maybe weren't there before. We also may get some benefit from COVID's new behaviors that we can take advantage of on the other side. So for example, the emphasis on touchless transactions, think electronic tolls versus cash, think distressed passenger mobile applications versus visiting gate agents, think payroll cards versus paper payroll checks. And then even remote working, think about our AP automation and outsourcing service to pay bills when you're outside of the office. So the hope is that we may be better positioned in some of our businesses when we get to the recovery side.  \n So look, in closing, we've never been in a place like this before. We're continuing to operate the business and to serve our essential clients, many of which continue to work through the crisis. We're in process of replanning things, our priorities, our expense levels, our project plans, our sales and go-to-market approaches, in an effort to make the best of the situation. And like you, we're hopeful that the gradual reopening will bring our clients back, and that our business will return to at least some sense of normal as we progress through the year. But I can tell you, we will be ready. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric to provide some additional details on the quarter. Eric? \nEric R. Dey: Thank you, Ron. I'll be going through my regular remarks for the first quarter results as quickly as I can to allow for some additional discussion about the second quarter expectations and your Q&A. \n For the first quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of $661.1 million, up 6% compared to $621.8 million in the first quarter of 2019. GAAP net income decreased 15% to $147.1 million from $172.1 million. And GAAP net income per diluted share decreased 14% to $1.67 from $1.93 in the first quarter of 2019.  \n Included in the first quarter 2020 results was the impact of a $90.1 million or $0.74 per diluted share onetime loss related to a customer receivable in our foreign currency trading business. Due to the extraordinary impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Cambridge business experienced a very large one-off bad debt loss in the first quarter, resulting from a large client in the agricultural commodity space entering voluntary liquidation. The details are in the earnings supplement so I won't go through all of them again here.  \n I'd remind you that approximately 30% of our Cambridge revenue comes from hedging, whereas approximately 70% comes from making international payments. I'd also note that Cambridge does not take FX risk. Our books and/or position are covered by back-to-back offsetting transactions with banks. This is a credit loss due to a customer's bankruptcy and inability to cover their AP margin calls. While we do believe there is a chance of some recovery through the liquidation process, we have determined it appropriate to take a provision for the full bad debt loss of $90 million on the customer due to uncertainty of any future recovery. We view this as truly a one-off event as this business has experienced less than 1.5% bad debt loss as a percentage of revenue for as far back as we have data, including periods prior to our acquisition of Cambridge in the third quarter of 2017. Please see our earnings supplement for a detailed overview of this onetime loss.  \n Also included in the first quarter of 2019 was the impact of a $15.7 million or $0.17 per diluted share impairment charge related to our minority investment in a telematics business. Excluding the impact of the onetime customer loss and impairment charge, net income increased 13%, and net income per diluted share increased 15% in the first quarter of 2020 versus the first quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP financial metrics that we will be discussing, our adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, and the reconciliation to GAAP numbers, is provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2020 increased 11% to $264.5 million compared to $238.4 million in the same period last year. And adjusted net income per diluted share increased 12% to $3 compared to $2.67 in adjusted net income per diluted share in the first quarter of 2019. \n First quarter of 2020 results reflect a negative year-over-year impact from the macroeconomic environment of approximately $6 million in revenue. The negative macro was driven mostly by lower foreign exchange rates, specifically the Brazilian real and U.K. pound, when compared with the first quarter of 2019. We believe FX negatively impacted revenue by approximately $21 million. Fuel prices were down slightly year-over-year for the full quarter. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe it was mostly neutral to the quarter. And finally, fuel spreads had about a $15 million favorable impact in the quarter.  \n Now moving down the income statement. Excluding the impact of the onetime loss in our foreign currency trading business, total operating expenses were up 10% for the first quarter of 2020 to $370.1 million compared with $337.6 million in the first quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions and bad debt expense. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses, excluding the onetime loss, were approximately 56% compared to 54.3% in the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of a onetime customer loss, bad debt expense in the first quarter of 2020 was $27.7 million or 9 basis points compared to $22.2 million or 8 basis points in the first quarter of 2019. Included in the first quarter was a reserve of $10 million associated with expected additional credit losses around the world due to the impact of COVID-19. \n Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 4% to $64.5 million in the first quarter of 2020 from $67.4 million in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. Interest expense decreased 9% to $35.7 million compared to $39.1 million in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in interest expense was due primarily to decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt, partially offset by the impact of additional borrowing for share buybacks.  \n Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was 14.6% compared to 24.9% for the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the onetime customer loss and the impact of the impairment charge in the first quarter of 2019, our effective tax rate was 18.9% for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 23.3% in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to additional compensation expense booked for tax purposes on stock option exercises.  \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1,552,000,000 in total cash. Approximately $482 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. We also have approximately $352 million of undrawn availability on our revolver, and closed on a $250 million bridge loan in April in order to maximize the company's liquidity. So in total, we believe we have adequate liquidity to weather the COVID storm.  \n As of March 31, 2020, we had $4,323,000,000 outstanding on our credit facilities and $819 million borrowed in our securitization facility. We purchased approximately 2 million shares in the first quarter for $530 million at an average price of $263. We have approximately $326 million in repurchase capacity remaining under our current authorization. \n As of March 31, 2020, our leverage ratio was 2.75x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA as calculated under our credit agreement. Finally, we spent approximately $18 million on CapEx during the first quarter of 2020.  \n Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter and balance of the year. First, I want to remind everyone that although our businesses are very resilient, our businesses have all been impacted by COVID-19, some more than others. As a reminder, our business models are primarily recurring revenue in nature. We have a very broad customer base and diversified businesses across industries and geographies.  \n Second, we are suspending our full year guidance. There is simply too much uncertainty regarding the resumption of business activity around the world to accurately predict our volumes could be in the second quarter and rest of the year. \n Some revenue trending data for the first quarter in April are as follows. Revenues in January and February were tracking at or ahead of our expectations before the impact of COVID-19 in March. Through the first 2 months of the year, revenue was approximately 8% and 8% ahead of prior year, respectively. In March, our volumes were impacted mid-month. And as a result, March revenue was only up approximately 3% versus prior year. And for the quarter, revenue was 6% ahead of prior year.  \n Our expectations are for volumes to hit their respective floors in April and begin to recover gradually as the world starts to reopen. April revenue is expected to be down approximately 20% versus prior year. We expect that the second quarter will be the lowest in terms of volume and revenue. And as the economy starts to recover, volumes should build throughout the year, resulting in higher revenue and earnings per share in the third and fourth quarters. \n With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take a question from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: I'll start by just asking on the expense outlook here and what you can control. What are you thinking about levers on the cost side that you might do here to protect the bottom line from some of the macro pressures you called out? \nRonald F. Clarke: Tien-Tsin, it's Ron. I'd say we're probably a target of about 5%. And it would be on volume-related things, things that flex versus selling system or tech things. We'll probably also clip the capital plan a bit. But in our business, you can't save your way to profitability, our profits turn on revenues, and so we're going to be quite careful to not over-dial that. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes. No, I expect that. And then you mentioned M&A. With the world changing, valuations maybe opens up the opportunity set a little bit, just your appetite, Ron, to do deals here. Are we in a wait and see mode? Or are you willing to pull the trigger on some deals? \nRonald F. Clarke: I'm telling you, Tien-Tsin, I say never. We think -- I think this is a game-changer. You've heard our complaints ongoing the last few years about people in the space driving up prices and seller expectations and free money and stuff. I think lots of companies are hurt. Companies that have assets we're interested in are hurt. I think there'll be some impact obviously to valuations. I think people that compete with us for deals will have more thoughts on the credit side. So I'd say to you, probably it's high, that's a really long time, and we're spending lots of time, what I'll call kind of new deal thinking. There's 5 or 6 assets that we've coveted for some period of time that I personally think may have some chance of opening. So I would say high. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Ryan Cary with Bank of America. \nRyan Cary: Just following up a little bit on Tien-Tsin's question. It sounds like most your cost saves are more on the volume variable side rather than the investment side. So are you still planning on the step-up in sales and IT expenses you discussed last quarter? And I think you called out expectations from incremental IT spend in the $200-plus million-ish range in 2020. Is that still on track? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Ryan, it's Ron. So that's right. We built sales plans to try to grow sales production, call it, circa 15%. We kind of grow sales expense, a little slower, call it, 10%, 12%. So yes, we built the plan to do that. Some of it takes care of itself, right? If people don't reach the production goals, you get some of that money back in the form of lower commissions. I'd also say we pulled back on some kinds of marketing and lead gen, obviously, all the physical trade shows and stuff like that. But with that said, I think we're being super cautious on the headcount side. It takes a long time to build a really good field group and a really good telesales group. And so I think we're quite reluctant to reduce that and honestly, not to even kind of refill or replace as we move through the year. So we're clearly trying to play the long game on selling. \nRyan Cary: Got it. And can you talk about some of the trends you saw in the toll business in the quarter? I was a little surprised the organic growth slowed to 10%.  Was there anything particular worth calling out? And anything you can say about growth of new urban toll users in the quarter? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. So first of all, I'd call it -- it's a really good result in this second half of March to still pencil that thing out of 10%. We're quite happy with it. But the reason it's not close to the mid-teens would be a couple of things. First, the transactions did soften and we did get paid a bit on spend, particularly on the B2B side there. So the COVID clipped a couple of points at the end. And then the other thing is the guy that leads that, they pushed to offer some free tags to build our tag volume at the end of the year to compete with the banks. And so we have -- we'll be rolling off kind of in the next month or 2. We probably have another couple of percent of what I'll call free tags sitting in our Q1 results. So those would be kind of the 2 nicks on the number. \nRyan Cary: And anything you can say about the growth of new urban tolls in the quarter or just trends that you're seeing? \nRonald F. Clarke: Can you say -- you broke up a bit, Ryan? \nRyan Cary: I apologize. Just anything around the new urban tag toll users in the quarter or any metrics around usage there. \nEric R. Dey: In terms of urban tag sales usage? \nRonald F. Clarke: Urban tags. Yes. I don't have that handy. I mean it's down. I think we targeted some kind of number, call it, 40,000 to 50,000 a quarter. I'll have to get back to you, I don't have any handy. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Appreciate all the disclosures, and I'm glad you guys are well. I guess the first question is on the comments on the second quarter being the weakest. Ron, you mentioned you have some defensive mix of businesses inside of your business. Can you just talk about how much of the volume is from these defensive areas versus the more cyclical stuff? And what gives you the confidence that we're going to inflect in the second quarter? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean I think the confidence comes from the sequential analysis, right? So we have a bit more texture than we set out. We've got daily reports. And I think from what we put in the supplement, it appears to us that virtually all of our businesses are planing, bottoming, if you will, at this point. And we've got another week, I think, of learning. We just had a big review yesterday. So I think -- what you guys haven't seen. So I'd say, if anything, we're starting actually to see a few of the business tick up a tiny bit. So the comment is our best guess is we're bottoming. And that we, Eric and I, think probably that May and June, it will be a smidge better than what we said in April. I quoted April around 20%-ish off of the prior year. So if, in fact, the tickup is happening, then clearly, Q3, if the world reopens, will be better. So our best guess is Q2 will be the worst. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. And you also mentioned, Ron, like that the health of the portfolio is pretty strong given the defensive mix. Can you just talk about how do you feel about the general health? I mean do you feel that certain areas of your portfolio might be at risk if there's a prolonged economic downturn? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean I think we tried, Sanjay, with that chart to get into the haves and the have-nots. So I think like every business that you guys follow, some are affected none, some and a lot. And I think that's the same thing inside the FLEETCOR portfolio. And so we have businesses on that page that we think are the weakest and probably would have the longest trough. So for example, and again that page in front is what we called out our... \nEric R. Dey: It's Page 10, Sanjay, in the earnings supplement. \nRonald F. Clarke: So the couple -- look, the couple, Sanjay, that would be, I think, the softest, the longest would be the recent lodging airline acquisition we did that fundamentally relies on the planes flying and crew flying. So that thing's off, I don't know, 75% and it would be off for a while. And then the gift card business, to the extent that brick-and-mortar retail stays closed or some of those go BK, some of those go out of business, I'd say those couple of businesses, I think, will be weakest. But the other ones, I think if we've got one message today, again is, the impact is softness. So it's a fuel card client with 10 drivers driving 2/3 of what they used to drive versus he's fired 3 or 4 of those captains. So the ability for the thing to kind of come back, if the clients kind of come back, we come back. And so I'd say the rest of the businesses, obviously, we've got a few that are in the green, that are kind of happy days. And then we've got the rest that are kind of sitting there waiting for the clients to get healthy again. So I think other than a couple that I call out, that I'd say have a longer curve to kind of come back, the couple I called out, I think the rest should be on their way back because of the essential service nature of our workforce. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. \nTrevor Williams: On corporate payments, I wanted to ask a few more on the sales side that Ron, you alluded to in your prepared remarks. Just with most people working remotely now, I'm wondering how that's impacted the selling process in that business. Because my assumption, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is that these are fairly long sales cycles and implementation periods. So as we think about you guys prebooking a lot of next year's revenue growth in the prior year, just how much of that we should be expecting to come from new customers signed in 2020? Just -- and what the progress looks like there. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, Trevor. You're totally right on current year. I think we've called out before that in the corporate pay business, particularly in the core virtual card business, most of the revenue from new accounts is sold the prior year, call it, somewhere 80% to 90%. So the revenue in 2020 is driven off of sales contracted but not implemented from '19.\n So on your second question, I'd say we're still finding our way, right? So this thing surprised all of us in March. We have a marketing and sales plan and closing plan, and it got changed, right? You can't have trade shows and we're not visiting large accounts like we used to. So I'd say there's been a repositioning of how to sell, what marketing to do, how to contact people. And I'd say, if anything, the receptivity seems high, like people have taken the call, taken the appointments. What I think is still unclear is can we close, right? We'll call it 30 days into this and some of these people have more time on their hands or they're just being kinder in these times, but the contact rates are kind of okay. So I'd say probably in 60 days, we'll have a fix on whether sales can kind of be where we thought, just done in a different way, or whether sales are going to be softer. I'd say we just don't know yet. \nTrevor Williams: Okay. No, that's really helpful. And then just on credit, Eric, I appreciate your comments in your prepared remarks. But was just hoping to get some more color on how credits trended in April maybe month-to-date. Whether that's either delinquencies or actual losses starting to come through more in earnest, just as we think about where we may need to expect losses to flex up to as we work through the trough in Q2? And then just wondering if you've seen any change in payment patterns after the PPP loans hit, and especially with some of the smaller fleet customers? \nRonald F. Clarke: Trevor, it's Ron. Let me take the first part and then I'll let Eric comment on the second part. I would say it's the most surprising thing to us so far, and surprising in a good way. So when this thing hit, you can imagine, we did student body, right, to work on credit and liquidity collections. And so we've got a monitoring system that looks at trip worthy, how rates people going delinquent, and then roll rates aging. And so I'd say that it's up, so we have benchmarked in all of our businesses. I'd say it's up but it's not up in any kind of meaningful way. So too early to call that, \"Hey, we've gotten through this between the stimulus money and stock. Hey, we're going to kind of be okay.\" But if you said to me now, how did it look, say, this Phoenix thing, it looks pretty good. \n And the last point on it is, we actually get a benefit from the lower volumes and the lower fuel prices. The fact that spend, and effectively AR -- new AR balances are dropping, obviously, it makes the collection assignment smaller and the credit risk smaller. So I'd say on this, this one, say, on the Phoenix thing, so far, so good. \nEric R. Dey: Yes. And Trevor, just to add to that, this is Eric. Obviously, we're -- we take a look at the aging very closely and we track it week-to-week. Obviously, exactly what the progress is in some of these aging buckets. And Ron indicated, we have been surprised that it really hasn't changed a whole lot. We've seen a little bit of tick up in some of the aging buckets, particularly in the fuel category in the U.S., particularly in the SMB category, so it's a little worse. And we've seen a little bit of tick up in Brazil as well, kind of a little worse. But again, nothing dramatic, nothing kind of to the magnitude that we thought it was going to be. \n We look at our AR balances a lot. I mean if you look at our AR balance at the end of the year, we had about $2.6 billion in AR, which moved to about 2 points -- I don't know, $2.1 billion, kind of at the end of March. And then at the end of April, we're down to about $1.8 billion. So the risk profile of the remaining AR is also getting better just because of the sheer amount of the outstanding AR that we have. So all in all, I think we're in pretty good shape. I think we were pretty conservative to take a bit of the reserve that we did at the end of the first quarter and we're keeping a close eye on it. And we've changed a lot of practices, and we do some things -- done some things to collect some of our money sooner. So I think we're off to an okay place. \nRonald F. Clarke: And let me just add, Trevor, one thing. We don't compete on terms like we compete with banks and other people. So we had policies for a long time in this company to compete on products and on the tech and on the convenience of the product. And so we have tons of daily, daily, tons of short terms weekly. In Europe, we have half of our book, I think, is insured. So we carve through, we have tons internationally on direct debit collect where we basically pull the money. And so in those cases, you've got trip rates in the 2% range, very, very small kinds of delinquency. So when we studied our old book again intently a month ago when this started, I think we feel pretty good structurally of how we've got the thing set up. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Steven Wald with Morgan Stanley. \nSteven Wald: Maybe just on a high level, starting with corporate payments. Ron, you talked about never been higher in terms of watching for opportunities in the M&A side here. But if we start in corporate payments, and maybe you could expand this out to some of the other areas. Could you maybe talk about as you're looking at opportunities or as you're looking at your own offering today and watching the experience of this downturn and disruptions and what you can solve for, what sort of changed, or if it has changed at all, in terms of where you want to be in the landscape of the corporate payment's B2B opportunity since we caught up 3 months ago? And maybe if you could expand it out to the other areas. Are there any areas that you serve across your offerings that you maybe feel less inclined to be in actively or expanding? \nRonald F. Clarke: No. It's a good question. I mean in the context of COVID and sheltering and the trends that we might expect over the next year or 2, this payables or corporate payments business, it's a great place. And the reason is that lots of AP, lots of the spend is fixed, think leases or IT contracts and stuff. And so bills have to get paid or services get turned off. And so I'd say, if anything, we'd like this corporate pay business for 5 years, and we've built a bunch of stuff and added to it and invested it. I'd say if anything, we like it even more. I think it's probably a little bit more defensive going forward versus the kind of the mobility stuff. Maybe mobility stays depressed a bit, whereas kind of AP stays where it is. So I'd say, if anything, it probably elevates that segment even a notch higher for us. \nSteven Wald: Understood. Maybe just in terms of a quick follow-up; I was looking to your slide, I think Slide 8, you had talked about the corporate payments growth bouncing back to 20%. But I think you also disclosed that you pulled the payroll card segment out of there, and that was the area that you called out last quarter with a sort of trouble from the prior -- from last year's disruption to services. What was the growth looking like ex those adjustments? I don't know if you restated that in the prior quarters or not. \nRonald F. Clarke: Eric, do you know? \nEric R. Dey: Yes. I'm looking for that. I don't know if we did a schedule on it. Yes. I know, Trevor, again, is the payroll card business was in the circa 30% down in volume for April. So if you stuck it on that chart to track the rest of the business, it would have brought it down some. And I think the 20% number is a revenue number. I don't have the payroll card revenue. But my guess, it's probably off in the 30% range. \nRonald F. Clarke: Steven, I'll get back to you with what it was in the first quarter. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Pete Christiansen with Citi. \nPeter Christiansen: And thanks for the great slide deck, fantastic job there. Ron, I was wondering -- I know FLEETCOR is a completely different company 10-plus years ago, but at least from the small fleet side, I was just wondering if you could share some of the experiences that you had back in the last downturn in terms of, I guess, attrition and perhaps credit on the small fleet side, I think that would be just -- that would be helpful. \nEric R. Dey: Pete, this is Eric. Yes, if you go back to 2008 and '09, I mean to your point, we are a completely different company today than we were back in 2008 and '09. But I'll comment a little bit on the fuel business, which is mostly what we had back then. So when we were into that downturn, we did see volumes soften pretty significantly. So we saw same-store sales softness kind of in the mid-single digits, so it was pretty high. Bad debt, it kind of squeaked up a little bit. We kind of ran -- I don't remember the exact numbers, but probably the mid- to high teens from a basis point standpoint in bad debt back then. And then it escalated to probably in the 40, 45 basis point range at its peak in 2008 and '09. So volumes down kind of in the high single digits, bad debt still, call it, kind of doubled over that -- in the fuel card segment. That's the kind of the business that we have then. \nPeter Christiansen: Right. That's helpful. And then as I look at the gift card business, there's been a couple of high-profile retailers filing lately. Can you walk us through what happens if you have a partner that does that? Are there changes in like breakage or availability of funds? Anything of that would be helpful. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, Pete, it's Ron. So mostly in our gift business, we don't take much credit risk because we don't really move money, right? We're really an accounting system, if you will, for retailers and a program manager. So the one place where there's credit risk in that is in card shipments. So if you're at Macy's or Dick's Sporting Goods and we -- you give us a card order, and we go to the card maker and take the stock and make it for you, put the Macy's logo on it and then send it to you, that would be the one place, right? If we ship it to you, whatever, March 15 and then -- so you have to pay us on March 31 and you don't. And so the good news on that is that our guy that runs that business, right, have chased all that stuff pretty hard when this thing hit. So right now, we have very, very little exposure, fortunately. And I put him on notice that we're not doing many of those kind of things again. We're going to do a lot of card shipments to challenged retailers, at least not short term. So I'd say we're probably in a pretty good place there. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: Ron, if you look across the business today, given everything that's going on, are you reassessing or thinking through where you'll invest in the future? Are there -- is this crisis kind of teaching any lessons in terms of changing priorities that you might have in terms of business investment? That could be product line, that could be geography. I know it's a very broad question. But do you feel sort of like it's just trying to hunker down with what we have today, and it will come out on the other end relatively intact? Or are there some more longer-term changes that you might kind of contemplate in terms of where you place your bets in the marketplace? \nRonald F. Clarke: No. That's a really good question, Ramsey. I'd say, yes, I think like all of us on this call, we're processing what the future could be, what will the world look like in 3 months, 6 months. But for sure, I think there'll be changes. So on the portfolio side, I'd say we're super happy with the kind of the 4 categories that we've got, the 3 employee card things, fuel, lodging and toll, and then obviously, we like the payable things. So there's nothing in the 4 businesses where we go, \"Oh, oh, I feel like I'm going to like those less.\" As I said in some of my comments, I think some of those categories will actually be helped by this thing. My sense is that a lot of our changes are going to be on the functional side. And what I mean by that is our constructs and our policies around, like, credit. Our approaches around selling. Our approaches around part time, full time. I think we're going through all kinds of thinking now of, if this world stays this way or there's some things we've learned in this world that we might stick with even if the world goes back to the way it was, I think there's going to be a lot of -- I'd say, it's still early. If you ask me that question again in 90 days, I think we'll have a better answer. But for sure, there will be a bunch of stuff we do different, for sure. \nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. And I was wondering also, and forgive me if I missed this before, but could you parse out a little bit of the same-store sales performance? Just in terms of -- sometimes you can give us incremental color on underlying verticals within some of your businesses on the same-store sales kind of... \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Eric will love to bring that, but I'll tell that obviously, the 2% drop was kind of all right in the last 2 weeks. So that means that dropped like a rock, obviously, given the April data that we've shown you. So I want to just prepare people that softness is what's taking our volume down. So you're going to hear a much different number in Q2. But you want to... \nEric R. Dey: Yes. I mean just to give you a little color, Ramsey. What we saw was, as you can imagine, Ron indicated a lot of the softness that we saw happen in the last 2, 3 weeks of the month of March. But fuel was a little bit soft, probably came in 3%, 4% soft overall, and lodging overall was a bit soft. But don't forget, that includes the TA business as well, that was kind of in the 4% to 5% range. I think it was offset by strength that we saw in our corporate payments business, which was actually up and also strength in our Brazil business, which was also up a little bit because of the clients that we have there and the additional products that we've added. So it's a bit of a mixed bag, but the softness was kind of where you would think it would be and the strength that kind of where you thought it would be as well. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from David Togut with Evercore ISI. \nDavid Togut: Ron, the high customer revenue retention historically of 91% to 92% has been a strength of the business. You closed the first quarter at 90.7%. As you look into Q2, which you've called as the likely trough, can you maintain customer revenue retention in the 90% to 92% range? \nRonald F. Clarke: David, it's a good question. I'd say we don't know. I think it's going to be a function a bit of the help of clients, honestly, and what the casualty rate is and the BK rate among our client base. And so a lot of the retention aggregate number is a function of mix. We have businesses that have very different kinds of retention rates based on size, enterprise versus small and then even type of business like payables growth, the spend growth of clients. So I don't know the answer. I guess it will probably be lower because we'll likely have more casualties in our client base where the businesses go out of business, which is already represent, and then credit. So again, if you simplistically said, \"Hey, we lose 9% or 10% of our revenue per year.\" 1/3 or 1/2 of that is the business getting back, the business getting weak, the business closing, the business not having the creditworthiness to be a client. \n So yes, my guess is that's probably going to go up some in the quarter. Now again, once you get to that base, we get through this thing, that there's nothing structural that concerns me that would take us lower. \nDavid Togut: I see. Understood. Just as a quick final question, and I apologize if you addressed this earlier, but looking at capital allocation priorities. You bought back $530 million of stock in the first quarter so you're very active. You have $326 million left on the repurchase authorization. Will you be deploying cash towards share repurchases in this environment, possibly looking more at acquisitions? The seller expectations come down. Or will you be more in the mode of husbanding capital? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. David, another good question. I'll let Eric comment, too. But I'd say we're in a preserve mode. We are -- I told the Board. We agreed with the Board. We are in a precaution. We want the maximum liquidity. We want a company that got all kinds of cushion until we see the other side of this and see the heartbeat on the other side. So we will not be buying back shares over the next quarter or 2. On the other side, I think, on the deal side, like I said, if there's something unique that comes out of this, we might pull the trigger a little bit sooner than later. But I'd say we're probably in a bit of a hold pattern for a while. \nOperator: And there are no further telephone questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. \nJames Eglseder: Guys, thanks for being on the call. Let us know if you have any additional questions, if you need anything else. Have a good night. \nOperator: And once again, that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric R. Dey",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron. I'll be going through my regular remarks for the first quarter results as quickly as I can to allow for some additional discussion about the second quarter expectations and your Q&A. \n For the first quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of $661.1 million, up 6% compared to $621.8 million in the first quarter of 2019. GAAP net income decreased 15% to $147.1 million from $172.1 million. And GAAP net income per diluted share decreased 14% to $1.67 from $1.93 in the first quarter of 2019.  \n Included in the first quarter 2020 results was the impact of a $90.1 million or $0.74 per diluted share onetime loss related to a customer receivable in our foreign currency trading business. Due to the extraordinary impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Cambridge business experienced a very large one-off bad debt loss in the first quarter, resulting from a large client in the agricultural commodity space entering voluntary liquidation. The details are in the earnings supplement so I won't go through all of them again here.  \n I'd remind you that approximately 30% of our Cambridge revenue comes from hedging, whereas approximately 70% comes from making international payments. I'd also note that Cambridge does not take FX risk. Our books and/or position are covered by back-to-back offsetting transactions with banks. This is a credit loss due to a customer's bankruptcy and inability to cover their AP margin calls. While we do believe there is a chance of some recovery through the liquidation process, we have determined it appropriate to take a provision for the full bad debt loss of $90 million on the customer due to uncertainty of any future recovery. We view this as truly a one-off event as this business has experienced less than 1.5% bad debt loss as a percentage of revenue for as far back as we have data, including periods prior to our acquisition of Cambridge in the third quarter of 2017. Please see our earnings supplement for a detailed overview of this onetime loss.  \n Also included in the first quarter of 2019 was the impact of a $15.7 million or $0.17 per diluted share impairment charge related to our minority investment in a telematics business. Excluding the impact of the onetime customer loss and impairment charge, net income increased 13%, and net income per diluted share increased 15% in the first quarter of 2020 versus the first quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP financial metrics that we will be discussing, our adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, and the reconciliation to GAAP numbers, is provided in Exhibit 1 of our press release. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2020 increased 11% to $264.5 million compared to $238.4 million in the same period last year. And adjusted net income per diluted share increased 12% to $3 compared to $2.67 in adjusted net income per diluted share in the first quarter of 2019. \n First quarter of 2020 results reflect a negative year-over-year impact from the macroeconomic environment of approximately $6 million in revenue. The negative macro was driven mostly by lower foreign exchange rates, specifically the Brazilian real and U.K. pound, when compared with the first quarter of 2019. We believe FX negatively impacted revenue by approximately $21 million. Fuel prices were down slightly year-over-year for the full quarter. And although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of these changes, we believe it was mostly neutral to the quarter. And finally, fuel spreads had about a $15 million favorable impact in the quarter.  \n Now moving down the income statement. Excluding the impact of the onetime loss in our foreign currency trading business, total operating expenses were up 10% for the first quarter of 2020 to $370.1 million compared with $337.6 million in the first quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions and bad debt expense. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses, excluding the onetime loss, were approximately 56% compared to 54.3% in the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of a onetime customer loss, bad debt expense in the first quarter of 2020 was $27.7 million or 9 basis points compared to $22.2 million or 8 basis points in the first quarter of 2019. Included in the first quarter was a reserve of $10 million associated with expected additional credit losses around the world due to the impact of COVID-19. \n Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 4% to $64.5 million in the first quarter of 2020 from $67.4 million in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. Interest expense decreased 9% to $35.7 million compared to $39.1 million in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in interest expense was due primarily to decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt, partially offset by the impact of additional borrowing for share buybacks.  \n Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was 14.6% compared to 24.9% for the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the onetime customer loss and the impact of the impairment charge in the first quarter of 2019, our effective tax rate was 18.9% for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 23.3% in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to additional compensation expense booked for tax purposes on stock option exercises.  \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1,552,000,000 in total cash. Approximately $482 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. We also have approximately $352 million of undrawn availability on our revolver, and closed on a $250 million bridge loan in April in order to maximize the company's liquidity. So in total, we believe we have adequate liquidity to weather the COVID storm.  \n As of March 31, 2020, we had $4,323,000,000 outstanding on our credit facilities and $819 million borrowed in our securitization facility. We purchased approximately 2 million shares in the first quarter for $530 million at an average price of $263. We have approximately $326 million in repurchase capacity remaining under our current authorization. \n As of March 31, 2020, our leverage ratio was 2.75x EBITDA, which is well below our covenant level of 4x EBITDA as calculated under our credit agreement. Finally, we spent approximately $18 million on CapEx during the first quarter of 2020.  \n Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter and balance of the year. First, I want to remind everyone that although our businesses are very resilient, our businesses have all been impacted by COVID-19, some more than others. As a reminder, our business models are primarily recurring revenue in nature. We have a very broad customer base and diversified businesses across industries and geographies.  \n Second, we are suspending our full year guidance. There is simply too much uncertainty regarding the resumption of business activity around the world to accurately predict our volumes could be in the second quarter and rest of the year. \n Some revenue trending data for the first quarter in April are as follows. Revenues in January and February were tracking at or ahead of our expectations before the impact of COVID-19 in March. Through the first 2 months of the year, revenue was approximately 8% and 8% ahead of prior year, respectively. In March, our volumes were impacted mid-month. And as a result, March revenue was only up approximately 3% versus prior year. And for the quarter, revenue was 6% ahead of prior year.  \n Our expectations are for volumes to hit their respective floors in April and begin to recover gradually as the world starts to reopen. April revenue is expected to be down approximately 20% versus prior year. We expect that the second quarter will be the lowest in terms of volume and revenue. And as the economy starts to recover, volumes should build throughout the year, resulting in higher revenue and earnings per share in the third and fourth quarters. \n With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. In terms of urban tag sales usage? It's Page 10, Sanjay, in the earnings supplement. Yes. And Trevor, just to add to that, this is Eric. Obviously, we're -- we take a look at the aging very closely and we track it week-to-week. Obviously, exactly what the progress is in some of these aging buckets. And Ron indicated, we have been surprised that it really hasn't changed a whole lot. We've seen a little bit of tick up in some of the aging buckets, particularly in the fuel category in the U.S., particularly in the SMB category, so it's a little worse. And we've seen a little bit of tick up in Brazil as well, kind of a little worse. But again, nothing dramatic, nothing kind of to the magnitude that we thought it was going to be. \n We look at our AR balances a lot. I mean if you look at our AR balance at the end of the year, we had about $2.6 billion in AR, which moved to about 2 points -- I don't know, $2.1 billion, kind of at the end of March. And then at the end of April, we're down to about $1.8 billion. So the risk profile of the remaining AR is also getting better just because of the sheer amount of the outstanding AR that we have. So all in all, I think we're in pretty good shape. I think we were pretty conservative to take a bit of the reserve that we did at the end of the first quarter and we're keeping a close eye on it. And we've changed a lot of practices, and we do some things -- done some things to collect some of our money sooner. So I think we're off to an okay place. Yes. I'm looking for that. I don't know if we did a schedule on it. Yes. I know, Trevor, again, is the payroll card business was in the circa 30% down in volume for April. So if you stuck it on that chart to track the rest of the business, it would have brought it down some. And I think the 20% number is a revenue number. I don't have the payroll card revenue. But my guess, it's probably off in the 30% range. Pete, this is Eric. Yes, if you go back to 2008 and '09, I mean to your point, we are a completely different company today than we were back in 2008 and '09. But I'll comment a little bit on the fuel business, which is mostly what we had back then. So when we were into that downturn, we did see volumes soften pretty significantly. So we saw same-store sales softness kind of in the mid-single digits, so it was pretty high. Bad debt, it kind of squeaked up a little bit. We kind of ran -- I don't remember the exact numbers, but probably the mid- to high teens from a basis point standpoint in bad debt back then. And then it escalated to probably in the 40, 45 basis point range at its peak in 2008 and '09. So volumes down kind of in the high single digits, bad debt still, call it, kind of doubled over that -- in the fuel card segment. That's the kind of the business that we have then. Yes. I mean just to give you a little color, Ramsey. What we saw was, as you can imagine, Ron indicated a lot of the softness that we saw happen in the last 2, 3 weeks of the month of March. But fuel was a little bit soft, probably came in 3%, 4% soft overall, and lodging overall was a bit soft. But don't forget, that includes the TA business as well, that was kind of in the 4% to 5% range. I think it was offset by strength that we saw in our corporate payments business, which was actually up and also strength in our Brazil business, which was also up a little bit because of the clients that we have there and the additional products that we've added. So it's a bit of a mixed bag, but the softness was kind of where you would think it would be and the strength that kind of where you thought it would be as well."

            "name": "Ronald F. Clarke",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call. I plan to cover 4 subjects at the opening here: first, I'll comment on COVID and our response to the crisis; second, I'll share my perspective on Q1 results; third, I'll speak to the trends that we're seeing in our businesses in April; and lastly, I'll cover our framework for resetting priorities in the company.  \n Okay. Let me begin with some remarks about the COVID situation and what we're doing in response. So like many companies, we've taken a number of actions over the last couple of months. Safety. So, first, to ensure the safety of our 8,000-plus worldwide employees, we quickly transitioned the majority of our employees to work from home. I'd say that we're working our way through the new work-from-home model, trying to establish a new cadence for running the company, more teleconferences, more Zoom, more general employee communications, really relooking at people's priorities.\n Second thing, we focused on business continuity to assure our systems and payment products continue to work through this period. I'm pleased to report that in Q1, we delivered the highest system uptime and fewest client incidents in quite some time. So good news there. \n Third, we focused on and shored up our liquidity. We consolidated cash. We raised a bridge loan and we've taken our liquidity to about $1.5 billion. \n And lastly, credit. We've tightened credit lines and payment terms. We've shut down inactive lines, reduced unused line capacity, selectively reduced payment terms for distressed clients or industries, and we've repurposed staff to step up our collections intensity. \n So in this initial response phase, we've had some success managing the situation and learning how to operate within it.  \n Okay. Let me shift gears and talk a bit about our Q1 results. So we reported Q1 revenue of $661 million, up 6%, and cash EPS of $3, up 12%. Our Q1 revenue finished about $10 million lower than our expectations as our businesses began to contract in the second half of March when the shelter-in-place orders took effect. January revenue grew 8%, February revenue, 8%, and our March revenue, 3%, leading to overall print revenue growth of 6% for the quarter. \n In terms of organic revenue growth or what we call like-for-like revenue growth, Q1 finished at 5% overall. Inside of that, fuel coming in at 2%; corporate pay, quite good at 20%; toll at 10%; and lodging at 5%. All of our businesses were impacted by the sudden volume declines in late March, bringing our growth rates for the quarter below target.  \n Despite the softer -- slightly softer revenue in the quarter, our profits actually came in at the high end of our expectations, helped there by a lower tax rate and fewer outstanding shares. \n Our operating trends in Q1 also affected by COVID. Our same-store sales declined 2%, again related predominantly to the late March softening. Our new sales grew 2% versus last year. Again, the market began to get distracted in late March. But thankfully, our client retention remains stable at 91%. So look, given everything, a pretty good financial print for Q1. A good start in January and February helped us hold on to the Q1 performance.  \n Okay. Let me make a turn to the trends we're seeing in April and run through each of our businesses and the COVID impact on each. So first up is fuel. So here in North America, our fuel volumes are 20% to 25% behind last year in April. Our trucking business holding up a bit better than our local. Because many of our North America fuel businesses are essential services, it looks like our volume declines are leveling off. Our North America fuel revenue will be helped quite a bit by spreads in April as the fuel margins remain very wide.  \n In our international fuel card business, volume, weaker than it is here. Business is down 25% to 50% depending on the particular market, mostly because the Europe shutdown was earlier than here in the U.S., and also because in the U.K., in particular, there's a greater proportion of white-collar cardholders who have been more impacted by shelter-in-place orders. Generally, we expect both North America and international fuel revenue in April to be a bit better than the volumes, and that's because fuel revenues or fees, some of them are fixed in nature, think card fees, which tends to have revenue be a bit better than volume.  \n Okay, next up, corporate pay. So in corporate pay, our virtual card volumes off about 20% in April versus prior year. Again, we're expecting probably volumes to level off there as lots of our client AP is fixed. Some good news with our full service, full AP automation and outsourcing business, which we expect to be up in April. The remote capability, the ability to process AP outside of the office, it's resonating. And our cross-border business continuing to hold up and grow a bit in April, mostly due to the ongoing currency volatility. We did take a extraordinary loss -- credit loss in the cross-border business, which Eric will cover in some detail in his remarks.  \n Turning to our lodging business. We expect our core workforce business to be down about 25% versus prior year in April. Our rail, truckers, construction workers continue to need rooms even in this environment. And just as a reminder, most of our workforce lodging travelers drive to their hotels. They don't fly to their hotels. Our new Travelliance airline or crew lodging business will be way down in April, somewhere in the 75%-plus range, as airlines canceled most of their flights, fortunately, a much, much smaller part of our lodging business.  \n Brazil. Brazil toll, a bright spot for us. So despite toll transactions being down in April, we expect toll revenue to be roughly flat or even slightly up, and that's primarily because toll revenues are subscription-based. Lastly, our gift card business expected to be down about 50% in April as many of our brick-and-mortar retail clients are temporarily closed, moving much of the activity in that business to digital redemption.  \n So a few conclusions here. Our April volume and revenue impacts vary quite a bit by business. So some of our business not impacted much, some impacted in the down 25% range and some impacted down to the 50% or 50%-plus range. Fortunately, the businesses most affected, most impacted by COVID represent a smaller proportion of our overall business. \n We do expect April revenue to come in 20% to 25% behind the prior year. We do expect volumes to begin to flatten. We see it sequentially as we look through April. And because many of our cardholders are essential workers, first responders, health care workers, truckers, rail, construction, they keep right on doing what they do. Also important, most of our volume decline thus far is client softness, not client loss. So good news that it could come back on the other side. And lastly, we're a 50% EBITDA business so we can continue to make money and generate cash even at these distressed levels of volume.  \n Okay, let me transition over now to the company's priorities and how we're framing things. So we've basically looked at a reset here of priorities based on the changing environment. So Phase 1, the response phase, which I outlined earlier. We've taken, again, 4 actions already: safety, business continuity, liquidity and credit initially here to respond to the situation. And again, I think we've had decent success and report we're well underway here.  \n Phase 2, the shutdown phase, the place we're at now, where volumes are down and all of us are learning new behaviors. The priorities in this phase are expenses. So we're working to get our expenses down and better aligned to current volumes. We're cutting where we can, where it makes sense, but protecting, particularly the selling system and technology capabilities that we'll need when we come out the other side. \n Selling, we're changing -- modifying how we sell, targeting different prospects, surge industries, moving almost exclusively to digital contact, repositioning our message. So lots of work to progress selling.  \n Projects. We're reevaluating our project work, pushing projects that we can control and it makes sense while delaying other projects that rely on others to a different day.\n And then lastly, we look forward to a future to a phase where businesses begin to reopen and things begin to recover. So message here is we'll be ready. In that phase, the recovery phase, we'll plan to chase acquisitions that maybe, just maybe weren't there before. We also may get some benefit from COVID's new behaviors that we can take advantage of on the other side. So for example, the emphasis on touchless transactions, think electronic tolls versus cash, think distressed passenger mobile applications versus visiting gate agents, think payroll cards versus paper payroll checks. And then even remote working, think about our AP automation and outsourcing service to pay bills when you're outside of the office. So the hope is that we may be better positioned in some of our businesses when we get to the recovery side.  \n So look, in closing, we've never been in a place like this before. We're continuing to operate the business and to serve our essential clients, many of which continue to work through the crisis. We're in process of replanning things, our priorities, our expense levels, our project plans, our sales and go-to-market approaches, in an effort to make the best of the situation. And like you, we're hopeful that the gradual reopening will bring our clients back, and that our business will return to at least some sense of normal as we progress through the year. But I can tell you, we will be ready. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric to provide some additional details on the quarter. Eric? Tien-Tsin, it's Ron. I'd say we're probably a target of about 5%. And it would be on volume-related things, things that flex versus selling system or tech things. We'll probably also clip the capital plan a bit. But in our business, you can't save your way to profitability, our profits turn on revenues, and so we're going to be quite careful to not over-dial that. I'm telling you, Tien-Tsin, I say never. We think -- I think this is a game-changer. You've heard our complaints ongoing the last few years about people in the space driving up prices and seller expectations and free money and stuff. I think lots of companies are hurt. Companies that have assets we're interested in are hurt. I think there'll be some impact obviously to valuations. I think people that compete with us for deals will have more thoughts on the credit side. So I'd say to you, probably it's high, that's a really long time, and we're spending lots of time, what I'll call kind of new deal thinking. There's 5 or 6 assets that we've coveted for some period of time that I personally think may have some chance of opening. So I would say high. Yes. Ryan, it's Ron. So that's right. We built sales plans to try to grow sales production, call it, circa 15%. We kind of grow sales expense, a little slower, call it, 10%, 12%. So yes, we built the plan to do that. Some of it takes care of itself, right? If people don't reach the production goals, you get some of that money back in the form of lower commissions. I'd also say we pulled back on some kinds of marketing and lead gen, obviously, all the physical trade shows and stuff like that. But with that said, I think we're being super cautious on the headcount side. It takes a long time to build a really good field group and a really good telesales group. And so I think we're quite reluctant to reduce that and honestly, not to even kind of refill or replace as we move through the year. So we're clearly trying to play the long game on selling. Yes. So first of all, I'd call it -- it's a really good result in this second half of March to still pencil that thing out of 10%. We're quite happy with it. But the reason it's not close to the mid-teens would be a couple of things. First, the transactions did soften and we did get paid a bit on spend, particularly on the B2B side there. So the COVID clipped a couple of points at the end. And then the other thing is the guy that leads that, they pushed to offer some free tags to build our tag volume at the end of the year to compete with the banks. And so we have -- we'll be rolling off kind of in the next month or 2. We probably have another couple of percent of what I'll call free tags sitting in our Q1 results. So those would be kind of the 2 nicks on the number. Can you say -- you broke up a bit, Ryan? Urban tags. Yes. I don't have that handy. I mean it's down. I think we targeted some kind of number, call it, 40,000 to 50,000 a quarter. I'll have to get back to you, I don't have any handy. Yes. I mean I think the confidence comes from the sequential analysis, right? So we have a bit more texture than we set out. We've got daily reports. And I think from what we put in the supplement, it appears to us that virtually all of our businesses are planing, bottoming, if you will, at this point. And we've got another week, I think, of learning. We just had a big review yesterday. So I think -- what you guys haven't seen. So I'd say, if anything, we're starting actually to see a few of the business tick up a tiny bit. So the comment is our best guess is we're bottoming. And that we, Eric and I, think probably that May and June, it will be a smidge better than what we said in April. I quoted April around 20%-ish off of the prior year. So if, in fact, the tickup is happening, then clearly, Q3, if the world reopens, will be better. So our best guess is Q2 will be the worst. Yes. I mean I think we tried, Sanjay, with that chart to get into the haves and the have-nots. So I think like every business that you guys follow, some are affected none, some and a lot. And I think that's the same thing inside the FLEETCOR portfolio. And so we have businesses on that page that we think are the weakest and probably would have the longest trough. So for example, and again that page in front is what we called out our... So the couple -- look, the couple, Sanjay, that would be, I think, the softest, the longest would be the recent lodging airline acquisition we did that fundamentally relies on the planes flying and crew flying. So that thing's off, I don't know, 75% and it would be off for a while. And then the gift card business, to the extent that brick-and-mortar retail stays closed or some of those go BK, some of those go out of business, I'd say those couple of businesses, I think, will be weakest. But the other ones, I think if we've got one message today, again is, the impact is softness. So it's a fuel card client with 10 drivers driving 2/3 of what they used to drive versus he's fired 3 or 4 of those captains. So the ability for the thing to kind of come back, if the clients kind of come back, we come back. And so I'd say the rest of the businesses, obviously, we've got a few that are in the green, that are kind of happy days. And then we've got the rest that are kind of sitting there waiting for the clients to get healthy again. So I think other than a couple that I call out, that I'd say have a longer curve to kind of come back, the couple I called out, I think the rest should be on their way back because of the essential service nature of our workforce. Yes, Trevor. You're totally right on current year. I think we've called out before that in the corporate pay business, particularly in the core virtual card business, most of the revenue from new accounts is sold the prior year, call it, somewhere 80% to 90%. So the revenue in 2020 is driven off of sales contracted but not implemented from '19.\n So on your second question, I'd say we're still finding our way, right? So this thing surprised all of us in March. We have a marketing and sales plan and closing plan, and it got changed, right? You can't have trade shows and we're not visiting large accounts like we used to. So I'd say there's been a repositioning of how to sell, what marketing to do, how to contact people. And I'd say, if anything, the receptivity seems high, like people have taken the call, taken the appointments. What I think is still unclear is can we close, right? We'll call it 30 days into this and some of these people have more time on their hands or they're just being kinder in these times, but the contact rates are kind of okay. So I'd say probably in 60 days, we'll have a fix on whether sales can kind of be where we thought, just done in a different way, or whether sales are going to be softer. I'd say we just don't know yet. Trevor, it's Ron. Let me take the first part and then I'll let Eric comment on the second part. I would say it's the most surprising thing to us so far, and surprising in a good way. So when this thing hit, you can imagine, we did student body, right, to work on credit and liquidity collections. And so we've got a monitoring system that looks at trip worthy, how rates people going delinquent, and then roll rates aging. And so I'd say that it's up, so we have benchmarked in all of our businesses. I'd say it's up but it's not up in any kind of meaningful way. So too early to call that, \"Hey, we've gotten through this between the stimulus money and stock. Hey, we're going to kind of be okay.\" But if you said to me now, how did it look, say, this Phoenix thing, it looks pretty good. \n And the last point on it is, we actually get a benefit from the lower volumes and the lower fuel prices. The fact that spend, and effectively AR -- new AR balances are dropping, obviously, it makes the collection assignment smaller and the credit risk smaller. So I'd say on this, this one, say, on the Phoenix thing, so far, so good. And let me just add, Trevor, one thing. We don't compete on terms like we compete with banks and other people. So we had policies for a long time in this company to compete on products and on the tech and on the convenience of the product. And so we have tons of daily, daily, tons of short terms weekly. In Europe, we have half of our book, I think, is insured. So we carve through, we have tons internationally on direct debit collect where we basically pull the money. And so in those cases, you've got trip rates in the 2% range, very, very small kinds of delinquency. So when we studied our old book again intently a month ago when this started, I think we feel pretty good structurally of how we've got the thing set up. No. It's a good question. I mean in the context of COVID and sheltering and the trends that we might expect over the next year or 2, this payables or corporate payments business, it's a great place. And the reason is that lots of AP, lots of the spend is fixed, think leases or IT contracts and stuff. And so bills have to get paid or services get turned off. And so I'd say, if anything, we'd like this corporate pay business for 5 years, and we've built a bunch of stuff and added to it and invested it. I'd say if anything, we like it even more. I think it's probably a little bit more defensive going forward versus the kind of the mobility stuff. Maybe mobility stays depressed a bit, whereas kind of AP stays where it is. So I'd say, if anything, it probably elevates that segment even a notch higher for us. Eric, do you know? Steven, I'll get back to you with what it was in the first quarter. Yes, Pete, it's Ron. So mostly in our gift business, we don't take much credit risk because we don't really move money, right? We're really an accounting system, if you will, for retailers and a program manager. So the one place where there's credit risk in that is in card shipments. So if you're at Macy's or Dick's Sporting Goods and we -- you give us a card order, and we go to the card maker and take the stock and make it for you, put the Macy's logo on it and then send it to you, that would be the one place, right? If we ship it to you, whatever, March 15 and then -- so you have to pay us on March 31 and you don't. And so the good news on that is that our guy that runs that business, right, have chased all that stuff pretty hard when this thing hit. So right now, we have very, very little exposure, fortunately. And I put him on notice that we're not doing many of those kind of things again. We're going to do a lot of card shipments to challenged retailers, at least not short term. So I'd say we're probably in a pretty good place there. No. That's a really good question, Ramsey. I'd say, yes, I think like all of us on this call, we're processing what the future could be, what will the world look like in 3 months, 6 months. But for sure, I think there'll be changes. So on the portfolio side, I'd say we're super happy with the kind of the 4 categories that we've got, the 3 employee card things, fuel, lodging and toll, and then obviously, we like the payable things. So there's nothing in the 4 businesses where we go, \"Oh, oh, I feel like I'm going to like those less.\" As I said in some of my comments, I think some of those categories will actually be helped by this thing. My sense is that a lot of our changes are going to be on the functional side. And what I mean by that is our constructs and our policies around, like, credit. Our approaches around selling. Our approaches around part time, full time. I think we're going through all kinds of thinking now of, if this world stays this way or there's some things we've learned in this world that we might stick with even if the world goes back to the way it was, I think there's going to be a lot of -- I'd say, it's still early. If you ask me that question again in 90 days, I think we'll have a better answer. But for sure, there will be a bunch of stuff we do different, for sure. Yes. Eric will love to bring that, but I'll tell that obviously, the 2% drop was kind of all right in the last 2 weeks. So that means that dropped like a rock, obviously, given the April data that we've shown you. So I want to just prepare people that softness is what's taking our volume down. So you're going to hear a much different number in Q2. But you want to... David, it's a good question. I'd say we don't know. I think it's going to be a function a bit of the help of clients, honestly, and what the casualty rate is and the BK rate among our client base. And so a lot of the retention aggregate number is a function of mix. We have businesses that have very different kinds of retention rates based on size, enterprise versus small and then even type of business like payables growth, the spend growth of clients. So I don't know the answer. I guess it will probably be lower because we'll likely have more casualties in our client base where the businesses go out of business, which is already represent, and then credit. So again, if you simplistically said, \"Hey, we lose 9% or 10% of our revenue per year.\" 1/3 or 1/2 of that is the business getting back, the business getting weak, the business closing, the business not having the creditworthiness to be a client. \n So yes, my guess is that's probably going to go up some in the quarter. Now again, once you get to that base, we get through this thing, that there's nothing structural that concerns me that would take us lower. Yes. David, another good question. I'll let Eric comment, too. But I'd say we're in a preserve mode. We are -- I told the Board. We agreed with the Board. We are in a precaution. We want the maximum liquidity. We want a company that got all kinds of cushion until we see the other side of this and see the heartbeat on the other side. So we will not be buying back shares over the next quarter or 2. On the other side, I think, on the deal side, like I said, if there's something unique that comes out of this, we might pull the trigger a little bit sooner than later. But I'd say we're probably in a bit of a hold pattern for a while."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings, welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. \n I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. \nJames Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Charles Freund, our CFO. Following their prepared comments, the operator will announce the queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then that you can get in line for questions. \n Please note that our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com. \n Now throughout this call, we will be discussing organic growth. As a reminder, organic revenue growth neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads, and includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed during the 2 years being compared. We will also be discussing non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than at other companies. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website. \n I do need to remind everybody that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our outlook, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We undertake no obligation to update any of these statements. These expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. \n Now with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? \nRonald F. Clarke: Okay. Jim, thanks. \n Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q4 earnings call. So upfront here, I plan to cover 3 subjects. So first, provide my view of Q4, along with full year '21 results; second, lay out our 2022 guidance and priorities for the year; and then lastly, I'll share my thoughts on the company's midterm imperatives. \n Okay. Let me make the turn to our Q4 results, which were quite good. So we reported revenue of $802 million, up 30% and cash EPS of $3.72 , that's up 24%, both record-highs for the company. Revenue came in quite hot, almost $40 million higher than the revenue guidance we provided 90 days ago. Organic revenue growth for Q4, good. Up 17%, also up 7% against Q4 of '19. Every line of business, double-digit organic revenue growth in the quarter. Our Q4 trends continued quite good. Record sales in the quarter, up 40% versus prior year. Steady revenue retention at 93%. Same-store sales, healthy at plus 6%. \n We have had some notable callout since we spoke last. We formalized our partnership with the largest bank in Brazil which will help distribute our toll products, so we expect a lift there. We launched formally our Corpay One SMB platform business, so getting our corporate payments business into the SMB space. We just completed another investment in an EV software company. We upsized our term loan of $750 million. We repurchased over 3 million FLT shares in Q4 and in January. And we completed the rebranding of our corporate payments business. All the brands now under Corpay. So in summary, really a good finish to the year better than we expected and the trends helpful as we look into 2022. \n Okay. Let me turn to 2021 full year. I think we characterize 2021 really as a comeback year, where we moved ahead of our 2019 pre-pandemic baseline. Really good financial results. '21 revenue of $2.8 billion, up 19%. Cash EPS of $13.21, also up 19%. Both of those results, record-highs for the company. We did open 2021 with an initial guide of $12.31 of cash EPS at the midpoint, so now finishing $0.90 better than that in initial guide. So clearly a better year than expected. \n Organic revenue growth for 2021, up 12%. That's the highest organic revenue growth that we've ever reported. 2021 sales, super good. Record levels, up 46% versus 2020 and up 19% versus 2019. We've added 175,000 new clients. 175,000 new clients to our books in '21 across the world. So strong demand for our services. We did close 2 accretive acquisitions in '21 and expect together those to deliver $0.50 to $0.60 of incremental cash EPS here in '22. So all in all, a meaningful recovery from 2020. \n All right. Let me cover now our initial thoughts on 2022 guidance along with the priorities for the year. We've mentioned before our stated midterm objectives for the company are to grow sales 20% plus, to grow organic revenue 10% plus, and to grow cash EPS 15% to 20%. Good news, our '22 guidance meets all 3 of these objectives, so here it goes. \n For revenue in 2022, at the midpoint, $3.22 billion, that's up 14%; cash EPS of $15.25 at the midpoint, up 15%; organic revenue growth overall, up 10%; and sales growth just over 20%. This guidance does not include any forward capital allocation beyond deleveraging. \n There is no real macro help in these numbers. We're basically outlooking the macro to be neutral. Yes, higher fuel prices, but really offset by some weaker FX. We have assumed about a 1% COVID recovery in our same-store sales client base coming back this year in '22. \n Confidence, pretty high in these numbers. About half of the expected year-over-year performance improvement is already in our exit rate or run rate coming into the year so that helps. Our recent sales and retention trends support the forecast. Most of the synergies for the 2 big acquisitions are really already baked so we expect to get that accretion. And we have repurchased about 6.5 million shares from a year ago, so obviously going to be quite accretive. \n In terms of priorities, we have picked a few things that we'll invest in incrementally this year. So digital sales. We're expecting a big increase in digital sales production in '22 and are making, thus, incremental investments in digital advertising and staff. IT. Big investments in IT transformation to accelerate our move to the cloud. And this platform business that I spoke of, where we're joining up our walk-around services with our central AP services. Going to push those platforms pretty hard and get a read on demand. So all in all, a pretty ambitious year. \n Okay. So last up today, I'd like to talk about our midterm prospects and the imperatives for the company. I thought it might be helpful to rewind just a bit for anyone new on the call, just remind everyone who FLEETCOR is and what we're trying to do. \n So in a nutshell, FLEETCOR provides B2B specialty payment solutions, really all intended to do one thing, which is to help businesses, our clients, spend less, primarily by controlling what they buy and what they pay for. Our differentiation kind of really comes in 2 forms. \n First, our products are highly specialized. We target certain kinds of clients with very specialized needs. So our products would look different for trucking firms than they would look for plumbing firms. Our travel services would look different for blue collar travelers than they would for white collar travelers. So very dialed-in kind of product line. \n And second, we operate more than 15 proprietary acceptance networks. That allows us to capture very unique data at the point of sale. We also enjoy very favorable economics, which we share with our clients. So this focused or specialized approach, coupled with a two-sided business model has allowed us to deliver consistent growth over a long period of time. \n So let me turn to the 3 imperatives, the big things that we're on that we think are critical to driving sustained growth over the long term. So first up is EV. We're working EV and the energy transition hard. We do feel like we've made a lot of progress so far. \n So both here and in Europe, we've added public acceptance networks for EV, so public charge points or recharge points. We've invested in EV software companies that facilitate at-home recharging and reimbursement. We signed up a few hundred clients to our EV service to get feedback on the service. And initially here, we're seeing the revenue or the economics from our service, EV service, roughly in line with our more traditional refueling services. So look, we're on this EV. We'll manage along with the transition and continue to report out. \n Second imperative is digital, where company's working super hard to make the digital transition, accelerated by COVID. So the first thing I'd say is sales has really made a pivot. So last year, over 50% of our global fuel card sales came in digitally and over half of those processing end-to-end with no human intervention. On the marketing front, we've moved our focus to top of the funnel. So we're using digital advertising, ABM technology to identify prospects interested in our services. \n On the client experience front, we've really advanced our UIs and their capability to allow our clients to do more themselves. So faster and easier than ever before. And at the point of sale, we've added new ways to transact with us beyond cards. So including mobile phones, RFID technology, even connected cars. So a lot of progress on the digital front. \n So last up is diversification, transitioning our portfolio to bigger TAMs, into higher-growth segments. So you've heard us speak of beyond -- going beyond, in which we extend each of our existing businesses into adjacent market segments to create more opportunity. \n So just a few examples there. So our corporate payments business, traditionally a middle markets business, now entering the SMB space. Our traveler lodging business, really a workforce, a blue collar-focused business has recently added airline or lodging for crews, and displaced homeowners or homeowners' insurance companies really to extend the potential of that business. In Brazil, historically, a toll-centric, highway-centric client base, we're now adding hundreds of thousands of urban or city dwellers to our expanded offering. So look, over time, we do expect these adjacencies to increase the opportunity for each of our businesses. \n Platform business. I mentioned we will join up our specialized payment solutions into one comprehensive platform in which a single business or client could use, for example, our smart business cards, our travel solutions and our online billpay services all from the same UI and all from us. So this platform concept really combines our capabilities for employee walk-around kinds of purchases along with central billpay. So we think the platform idea has big potential and can be quite additive to the specialized payment services that we offer now. \n As a result of these extensions, we are expecting our global fleet card business to account for about 40% of the company's revenue this year. That's down from about 50% 5 years ago. So again, repositioning for faster growth. So we do plan to work these 3 midterm imperatives hard: EV, digital and diversification. Of course, we'll report progress as we go. \n So in conclusion today, back to Q4. Again, better than we expected and good trends coming into this year. 2021, really, again, a comeback year, finishing much, much better than we thought at the outset. This year, 2022, another guide to growth. Organic growth of expected at 10%, earnings expected to be up 15%, so a lot of distance from our pre-pandemic baseline. And the midterm, again, we're pretty focused on these 3 imperatives that I just outlined, key to sustainable growth for the company. \n So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter. Chuck? \nCharles Freund: Thanks, Ron. \n So jumping into the product category details behind our 17% organic revenue growth in Q4, corporate payments was up 18%, with another quarter of strong performance in full AP, which was up over 50% yet again. Our card products, virtual and multicard, were up 16%, and cross-border was up 14%, which is normalized for the AFEX acquisition we closed in June. In cross-border, we completed the final customer migrations from AFEX' systems to our Corpay cross-border platform in December. And we'll continue with the integration of back-office systems and processes throughout this year. Our thesis are holding, with synergies and accretion in line with our expectations. \n I'd like to give a big shout out to our integration team as it's due to their hard work and dedication that the conversion has been so seamless and successful. \n Fuel was up organically 12%, with growth in every geography largely as a result of our digital sales efforts and strong retention rates. Our ability to sell and retain fuel card customers around the world demonstrates the attractiveness of our offers, the competitiveness of our products and the effectiveness of our technology. \n We continue to make good progress in developing and marketing our EV charge management solutions, particularly in Europe, where we now have over 5,000 clients with EV-enabled cards or fobs. We've also been actively expanding the on-road network acceptance of our EV solutions, with approximately 6,500 charge points in the U.K. now accepting our products. This represents about 22% coverage of all publicly available charge points in the country. \n On the continent, we've got around 85% coverage as our products are accepted at roughly 190,000 charge points. We've built a dedicated organization to advance our EV efforts and will continue to support our fuel card customers as they slowly migrate to EVs. \n Tolls was up 17% compared with last year as strong new, sales up 20%, and some new retention initiatives are really paying off. We made tremendous progress to expand our toll business this year. We doubled our fuel locations year-over-year to nearly 1,200, and we had nearly 0.5 million active fuel users as of year-end. \n We recently signed Mitsubishi, Hyundai, Toyota and Kia to install our tags on vehicles before they leave the factories. And as Ron mentioned earlier, we completed our joint venture with Caixa, Brazil's largest bank.\n Our lodging business continued to perform well, up 39%. Workforce lodging has improved with higher volume, and airlines especially outperformed, with organic growth over 100% as domestic air travel rebounded from COVID lows. The integration of ALE Solutions, a provider of lodging services to displaced policyholders of major insurance companies, is going quite smoothly, and we're increasingly confident in the value it will deliver. \n Gift organic growth was 19% year-over-year as the new efforts we've discussed on the last several calls continue to produce results, especially the retailer online sales channel. We also saw a pick-up in card replenishment orders, which had been delayed due to COVID concerns. \n Now looking further down the income statement, operating expenses of $462 million represented an increase over prior year, primarily due to the addition of the AFEX and ALE operations as well as higher deal and integration-related costs, increases tied to higher volumes across our businesses, stock compensation, and new sales generation activities and investments to drive future growth. \n Bad debt expense was $18.5 million or 5 basis points as credit losses have returned to more historical levels. Interest expense decreased 9% year-over-year due to a slight decline in LIBOR rates and the offset of higher interest rates applied to customer deposits and cash balances in certain foreign jurisdictions. We incurred $9.9 million of cost during the quarter associated with the incremental $750 million in Term B debt we added in December. \n On the Term B increase, the rate was the same as our existing facility at LIBOR plus 175 basis points and matures in April 2028. Our ratings and leverage remained effectively unchanged, reflecting the strength and earnings power of our company. \n Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.6% versus 20.3% last year, with the increase driven primarily by the lack of excess tax benefit on stock option exercises. \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with over $1.5 billion in unrestricted cash, and we had $1.1 billion available on our revolver. There was $4.9 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, which included the incremental $750 million Term B debt I just mentioned. Finally, we had $1.1 billion borrowed in our securitization facility. All in, as of December 31, our leverage ratio was 2.71x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. \n As Ron mentioned, in the quarter, we repurchased roughly 2.3 million shares. And in total, we repurchased about 5.5 million shares during 2021. We also bought 1.1 million shares in January under our 10b5-1 plan. You may have seen in our press release that our Board authorized another $1 billion in repurchases. So taking all of that into account, we still have almost $1.4 billion authorized for repurchases as of today. \n We believe we have ample liquidity to pursue any near-term M&A opportunities and continue to buy back shares when it makes sense. I think it's important to remind everyone of the power that our earnings and cash flow gives us. Recapping 2021, we repurchased 5.5 million shares for $1.36 billion. Our guidance for share count for 2022 is down 7 million shares from what we guided a year ago. We spent $950 million on deals, which will generate incremental earnings of $0.50 to $0.60 per share next year and continue to provide growth in future years. \n We also raised an additional $1.55 billion of Term B debt, $800 million in Q2 and $750 million in Q4, at very attractive rates and terms. And our leverage barely changed. \n We believe the combination of our strong position, the structure of our business model and high recurring revenues will enable us to deliver consistent quality growth year after year after year. \n Now let me share some thoughts on our Q1 outlook and our full-year assumptions. Looking ahead, we're expecting Q1 2022 revenue to be between $740 million and $760 million, and adjusted net income per share to be between $3.45 and $3.55, which at the midpoint is approximately $0.68 and or 24% higher than what we reported in Q1 of 2021. \n You may notice the midpoint of our Q1 guide is also approximately $0.22 or 6% lower than what we reported in Q4 of 2021. This is largely due to revenue seasonality, where certain businesses, such as gift and tolls, have strong fourth quarters while fuel and lodging tend to have soft first quarters due to weather and holidays. As such, the first quarter tends to be the lowest in terms of both revenue and profit for our company. \n I'd like to note a few assumptions underlying the full year 2022 guidance Ron provided earlier. We expect bad debt to be about $30 million higher than 2021 levels as we see a return to more normalized credit losses, due in part to increasing sales production. Our interest expense guidance of $90 million to $100 million assumes 3 25 basis point rate increases throughout the year. And our tax rate is also expected to be higher, at between 24% and 26%, as we expect any excess tax benefit from stock option exercises to remain low relative to the last few years. \n The effects of these higher expenses will be partially offset by the lower share count resulting from our repurchase activity over the past 13 months. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement. \n Now let's move beyond the results and the outlook. Since we last spoke, our new ESG report was published and is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Some highlights you will find in the document are: more details around our workforce advantage, including our comprehensive employee development and training programs; and our adoption of the Rooney Rule for all vice-president-and-above positions; as well as some reporting on our global data centers, including the significant reduction in power usage and footprint which are down 40% and 62%, respectively, over the last 5 years. \n Finally, I would like to thank our nearly 10,000 employees around the world who helped us deliver a strong finish to a great year and who will be the driving force to even greater heights in 2022. Thank you for your interest in FLEETCOR. \n And now, operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen with Citi. \nPeter Christiansen: [Technical Difficulty] \n which is good to see. Ron, looking at the outlook, which... \nRonald F. Clarke: Pete, we're struggling to hear you. \nPeter Christiansen: I'm sorry, can you hear me? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. We -- I can, now. \nPeter Christiansen: [indiscernible] \nRonald F. Clarke: If you could dial back in. We can take the next question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: Congratulations on solid results in the fourth quarter here. I wanted to ask about CapEx as a percentage of revenue. It looks like it moved up to 4% from 3% where it's been for quite some time. Now I know Ron called out a lot of critical business investment. \n But I'm just wondering, should we view the investment you're making as more kind of cyclical in nature? And meaning, you'll kind of finish with this investment cycle and maybe CapEx as a percentage of revenue will tick back down again? Or is this sort of what we should expect in terms of a new level of business investment going forward? \nRonald F. Clarke: Ramsey, it's Ron. I'd say probably the latter. Probably think about this level, this 4%-ish level. And the 2 drivers, kind of new things in the last couple of years, would be that Brazil network buildout that we've referenced before. So a fair amount of cost in getting those incremental few thousand stations up. And then two, we've earmarked a fair amount of kind of incremental money through the IT transformation. So not just enhancing, obviously, the systems we have, but effectively building new ones in parallel. So I'd say those couple of things would have at least probably a couple more years to run and then it may bottom back down a bit. \nRamsey El-Assal: And on capital deployment or balance sheet deployment, more generally, maybe Ron, if you could give us your view on the appetite for sort of, A, first, buybacks versus M&A? And then on the M&A side, I'm really curious to see whether you're seeing more opportunities emerge or the deal pipeline increasing just because the valuation environment seems to have shifted down quite a bit. It might be a little too soon, but I'm just curious what you're seeing out there. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Good question. So I'd say that our priorities are unchanged, Ramsey,right? We're first M&A, if we like it, for capabilities and/or it's accretive. But as you can tell from Chuck's comments earlier, we -- what did we say, 6.5 million shares we bought back in the last 12 months. So we've had a bit of an appetite for our own stock, which we think is appropriate. \n In terms of the M&A, we did press the pause button, call it, 3 months ago when we saw the volatility, both in our own stock and in some of the others in our category. And so literally post this, we're going to kind of reach back out to some of those things that are super late in the pipeline and test where sellers are basically. We've got a view of where we are now. So I'd say ask me again in 30 days whether sellers have got the message that things are volatile and maybe at a lower price that they'll take. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. \nDarrin Peller: When we look forward on the fuel segment, on a stack basis, you're running in the low single-digit range now, but I think embedded in your outlook is definitely an acceleration. Can you talk through that a bit in terms of the OTR side versus the fleet -- the local fleets, and really how you're going to bridging from the run rate now to a higher level of growth? And then I just have a quick follow-up on the corporate payments side. \nRonald F. Clarke: Darrin, hey, it's Ron. Yes. I'd say the guide embedded in the guide for '22 would be high single digits for fuel cards, so off of obviously more normalized comps this year. And Part B, yes, the OTR, which is, I don't know, call it, 30% of our business globally across Europe and Brazil continues to run softer, right? The COVID impact, getting drivers to soften that business more. So I think inside of our high single digit, that thing would be a smidge softer than the local or partner business. \nDarrin Peller: Okay. And you've had decent sales [ flow ] that's probably flowing through, too, right now? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. This -- you kind of cut out a bit. But if you said we had decent sales, I mean we've had literally record sales in the fuel card business. \nDarrin Peller: Right. Yes, I figure that's flowing through starting now. \n Just a quick follow-up on the corporate payments side. I mean, really, I'm trying to figure out when the cross-sell, you think, is going to really kick into full gear for Corpay, right. When we think about the opportunity in really the software in Nvoicepay side versus the virtual car alone, but really the holistic offering, where do you think we're going to be? When do you think we're going to be in a full-scale effort around that initiative? Which sounds like -- I know there's been a lot of good industry chatter on it, but that could probably flow through to some meaningful trends. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, another good question. I'd say probably another quarter or so, and let me tell you why. So we started out, call it, in the second half testing, going out to, call it, 1,000 clients, 2,000 clients, putting them on a new payment platform, seeing if they had an interest in our new platform, billpay solution, saw some decent reaction to it. And so what we've decided to do is kind of be careful in changing the payment platform and basically presenting a new service at the same time. \n We want to be super cautious around not upsetting, if you will, the golden goose of these fuel card clients. So we're moving to put that platform in against a broader set of clients, get them comfortable using that and then effectively present harder this add-on for them. So my guess is probably somewhere in Q2, we'll be able to report out on it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Just a question on the expense growth. Obviously, very strong coming out of the pandemic, sort of deflationary there. Could you just talk about how much is driven by inflationary pressure versus more investments you're making? And kind of what you're assuming that's going to translate to in terms of top line growth? \nCharles Freund: Yes, Sanjay, this is Charles. So the expense growth you're seeing comes from a couple of different areas. One, we've got the AFEX and ALE acquisitions that are rolling in, so that's number one. Two, we've got the normalization of credit losses. We expect that to be quite a bit higher, some [ start comp ] in there. Also related to the deals, we've got ongoing integration costs. The AFEX integration is probably the most advanced we'll have taken as a company, so to really move them off their systems, close redundant offices, et cetera. It's a multiyear journey there and we're spending money to basically create synergies for the future. So that's also kind of baked in, both in the fourth quarter here as well as into our guide for next year. \n We are seeing some inflationary pressure predominantly around staffing. So wages in some of the call centers and such, we've taken measures to remedy that. As it relates to vendors, a little bit. But I'd say that, that will help us eventually as it flows through to vendor payments in, say, our corporate payments arena. So it's a tale of two cities, right? We're going to have some additional costs from inflation, but we'll also get some benefit from it on the revenue side. \nRonald F. Clarke: Sanjay, it's Ron. Let just jump on the last thing Chuck said, which would be some of the increment is really directed by us, choice that we made around EV capabilities and sales. And again, some testing and advertising things and even in IT to really better position the business. We like the profit number we got to. So in addition to the factors that Chuck just laid out, I do want you to hear that we've chosen to chase some things that help the company on a forward basis. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Understood. And I actually have a follow-up question on the EV point. I'm just curious, Ron, like how you think the distribution channels are going to look like in the future, some payment processors that partnered with like the auto manufacturers? And I'm just curious how unconventional the partnerships that you're trying to forge are going forward. I know you have some of them, but maybe you can just speak to what you're targeting. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I think it's actually been the other way so far. I think that we announced again a follow-on in kind of a new investment in software companies. I think companies that are working on software see people like us, leasing companies, as the best distribution pipe in the fleet, particularly as they're mixing stuff. And so we continue to like our chances, both offering that back to our client base because we're first to see if they're moving off of a fuel -- of internal combustion approach to something else so we could spot it in our client base. And then B, we've got obviously lots of coverage generally, right, to bring new clients into the fold. And so I'd say, for sure, our distribution capabilities are probably as good as any. \n With that said, we did mention the Brazil thing, which is a bit of a case study where we've now basically put tags -- effectively, toll tags in with 3 or 4 partners literally as those cars come off the line. So when you buy your new Kia or whatever the heck it is, Nissan, in Brazil, it's got a Sem Parar tag when you come out. \n So look, we think over time, these cars will be coming off the line connected, where they're sending data every couple of seconds. And so we mostly want to be set up just to grab that, relationships where we have access to that connected car information and can then help, again, the client, whether he's at a public location or road location or at home basically pay for the thing. So I would say -- I said earlier in the office, we are just so much smarter on this transition now and how to play and how we're advantaged or not and what help we need. So I don't know if we're communicating it well, but we are just in a way better spot than we were. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Williams with Jefferies. \nTrevor Williams: I wanted to ask another one on expenses, kind of similar to what Sanjay was getting after. But so margins in Q4 were down about 300 basis points from the third quarter despite all the revenue upside. I mean is this kind of a new stepped-up level of spend that's just kind of rebased higher that we should just expect to run through 2022? \n Just kind of as we're thinking about how much leverage you can get from -- you're guiding to 14% revenue growth next year, if you do better than that, if we get kind of another light back just on some of the piece of the revenue pie that are still kind of lagging versus '19. So just give us a sense for kind of what your -- for how we should be thinking about operating leverage going forward, given that you've already -- it seems like in the last couple of quarters, there's been a stepped-up level of investment to kind of prepare for the new go-to-market strategy. \nCharles Freund: Yes. Trevor, it's Charles. I'd say that it is a bit of a reset. So some of the acquisitions that we bought do operate at slightly lower margins. So they're dealing with big airlines or insurance companies, right? These are very, very focused on the rates they pay, and then also require a very, very high levels of service. And so we need to make investments. And as the airline volumes of revenue is pouring back, we need to staff up to accommodate those service level requirements. \n So I think the 54% is probably a good assumption going for next year. And as Ron mentioned, we are continuing to make investments for future growth. And so I'd say, operating margin should hold at that level for the remainder of this year. \nTrevor Williams: Okay. Got it. And then, Charles, just a follow up on interest expense. It sounds like you guys have 3 hikes built into what you're guiding to for '22. Can you give us a sense just -- and even if it's not an exact number, that's fine. But if we end up at 5 or 6 hikes what the interest expense sensitivity could look like in that scenario? \nCharles Freund: We've got about $5.9 billion that would flow with LIBOR. So for every 25 basis points, you're looking at kind of $14 million to $15 million of incremental annualized expense, so you got to layer that in over time. On the flip side, we do have customer deposits and cash balances that sit around the world, and we're earning pretty good interest on those. And so if interest rates continue to rise around the world, we might actually see enough benefit. \nJames Eglseder: Alex? \n [Technical Difficulty] \n Okay. Thanks, Trevor. I apologize for any technical difficulties. It looks like we're going to take Tien-Tsin next. Except I can't promote him. Alex, can we take Tien-Tsin? All right, guys, let's see if we can do the next one. \n Alex, can you hear us? Okay, he can hear us, but I don't know where the operator was. Guys, give us just a minute, okay, to get this sorted. \n Okay. Well, while we wait for -- that's getting squared away, Pete's questions from earlier were, how should we think about expectations on the Corpay One SMB initiative factoring into the guide? Trying to understand if there's upside opportunity versus normalized corporate payments growth expectations. \n I don't know if... \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Can people hear us? \nJames Eglseder: Yes, they can hear us. \nRonald F. Clarke: Pete, I don't think you can hear, but it's Ron. So I kind of answered a bit of this earlier that we're going a bit slower to be cautious on the cross-sell, and we are obviously selling to new prospects in the market. So I'd say it would be pretty minimal. So if you look at our overall corporate payments guide for the year, the SMB piece would still be relatively small, again, mostly because we're trying to be careful and make sure we have the acquisition economics, right? \n So in terms of upside, I think, yes, since we don't have scalable views of that yet, I'd say as we get into the second half and get through some of the testing that's going to go on, there could be some upside. We could step on the gas there a bit if we like what we're seeing, and maybe lift the growth rate in the second half. \nJames Eglseder: Okay. And then another question is, can you flesh out the Brazilian banking relationship a bit, how you see this impacting the value prop, and how could this impact future revenue growth going forward? \nCharles Freund: Yes. So we completed the joint venture with Caixa Bank. It's the largest bank in Brazil, tends to focus a bit more downmarket. So if you look at our historic Sem Parar business, we've tend to focus a bit more on -- I won't say, affluent, but kind of more middle class users and such. And with Caixa, we'll be able to, one, move a bit downmarket and leverage all of the distribution capabilities, so all the branches, their ATMs, et cetera. And so we view it as extensive distribution, but also reaching slightly different segments around the country that we just weren't as focused on historically. \nRonald F. Clarke: Let me just jump on, Jim, and talk about it. Hey, it's Ron. I would just add to it that we love how incremental different distribution channels are. So when we bought the business, I can't remember, 70% or 80% of all new sales came through the stores, kiosks -- the [ 500 ] stores and in toll booths, where people were waiting in line, and we diversified that into digital hanging things at retail, outbound sales, et cetera, and then a whole slew of partners, including the manufacturers that Chuck referenced. \n So what I'd say most is we just love the incremental nature of a bank and those accounts and those relationships and being in that channel. So we haven't put a ton into the guide yet because that thing just lifted off, I think, a couple of months -- 2, 3 months ago. But we are super excited about it because it is the single largest bank, largest set of account holders in the entire country. And so we're super hopeful again that, that will be additive. And to Chuck's point, because it targets a slightly different set of user than the traditional one. \nJames Eglseder: And I think we have Alex back. Alex? \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the technical difficulties. We will now take our next question. \n Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. \nAndrew Polkowitz: Hey, Ron, Charles, Jim. It's Andrew, actually, on for Tien-Tsin. Congrats on the quarter. \n I wanted to ask a question on retention. So obviously, still running strong compared to pre-pandemic, a little bit of a slide quarter-over-quarter. But what I wanted to ask was, as you guys started to sell more services in bundled, with the Corpay integration, could there be any lift in terms of retention as you sell potentially stickier products? \nRonald F. Clarke: Andrew, it's Ron. Yes, we actually have statistics on that. So we look at different cohorts, similar sets of clients and look at whether they have 1, 2, 3 kinds of services. And your thesis is absolutely right that as you move beyond one service, you're stickier with clients, have a deeper relationship, yes. So to the extent that we get what we call our platform or bundle to work and someone had walk-around products and then we were able to get their central billpay, we do think we'll get a lift. And particularly when the bundle could include smart business cards or fuel cards, which is the predominant walk-around. \nAndrew Polkowitz: Great. Just one more quick follow-up. I was just curious, were there any hiring pressures or wage pressures that impacted your clients, whether it be in the fuel or corporate payment side that might have been a little bit of a headwind as a result of this quarter that we could expect to normalize over time? \nRonald F. Clarke: We had a little bit, actually. Chuck referred to this earlier in our lodging business, where we have a decent-sized servicing group which is one of the lowest wage groups kind of in the company. And so I'd say that's the place that we felt some pressure and responded to that in the fall, both to retain people that we were losing and to add additional people. I think like the rest of corporations in America, we're seeing some pressures in different areas, in IT, digital, certain pockets. But we basically have built that in again to the guide. I think it's been going on for, call it, 3 to 6 months. So I think we're comfortable with what we plan. \nCharles Freund: And Andrew, just to pick up on that, I think you were talking maybe wage pressure on some of our customers. And what I'd say there is we have seen that in lodging, in particular. And so our workforce lodging business, which has recovered, which is not to the extent that we -- where it could, is that they've had actually small businesses turn down jobs. And I can't travel there and do the work because I can't hire the people. \n And so it will be interesting to see, as government subsidies and other things fall aside and see what happens to the employment market, but we think there is some upside opportunity there. Having built a whole lot into the plan a little bit, but not a whole lot. But wait and see, maybe truck drivers, too. Yes. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. \nRobert Napoli: Ron, I guess, could you give some color on your expectations for the growth of the corporate payments business in 2022 and I guess, over the medium term? And maybe the various pieces, full AP versus cross-border versus other? \nRonald F. Clarke: Sure, Bob. I'd say the guide for that business in totality is in the high teens. And again, to your point, there's different pieces. The payables portion of that, virtual cards, full AP. Chuck mentioned the full AP, I think, grew 50% last quarter, so that will grow a bit faster. The partner business that we called out will grow slower than that and probably the cross-border business would be closer to the mid-teens. So there'll be those different pieces in it. \n And you ask me this every time, \"Hey, can you grow it faster?\" Well, obviously, if we could spend more money. But we -- again, we try to balance what we spend to kind of growth target and a profit target and spend wisely so that we don't again have 50% new people or advertising that doesn't work. So we try again to be disciplined in terms of -- productive in terms of the monies that we spend. \nRobert Napoli: Then a follow-up question. Ron, as you called out at the beginning of the call, I mean, FLEETCOR has 15 proprietary acceptance networks, I think, for your fuel card business. Are that many necessary? Is there -- how do you think about those proprietary acceptance networks versus leveraging an open-loop network? What benefits are you getting out of that? Is there an opportunity to optimize? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, that's a great question. So the answer is it's not only our fuel cards business, it's kind of the underlying core of the company. So it's the same thing in lodging. We've got 15,000 hotels here in the U.S. out of, call it, 45,000 or 50,000. We have super economics again and unique data. We've got a toll network, for example, in Brazil. We have fuel networks in, I don't know, 10 countries, where it's impossible for you or someone to go try to create a proprietary network today. \n So I call it out really just to remind new people that those networks and the volume that we run through them and the data that we collect and the economics that we collect are just massively advantageous to us when we turn around to the client side, to the business account side and pitch our offer to them. So I was really just trying to let people know that it's not some plain vanilla, jumping on someone else's network that everyone else basically has access to. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. \nDavid Togut: The lodging business did nicely, exceeded our forecast for revenue in the quarter. Could you walk through what your forecast is for lodging revenue growth in 2022? And if you could discuss some of the underlying drivers, kind of the domestic business versus the international business. And then talk a little bit about Travelliance which you acquired a couple of years ago, and are you seeing a nice recovery there. \nCharles Freund: Yes, David, this is Charles. So lodging performing extremely well. We do have some continued recovery to go there, particularly in the airline space. So a lot of the performance you're seeing here is reflective of the domestic air travel. International has still been way, way down versus historic norms. [ So seeing ] that kind of swinging back a bit next year. \n Workforce has a bit of room to recover, but it's also just chugging along and doing pretty well. ALE business, which was a recent acquisition, accretive, a good buy for us. Still work to do to realize those synergies, but I'd say we're confident that the plans come together, so that looks pretty good. In terms of that specific line of business or product category, I have it in front of me. \nRonald F. Clarke: Hey, David, it's Ron. I leave it here, as Chuck has talked, and so the guide on that thing is plus 20% organically and obviously crazy high in the 40s on a print basis because we bought something, I guess, closed in September. And the drivers to get to that are the sales plan is way up. I think the sales plan is up 35% or 40%. It's our plan for '22. And then what Chuck said that there's super sensitivity in that one, particularly the airline, for example, about 1/4 of that segment historically of our revenue came from international flights, which in Q4 was still effectively 0. \n And so to the extent that the world opens and airlines go back crossing borders, again, let's say, in Q2, we have the contracts, and we're already serving the airlines on the domestic legs. And so we've assumed a little bit of kind of bounce back in that kind of in the second half. So it's big sales. It's bounce back in the airline thing. It's synergies that are baked into the recent acquisition, it's big sales plan. There's just a lot of things going right in that business. \nDavid Togut: Just a quick final question on capital allocation priorities for 2022. You've been very opportunistic with the stock at the current price, you've also been able to make some solid acquisitions. What's your thought process for the year ahead when you look at your stock at the current price versus what you have in the acquisition pipeline? \nRonald F. Clarke: We're still buyers. I mean, I guess, I mentioned in my opening comments, that not only did we buy a couple of million shares in Q4, but we made the decision with the Board to keep buying at the price into January, right, through a 10b5. And so I don't know where the stock is going to be, but at this price, we're buyers. \n And I think Chuck said it super well, Dave, earlier that with the liquidity we have, $1.5 billion, $1.7 billion, depending on what cash we elect to use, we can do a lot of things, right? At this kind of stock price, we can buy back still a lot more of the company. And as I mentioned, we're going to un-pause a set of deals that we worked on in the summer into the fall. And so my guess, if you said to me, \"Hey, we talk in 6 months,\" is you see us do both. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. \nGeorgios Mihalos: I guess, first, just to build off David's, the last one, can you sort of break down for us now the composition of revenue within lodging from your traditional blue collar business and the airlines business now? Just trying to get a sense of how they are in terms of size and how we should be thinking about that bounce back in airlines going forward if it materializes. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, that's a good question. So I think we probably get the details of that, but we do think of it in 3 pieces or 3 verticals. So we have what we call workforce, which is the original business we've owned for 10 years, which targets blue collar, travelers, a tree-cutting firm that goes when the power lines are down. And then a couple of verticals that we've gotten into the last couple of years of airline crew. So the airlines, again, it's a global business. 10% of the lodging rooms, I think, are crew around the world. So a nice segment for us to be in. \n And then this newest one for us of homeowner insurers basically put people when you have water damage or a fire or something like that, they're putting people up and then put them into longer-term housing. So there's super unique things in terms of the systems that we integrate into -- right into the crew management system or into the claims system in the case of the insurer. The networks are a little bit different than we try to put together depending on who the traveler is. \n And so I'd say that the 2 newest things would be circa 40%, just to give you kind of a number relative to the workforce [ figure ]. And the good news is all 3 of those, again, are growing for the reasons that I outlined a bit ago. \nGeorgios Mihalos: Okay. Just a quick follow-up on the expense side. I know it's something that's been talked about here. But if we look at '22, I mean, certainly, it sounds like there are some expenses that are somewhat more transitory, right? You've got a big increase as the bad debt normalizes and starts to come back. Obviously, you've got some integration costs. But could you just help us think about how much of those are transitory specific to '22 versus sort of structural over the next several years as you accelerate investments to the cloud into your tech transformation? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, George, let me -- it's Ron. Let me take a swing and then Chuck can maybe provide a bit more detail. The way that I think about it, we think about it is what I'll call kind of discretionary expense so that we think about the business sitting there to operate and run the book of business we have, we need a set of expenses, right? We need IT to run and com and people and credit and things like that. And then the big incremental expenses are really sales and IT and then a little bit of management to figure out the way. And so those are gigantic. \n They're -- call those things I'm talking about $600 million to $700 million of our total expense plan in '22. So the call for us is really just how much do we spend in those things, which, again, are 50% or more helping 2023 and 2024, right? Because by the time you sell the thing and get it on board and you do it by next Thanksgiving, you don't get the business until the following year, you build an IT thing, you don't roll it out until Christmas. \n So that's the message I think that you ought to hear is we made the call when we like the revenue and profit guide that we can get to, to basically chase some things that we like, that we think are additive and incremental in the future years. And so the answer is it depends. If those things go well, we'll double down on it more. If they don't, we'll probably back off. If we need a different profit target, we may back off if we don't. \n So I'd say that those are the ones we kind of keep in our hand on the steering wheel and decide kind of how much we want to do with it. Unless investors told me, \"Hey, they don't care about what our profits are,\" and then we might do more of it. I haven't heard that yet, so -- but we're still balancing it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist. \nAndrew Jeffrey: Ron, lots of pretty interesting initiatives, I think, first, digital, which you noted is now half of fuel sales and the progress towards a platform selling motion. I'm trying to wrap my head around a little bit, and I don't expect you to speak to anything beyond '22, but is there anything that we should be thinking about as sort of leaking out of the bottom of the funnel if you're having success with more value-added solutions, maybe expanded spend on fuel cards. \n I'm not sure you called that out this quarter in particular, but all this stuff collectively, should we think that maybe this business can grow faster at the current margin? Or is there -- I just want to make sure I'm not missing any puts and takes here that you'd want us to focus on. \nRonald F. Clarke: It's a super good question, Andrew. And my answer, a little lawfully, would be it depends. So what I would say to you is this direction we're going of effectively repackaging and integrating a bunch of the products that we have has enormous incremental potential for the company because it will be served up differently, and it will appeal to different businesses than we're targeting today. \n So the first message I'm trying to get everybody to say is we're on to something that leverages the capabilities we've built over 20 years, that it's a 10x kind of opportunity for the company. The process that we could make is going to be a function of the selling economics of that, which we're just getting into. \n So if you said to me, \"Hey, how do you think the profit margins will look in 2 or 3 years?\" My answer is probably pretty similar of the set of businesses that we have because we've got great experience and history and statistics, and we know the curves. We kind of know what we can produce. \n I would say we don't know that answer for some of these platform things. And so if those things sell kind of at a line average or even a smidge worse, I think you'll continue to see growth with similar kinds of margins. And if not, then we'll fight that fight when we get there and ask people, \"Hey, would you rather see accelerated revenue with slightly lower margins?\" If that's the conclusion. But it's really just a bit too -- it's a bit too early to call. \nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. That's helpful. And then just philosophically or theoretically as a follow-up, is this a business that at some point you'd like to be simpler? Or do you feel really good about all the businesses you're in? I know gift has sort of been kind of a mixed bag over the years. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I think we -- it's a great question. I think that it's the oldest vantage point, like we made the great idea of talking to you guys and buy-side people about the way we run the company and we have these different things and stuff. When we sit around in the company, it's really pretty simple. I tried to say in my opening remarks of basically, we just work for businesses and we work on their expenses or their spend and we try to reduce it. Then the programs that we created control what they buy and what they pay for. So for us, whether it's the lodging room piece of spend or fuel or business card piece of spend or a vendor, it all looks like a business expense that we're trying to help control. \n And the reason that it seems complicated is we've made like super specialized ways to do it. So we ended up like talking to everybody, \"Hey, let me tell you about the super secret sauce I use in lodging versus whatever.\" And I think we're going to start to talk to the marketplace, to your point, a little simpler and just say, \"Hey, look, we're about trying to help you spend less on kind of nonpayroll expenses, and we've got super special stuff and we've got kind of more generalized stuff. And what's your need, and we've got a product line. Let's see if we can help you.\" And maybe get a back off a little bit of all the detail that we provide everybody on how we make the sausage, I think. \nAndrew Jeffrey: Yes. I think that could help a lot. Very helpful, thanks. \nRonald F. Clarke: The selling is a perfect example or whatever. Like we use this pivot we've made to digital. We use it everywhere in the company. We figured out how to build the tech stack. We figured out how to advertise. We figured out how to automate bidding. We figured out how to get applications processed through the system. We figured how to make credit instant. We've done like so many things that we can basically print and copy into the other businesses that we have. \n And so I think you'll see more of that. As we launch this platform line, you'll see us tucking the things that we have into the platform. And they may seem more of the same to people than different. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. \nKenneth Suchoski: Ron, I wanted to follow up on some of the questions on EV. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the EV economics are roughly in line with traditional fueling services. So can you provide some insight on what the unit economics might look like for the EV offering? It's impressive that the transition to EV is revenue neutral. So I'm just curious what's driving that. \nCharles Freund: Ken, this is Charles. Good question. And I actually had our analyst pull data from the Netherlands, a country that's a little bit further ahead in terms of EV migration than the U.K., which is further ahead than the U.S. And there, we have about 18,000 clients. And we said, \"Okay, let's split those clients into 2 categories: a group that only buys fuel. It has no EV. So IC, internal combustion engine-only; and then mixed fleets.\" And what I'd tell you is about 14% of the clients, about 2,500 clients are mixed fleets. So they've got both types of vehicles. And they tend to be larger, so the enterprise-level clients are moving faster. So the mixed fleets average about 20 cards per account or vehicles per account, whereas on the fuel-only fleet, say IC-only fleets, there are about 5 cars per account. \n When I look at those mixed fleets, the actual revenue per vehicle that we receive on EVs versus fuel, it's actually slightly higher. And part of the reason is that these enterprise-level clients get rebates when they go out in the fuel networks, which we provide to them, which we don't see on the EV reporting side. And so the economics turn out to be neutral to actually slightly favorable on the EV side. And so without now getting into specifics, client-level type of revenue per, I would tell you that EV is about 20% higher for these mixed fleets. \n Now of their cards, they've got about 15% to 20% over to EV already. So we're seeing some real data points here. But that just gives you enough sense of who's moving, the size of accounts that are moving, how far they moved and the economic kind of relationship there and why it is comparable. \nRonald F. Clarke: Hey, Ken, it's Ron. It's a super important question so let me -- it's Ron, just chip on to what Chuck said. So to me, there was and is maybe a massive misconception that, \"Hey, when a business moves to EV, you plug in and everything is free.\" So goodbye, FLEETCOR, tough day. So the 2 things that I can't not admit that somewhere years ago, I was worried when I was dumber. But the 2 things that are clear are: one, it costs way more to recharge an EV vehicle than people thought. Certainly, when you do it publicly. There's a huge markup on the electricity, obviously, because the charge point versus trying to make money and there's way higher MDR for people like us because they're trying to build up volume. \n So the first misconception is, \"Oh, it costs $50 to fill up a van and only $5 to recharge a van.\" So that's not true. And then the second thing, which I think we all missed is, most of the recharging is going to happen at home. So there's millions of charge points that we're not in the business today. We only do stuff at gas stations. And so, to me, those are the 2 things where you go, \"Oh my God, most of the recharging is going to happen at home and it's got to be measured and reimbursed. So who's going to do it?\" \n So I just discovered from the math that Chuck ran through, I just want to stick those concepts in people's heads that it is different than all of us thought coming into the thing. There's more money helping businesses in this thing, and it's going to cost them more than they think when they think about their golf cards. \nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. \nJames Faucette: I wanted to kind of follow up on that question and just ask on these minority investments that you've made, I think, at least in my mind, the case to be made for managing those expenses and the costs associated with it, as you just highlighted are probably more significant than people may have imagined. \n But can you talk about strategically why -- or under what conditions you do the minority investment versus acquisition, what you're expecting that to lead to down the road, and how we should think about that trajectory of relationships and potential contribution directly to FLEETCOR? \nRonald F. Clarke: James, hey, it's Ron. It's a good question. It's kind of \"try before you buy\". So the category is new. There's a couple of partners that we called out today that have been working on software pretty hard and stuff. So for us, it's kind of a no-brainer to be supportive to them, give them money to keep kind of bill. And we have, obviously, commercial agreements that state the economics and the roles of the 2 companies. And so we like it. \n We kind of get -- some people have been working on it here in the U.S. and some people have been working on it in Europe. We integrated it into the stuff we have and off we go. We've got a product that works, and so we can focus on trying to sell those stuff, which is what those 2 partners are looking for. Honestly, to the extent the thing is a super big deal and we want to get more of the value chain, we would clearly look at other options and stuff down the road and obviously in other geographies. \n But initially, we're super pleased with these partners. We screened a lot of them. We like the offerings that we have. And we're still in the mode that I said we can. We're still trying to learn exactly what the clients want and need and to make sure that the products, including the software, are dialed into that. So we didn't want to get out over our skis before we were clearer. \nJames Faucette: That makes sense. And then just as a quick follow-up. You've talked a lot about the strength we're seeing in things like hotel and recovery in travel. Can you just give us a little bit of color on what we -- you saw as we went through the Omicron wave and where you're at on a run rate trajectory, if there was any impact there? Just trying to measure near-term sensitivity to recent events. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Another good question. I'd say a smidge. We, Chuck and I, obviously did a reconnaissance of January with our folks, and I think we had a bit more in Europe, again. Exiting December and a bit into January, I'd say, it's a pretty soft month change for us anyway. So a smidgy impact. Obviously, we've rolled that into our guidance yesterday. We've had our eyes open the whole time. And I'd say the most recent stop, call it, the last week or 2 that smidgy thing is kind of going away. \n So it's -- I don't want to get over my hopes easier, but it's sure feeling like we're coming out a bit into a clearing, finally. And again, I just want to reaffirm that the forward numbers we've given for '22, we're pretty confident sitting here, beginning of February. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. This concludes today's conference, and you may... \nJames Eglseder: Hey, Alex, can we make just a quick comment? We just want to apologize to those on the call for the technical whiteout. Hopefully, it wasn't super confusing. So as always, appreciate the interest and the support. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Charles Freund",
            "content": "Thanks, Ron. \n So jumping into the product category details behind our 17% organic revenue growth in Q4, corporate payments was up 18%, with another quarter of strong performance in full AP, which was up over 50% yet again. Our card products, virtual and multicard, were up 16%, and cross-border was up 14%, which is normalized for the AFEX acquisition we closed in June. In cross-border, we completed the final customer migrations from AFEX' systems to our Corpay cross-border platform in December. And we'll continue with the integration of back-office systems and processes throughout this year. Our thesis are holding, with synergies and accretion in line with our expectations. \n I'd like to give a big shout out to our integration team as it's due to their hard work and dedication that the conversion has been so seamless and successful. \n Fuel was up organically 12%, with growth in every geography largely as a result of our digital sales efforts and strong retention rates. Our ability to sell and retain fuel card customers around the world demonstrates the attractiveness of our offers, the competitiveness of our products and the effectiveness of our technology. \n We continue to make good progress in developing and marketing our EV charge management solutions, particularly in Europe, where we now have over 5,000 clients with EV-enabled cards or fobs. We've also been actively expanding the on-road network acceptance of our EV solutions, with approximately 6,500 charge points in the U.K. now accepting our products. This represents about 22% coverage of all publicly available charge points in the country. \n On the continent, we've got around 85% coverage as our products are accepted at roughly 190,000 charge points. We've built a dedicated organization to advance our EV efforts and will continue to support our fuel card customers as they slowly migrate to EVs. \n Tolls was up 17% compared with last year as strong new, sales up 20%, and some new retention initiatives are really paying off. We made tremendous progress to expand our toll business this year. We doubled our fuel locations year-over-year to nearly 1,200, and we had nearly 0.5 million active fuel users as of year-end. \n We recently signed Mitsubishi, Hyundai, Toyota and Kia to install our tags on vehicles before they leave the factories. And as Ron mentioned earlier, we completed our joint venture with Caixa, Brazil's largest bank.\n Our lodging business continued to perform well, up 39%. Workforce lodging has improved with higher volume, and airlines especially outperformed, with organic growth over 100% as domestic air travel rebounded from COVID lows. The integration of ALE Solutions, a provider of lodging services to displaced policyholders of major insurance companies, is going quite smoothly, and we're increasingly confident in the value it will deliver. \n Gift organic growth was 19% year-over-year as the new efforts we've discussed on the last several calls continue to produce results, especially the retailer online sales channel. We also saw a pick-up in card replenishment orders, which had been delayed due to COVID concerns. \n Now looking further down the income statement, operating expenses of $462 million represented an increase over prior year, primarily due to the addition of the AFEX and ALE operations as well as higher deal and integration-related costs, increases tied to higher volumes across our businesses, stock compensation, and new sales generation activities and investments to drive future growth. \n Bad debt expense was $18.5 million or 5 basis points as credit losses have returned to more historical levels. Interest expense decreased 9% year-over-year due to a slight decline in LIBOR rates and the offset of higher interest rates applied to customer deposits and cash balances in certain foreign jurisdictions. We incurred $9.9 million of cost during the quarter associated with the incremental $750 million in Term B debt we added in December. \n On the Term B increase, the rate was the same as our existing facility at LIBOR plus 175 basis points and matures in April 2028. Our ratings and leverage remained effectively unchanged, reflecting the strength and earnings power of our company. \n Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.6% versus 20.3% last year, with the increase driven primarily by the lack of excess tax benefit on stock option exercises. \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with over $1.5 billion in unrestricted cash, and we had $1.1 billion available on our revolver. There was $4.9 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, which included the incremental $750 million Term B debt I just mentioned. Finally, we had $1.1 billion borrowed in our securitization facility. All in, as of December 31, our leverage ratio was 2.71x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. \n As Ron mentioned, in the quarter, we repurchased roughly 2.3 million shares. And in total, we repurchased about 5.5 million shares during 2021. We also bought 1.1 million shares in January under our 10b5-1 plan. You may have seen in our press release that our Board authorized another $1 billion in repurchases. So taking all of that into account, we still have almost $1.4 billion authorized for repurchases as of today. \n We believe we have ample liquidity to pursue any near-term M&A opportunities and continue to buy back shares when it makes sense. I think it's important to remind everyone of the power that our earnings and cash flow gives us. Recapping 2021, we repurchased 5.5 million shares for $1.36 billion. Our guidance for share count for 2022 is down 7 million shares from what we guided a year ago. We spent $950 million on deals, which will generate incremental earnings of $0.50 to $0.60 per share next year and continue to provide growth in future years. \n We also raised an additional $1.55 billion of Term B debt, $800 million in Q2 and $750 million in Q4, at very attractive rates and terms. And our leverage barely changed. \n We believe the combination of our strong position, the structure of our business model and high recurring revenues will enable us to deliver consistent quality growth year after year after year. \n Now let me share some thoughts on our Q1 outlook and our full-year assumptions. Looking ahead, we're expecting Q1 2022 revenue to be between $740 million and $760 million, and adjusted net income per share to be between $3.45 and $3.55, which at the midpoint is approximately $0.68 and or 24% higher than what we reported in Q1 of 2021. \n You may notice the midpoint of our Q1 guide is also approximately $0.22 or 6% lower than what we reported in Q4 of 2021. This is largely due to revenue seasonality, where certain businesses, such as gift and tolls, have strong fourth quarters while fuel and lodging tend to have soft first quarters due to weather and holidays. As such, the first quarter tends to be the lowest in terms of both revenue and profit for our company. \n I'd like to note a few assumptions underlying the full year 2022 guidance Ron provided earlier. We expect bad debt to be about $30 million higher than 2021 levels as we see a return to more normalized credit losses, due in part to increasing sales production. Our interest expense guidance of $90 million to $100 million assumes 3 25 basis point rate increases throughout the year. And our tax rate is also expected to be higher, at between 24% and 26%, as we expect any excess tax benefit from stock option exercises to remain low relative to the last few years. \n The effects of these higher expenses will be partially offset by the lower share count resulting from our repurchase activity over the past 13 months. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement. \n Now let's move beyond the results and the outlook. Since we last spoke, our new ESG report was published and is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Some highlights you will find in the document are: more details around our workforce advantage, including our comprehensive employee development and training programs; and our adoption of the Rooney Rule for all vice-president-and-above positions; as well as some reporting on our global data centers, including the significant reduction in power usage and footprint which are down 40% and 62%, respectively, over the last 5 years. \n Finally, I would like to thank our nearly 10,000 employees around the world who helped us deliver a strong finish to a great year and who will be the driving force to even greater heights in 2022. Thank you for your interest in FLEETCOR. \n And now, operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. Yes, Sanjay, this is Charles. So the expense growth you're seeing comes from a couple of different areas. One, we've got the AFEX and ALE acquisitions that are rolling in, so that's number one. Two, we've got the normalization of credit losses. We expect that to be quite a bit higher, some [ start comp ] in there. Also related to the deals, we've got ongoing integration costs. The AFEX integration is probably the most advanced we'll have taken as a company, so to really move them off their systems, close redundant offices, et cetera. It's a multiyear journey there and we're spending money to basically create synergies for the future. So that's also kind of baked in, both in the fourth quarter here as well as into our guide for next year. \n We are seeing some inflationary pressure predominantly around staffing. So wages in some of the call centers and such, we've taken measures to remedy that. As it relates to vendors, a little bit. But I'd say that, that will help us eventually as it flows through to vendor payments in, say, our corporate payments arena. So it's a tale of two cities, right? We're going to have some additional costs from inflation, but we'll also get some benefit from it on the revenue side. Yes. Trevor, it's Charles. I'd say that it is a bit of a reset. So some of the acquisitions that we bought do operate at slightly lower margins. So they're dealing with big airlines or insurance companies, right? These are very, very focused on the rates they pay, and then also require a very, very high levels of service. And so we need to make investments. And as the airline volumes of revenue is pouring back, we need to staff up to accommodate those service level requirements. \n So I think the 54% is probably a good assumption going for next year. And as Ron mentioned, we are continuing to make investments for future growth. And so I'd say, operating margin should hold at that level for the remainder of this year. We've got about $5.9 billion that would flow with LIBOR. So for every 25 basis points, you're looking at kind of $14 million to $15 million of incremental annualized expense, so you got to layer that in over time. On the flip side, we do have customer deposits and cash balances that sit around the world, and we're earning pretty good interest on those. And so if interest rates continue to rise around the world, we might actually see enough benefit. Yes. So we completed the joint venture with Caixa Bank. It's the largest bank in Brazil, tends to focus a bit more downmarket. So if you look at our historic Sem Parar business, we've tend to focus a bit more on -- I won't say, affluent, but kind of more middle class users and such. And with Caixa, we'll be able to, one, move a bit downmarket and leverage all of the distribution capabilities, so all the branches, their ATMs, et cetera. And so we view it as extensive distribution, but also reaching slightly different segments around the country that we just weren't as focused on historically. And Andrew, just to pick up on that, I think you were talking maybe wage pressure on some of our customers. And what I'd say there is we have seen that in lodging, in particular. And so our workforce lodging business, which has recovered, which is not to the extent that we -- where it could, is that they've had actually small businesses turn down jobs. And I can't travel there and do the work because I can't hire the people. \n And so it will be interesting to see, as government subsidies and other things fall aside and see what happens to the employment market, but we think there is some upside opportunity there. Having built a whole lot into the plan a little bit, but not a whole lot. But wait and see, maybe truck drivers, too. Yes. Yes, David, this is Charles. So lodging performing extremely well. We do have some continued recovery to go there, particularly in the airline space. So a lot of the performance you're seeing here is reflective of the domestic air travel. International has still been way, way down versus historic norms. [ So seeing ] that kind of swinging back a bit next year. \n Workforce has a bit of room to recover, but it's also just chugging along and doing pretty well. ALE business, which was a recent acquisition, accretive, a good buy for us. Still work to do to realize those synergies, but I'd say we're confident that the plans come together, so that looks pretty good. In terms of that specific line of business or product category, I have it in front of me. Ken, this is Charles. Good question. And I actually had our analyst pull data from the Netherlands, a country that's a little bit further ahead in terms of EV migration than the U.K., which is further ahead than the U.S. And there, we have about 18,000 clients. And we said, \"Okay, let's split those clients into 2 categories: a group that only buys fuel. It has no EV. So IC, internal combustion engine-only; and then mixed fleets.\" And what I'd tell you is about 14% of the clients, about 2,500 clients are mixed fleets. So they've got both types of vehicles. And they tend to be larger, so the enterprise-level clients are moving faster. So the mixed fleets average about 20 cards per account or vehicles per account, whereas on the fuel-only fleet, say IC-only fleets, there are about 5 cars per account. \n When I look at those mixed fleets, the actual revenue per vehicle that we receive on EVs versus fuel, it's actually slightly higher. And part of the reason is that these enterprise-level clients get rebates when they go out in the fuel networks, which we provide to them, which we don't see on the EV reporting side. And so the economics turn out to be neutral to actually slightly favorable on the EV side. And so without now getting into specifics, client-level type of revenue per, I would tell you that EV is about 20% higher for these mixed fleets. \n Now of their cards, they've got about 15% to 20% over to EV already. So we're seeing some real data points here. But that just gives you enough sense of who's moving, the size of accounts that are moving, how far they moved and the economic kind of relationship there and why it is comparable."

            "content": "Okay. Jim, thanks. \n Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q4 earnings call. So upfront here, I plan to cover 3 subjects. So first, provide my view of Q4, along with full year '21 results; second, lay out our 2022 guidance and priorities for the year; and then lastly, I'll share my thoughts on the company's midterm imperatives. \n Okay. Let me make the turn to our Q4 results, which were quite good. So we reported revenue of $802 million, up 30% and cash EPS of $3.72 , that's up 24%, both record-highs for the company. Revenue came in quite hot, almost $40 million higher than the revenue guidance we provided 90 days ago. Organic revenue growth for Q4, good. Up 17%, also up 7% against Q4 of '19. Every line of business, double-digit organic revenue growth in the quarter. Our Q4 trends continued quite good. Record sales in the quarter, up 40% versus prior year. Steady revenue retention at 93%. Same-store sales, healthy at plus 6%. \n We have had some notable callout since we spoke last. We formalized our partnership with the largest bank in Brazil which will help distribute our toll products, so we expect a lift there. We launched formally our Corpay One SMB platform business, so getting our corporate payments business into the SMB space. We just completed another investment in an EV software company. We upsized our term loan of $750 million. We repurchased over 3 million FLT shares in Q4 and in January. And we completed the rebranding of our corporate payments business. All the brands now under Corpay. So in summary, really a good finish to the year better than we expected and the trends helpful as we look into 2022. \n Okay. Let me turn to 2021 full year. I think we characterize 2021 really as a comeback year, where we moved ahead of our 2019 pre-pandemic baseline. Really good financial results. '21 revenue of $2.8 billion, up 19%. Cash EPS of $13.21, also up 19%. Both of those results, record-highs for the company. We did open 2021 with an initial guide of $12.31 of cash EPS at the midpoint, so now finishing $0.90 better than that in initial guide. So clearly a better year than expected. \n Organic revenue growth for 2021, up 12%. That's the highest organic revenue growth that we've ever reported. 2021 sales, super good. Record levels, up 46% versus 2020 and up 19% versus 2019. We've added 175,000 new clients. 175,000 new clients to our books in '21 across the world. So strong demand for our services. We did close 2 accretive acquisitions in '21 and expect together those to deliver $0.50 to $0.60 of incremental cash EPS here in '22. So all in all, a meaningful recovery from 2020. \n All right. Let me cover now our initial thoughts on 2022 guidance along with the priorities for the year. We've mentioned before our stated midterm objectives for the company are to grow sales 20% plus, to grow organic revenue 10% plus, and to grow cash EPS 15% to 20%. Good news, our '22 guidance meets all 3 of these objectives, so here it goes. \n For revenue in 2022, at the midpoint, $3.22 billion, that's up 14%; cash EPS of $15.25 at the midpoint, up 15%; organic revenue growth overall, up 10%; and sales growth just over 20%. This guidance does not include any forward capital allocation beyond deleveraging. \n There is no real macro help in these numbers. We're basically outlooking the macro to be neutral. Yes, higher fuel prices, but really offset by some weaker FX. We have assumed about a 1% COVID recovery in our same-store sales client base coming back this year in '22. \n Confidence, pretty high in these numbers. About half of the expected year-over-year performance improvement is already in our exit rate or run rate coming into the year so that helps. Our recent sales and retention trends support the forecast. Most of the synergies for the 2 big acquisitions are really already baked so we expect to get that accretion. And we have repurchased about 6.5 million shares from a year ago, so obviously going to be quite accretive. \n In terms of priorities, we have picked a few things that we'll invest in incrementally this year. So digital sales. We're expecting a big increase in digital sales production in '22 and are making, thus, incremental investments in digital advertising and staff. IT. Big investments in IT transformation to accelerate our move to the cloud. And this platform business that I spoke of, where we're joining up our walk-around services with our central AP services. Going to push those platforms pretty hard and get a read on demand. So all in all, a pretty ambitious year. \n Okay. So last up today, I'd like to talk about our midterm prospects and the imperatives for the company. I thought it might be helpful to rewind just a bit for anyone new on the call, just remind everyone who FLEETCOR is and what we're trying to do. \n So in a nutshell, FLEETCOR provides B2B specialty payment solutions, really all intended to do one thing, which is to help businesses, our clients, spend less, primarily by controlling what they buy and what they pay for. Our differentiation kind of really comes in 2 forms. \n First, our products are highly specialized. We target certain kinds of clients with very specialized needs. So our products would look different for trucking firms than they would look for plumbing firms. Our travel services would look different for blue collar travelers than they would for white collar travelers. So very dialed-in kind of product line. \n And second, we operate more than 15 proprietary acceptance networks. That allows us to capture very unique data at the point of sale. We also enjoy very favorable economics, which we share with our clients. So this focused or specialized approach, coupled with a two-sided business model has allowed us to deliver consistent growth over a long period of time. \n So let me turn to the 3 imperatives, the big things that we're on that we think are critical to driving sustained growth over the long term. So first up is EV. We're working EV and the energy transition hard. We do feel like we've made a lot of progress so far. \n So both here and in Europe, we've added public acceptance networks for EV, so public charge points or recharge points. We've invested in EV software companies that facilitate at-home recharging and reimbursement. We signed up a few hundred clients to our EV service to get feedback on the service. And initially here, we're seeing the revenue or the economics from our service, EV service, roughly in line with our more traditional refueling services. So look, we're on this EV. We'll manage along with the transition and continue to report out. \n Second imperative is digital, where company's working super hard to make the digital transition, accelerated by COVID. So the first thing I'd say is sales has really made a pivot. So last year, over 50% of our global fuel card sales came in digitally and over half of those processing end-to-end with no human intervention. On the marketing front, we've moved our focus to top of the funnel. So we're using digital advertising, ABM technology to identify prospects interested in our services. \n On the client experience front, we've really advanced our UIs and their capability to allow our clients to do more themselves. So faster and easier than ever before. And at the point of sale, we've added new ways to transact with us beyond cards. So including mobile phones, RFID technology, even connected cars. So a lot of progress on the digital front. \n So last up is diversification, transitioning our portfolio to bigger TAMs, into higher-growth segments. So you've heard us speak of beyond -- going beyond, in which we extend each of our existing businesses into adjacent market segments to create more opportunity. \n So just a few examples there. So our corporate payments business, traditionally a middle markets business, now entering the SMB space. Our traveler lodging business, really a workforce, a blue collar-focused business has recently added airline or lodging for crews, and displaced homeowners or homeowners' insurance companies really to extend the potential of that business. In Brazil, historically, a toll-centric, highway-centric client base, we're now adding hundreds of thousands of urban or city dwellers to our expanded offering. So look, over time, we do expect these adjacencies to increase the opportunity for each of our businesses. \n Platform business. I mentioned we will join up our specialized payment solutions into one comprehensive platform in which a single business or client could use, for example, our smart business cards, our travel solutions and our online billpay services all from the same UI and all from us. So this platform concept really combines our capabilities for employee walk-around kinds of purchases along with central billpay. So we think the platform idea has big potential and can be quite additive to the specialized payment services that we offer now. \n As a result of these extensions, we are expecting our global fleet card business to account for about 40% of the company's revenue this year. That's down from about 50% 5 years ago. So again, repositioning for faster growth. So we do plan to work these 3 midterm imperatives hard: EV, digital and diversification. Of course, we'll report progress as we go. \n So in conclusion today, back to Q4. Again, better than we expected and good trends coming into this year. 2021, really, again, a comeback year, finishing much, much better than we thought at the outset. This year, 2022, another guide to growth. Organic growth of expected at 10%, earnings expected to be up 15%, so a lot of distance from our pre-pandemic baseline. And the midterm, again, we're pretty focused on these 3 imperatives that I just outlined, key to sustainable growth for the company. \n So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter. Chuck? Pete, we're struggling to hear you. Yes. We -- I can, now. If you could dial back in. We can take the next question. Ramsey, it's Ron. I'd say probably the latter. Probably think about this level, this 4%-ish level. And the 2 drivers, kind of new things in the last couple of years, would be that Brazil network buildout that we've referenced before. So a fair amount of cost in getting those incremental few thousand stations up. And then two, we've earmarked a fair amount of kind of incremental money through the IT transformation. So not just enhancing, obviously, the systems we have, but effectively building new ones in parallel. So I'd say those couple of things would have at least probably a couple more years to run and then it may bottom back down a bit. Yes. Good question. So I'd say that our priorities are unchanged, Ramsey,right? We're first M&A, if we like it, for capabilities and/or it's accretive. But as you can tell from Chuck's comments earlier, we -- what did we say, 6.5 million shares we bought back in the last 12 months. So we've had a bit of an appetite for our own stock, which we think is appropriate. \n In terms of the M&A, we did press the pause button, call it, 3 months ago when we saw the volatility, both in our own stock and in some of the others in our category. And so literally post this, we're going to kind of reach back out to some of those things that are super late in the pipeline and test where sellers are basically. We've got a view of where we are now. So I'd say ask me again in 30 days whether sellers have got the message that things are volatile and maybe at a lower price that they'll take. Darrin, hey, it's Ron. Yes. I'd say the guide embedded in the guide for '22 would be high single digits for fuel cards, so off of obviously more normalized comps this year. And Part B, yes, the OTR, which is, I don't know, call it, 30% of our business globally across Europe and Brazil continues to run softer, right? The COVID impact, getting drivers to soften that business more. So I think inside of our high single digit, that thing would be a smidge softer than the local or partner business. Yes. This -- you kind of cut out a bit. But if you said we had decent sales, I mean we've had literally record sales in the fuel card business. Yes, another good question. I'd say probably another quarter or so, and let me tell you why. So we started out, call it, in the second half testing, going out to, call it, 1,000 clients, 2,000 clients, putting them on a new payment platform, seeing if they had an interest in our new platform, billpay solution, saw some decent reaction to it. And so what we've decided to do is kind of be careful in changing the payment platform and basically presenting a new service at the same time. \n We want to be super cautious around not upsetting, if you will, the golden goose of these fuel card clients. So we're moving to put that platform in against a broader set of clients, get them comfortable using that and then effectively present harder this add-on for them. So my guess is probably somewhere in Q2, we'll be able to report out on it. Sanjay, it's Ron. Let just jump on the last thing Chuck said, which would be some of the increment is really directed by us, choice that we made around EV capabilities and sales. And again, some testing and advertising things and even in IT to really better position the business. We like the profit number we got to. So in addition to the factors that Chuck just laid out, I do want you to hear that we've chosen to chase some things that help the company on a forward basis. Yes. I think it's actually been the other way so far. I think that we announced again a follow-on in kind of a new investment in software companies. I think companies that are working on software see people like us, leasing companies, as the best distribution pipe in the fleet, particularly as they're mixing stuff. And so we continue to like our chances, both offering that back to our client base because we're first to see if they're moving off of a fuel -- of internal combustion approach to something else so we could spot it in our client base. And then B, we've got obviously lots of coverage generally, right, to bring new clients into the fold. And so I'd say, for sure, our distribution capabilities are probably as good as any. \n With that said, we did mention the Brazil thing, which is a bit of a case study where we've now basically put tags -- effectively, toll tags in with 3 or 4 partners literally as those cars come off the line. So when you buy your new Kia or whatever the heck it is, Nissan, in Brazil, it's got a Sem Parar tag when you come out. \n So look, we think over time, these cars will be coming off the line connected, where they're sending data every couple of seconds. And so we mostly want to be set up just to grab that, relationships where we have access to that connected car information and can then help, again, the client, whether he's at a public location or road location or at home basically pay for the thing. So I would say -- I said earlier in the office, we are just so much smarter on this transition now and how to play and how we're advantaged or not and what help we need. So I don't know if we're communicating it well, but we are just in a way better spot than we were. Yes. Can people hear us? Pete, I don't think you can hear, but it's Ron. So I kind of answered a bit of this earlier that we're going a bit slower to be cautious on the cross-sell, and we are obviously selling to new prospects in the market. So I'd say it would be pretty minimal. So if you look at our overall corporate payments guide for the year, the SMB piece would still be relatively small, again, mostly because we're trying to be careful and make sure we have the acquisition economics, right? \n So in terms of upside, I think, yes, since we don't have scalable views of that yet, I'd say as we get into the second half and get through some of the testing that's going to go on, there could be some upside. We could step on the gas there a bit if we like what we're seeing, and maybe lift the growth rate in the second half. Let me just jump on, Jim, and talk about it. Hey, it's Ron. I would just add to it that we love how incremental different distribution channels are. So when we bought the business, I can't remember, 70% or 80% of all new sales came through the stores, kiosks -- the [ 500 ] stores and in toll booths, where people were waiting in line, and we diversified that into digital hanging things at retail, outbound sales, et cetera, and then a whole slew of partners, including the manufacturers that Chuck referenced. \n So what I'd say most is we just love the incremental nature of a bank and those accounts and those relationships and being in that channel. So we haven't put a ton into the guide yet because that thing just lifted off, I think, a couple of months -- 2, 3 months ago. But we are super excited about it because it is the single largest bank, largest set of account holders in the entire country. And so we're super hopeful again that, that will be additive. And to Chuck's point, because it targets a slightly different set of user than the traditional one. Andrew, it's Ron. Yes, we actually have statistics on that. So we look at different cohorts, similar sets of clients and look at whether they have 1, 2, 3 kinds of services. And your thesis is absolutely right that as you move beyond one service, you're stickier with clients, have a deeper relationship, yes. So to the extent that we get what we call our platform or bundle to work and someone had walk-around products and then we were able to get their central billpay, we do think we'll get a lift. And particularly when the bundle could include smart business cards or fuel cards, which is the predominant walk-around. We had a little bit, actually. Chuck referred to this earlier in our lodging business, where we have a decent-sized servicing group which is one of the lowest wage groups kind of in the company. And so I'd say that's the place that we felt some pressure and responded to that in the fall, both to retain people that we were losing and to add additional people. I think like the rest of corporations in America, we're seeing some pressures in different areas, in IT, digital, certain pockets. But we basically have built that in again to the guide. I think it's been going on for, call it, 3 to 6 months. So I think we're comfortable with what we plan. Sure, Bob. I'd say the guide for that business in totality is in the high teens. And again, to your point, there's different pieces. The payables portion of that, virtual cards, full AP. Chuck mentioned the full AP, I think, grew 50% last quarter, so that will grow a bit faster. The partner business that we called out will grow slower than that and probably the cross-border business would be closer to the mid-teens. So there'll be those different pieces in it. \n And you ask me this every time, \"Hey, can you grow it faster?\" Well, obviously, if we could spend more money. But we -- again, we try to balance what we spend to kind of growth target and a profit target and spend wisely so that we don't again have 50% new people or advertising that doesn't work. So we try again to be disciplined in terms of -- productive in terms of the monies that we spend. Yes, that's a great question. So the answer is it's not only our fuel cards business, it's kind of the underlying core of the company. So it's the same thing in lodging. We've got 15,000 hotels here in the U.S. out of, call it, 45,000 or 50,000. We have super economics again and unique data. We've got a toll network, for example, in Brazil. We have fuel networks in, I don't know, 10 countries, where it's impossible for you or someone to go try to create a proprietary network today. \n So I call it out really just to remind new people that those networks and the volume that we run through them and the data that we collect and the economics that we collect are just massively advantageous to us when we turn around to the client side, to the business account side and pitch our offer to them. So I was really just trying to let people know that it's not some plain vanilla, jumping on someone else's network that everyone else basically has access to. Hey, David, it's Ron. I leave it here, as Chuck has talked, and so the guide on that thing is plus 20% organically and obviously crazy high in the 40s on a print basis because we bought something, I guess, closed in September. And the drivers to get to that are the sales plan is way up. I think the sales plan is up 35% or 40%. It's our plan for '22. And then what Chuck said that there's super sensitivity in that one, particularly the airline, for example, about 1/4 of that segment historically of our revenue came from international flights, which in Q4 was still effectively 0. \n And so to the extent that the world opens and airlines go back crossing borders, again, let's say, in Q2, we have the contracts, and we're already serving the airlines on the domestic legs. And so we've assumed a little bit of kind of bounce back in that kind of in the second half. So it's big sales. It's bounce back in the airline thing. It's synergies that are baked into the recent acquisition, it's big sales plan. There's just a lot of things going right in that business. We're still buyers. I mean, I guess, I mentioned in my opening comments, that not only did we buy a couple of million shares in Q4, but we made the decision with the Board to keep buying at the price into January, right, through a 10b5. And so I don't know where the stock is going to be, but at this price, we're buyers. \n And I think Chuck said it super well, Dave, earlier that with the liquidity we have, $1.5 billion, $1.7 billion, depending on what cash we elect to use, we can do a lot of things, right? At this kind of stock price, we can buy back still a lot more of the company. And as I mentioned, we're going to un-pause a set of deals that we worked on in the summer into the fall. And so my guess, if you said to me, \"Hey, we talk in 6 months,\" is you see us do both. Yes, that's a good question. So I think we probably get the details of that, but we do think of it in 3 pieces or 3 verticals. So we have what we call workforce, which is the original business we've owned for 10 years, which targets blue collar, travelers, a tree-cutting firm that goes when the power lines are down. And then a couple of verticals that we've gotten into the last couple of years of airline crew. So the airlines, again, it's a global business. 10% of the lodging rooms, I think, are crew around the world. So a nice segment for us to be in. \n And then this newest one for us of homeowner insurers basically put people when you have water damage or a fire or something like that, they're putting people up and then put them into longer-term housing. So there's super unique things in terms of the systems that we integrate into -- right into the crew management system or into the claims system in the case of the insurer. The networks are a little bit different than we try to put together depending on who the traveler is. \n And so I'd say that the 2 newest things would be circa 40%, just to give you kind of a number relative to the workforce [ figure ]. And the good news is all 3 of those, again, are growing for the reasons that I outlined a bit ago. Yes, George, let me -- it's Ron. Let me take a swing and then Chuck can maybe provide a bit more detail. The way that I think about it, we think about it is what I'll call kind of discretionary expense so that we think about the business sitting there to operate and run the book of business we have, we need a set of expenses, right? We need IT to run and com and people and credit and things like that. And then the big incremental expenses are really sales and IT and then a little bit of management to figure out the way. And so those are gigantic. \n They're -- call those things I'm talking about $600 million to $700 million of our total expense plan in '22. So the call for us is really just how much do we spend in those things, which, again, are 50% or more helping 2023 and 2024, right? Because by the time you sell the thing and get it on board and you do it by next Thanksgiving, you don't get the business until the following year, you build an IT thing, you don't roll it out until Christmas. \n So that's the message I think that you ought to hear is we made the call when we like the revenue and profit guide that we can get to, to basically chase some things that we like, that we think are additive and incremental in the future years. And so the answer is it depends. If those things go well, we'll double down on it more. If they don't, we'll probably back off. If we need a different profit target, we may back off if we don't. \n So I'd say that those are the ones we kind of keep in our hand on the steering wheel and decide kind of how much we want to do with it. Unless investors told me, \"Hey, they don't care about what our profits are,\" and then we might do more of it. I haven't heard that yet, so -- but we're still balancing it. It's a super good question, Andrew. And my answer, a little lawfully, would be it depends. So what I would say to you is this direction we're going of effectively repackaging and integrating a bunch of the products that we have has enormous incremental potential for the company because it will be served up differently, and it will appeal to different businesses than we're targeting today. \n So the first message I'm trying to get everybody to say is we're on to something that leverages the capabilities we've built over 20 years, that it's a 10x kind of opportunity for the company. The process that we could make is going to be a function of the selling economics of that, which we're just getting into. \n So if you said to me, \"Hey, how do you think the profit margins will look in 2 or 3 years?\" My answer is probably pretty similar of the set of businesses that we have because we've got great experience and history and statistics, and we know the curves. We kind of know what we can produce. \n I would say we don't know that answer for some of these platform things. And so if those things sell kind of at a line average or even a smidge worse, I think you'll continue to see growth with similar kinds of margins. And if not, then we'll fight that fight when we get there and ask people, \"Hey, would you rather see accelerated revenue with slightly lower margins?\" If that's the conclusion. But it's really just a bit too -- it's a bit too early to call. Yes. I think we -- it's a great question. I think that it's the oldest vantage point, like we made the great idea of talking to you guys and buy-side people about the way we run the company and we have these different things and stuff. When we sit around in the company, it's really pretty simple. I tried to say in my opening remarks of basically, we just work for businesses and we work on their expenses or their spend and we try to reduce it. Then the programs that we created control what they buy and what they pay for. So for us, whether it's the lodging room piece of spend or fuel or business card piece of spend or a vendor, it all looks like a business expense that we're trying to help control. \n And the reason that it seems complicated is we've made like super specialized ways to do it. So we ended up like talking to everybody, \"Hey, let me tell you about the super secret sauce I use in lodging versus whatever.\" And I think we're going to start to talk to the marketplace, to your point, a little simpler and just say, \"Hey, look, we're about trying to help you spend less on kind of nonpayroll expenses, and we've got super special stuff and we've got kind of more generalized stuff. And what's your need, and we've got a product line. Let's see if we can help you.\" And maybe get a back off a little bit of all the detail that we provide everybody on how we make the sausage, I think. The selling is a perfect example or whatever. Like we use this pivot we've made to digital. We use it everywhere in the company. We figured out how to build the tech stack. We figured out how to advertise. We figured out how to automate bidding. We figured out how to get applications processed through the system. We figured how to make credit instant. We've done like so many things that we can basically print and copy into the other businesses that we have. \n And so I think you'll see more of that. As we launch this platform line, you'll see us tucking the things that we have into the platform. And they may seem more of the same to people than different. Hey, Ken, it's Ron. It's a super important question so let me -- it's Ron, just chip on to what Chuck said. So to me, there was and is maybe a massive misconception that, \"Hey, when a business moves to EV, you plug in and everything is free.\" So goodbye, FLEETCOR, tough day. So the 2 things that I can't not admit that somewhere years ago, I was worried when I was dumber. But the 2 things that are clear are: one, it costs way more to recharge an EV vehicle than people thought. Certainly, when you do it publicly. There's a huge markup on the electricity, obviously, because the charge point versus trying to make money and there's way higher MDR for people like us because they're trying to build up volume. \n So the first misconception is, \"Oh, it costs $50 to fill up a van and only $5 to recharge a van.\" So that's not true. And then the second thing, which I think we all missed is, most of the recharging is going to happen at home. So there's millions of charge points that we're not in the business today. We only do stuff at gas stations. And so, to me, those are the 2 things where you go, \"Oh my God, most of the recharging is going to happen at home and it's got to be measured and reimbursed. So who's going to do it?\" \n So I just discovered from the math that Chuck ran through, I just want to stick those concepts in people's heads that it is different than all of us thought coming into the thing. There's more money helping businesses in this thing, and it's going to cost them more than they think when they think about their golf cards. James, hey, it's Ron. It's a good question. It's kind of \"try before you buy\". So the category is new. There's a couple of partners that we called out today that have been working on software pretty hard and stuff. So for us, it's kind of a no-brainer to be supportive to them, give them money to keep kind of bill. And we have, obviously, commercial agreements that state the economics and the roles of the 2 companies. And so we like it. \n We kind of get -- some people have been working on it here in the U.S. and some people have been working on it in Europe. We integrated it into the stuff we have and off we go. We've got a product that works, and so we can focus on trying to sell those stuff, which is what those 2 partners are looking for. Honestly, to the extent the thing is a super big deal and we want to get more of the value chain, we would clearly look at other options and stuff down the road and obviously in other geographies. \n But initially, we're super pleased with these partners. We screened a lot of them. We like the offerings that we have. And we're still in the mode that I said we can. We're still trying to learn exactly what the clients want and need and to make sure that the products, including the software, are dialed into that. So we didn't want to get out over our skis before we were clearer. Yes. Another good question. I'd say a smidge. We, Chuck and I, obviously did a reconnaissance of January with our folks, and I think we had a bit more in Europe, again. Exiting December and a bit into January, I'd say, it's a pretty soft month change for us anyway. So a smidgy impact. Obviously, we've rolled that into our guidance yesterday. We've had our eyes open the whole time. And I'd say the most recent stop, call it, the last week or 2 that smidgy thing is kind of going away. \n So it's -- I don't want to get over my hopes easier, but it's sure feeling like we're coming out a bit into a clearing, finally. And again, I just want to reaffirm that the forward numbers we've given for '22, we're pretty confident sitting here, beginning of February."

Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.\n  [Operator Instructions] \n Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. \nJames Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Charles Freund, our CFO.  \n Following the prepared comments, the operator will announce that queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then that you can get in line for questions. Please note, our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com.  \n Now throughout this call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. Reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described.  \n I do need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our recovery, outlook, new products and acquisitions and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We do not undertake any obligation to update any of these statements. These expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release and on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Committee. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov.  \n So with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? \nRonald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q3 earnings call. So up-front here, I'd like to run through 4 subjects: first, I'll give you my take on our Q3 results  along with the rest of your outlook; second, take you into a bit deeper dive into our sales results; third, give you an update on the 3 acquisitions that we've completed year-to-date; and then lastly, an early preview of 2022 and beyond.  \n All right. So let me make the turn to our Q3 results. We reported Q3 revenue of $755 million, up 29% and cash EPS of $3.52, up 25%, so both of those all-time record highs for the company. Also, the Q3 results annualized, finally above $3 billion, so past the $3 billion mark in revenue and $14 in cash EPS. Organic revenue for the quarter, up 17%. And inside of that, Corporate Payments business grew 22% organically.  \n The trends in Q3 are quite good. Sales finishing at record levels, up over 50% versus Q3 last year and over 30% against the baseline of Q3 '19. Retention, steady as she goes at 93% for the quarter. And again, our global fuel card business inside of that also coming at 93%. Same-store sales strengthened plus 5% for the quarter, which further adds to the same-store sales rebound we saw in Q2. Credit losses low again at 3 basis points, continuing to run below historic levels. You may notice our tax rate kind of 4 points higher than last year. That did shave about $0.20 off the $3.52 that we reported for the quarter. So look, overall, kind of pretty pleased with the quarter.  \n So in terms of rest of the year, we're raising guidance today. So revenue guidance at the midpoint now, $2.795 billion, that's up $30 million from August. Cash EPS at the midpoint to $13.05, that's up $0.15 from August. This raise versus last time reflects, obviously, these Q3 results are beat the ALE acquisition, which closed September 1 and a bit more favorable fuel prices, all of those offset just a bit by slower-than-planned COVID recovery. If you look at the Q4 on its own, it anticipates revenue and profit growth up about 20% versus Q4 last year and about 10% against Q4 2019.  \n All right. Let me make the transition into a bit deeper dive into our sales results. So as I mentioned, new sales or bookings reached record levels in the quarter and are up sequentially, significantly and up dramatically over the prior periods. So as I'm sure you're aware, sales reflect the market demand for our solutions but are also really the best leading indicator of future prospects. And so crazy record this quarter. We signed up almost 50,000 new business clients globally in Q3. So 50,000 new accounts joined the fold, so a record.  \n Over 50% of all of our global fuel card sales now come to us through our digital channels. So great because it's very low cost. We continue to increase our digital advertising spend, and we're enjoying record levels of prospects visiting our websites. Interest in EV solutions increasing, so a number of large accounts signing on to our EV solution. So that included Hertz, Volkswagen USA, Union Pacific, LeasePlan Europe and Siemens.  \n Brazil toll sales rocked in the quarter. Our urban sales or kind of the city dwellers that are lower frequency toll users represented 23% of all new sales in the quarter. So programs, whatever, 2 or 3 years old now, almost a quarter. And the active tags for the quarter reached a new milestone, 6 million, so 6 million active paying tags now in Brazil. We are planning to launch our new bank JV this month with the largest bank in Brazil, who will be helping to promote our products.  \n We don't talk about it much, but our customer acquisition cost is really quite attractive, runs about 65% of the sales new revenue, so really super important for profitable growth. So let me shift gears and talk a little bit about the 3 acquisitions that we've closed year-to-date and how they're doing. So Roger, first up. We've now rebranded Roger to be Corpay One, which is our entry into the Corporate Payments SMB space. So we're underway now adding new SMB bill pay clients through digital channels and accounting channels, and have some early returns on cross-selling bill pay into our fuel card base. So super early, but it looks like about 10% of our fuel card clients that pay their bills with our new Corpay One platform are choosing to pay a second non-fleet Cor bill with us, so effectively becoming bill pay customers.  \n We're looking at somewhere around 10,000 to 20,000 SMB bill pay clients coming online in 2022. And also interesting, we plan to launch what we call our 2-in-1 solution before year-end that will combine our smart business cards with our bill pay platform into one interface. So an SMB client could potentially pay all of their nonpayroll expenses with us on a single platform.  \n Second deal this year, AFEX, which is a cross-border provide, very similar to our Cambridge business. Super performance in '21. Pro forma revenue growing mid-teens. EBITDA up almost 50% versus prior year. Well along on integration, we've already combined the management teams into one group, and are about halfway through migrating the AFEX customers onto the Cambridge IT platform. So I hope to retire most of the AFEX IT system by year-end.  \n Last deal up is ALE. That's the lodging extension for the insurance vertical. It helps homeowner insurance place policyholders into hotels and temporary housing. So we closed at September 1 about 3.5 million incremental annual hotel rooms, will be added to our lodging business. Underway with the synergy work. And early view is about $0.20 accretive to 2022. So, so far, so good really across all 3 transactions this year.  \n All right. So lastly, let me share our view, early view of 2022, and speak a little bit to the beyond '22 prospects for the company. So for next year, encouraged by a few things. First, the run rate, we're exiting '21 with about $3 billion of annualized revenue and $14 of cash EPS. So nose of the plane is up. Sales again, running at record levels, which will drive incremental revenue into '22. We also expect sales to grow again next year about 20%.  \n Macro is on our side, helping us. Obviously, fuel prices are high. FX is generally holding, so setting up well there. And then I mentioned the acquisitions, particularly AFEX and ALE, together contributing probably about $0.50 of incremental accretion next year. So look, taken together, the early 2022 set up is quite good.  \n If we look just a little farther out into the midterm, we're kind of also encouraged there for a couple of reasons. So first, we've expanded, via our Beyond strategy, the market segments or the served market segments in each of our 5 major lines of business. So that's laid out on, I think, Page 14 of the earnings supplement. So for example, in Corpay, our Corporate Payments business, we've added cloud-based AP solutions to our original virtual card business. So we did that a couple of years ago in the middle market with Nvoicepay, and then obviously, this year, in the SMB market with Roger. So look, much, much better positioned now to attack the Corporate Payments TAM.  \n And then again, if you look at our lodging business initially focused only on workforce or blue collar travelers going to economy hotels. Since we've added 2 new segments, the airline crew business and now the insurance policyholder business of the fold, that really triples the opportunity in terms of room nights for the lodging business.  \n A second thing is we're on a path, as I mentioned, to combine our card business with our payables business into a single platform, which would do two things: first, give us differentiation in the marketplace, where we can help clients pay all their nonpayroll expenses with us, both walk-around purchases and supplier payables from a single account; and second, could help us turn our fuel card business into a Corporate Payments business by cross-selling our bill pay services to our hundreds of thousands of fuel card clients. So as I mentioned, underway there. So look, the combination of expanding our served market segments in our existing 5 businesses along with this idea of joining up our cards and bill pay onto a single platform is encouraging for us.  \n So look, in closing, just a few final wrap-up thoughts. So again, a really good quarter, record revenue and profits for Q3, good trends, same-store sales up -- sales -- new sales up and retention steady, again, record sales and very attractive cost of acquisition of new accounts. 3 acquisitions on track against our thesis, and our early '22 set up attractive. So look, all-in-all, it feels like we're in a pretty good place.  \n So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter. Chuck? \nCharles Freund: Thanks, Ron. I'm delighted to share with you some more color on a very solid clean quarter. For Q3 of 2021, we reported revenue of $755 million, up 29%; GAAP net income of $234 million, up 24%; and GAAP net income per diluted share of $2.80, up 28%. Adjusted net income for the quarter, or ANI, increased 22% to $294 million or roughly $1.2 billion annualized. ANI per diluted share increased 25% to $3.52.  \n Organic revenue growth was 17%, driven by continued strong sales, solid retention levels and same-store sales recovery. Looking at organic growth across product categories. Corporate Payments was up 22% in the third quarter, highlighted by full AP, which grew over 50% again this quarter. Corpay One, our small business-focused full AP offering, grew 78%. So our full AP solutions continue to sell well in the market.  \n Cross-border revenue was up 19%, which showed some softness from the lockdowns down under in Australia. We do believe much of this softness is recoverable, but the timing is hard to predict. The AFEX integration is progressing quite well, and we've converted more than half of its customers onto our existing cross-border payment systems. We expect to convert the remaining customers before year-end. I'd like to thank our cross-border team as they've worked tirelessly to complete these customer migrations seamlessly, while simultaneously operating a growing, thriving business.  \n And within B2B, a lot of attention has been paid to new small entrants, several of which we enable with our partner program using our best-in-class virtual card. The partners we enable own the customer relationship, do the marketing and take the credit risk, so they keep most of the economics. We're more of a processor to them. So our take rate is meaningfully lower than when we go direct to customers, which is really where we tend to focus most of our sales and marketing efforts. So while these partners drive some volume growth, they still only represent about 13% of our Corporate Payments revenue.  \n Fuel was up organically 13% year-over-year, with strong retention trends and record digital sales continuing to drive the performance. We're seeing some softness in same-store sales as Australia, New Zealand and parts of Continental Europe are still grappling with COVID-related lockdowns, and over-the-road trucking is facing the driver supply shortage that's been all over the news. But despite these headwinds, our fuel businesses continued to grow in every geography as a result of our sales efforts and strong retention rates.  \n Tolls was up 14% compared with last year and showed impressive performance again this quarter, growing to above 6 million total tag holders, with 5 million consumer tags and 1 million business tags. Now just for context, the business had approximately 4.5 million total tag holders when we acquired it back in 2016.  \n Economic and business activity has returned to relatively normal levels in Brazil, which has increased customer mobility and sales traffic through retail and toll locations, helping us to achieve record Q3 sales. Lodging was particularly strong, up 40%, with airline lodging up 61% on the back of the recovery in domestic air travel. We hope to see more recovery in international airline lodging as borders reopen. Gift organic growth was 25% year-over-year, benefiting from continued retailer embrace of the online sales channel.  \n Now looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses were up 30% to $417 million and were 55% of revenue, stable with last year. The increase was primarily due to higher levels of business activity, the effect of currency translation impact on international expenses and acquisitions. Interest expense decreased 7% to $29 million, primarily due to higher interest income earned on cash balances and lower LIBOR rates more than offsetting higher debt and securitization balances.  \n As Ron mentioned, our effective tax rate for the third quarter was higher than expected, coming in at 24.1%. This was due to fewer stock option exercises during the quarter likely due to the low share price, which resulted in minimal excess tax benefits. We currently expect our tax rate in Q4 to be back within our full year guidance range.  \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of unrestricted cash, and we also had approximately $650 million of undrawn availability on our revolver. In total, we had $4.6 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $1.1 billion borrowed on our securitization facility. As of September 30, our leverage ratio was 2.76x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  \n We used $406 million to repurchase approximately 1.6 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $260 per share. We still have $1.18 billion of share buyback capacity in our program. So far this year, we've bought back 3.1 million shares and we've closed 3 deals, putting $1.7 billion of capital to work. On top of that, we still have low leverage and ample liquidity for additional deals and/or buybacks, clearly demonstrating the earnings power and attractiveness of our high-margin, high-cash flow business.  \n Looking ahead, I would note that you can see our full updated guidance and assumptions in both our press release and supplement. But before we open it up for questions, I would like to inform you that at the most recent Board meeting, FLEETCOR adopted the Rooney Rule for all future Board positions. I would also like to mention that we expect to publish our latest ESG report to our Investor Relations website within the next few weeks, and we'd be happy to take your feedback on our ESG efforts after you've had a chance to review that report.  \n With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\n Our first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. \nDarrin Peller: Look, it's great to see the macro recovery and you guys benefiting there as well as the initiatives you've made, especially on the Corpay side. And I just want to hone in on that segment, primarily, given all the acquisitions and the rebranding and the efforts on sales focused on really software now. So can you just touch on that in terms of what the different assets are going to contribute where you saw the opportunity for growth most profound in the next few quarters? \n And then maybe just quickly, I saw in the quarter, we're hoping for a little more acceleration now, but I think some of this may just be coming over time as the sales free navigates its focus. But can you just touch on the current trends? I think it decelerated on a 2-year stack a little bit, but what it could be going forward? \nRonald F. Clarke: Darrin, it's Ron here. We're pretty happy with it. I'd say, the sales continued to remain quite good in the corporate pay segment. And of the 3 areas, our direct business where we go to end clients and our FX business, cross-border business, super good growth in Q3. I think one was the direct business, was 30%. I think it's in the earnings supplement, and the cross-border, I think, high teens [ 19 ]  all the while we're digesting that AFEX acquisitions are pretty busy on that. So I think those two pieces are of the business. And so they're growing good. The sales are good. To your point, if we get any COVID recovery, there's still some fair amount to get back next year. We're -- I think we're bullish. I think our early view, again, is high teens for that segment for '22. \nDarrin Peller: Okay. That's really helpful. And I mean, just Ron, this is -- should we think about it being much more of a software-focused approach going forward in terms of sales versus more pure-play virtual card, I guess, more rolling together all the assets? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. So that's a great question. Yes, we started that. I think a couple of years ago, we bought kind of the full AP software front-end and plug it into our back-end execution stuff. And so we've moved the mix, Darrin, dramatically here in 2021. So we're selling, I don't know, I think almost [indiscernible] what we call full AP where we take 100% of the clients' payables versus virtual card. But obviously, the great news is it's still all virtual guard, right?  \n When we sell that, full AP, underneath that, basically is the same engine to your point, the same merchant database, the same ability to earn interchange, if you will, on that portion. So it sells better. We think it has more value to the client. We generally retain more of the economics there and yet we still have a bunch of virtual cards. So you'll see more of that. I think we'll probably move even more of the business as you roll forward that way. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist. \nAndrew Jeffrey: Ron, the commentary on the digital go-to-market, I think, is particularly intriguing. Can you talk a little bit about what the LTV to CAC looks like in your fuel business? I think you said 50% of the sales are going through digital channels. And how we might expect that to inform your consolidated profitability over time? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I think the call out, Andrew, was for our whole global -- our entire sales for Q3, we run around 65%, okay? So some businesses are better than that. Obviously, some are worse, and same with channels. So it's referencing that the digital channel, which is growing as a percent, is lower than that 65% line average. So the good news is as the mix of our total sales moves more and more to digital, that should improve basically our cost of acquisition. And so, obviously, we're delighted that more and more of the business is moving there.  \n And then second thing I'd say about that is things that are less dependent on people, right, hiring, training and retaining lots of people, slows company's ability right to staff and grow that way. So on the digital side, we're getting pretty good at increasing digital advertising spend now and seeing the payback in terms of visitors and flow through to conversions. So that's something that we can step on a bit faster and get returns faster. So I'd say this whole shift basically to digital sets up super well.  \n As it relates to the corporate pay economics long term, I think you're right. I mean, I think the big, big idea we have is we've got this giant fuel card client base. I don't know, 500,000, I think, or more active clients. And they generally are small, right? We get a couple thousand in revenues. We don't get a lot from them. So the idea of being able to go to that group and cross-sell them something else that has the same or more value, obviously, could accelerate revenue growth, but to your point, it's a way lower cost of acquisition than prospecting for new business, like going back to all the UIs and all the ways that we talk to our existing clients. So now when I say it's super early, we just started, but that would have an opportunity one, to make our fuel card business and the synergy, the assets of 20 years of building that payout. And then second, drive again the cost of acquisition down if that cross-sell component becomes big. \nCharles Freund: Andrew, I can clarify this. This is Charles. I'd just like to clarify Ron's comment regarding 65% in terms of an acquisition cost. We define that as what we call NSC or net sales expense. It's basically cost of acquisition divided by the annual revenue from that client for prospect. So if I -- if someone is going to generate 1,000 on revenue for me annually and cost me $650 to acquire that account, that's the 65% metric that we use internally. \nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. And how does that compare to the traditional sales channels? \nCharles Freund: I'd say that we've been fairly stable through time. Some of it does shift as you have more field-based selling. But in the main, we've been around 50%, 60% for years. \nRonald F. Clarke: And, Andrew, I love with the spotlight on it because lots of other people spend lots of money. They generate some sales, but you can't ever make a return, right? So if you sell $100 million and spend $65 million, you're underwater on the first year. But then you've got, call it, $90 million of the $100 million you sold the second year with 80% flow through, you got $80 million flowing through for 8 more years with no sales expense. So that's the key to profitability in our kind of business is basically this acquisition cost and the retention rate. So we call it out because that's how the business actually makes money. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen with Citi. \nPeter Christiansen: Nice results. Just wanted to dig a little bit into the lodging business this quarter. I know there was a bunch of natural disasters in the last couple of months, wildfires, Ida, so on and so forth. Just wondering, to what degree that was a contribution factor to some of the outsized growth in lodging? How should we think about the ALE business during periods of natural disasters? How does that business, I guess, from a revenue perspective, how should we think about it ranging in these types of periods? \nRonald F. Clarke: Pete, thanks for the question. It's Ron. So in the first part of the question, hey, how did bad weather and stuff help the lodging business some is Q3? Some is the answer. So we picked up some decent amount of incremental volume when that happens kind of almost unexpected volume, but the rate on that is like super-duper low. We sign up with contracts with people like FEMA and stuff. And so lots of volume and a little bit of revenue contribution.  \n On the ALE side, I'd say, it helps again a little bit. The diligence that we did in that business is surprisingly over incredibly long cycle. I don't know, 90% plus, I guess, over the 5 or 10 years we looked at is not hurricane or natural disaster-related. It's your pipe ranks and your house floods, and you left the candle on of the bathroom and the house burned down. And so it's what we think of as just way more common kind of every day, which is why we went ahead with the business. It's just way more ratably, you take all the hundreds of millions of homes or apartments. Stuff goes wrong, with them that displaces people. And so that business, obviously, it's insurance, so the statistics on it are pretty good. So I'd say for both businesses, it helps really just at the margin. \nPeter Christiansen: That's helpful. And then your comments on the fuel card business seeing a little bit of incremental softness, which is understandable what's going on abroad in some areas. But I was just wondering if you could characterize the competitive market perhaps for larger fleet type deals and how that's kind of evolving, I guess, as we come out of COVID. Are you seeing competition intensify? Or are there big opportunities ahead? Do you think -- just wondering if you could put a frame on that. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I'd say probably if anything, it's lessened during COVID. I mean I think we've called out for at least a few quarters now the overall fuel card retention rate, which is up. I think it's up -- I don't have it in front of me, but it's certainly up dramatically in the last couple of years versus where it was a couple of years ago. And I think I called out that it remained at 93% for the quarter. And so I would say, the COVID basically people shifted to other priorities, and doing RFPs for fuel cards probably wasn't the top one.  \n So the other thing I'd say, because I think it's missed is, the real competition for us. We study wins and losses in fuel cards. So where do we get the 35,000 new accounts that came on board this quarter and where the 10,000 that we lost? And the answer is not our friends WEX. It's basically business cards and other forms of payment, both in business cards, for example. So that's -- so the real competition for us globally in the fuel card business is really other means of payment. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask about the new sales bookings growth, which was an impressive number. Was this the result of any kind of changes you've made in your approach in terms of the sales organization, or -- and also, could you help us think through, or maybe even remind us of the algorithm by which those bookings will eventually convert to revenue, maybe something about timing, or how that actually operates? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, Ramsey. So we agree. I tried to put a bit of a spotlight on it for the quarter because it's in record territory, right? There weren't 50,000 accounts when I started with the platform 20 years ago. So to sign up 50,000 new businesses in a quarter is good. And then second, against the '19 baseline, I think I called out our bookings dollars were up 30%. So forget the weak comp against the normal quarter. A couple of years ago, it's way up. So the headline is our company sales were way up, that's headline 1. \n And Part B is so why they weigh up? I think it's the location we made into digital, So start, I don't know, 4 or 5 years ago, we did a bunch of things to get way better at digital marketing and selling, obviously, not the least of which is the whole tech stack that we build to be able to follow businesses and everywhere they crawl around and then what they do to advertising, figuring out where to spend and who to target money against to get them to visit our sites to optimizing our sites to get conversion rates and sales at the bottom end to applications going end-to-end where someone could go on our site and literally order the program and get cards in a couple of days and not have to talk to people.  \n So the reengineering, I'd say, of the whole digital machinery has been, first of all, it was massive, but we're getting the returns of it now. It's obviously ramped way the heck up. And I think it's another huge step-up in our early plans for '22. So I would say that's the main, main driver, and we're doing that everywhere. We're just way smarter in how we target and how we study where prospects go and what they're looking at instead of trying to make up who we think might be interested in our products.  \n So on your second question on bookings, the answer to it is, let's say, we said, hey, we sold, pick a number, $100 million of new business in this core. To Chuck's point, what that means is as you roll forward and that all gets implemented, it's obviously an annualized amount of $100 million. It wouldn't be $100 million in this year, like we sold it throughout the year, it'd be $50 million, for example, in that case. And so we have very different timings.  \n In our Brazil business, we sell, and it's almost instamatic. In our fuel card business, we sell and we get it pretty soon. In our Corporate Payments business, which are bigger accounts, it takes longer. So our -- we basically know our sales, if you will, our new business for '22 because it's all sitting in our pipeline to be implemented. So the bookings number turns into an annualized revenue number, which is how we build our plans, and then the timing or what we call the in-year amount varies across the various businesses we have.  \n But the main thing I want to make sure people are clear is it's working. I don't want to get lost in the details here that the company, our company, is selling more of everything than it's ever sold before ever. \nRamsey El-Assal: Great. It sounds like it's not a fluke but by design, so encouraging. Ron, I wanted to ask you about your new compensation contract, which is structured in more of pay-for-performance kind of style. Can you talk about why you pivoted in that direction in terms of structuring your comp, and sort of what gives you confidence about hitting those sort of future hurdle rates? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, that's interesting question. I'd say basically that the first 10 years of the company's life was in a PE form with the alignment between investors and managers were super clear. If value gets created, the proceeds get split versus this kind of, \"Hey, I just give you money for showing up.\" And so it's in kind of the DNA. I like it. I like it, the people that put capital in alongside of me get returns, and I give returns. And if we don't, we don't. And obviously, there's more leverage than that. I've got, as you know, a lot of money. And so getting some money with our current tax structure is not super interesting. So it's a motivating way to keep me at the grindstone for a couple of years here to try to get the thing to a place.  \n And how do I feel about the confidence other than the way people rate our stock? I feel good. We have models that come off of the sales and retention math that we run all the time for your models, and I see what the revenue and cash EPS looks like running through our machine. And if it's valued fairly reasonably, it gets to those targets that are there. So I look at it and go -- if someone priced our earnings reasonably, I think we can make the targets and then I could get paid. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. \nMihir Bhatia: Maybe just to start, I just wanted to ask about the gift card business. Given all we're hearing about supply chain issues, could that be a tailwind in 4Q? Maybe a little bit of a unique opportunity there. Anything you're hearing if you could just talk about that? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, Mihir, it's Ron again. So yes, there are a bit on the card side and just the retailers ordering cycle. So I would say it looks kind of like it's going to come in on our plan, just talking to our gift head not long ago. But I'd say the upside for us is probably not so much that, that the card orders would go up. It's really -- finally, the guy running it, and we finally found a way to grow the business. So -- and how long we followed our company, but I've been trying to sell a business since I bought it. And all the guys turned it into a business now that we think that can compound a double digit. \n So the way they've done it is instead of just being an administrator, an accountant for the Macy's gift card and count them $100 down, they help our clients now sell online. So they've moved over to helping sell online digital gift cards because they know a lot about it. They're getting paid extra for wallet provisioning. Half the gift cards, there's breakage where people can't find them anymore. They're in a drawer. \n And so super technically hard to move private label cards into wallets, but our guys came up with a way to do it. So we get paid money from a number of the brands to basically provision those electronically. And then the guy came up with the idea of selling the content. We have, I don't know, 300 or 400 pretty good brands. So we're taking them back to businesses because we're in the B2B business. So they've built a bit of a revenue and sales stream now taking them for rewards like companies like ours, for example, for employees.  \n So these 2 or 3 new ideas on top of the kind of old chugging along kind of low single-digit business has propped that thing up now to being north of 10%. So -- and I went through the guys plan a couple of weeks ago. So I think finally have a set of ideas that are more sustainable to keep growing that business now. \nMihir Bhatia: All right. Great. And then If I could ask about the, just about Brazil. You mentioned things are getting back to normal there. You've obviously had very good momentum in selling more tags. So is there an argument there that you might see a little bit of an exponential step-function growth in the revenues per tag? Because those are still meaningfully below like where you were in 2019, and you've obviously added a lot of capabilities where you can use those tags too. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, that must be -- you're looking, I think, at the FX. So we're way the heck up. The sales there in constant currency in real are way, way up. I don't have it in front of me versus '19. Chuck is going to pull it out, but these should record levels. Whatever we sold in Q3 would have been an all-time record number of sales. And what I said about the recovery is Brazil is in a complete ditch COVID-wise in the spring and into the summer, and somehow has come out the other side. They are in a better price than we are here. \n So what that's done is it's opened the stores there where we sell a lot. We have kiosks and hundreds and hundreds of stores. So stores are open. People are walking. Mobility's back and more people are running through the tolls where we also sell. So the place is basically where we conduct business to try to make sales are kind of reactivated again, which is helping drive it.  \n And then second, I think we said before, we've come up with a number of super new partner or channel ideas there. The newest one is we've got a couple of the big car manufacturers to put the tags now on the vehicles. So when you go in and get your new Volkswagen and drive it out of the dealership there, you look up and there's a sticker already there with a little POS thing that says, \"Hey, call this number go to this website.\" We're getting like 50% or something conversion on adoption of these new vehicles rolling out of the dealership. So it's really -- I can't even tell you how good of a sales story that team has put together.  \n But the -- as you said, the big, big idea for us and we poured a lot of capital into it this year in '21 is to double or triple the fueling locations, and the fueling transactions are up huge over a year ago now as we take the 6 million vehicles. So we had tags and given more places to use the tags. So that is the one said to me, where could the free money and real acceleration come. It could come from this massive group of people basically just having more places to use the tag and the accounts already on their vehicle. \nMihir Bhatia: And you get paid per transaction, right? \nRonald F. Clarke: We get paid MDR pretty attractive MDR on the fueling in that example, yes. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: I wanted to talk about the partner channel Corporate Payments mix that Charles touched on. When we think about that 13%, 14%, is this a higher profitability contribution because your partners are sort of bearing the expense?  \n And then as we think about how that percentage is going to migrate over time, do you expect that to go up or down, or is there -- how long are those partners committed to? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. So it's Ron. Let me start with the second part. So we probably have, I don't know, 15 significant kinds of partners in that Corporate Payments group called top 3 or 4 most important, another 8 or 10. And so the contracts generally would run anywhere from probably 3 to 5 Years. We just renewed actually a couple of them with some of our most important partners this year.  \n In terms of what do I think I'd say down would be my answer. So if you look at -- I think we put, Jim, a slide in the earnings supplement. I think it's Page 15, Sanjay, but I think that's positive. Yes, it takes the 3 pieces of our Corporate Payments business, the partner thing that we're talking about and then the direct business where we go to the end client and then the cross-border business where we mostly go to the end client. So you can see that those two are growing revenue much faster. And so the mix itself, if you just run the clock forward would make the partner piece smaller, I think, going forward.  \n So obviously, there's lot of spend there and spend grows fast. But to your point, they do more of the work. So obviously, our rates are much, much lower there than in the direct business. So we like the business, but obviously, 90% of our Corporate Payments business is in the directed cross-border. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. I guess, obviously, the chatter out there is you have a lot of these fintechs that are competing against you and with you. And I'm just curious, as we think about FLEETCOR's competitive edge, I know, Ron, you talked about how you're putting the acquisitions together to deliver a powerful punch. But I mean do you feel like there's -- the competitive intensity has increased in that market and your -- or that you widened your moat in that market? I'm just curious to just get a little bit more color on that because that's obviously been a hot topic of discussion. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, I think it's a super good question. I think obviously, there's more people trying to get into entire processing, whether it's virtual or just traditional physical cards. So I think, first off, that a lot of the players that get into are issue for issuing kinds of companies that are in that business, right, for FIs and for us, but yes, some of them are coming into our area.  \n What I'd say back is fallacy is somehow that the game is tech and product to the X, Y, Z fintech has some great thing not old fashion FLEETCOR out of it. And what I'd say to you is what they're missing is it's the merchant network, you can't monetize virtual cards if you don't have a virtual card merchant network that can process and capture those transactions you can profit until the day goes on, but you have to have the network. So we've had a, call it, I don't know, a 10-year head start on everybody in cleansing, building, growing that network.  \n And then the second one is the whole service dimension of a huge pay for you group, a massive group that helps the partners clean up the data and get the stuff processed. So I'd say those would be the couple of components that people missed that this isn't just making a new processing engine in the garage and giving it to AWS, and that's all going to be great. There's actual real assets that we have that cause our partners to stay with us. I mean, there was a big thing. Some came into my office a year, 2 of your clients, Build.com and AVIDA brought on other providers. We're doing great with them. We've renewed the contract for a number of years with one of them. We're getting more business than ever from another. We're obviously we have a great relationship.  \n Some of those are targeted like the Marqeta thing, as an example, is targeted to FIs, which we're not even in. We're not in the processing business to help FIs. We thought they wouldn't use their own processes and stuff. And so I think like everything else, it's someone searching for some narrative that is in there. We've got a good business. It's growing. The spend is growing like crazy. But because we make so much more money on the direct businesses and a growing fast, that mix will cause the partner thing to be a bit smaller.  \n But I think we're still -- I'd tell you, go call our partners. Don't ask me the supplier. Go ask our partners that they like the job we're doing. I look at the performance reports. I send performance reviews with the partners, myself personally. So from my vantage point, we're doing quite well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Suchoski with Autonomous. \nKenneth Suchoski: I just wanted to dig into the fuel card business a little bit more. I mean, it looks like transactions came weaker than we were expecting, and I think you called out international and the driver shortage. But can you provide some detail there on where you're seeing that weakness on the transaction side? And what's your expectation around the recovery? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, Ken, it's Ron. So yes, I'd say, there's good news and bad news. The good news is -- the bad news is, a, the transactions are a little weaker than we thought. The good news is they're not worth much.  \n So the two areas of weakness are in trucking, again, a particularly large trucking both here and in Europe. And you guys have read the press on this that the large trucking firms just don't have drivers. And not only are they not drivers, they're quitting and forming and going into smaller firms now. So our big accounts are effectively just soft in terms of trucks and transactions, but they're happy because they're just raising their rates.  \n And then the second one I'd say is really Europe and the big corporates, they are the white collar book of business where people haven't gone back to work in Europe. And I don't know if you guys know it's been in Europe, lots of people of company cars. So people like us have a car and we used to drive around and get reimbursed. So those are the two areas that are weak.  \n The good news is we don't get paid anything for those things. We don't get paid very much. So that's why our revenue growth is still pretty good. The local business, for example, in our partner business are super healthy, and even a big part of our U.K. business, which I'm looking at, had strong same-store sales recovery. So the areas where we get paid and we get revenue are actually pretty healthy. \nKenneth Suchoski: Got it. That's really helpful. And maybe just my -- for my follow-up, I think on last quarter's call, you've provided some preliminary thoughts on '22. I think you talked about $14 in annualized EPS in the second half of this year. You have some interest rate hedges rolling off and then the contribution from AFEX and ALE. So lots of moving parts, but maybe you can frame for us how you're thinking about 2022. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, that's it's a good question. So the way, I mean, I say this all the time, if you like businesses, you can plan, you should like our business, it's the nature of the model. And so what we do is we -- which we're about halfway through, we build things off of run rate. So we're staring here at October volumes and revenues in all of our businesses. And I think what I said is, hey, when you post $3.52 or $3.50, we multiply it and we go, okay, that sounds like $14, and we guided to a number we don't have in front of me, Chuck, that's $3.50-something for Q4 is a track stuff. So there's another one. \n So hey, we start with the company is running earning $14 on an annualized basis now. Then we sit there and say, \"Okay, we had sales record levels this year, of which, call it, 2/3 of that will be realized in 2022 so we can see what that number is.\" Then we have a bigger sales plan for 2022, probably 20% higher, and we look at what's in here there. I'm like, \"hey, that looks good\".  \n And then we look at the deals that I mentioned that are kind of on top of that, which I think I called out together, call it, $0.50 would be kind of my commitment on the stuff that we use capital for. So that's how we build the math. We take the run rate, we take this year, next year sales. We take added things like the accretion of deals, and that helps us basically target a number that we can get to. And we haven't planned a heck of a lot of COVID recovery. Obviously, it's -- we're just obviously 12 months this year. And so we've been pretty conservative so far and getting some of that back. We still have probably $100 million, $150 million that could literally come back a different day potentially. And so those are the components.  \n And what I was trying to say -- and the other one is the macro. Obviously, fuel prices are higher here in November than they were in January and seem to be holding. And so when you roll all that up, my message is it looks super early, but it looks like a really good number. And the reason I go through all that math is to get people longer than us who are in the company some insight into how they ought to think about it. Things could happen, but the company is pretty well positioned to put up an attractive growth number for next year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. \nDavid Togut: In the Corporate Payments business, WEX reported a pretty substantial compression in revenue yield in the third quarter year-over-year. Can you comment on the revenue yield you're seeing in that business? And, a, is there any significant change? And are there any call-outs in verticals, i.e., kind of travel versus nontravel? \nRonald F. Clarke: David, it's Ron. It's a good question. So I'd go back to the slide that Jim put in our earnings supplement. I think it's Page 15. So again, sitting inside, our Corporate Payments business, I think we report, what, 22% organic growth and, what, 50% or something, [ friends ], for the quarter? \nCharles Freund: 68%, I think. \nRonald F. Clarke: 68%. So obviously, that's the overall number, David. But the pieces of that, again, are the direct or end-client business, the cross-border business and then this channel partner business. And so for us, the good news is the 2 big pieces, which are about 90% I'm looking at the thing are effectively flat. So because we price it, there's really no rate erosion in that out of our business. And so all of the rate erosion is really just in the mix of partners where we have tax table rates, and we have some partners that are growing like crazy. So as their volumes go up, they enjoy a bit better rates, right, in the base than the base rates. \n And so because we don't have the same kind of reliance, if you will, on the channel business, I think we're a bit more insulated, if you will, from rate compression there. And I mentioned it earlier, I'd say the super positive thing is our mix of that business is going to more full AP. And don't forget, we bought an SMB company that has higher rates. So as we roll in the full AP, the Nvoicepay mix and this Corpay One mix, those have a way higher rate than the existing businesses. So my guess is just kicking out the channel business, I see actually rate expansion over the next couple of years in that business mostly help from mix. \nDavid Togut: Understood. That's very clear. Just as a quick follow-up. You commented earlier about the difficulty of finding drivers in this environment. Could you quantify for us what this means for your fuel card business in terms of revenue growth in 2022? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, I think the driver thing is a total trucking vertical, issue, David. I don't think it's -- we don't see it obviously as significantly in the trade businesses, right? Those people have to be trained and whatever they are. So we don't see the same kind of softness, if you will, of our existing customers in those kinds of businesses. And so -- and again, we see it mostly in the large account trucking business. be the other thing, which we don't make any money in either. \n So I'd say that who knows? My guess is it's not a super easy fix for suddenly large trucking people to get the people, although you see the pictures of the at the ports of the need for more trucking. So my guess is there'll be more incentives and pressure to try to get more people into the space over the next 6 to 12 months. But I'd say it doesn't do much to us. One, it's limited only to that trucking vertical. Two, it's limited to the big firms, which don't pay as much. And, And three, honestly, it's kind of in our run rate. The softness has really been the year for the last couple of quarters. \n And so I don't see it really getting any worse, mostly because of what I said that I think there's going to be such a push to try to add people. And I think the rates are going to keep going up to attract people. So I'd say it's probably not a super duper impact on our forward thinking for the few of our business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. \nGeorgios Mihalos: Ron, you talked a lot about some of the, I guess, hiring and wage pressures that are impacting the fuel side of the business. I'm just curious, as it relates to the Corporate Payments business, do you feel like that's been impacted at all by any supply chain issues at your customers, or has that come up at all your conversations with them? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, for sure. I mean, again, George, I'd say it's pocketed. When we go look, we have bigger customers there. And so some have come through this thing kind of unscathed and then others have had a big problem. So yes, we have a select group of clients that are kind of down and have stayed down. And I think the supply chain is a big part of it. \nGeorgios Mihalos: Okay. That's helpful. I'm just curious to the extent, are you able to quantify that in any sort of capacity or give any sort of color around that? \n And then maybe separately for a follow-up, the minimal credit losses that you're continuing to see, is that just a harbinger of just cleaner credit now, or do you feel that there is an opportunity to loosen credit standards even from here? Just curious how you're thinking about that. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. So let me take the first part, yes. We are one of the easiest things to quantify for us is to look at clients we have, let's say, clients 1 through 100 and look at their volumes and revenue in a prior period, let's say, 2019 or Q3 of 2019. And then, let's say, we still have those 100 clients to go look at their volume and revenue with us in Q3 of this year. So that's the stat we call same-store sales or the core client base. \n So yes, we -- for Corporate Payments or every business, we turn that into a revenue number and say, okay, we're some, whatever, $20 million with clients that used to give us $20 million more 2 quarters ago than they do now. And hey, we watch them to see whether some of that $20 million is coming back. So we have super clear visibility on the amount of it and the rate of recovery of it. Is that one clear? \nGeorgios Mihalos: Yes. Just curious, if you could sort of ballpark what that impact would be or if you're willing to ballpark what that impact would have been how much faster the growth would have been in the segment? \nRonald F. Clarke: You want to say, Chuck, anything about that? \nCharles Freund: Yes, I think we look at those pocketed groups. So in Corporate Payments, the top 75 we last looked at it last month, the 75 most affected clients, their volume was still down about half of where it was back in January 2020. And so we looked at it just last month. So we continue to track it. But as Ron mentioned, it's highly pocketed in certain categories that just haven't quite reopened yet. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. It's about -- just to give you a percentage, it's about, I'd say 3% this quarter versus our plan. So hey, we guesstimated those 100 people would come back a certain way in Q3 from 2 years ago, and they came part of the way back. They come back to where we thought we'd at. That's 3 points more of growth in the things. So it's still a significant thing. And we'd be hopeful maybe we get it back and be kind of ready to get back a different day. \n On your second question, the credit question, I'd say yes, yes and yes. It's a super good question. It's record lifetime lows of credit losses, first of all, because we didn't sell much new business, obviously, in 2020. So there wasn't a lot of new business coming on. And then between the stimulus and relief and everything else, people repaid us and stuff. \n And so for sure, we've opened it up. I think Chuck said in the last call last time that we expect those losses to tick up. You can see it a bit in the roll rates, right, as we've onboarded a lot more business this year. Our Q4 losses will be a bit higher. \n And we're actually doing that juggling question now for 2022. Okay, how much do we -- how open do we want to be in credit both with existing accounts in terms of credit lines? I mean think of this, I've got fuel cards to have some credit line and the credit line is enough to pay their fuel card bills. What do they tell me they want to pay all my bill -- the bills with payment. And I said, okay, I lease with our credit. \n I mean our opportunity to increase credit to creditworthy people for our new products is like super high. And so I'd say we, for sure, will rebalance next year towards taking more risk certainly than this year and try to make that trade-off, right, between incremental sales and revenue growth and incremental losses. But we'll be careful. I want to make sure everyone on the call is clear, we're not crazy. We'll step our way in. We'll study our way in, but we will do more of it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. \nRobert Napoli: So Ron, I mean, there's been a lot of questions asked and -- but just -- what business -- or what are you most excited about over the next few years? Which part of -- parts of your business do you see the most opportunity to maybe outperform, drive upside drive growth? \nRonald F. Clarke: Bob, it's a great question. I'd say the most -- to me, the most exciting thing, which is coming mostly from the world out there is this synergy, this platform concept of bringing walk-around plastic, which is the business we've mostly been in with payable together. And so it's a way of trading, in our case, a massive synergy in these businesses we've built over 20 years of getting just way more out of them. \n So I gave the example earlier, we're launching late this month or the beginning of December, the thing we call the 2-in-1, where a client that has a business card of ours or a fuel card could also pay bills with us, and literally, it would just be in one place. He could use our card and our credit to pay some of his bills. Obviously, we'd have access that it was bank account to fund the bills. His report would show all his walk-around purchases like it does now and will show all his payables, the vendors, the way it is now, and it would all be in one place. \n And so that has the opportunity in joining up businesses that we have. That's what creates profit acceleration, right, where you don't have to go fish one at a time, right, for each new client, you can go back to this pretty gigantic customer base that we built and basically start to join it up and cross up that's useful to them. And the tech that we have now makes it look -- when you look at it, it's just stitched together now. \n So I'd say, that's the -- again, I try to say the thing, I'm also excited, I know people, doubt me -- doubt us, but we got a lot of legs in the businesses we have on that page. We pitch this beyond thing, and we've added segments everywhere in all the businesses which are adding growth. So I'm obviously super happy about that. But this integration and joining up in synergy where the new guys that have some nice new shiny product, they don't have a 20-year customer base and spend, and they don't get 50,000. So I mean, most of all year, your guys had signed 50,000 clients in the quarter. So that's the super exciting thing is can we monetize this bigger business profitably, would be what I'd say is the super new opportunity for us. \nRobert Napoli: Great. And Charles, just how are you feeling, looking at margins, the ability to expand margins from here over the next few years? \nCharles Freund: Yes, Bob, I'd say that our model tends to be one where we try to grow top line 10-plus percent and get a little bit of expansion. I think that is a mindset we've had for a long time, and we'll continue on that path. So I'd say we'll increment our way kind of as we go. \n With that said, we do make a little room for select investments, whether it's the digital sales that Ron mentioned. When we have opportunities to invest, we will make those investments. but always with a mindset that we'll continue to grow the bottom line a little bit faster than the top. \nOperator: At this time, we have reached the end of our allotted time for the call. Thank you, everybody, for joining today's conference. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Charles Freund",
            "content": "Thanks, Ron. I'm delighted to share with you some more color on a very solid clean quarter. For Q3 of 2021, we reported revenue of $755 million, up 29%; GAAP net income of $234 million, up 24%; and GAAP net income per diluted share of $2.80, up 28%. Adjusted net income for the quarter, or ANI, increased 22% to $294 million or roughly $1.2 billion annualized. ANI per diluted share increased 25% to $3.52.  \n Organic revenue growth was 17%, driven by continued strong sales, solid retention levels and same-store sales recovery. Looking at organic growth across product categories. Corporate Payments was up 22% in the third quarter, highlighted by full AP, which grew over 50% again this quarter. Corpay One, our small business-focused full AP offering, grew 78%. So our full AP solutions continue to sell well in the market.  \n Cross-border revenue was up 19%, which showed some softness from the lockdowns down under in Australia. We do believe much of this softness is recoverable, but the timing is hard to predict. The AFEX integration is progressing quite well, and we've converted more than half of its customers onto our existing cross-border payment systems. We expect to convert the remaining customers before year-end. I'd like to thank our cross-border team as they've worked tirelessly to complete these customer migrations seamlessly, while simultaneously operating a growing, thriving business.  \n And within B2B, a lot of attention has been paid to new small entrants, several of which we enable with our partner program using our best-in-class virtual card. The partners we enable own the customer relationship, do the marketing and take the credit risk, so they keep most of the economics. We're more of a processor to them. So our take rate is meaningfully lower than when we go direct to customers, which is really where we tend to focus most of our sales and marketing efforts. So while these partners drive some volume growth, they still only represent about 13% of our Corporate Payments revenue.  \n Fuel was up organically 13% year-over-year, with strong retention trends and record digital sales continuing to drive the performance. We're seeing some softness in same-store sales as Australia, New Zealand and parts of Continental Europe are still grappling with COVID-related lockdowns, and over-the-road trucking is facing the driver supply shortage that's been all over the news. But despite these headwinds, our fuel businesses continued to grow in every geography as a result of our sales efforts and strong retention rates.  \n Tolls was up 14% compared with last year and showed impressive performance again this quarter, growing to above 6 million total tag holders, with 5 million consumer tags and 1 million business tags. Now just for context, the business had approximately 4.5 million total tag holders when we acquired it back in 2016.  \n Economic and business activity has returned to relatively normal levels in Brazil, which has increased customer mobility and sales traffic through retail and toll locations, helping us to achieve record Q3 sales. Lodging was particularly strong, up 40%, with airline lodging up 61% on the back of the recovery in domestic air travel. We hope to see more recovery in international airline lodging as borders reopen. Gift organic growth was 25% year-over-year, benefiting from continued retailer embrace of the online sales channel.  \n Now looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses were up 30% to $417 million and were 55% of revenue, stable with last year. The increase was primarily due to higher levels of business activity, the effect of currency translation impact on international expenses and acquisitions. Interest expense decreased 7% to $29 million, primarily due to higher interest income earned on cash balances and lower LIBOR rates more than offsetting higher debt and securitization balances.  \n As Ron mentioned, our effective tax rate for the third quarter was higher than expected, coming in at 24.1%. This was due to fewer stock option exercises during the quarter likely due to the low share price, which resulted in minimal excess tax benefits. We currently expect our tax rate in Q4 to be back within our full year guidance range.  \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of unrestricted cash, and we also had approximately $650 million of undrawn availability on our revolver. In total, we had $4.6 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $1.1 billion borrowed on our securitization facility. As of September 30, our leverage ratio was 2.76x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  \n We used $406 million to repurchase approximately 1.6 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $260 per share. We still have $1.18 billion of share buyback capacity in our program. So far this year, we've bought back 3.1 million shares and we've closed 3 deals, putting $1.7 billion of capital to work. On top of that, we still have low leverage and ample liquidity for additional deals and/or buybacks, clearly demonstrating the earnings power and attractiveness of our high-margin, high-cash flow business.  \n Looking ahead, I would note that you can see our full updated guidance and assumptions in both our press release and supplement. But before we open it up for questions, I would like to inform you that at the most recent Board meeting, FLEETCOR adopted the Rooney Rule for all future Board positions. I would also like to mention that we expect to publish our latest ESG report to our Investor Relations website within the next few weeks, and we'd be happy to take your feedback on our ESG efforts after you've had a chance to review that report.  \n With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. Andrew, I can clarify this. This is Charles. I'd just like to clarify Ron's comment regarding 65% in terms of an acquisition cost. We define that as what we call NSC or net sales expense. It's basically cost of acquisition divided by the annual revenue from that client for prospect. So if I -- if someone is going to generate 1,000 on revenue for me annually and cost me $650 to acquire that account, that's the 65% metric that we use internally. I'd say that we've been fairly stable through time. Some of it does shift as you have more field-based selling. But in the main, we've been around 50%, 60% for years. 68%, I think. Yes, I think we look at those pocketed groups. So in Corporate Payments, the top 75 we last looked at it last month, the 75 most affected clients, their volume was still down about half of where it was back in January 2020. And so we looked at it just last month. So we continue to track it. But as Ron mentioned, it's highly pocketed in certain categories that just haven't quite reopened yet. Yes, Bob, I'd say that our model tends to be one where we try to grow top line 10-plus percent and get a little bit of expansion. I think that is a mindset we've had for a long time, and we'll continue on that path. So I'd say we'll increment our way kind of as we go. \n With that said, we do make a little room for select investments, whether it's the digital sales that Ron mentioned. When we have opportunities to invest, we will make those investments. but always with a mindset that we'll continue to grow the bottom line a little bit faster than the top."

            "name": "Ronald F. Clarke",
            "content": "Okay, Jim, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q3 earnings call. So up-front here, I'd like to run through 4 subjects: first, I'll give you my take on our Q3 results  along with the rest of your outlook; second, take you into a bit deeper dive into our sales results; third, give you an update on the 3 acquisitions that we've completed year-to-date; and then lastly, an early preview of 2022 and beyond.  \n All right. So let me make the turn to our Q3 results. We reported Q3 revenue of $755 million, up 29% and cash EPS of $3.52, up 25%, so both of those all-time record highs for the company. Also, the Q3 results annualized, finally above $3 billion, so past the $3 billion mark in revenue and $14 in cash EPS. Organic revenue for the quarter, up 17%. And inside of that, Corporate Payments business grew 22% organically.  \n The trends in Q3 are quite good. Sales finishing at record levels, up over 50% versus Q3 last year and over 30% against the baseline of Q3 '19. Retention, steady as she goes at 93% for the quarter. And again, our global fuel card business inside of that also coming at 93%. Same-store sales strengthened plus 5% for the quarter, which further adds to the same-store sales rebound we saw in Q2. Credit losses low again at 3 basis points, continuing to run below historic levels. You may notice our tax rate kind of 4 points higher than last year. That did shave about $0.20 off the $3.52 that we reported for the quarter. So look, overall, kind of pretty pleased with the quarter.  \n So in terms of rest of the year, we're raising guidance today. So revenue guidance at the midpoint now, $2.795 billion, that's up $30 million from August. Cash EPS at the midpoint to $13.05, that's up $0.15 from August. This raise versus last time reflects, obviously, these Q3 results are beat the ALE acquisition, which closed September 1 and a bit more favorable fuel prices, all of those offset just a bit by slower-than-planned COVID recovery. If you look at the Q4 on its own, it anticipates revenue and profit growth up about 20% versus Q4 last year and about 10% against Q4 2019.  \n All right. Let me make the transition into a bit deeper dive into our sales results. So as I mentioned, new sales or bookings reached record levels in the quarter and are up sequentially, significantly and up dramatically over the prior periods. So as I'm sure you're aware, sales reflect the market demand for our solutions but are also really the best leading indicator of future prospects. And so crazy record this quarter. We signed up almost 50,000 new business clients globally in Q3. So 50,000 new accounts joined the fold, so a record.  \n Over 50% of all of our global fuel card sales now come to us through our digital channels. So great because it's very low cost. We continue to increase our digital advertising spend, and we're enjoying record levels of prospects visiting our websites. Interest in EV solutions increasing, so a number of large accounts signing on to our EV solution. So that included Hertz, Volkswagen USA, Union Pacific, LeasePlan Europe and Siemens.  \n Brazil toll sales rocked in the quarter. Our urban sales or kind of the city dwellers that are lower frequency toll users represented 23% of all new sales in the quarter. So programs, whatever, 2 or 3 years old now, almost a quarter. And the active tags for the quarter reached a new milestone, 6 million, so 6 million active paying tags now in Brazil. We are planning to launch our new bank JV this month with the largest bank in Brazil, who will be helping to promote our products.  \n We don't talk about it much, but our customer acquisition cost is really quite attractive, runs about 65% of the sales new revenue, so really super important for profitable growth. So let me shift gears and talk a little bit about the 3 acquisitions that we've closed year-to-date and how they're doing. So Roger, first up. We've now rebranded Roger to be Corpay One, which is our entry into the Corporate Payments SMB space. So we're underway now adding new SMB bill pay clients through digital channels and accounting channels, and have some early returns on cross-selling bill pay into our fuel card base. So super early, but it looks like about 10% of our fuel card clients that pay their bills with our new Corpay One platform are choosing to pay a second non-fleet Cor bill with us, so effectively becoming bill pay customers.  \n We're looking at somewhere around 10,000 to 20,000 SMB bill pay clients coming online in 2022. And also interesting, we plan to launch what we call our 2-in-1 solution before year-end that will combine our smart business cards with our bill pay platform into one interface. So an SMB client could potentially pay all of their nonpayroll expenses with us on a single platform.  \n Second deal this year, AFEX, which is a cross-border provide, very similar to our Cambridge business. Super performance in '21. Pro forma revenue growing mid-teens. EBITDA up almost 50% versus prior year. Well along on integration, we've already combined the management teams into one group, and are about halfway through migrating the AFEX customers onto the Cambridge IT platform. So I hope to retire most of the AFEX IT system by year-end.  \n Last deal up is ALE. That's the lodging extension for the insurance vertical. It helps homeowner insurance place policyholders into hotels and temporary housing. So we closed at September 1 about 3.5 million incremental annual hotel rooms, will be added to our lodging business. Underway with the synergy work. And early view is about $0.20 accretive to 2022. So, so far, so good really across all 3 transactions this year.  \n All right. So lastly, let me share our view, early view of 2022, and speak a little bit to the beyond '22 prospects for the company. So for next year, encouraged by a few things. First, the run rate, we're exiting '21 with about $3 billion of annualized revenue and $14 of cash EPS. So nose of the plane is up. Sales again, running at record levels, which will drive incremental revenue into '22. We also expect sales to grow again next year about 20%.  \n Macro is on our side, helping us. Obviously, fuel prices are high. FX is generally holding, so setting up well there. And then I mentioned the acquisitions, particularly AFEX and ALE, together contributing probably about $0.50 of incremental accretion next year. So look, taken together, the early 2022 set up is quite good.  \n If we look just a little farther out into the midterm, we're kind of also encouraged there for a couple of reasons. So first, we've expanded, via our Beyond strategy, the market segments or the served market segments in each of our 5 major lines of business. So that's laid out on, I think, Page 14 of the earnings supplement. So for example, in Corpay, our Corporate Payments business, we've added cloud-based AP solutions to our original virtual card business. So we did that a couple of years ago in the middle market with Nvoicepay, and then obviously, this year, in the SMB market with Roger. So look, much, much better positioned now to attack the Corporate Payments TAM.  \n And then again, if you look at our lodging business initially focused only on workforce or blue collar travelers going to economy hotels. Since we've added 2 new segments, the airline crew business and now the insurance policyholder business of the fold, that really triples the opportunity in terms of room nights for the lodging business.  \n A second thing is we're on a path, as I mentioned, to combine our card business with our payables business into a single platform, which would do two things: first, give us differentiation in the marketplace, where we can help clients pay all their nonpayroll expenses with us, both walk-around purchases and supplier payables from a single account; and second, could help us turn our fuel card business into a Corporate Payments business by cross-selling our bill pay services to our hundreds of thousands of fuel card clients. So as I mentioned, underway there. So look, the combination of expanding our served market segments in our existing 5 businesses along with this idea of joining up our cards and bill pay onto a single platform is encouraging for us.  \n So look, in closing, just a few final wrap-up thoughts. So again, a really good quarter, record revenue and profits for Q3, good trends, same-store sales up -- sales -- new sales up and retention steady, again, record sales and very attractive cost of acquisition of new accounts. 3 acquisitions on track against our thesis, and our early '22 set up attractive. So look, all-in-all, it feels like we're in a pretty good place.  \n So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter. Chuck? Darrin, it's Ron here. We're pretty happy with it. I'd say, the sales continued to remain quite good in the corporate pay segment. And of the 3 areas, our direct business where we go to end clients and our FX business, cross-border business, super good growth in Q3. I think one was the direct business, was 30%. I think it's in the earnings supplement, and the cross-border, I think, high teens [ 19 ]  all the while we're digesting that AFEX acquisitions are pretty busy on that. So I think those two pieces are of the business. And so they're growing good. The sales are good. To your point, if we get any COVID recovery, there's still some fair amount to get back next year. We're -- I think we're bullish. I think our early view, again, is high teens for that segment for '22. Yes. So that's a great question. Yes, we started that. I think a couple of years ago, we bought kind of the full AP software front-end and plug it into our back-end execution stuff. And so we've moved the mix, Darrin, dramatically here in 2021. So we're selling, I don't know, I think almost [indiscernible] what we call full AP where we take 100% of the clients' payables versus virtual card. But obviously, the great news is it's still all virtual guard, right?  \n When we sell that, full AP, underneath that, basically is the same engine to your point, the same merchant database, the same ability to earn interchange, if you will, on that portion. So it sells better. We think it has more value to the client. We generally retain more of the economics there and yet we still have a bunch of virtual cards. So you'll see more of that. I think we'll probably move even more of the business as you roll forward that way. Yes. I think the call out, Andrew, was for our whole global -- our entire sales for Q3, we run around 65%, okay? So some businesses are better than that. Obviously, some are worse, and same with channels. So it's referencing that the digital channel, which is growing as a percent, is lower than that 65% line average. So the good news is as the mix of our total sales moves more and more to digital, that should improve basically our cost of acquisition. And so, obviously, we're delighted that more and more of the business is moving there.  \n And then second thing I'd say about that is things that are less dependent on people, right, hiring, training and retaining lots of people, slows company's ability right to staff and grow that way. So on the digital side, we're getting pretty good at increasing digital advertising spend now and seeing the payback in terms of visitors and flow through to conversions. So that's something that we can step on a bit faster and get returns faster. So I'd say this whole shift basically to digital sets up super well.  \n As it relates to the corporate pay economics long term, I think you're right. I mean, I think the big, big idea we have is we've got this giant fuel card client base. I don't know, 500,000, I think, or more active clients. And they generally are small, right? We get a couple thousand in revenues. We don't get a lot from them. So the idea of being able to go to that group and cross-sell them something else that has the same or more value, obviously, could accelerate revenue growth, but to your point, it's a way lower cost of acquisition than prospecting for new business, like going back to all the UIs and all the ways that we talk to our existing clients. So now when I say it's super early, we just started, but that would have an opportunity one, to make our fuel card business and the synergy, the assets of 20 years of building that payout. And then second, drive again the cost of acquisition down if that cross-sell component becomes big. And, Andrew, I love with the spotlight on it because lots of other people spend lots of money. They generate some sales, but you can't ever make a return, right? So if you sell $100 million and spend $65 million, you're underwater on the first year. But then you've got, call it, $90 million of the $100 million you sold the second year with 80% flow through, you got $80 million flowing through for 8 more years with no sales expense. So that's the key to profitability in our kind of business is basically this acquisition cost and the retention rate. So we call it out because that's how the business actually makes money. Pete, thanks for the question. It's Ron. So in the first part of the question, hey, how did bad weather and stuff help the lodging business some is Q3? Some is the answer. So we picked up some decent amount of incremental volume when that happens kind of almost unexpected volume, but the rate on that is like super-duper low. We sign up with contracts with people like FEMA and stuff. And so lots of volume and a little bit of revenue contribution.  \n On the ALE side, I'd say, it helps again a little bit. The diligence that we did in that business is surprisingly over incredibly long cycle. I don't know, 90% plus, I guess, over the 5 or 10 years we looked at is not hurricane or natural disaster-related. It's your pipe ranks and your house floods, and you left the candle on of the bathroom and the house burned down. And so it's what we think of as just way more common kind of every day, which is why we went ahead with the business. It's just way more ratably, you take all the hundreds of millions of homes or apartments. Stuff goes wrong, with them that displaces people. And so that business, obviously, it's insurance, so the statistics on it are pretty good. So I'd say for both businesses, it helps really just at the margin. Yes. I'd say probably if anything, it's lessened during COVID. I mean I think we've called out for at least a few quarters now the overall fuel card retention rate, which is up. I think it's up -- I don't have it in front of me, but it's certainly up dramatically in the last couple of years versus where it was a couple of years ago. And I think I called out that it remained at 93% for the quarter. And so I would say, the COVID basically people shifted to other priorities, and doing RFPs for fuel cards probably wasn't the top one.  \n So the other thing I'd say, because I think it's missed is, the real competition for us. We study wins and losses in fuel cards. So where do we get the 35,000 new accounts that came on board this quarter and where the 10,000 that we lost? And the answer is not our friends WEX. It's basically business cards and other forms of payment, both in business cards, for example. So that's -- so the real competition for us globally in the fuel card business is really other means of payment. Yes, Ramsey. So we agree. I tried to put a bit of a spotlight on it for the quarter because it's in record territory, right? There weren't 50,000 accounts when I started with the platform 20 years ago. So to sign up 50,000 new businesses in a quarter is good. And then second, against the '19 baseline, I think I called out our bookings dollars were up 30%. So forget the weak comp against the normal quarter. A couple of years ago, it's way up. So the headline is our company sales were way up, that's headline 1. \n And Part B is so why they weigh up? I think it's the location we made into digital, So start, I don't know, 4 or 5 years ago, we did a bunch of things to get way better at digital marketing and selling, obviously, not the least of which is the whole tech stack that we build to be able to follow businesses and everywhere they crawl around and then what they do to advertising, figuring out where to spend and who to target money against to get them to visit our sites to optimizing our sites to get conversion rates and sales at the bottom end to applications going end-to-end where someone could go on our site and literally order the program and get cards in a couple of days and not have to talk to people.  \n So the reengineering, I'd say, of the whole digital machinery has been, first of all, it was massive, but we're getting the returns of it now. It's obviously ramped way the heck up. And I think it's another huge step-up in our early plans for '22. So I would say that's the main, main driver, and we're doing that everywhere. We're just way smarter in how we target and how we study where prospects go and what they're looking at instead of trying to make up who we think might be interested in our products.  \n So on your second question on bookings, the answer to it is, let's say, we said, hey, we sold, pick a number, $100 million of new business in this core. To Chuck's point, what that means is as you roll forward and that all gets implemented, it's obviously an annualized amount of $100 million. It wouldn't be $100 million in this year, like we sold it throughout the year, it'd be $50 million, for example, in that case. And so we have very different timings.  \n In our Brazil business, we sell, and it's almost instamatic. In our fuel card business, we sell and we get it pretty soon. In our Corporate Payments business, which are bigger accounts, it takes longer. So our -- we basically know our sales, if you will, our new business for '22 because it's all sitting in our pipeline to be implemented. So the bookings number turns into an annualized revenue number, which is how we build our plans, and then the timing or what we call the in-year amount varies across the various businesses we have.  \n But the main thing I want to make sure people are clear is it's working. I don't want to get lost in the details here that the company, our company, is selling more of everything than it's ever sold before ever. Yes, that's interesting question. I'd say basically that the first 10 years of the company's life was in a PE form with the alignment between investors and managers were super clear. If value gets created, the proceeds get split versus this kind of, \"Hey, I just give you money for showing up.\" And so it's in kind of the DNA. I like it. I like it, the people that put capital in alongside of me get returns, and I give returns. And if we don't, we don't. And obviously, there's more leverage than that. I've got, as you know, a lot of money. And so getting some money with our current tax structure is not super interesting. So it's a motivating way to keep me at the grindstone for a couple of years here to try to get the thing to a place.  \n And how do I feel about the confidence other than the way people rate our stock? I feel good. We have models that come off of the sales and retention math that we run all the time for your models, and I see what the revenue and cash EPS looks like running through our machine. And if it's valued fairly reasonably, it gets to those targets that are there. So I look at it and go -- if someone priced our earnings reasonably, I think we can make the targets and then I could get paid. Yes, Mihir, it's Ron again. So yes, there are a bit on the card side and just the retailers ordering cycle. So I would say it looks kind of like it's going to come in on our plan, just talking to our gift head not long ago. But I'd say the upside for us is probably not so much that, that the card orders would go up. It's really -- finally, the guy running it, and we finally found a way to grow the business. So -- and how long we followed our company, but I've been trying to sell a business since I bought it. And all the guys turned it into a business now that we think that can compound a double digit. \n So the way they've done it is instead of just being an administrator, an accountant for the Macy's gift card and count them $100 down, they help our clients now sell online. So they've moved over to helping sell online digital gift cards because they know a lot about it. They're getting paid extra for wallet provisioning. Half the gift cards, there's breakage where people can't find them anymore. They're in a drawer. \n And so super technically hard to move private label cards into wallets, but our guys came up with a way to do it. So we get paid money from a number of the brands to basically provision those electronically. And then the guy came up with the idea of selling the content. We have, I don't know, 300 or 400 pretty good brands. So we're taking them back to businesses because we're in the B2B business. So they've built a bit of a revenue and sales stream now taking them for rewards like companies like ours, for example, for employees.  \n So these 2 or 3 new ideas on top of the kind of old chugging along kind of low single-digit business has propped that thing up now to being north of 10%. So -- and I went through the guys plan a couple of weeks ago. So I think finally have a set of ideas that are more sustainable to keep growing that business now. Yes, that must be -- you're looking, I think, at the FX. So we're way the heck up. The sales there in constant currency in real are way, way up. I don't have it in front of me versus '19. Chuck is going to pull it out, but these should record levels. Whatever we sold in Q3 would have been an all-time record number of sales. And what I said about the recovery is Brazil is in a complete ditch COVID-wise in the spring and into the summer, and somehow has come out the other side. They are in a better price than we are here. \n So what that's done is it's opened the stores there where we sell a lot. We have kiosks and hundreds and hundreds of stores. So stores are open. People are walking. Mobility's back and more people are running through the tolls where we also sell. So the place is basically where we conduct business to try to make sales are kind of reactivated again, which is helping drive it.  \n And then second, I think we said before, we've come up with a number of super new partner or channel ideas there. The newest one is we've got a couple of the big car manufacturers to put the tags now on the vehicles. So when you go in and get your new Volkswagen and drive it out of the dealership there, you look up and there's a sticker already there with a little POS thing that says, \"Hey, call this number go to this website.\" We're getting like 50% or something conversion on adoption of these new vehicles rolling out of the dealership. So it's really -- I can't even tell you how good of a sales story that team has put together.  \n But the -- as you said, the big, big idea for us and we poured a lot of capital into it this year in '21 is to double or triple the fueling locations, and the fueling transactions are up huge over a year ago now as we take the 6 million vehicles. So we had tags and given more places to use the tags. So that is the one said to me, where could the free money and real acceleration come. It could come from this massive group of people basically just having more places to use the tag and the accounts already on their vehicle. We get paid MDR pretty attractive MDR on the fueling in that example, yes. Yes. So it's Ron. Let me start with the second part. So we probably have, I don't know, 15 significant kinds of partners in that Corporate Payments group called top 3 or 4 most important, another 8 or 10. And so the contracts generally would run anywhere from probably 3 to 5 Years. We just renewed actually a couple of them with some of our most important partners this year.  \n In terms of what do I think I'd say down would be my answer. So if you look at -- I think we put, Jim, a slide in the earnings supplement. I think it's Page 15, Sanjay, but I think that's positive. Yes, it takes the 3 pieces of our Corporate Payments business, the partner thing that we're talking about and then the direct business where we go to the end client and then the cross-border business where we mostly go to the end client. So you can see that those two are growing revenue much faster. And so the mix itself, if you just run the clock forward would make the partner piece smaller, I think, going forward.  \n So obviously, there's lot of spend there and spend grows fast. But to your point, they do more of the work. So obviously, our rates are much, much lower there than in the direct business. So we like the business, but obviously, 90% of our Corporate Payments business is in the directed cross-border. Yes, I think it's a super good question. I think obviously, there's more people trying to get into entire processing, whether it's virtual or just traditional physical cards. So I think, first off, that a lot of the players that get into are issue for issuing kinds of companies that are in that business, right, for FIs and for us, but yes, some of them are coming into our area.  \n What I'd say back is fallacy is somehow that the game is tech and product to the X, Y, Z fintech has some great thing not old fashion FLEETCOR out of it. And what I'd say to you is what they're missing is it's the merchant network, you can't monetize virtual cards if you don't have a virtual card merchant network that can process and capture those transactions you can profit until the day goes on, but you have to have the network. So we've had a, call it, I don't know, a 10-year head start on everybody in cleansing, building, growing that network.  \n And then the second one is the whole service dimension of a huge pay for you group, a massive group that helps the partners clean up the data and get the stuff processed. So I'd say those would be the couple of components that people missed that this isn't just making a new processing engine in the garage and giving it to AWS, and that's all going to be great. There's actual real assets that we have that cause our partners to stay with us. I mean, there was a big thing. Some came into my office a year, 2 of your clients, Build.com and AVIDA brought on other providers. We're doing great with them. We've renewed the contract for a number of years with one of them. We're getting more business than ever from another. We're obviously we have a great relationship.  \n Some of those are targeted like the Marqeta thing, as an example, is targeted to FIs, which we're not even in. We're not in the processing business to help FIs. We thought they wouldn't use their own processes and stuff. And so I think like everything else, it's someone searching for some narrative that is in there. We've got a good business. It's growing. The spend is growing like crazy. But because we make so much more money on the direct businesses and a growing fast, that mix will cause the partner thing to be a bit smaller.  \n But I think we're still -- I'd tell you, go call our partners. Don't ask me the supplier. Go ask our partners that they like the job we're doing. I look at the performance reports. I send performance reviews with the partners, myself personally. So from my vantage point, we're doing quite well. Yes, Ken, it's Ron. So yes, I'd say, there's good news and bad news. The good news is -- the bad news is, a, the transactions are a little weaker than we thought. The good news is they're not worth much.  \n So the two areas of weakness are in trucking, again, a particularly large trucking both here and in Europe. And you guys have read the press on this that the large trucking firms just don't have drivers. And not only are they not drivers, they're quitting and forming and going into smaller firms now. So our big accounts are effectively just soft in terms of trucks and transactions, but they're happy because they're just raising their rates.  \n And then the second one I'd say is really Europe and the big corporates, they are the white collar book of business where people haven't gone back to work in Europe. And I don't know if you guys know it's been in Europe, lots of people of company cars. So people like us have a car and we used to drive around and get reimbursed. So those are the two areas that are weak.  \n The good news is we don't get paid anything for those things. We don't get paid very much. So that's why our revenue growth is still pretty good. The local business, for example, in our partner business are super healthy, and even a big part of our U.K. business, which I'm looking at, had strong same-store sales recovery. So the areas where we get paid and we get revenue are actually pretty healthy. Yes, that's it's a good question. So the way, I mean, I say this all the time, if you like businesses, you can plan, you should like our business, it's the nature of the model. And so what we do is we -- which we're about halfway through, we build things off of run rate. So we're staring here at October volumes and revenues in all of our businesses. And I think what I said is, hey, when you post $3.52 or $3.50, we multiply it and we go, okay, that sounds like $14, and we guided to a number we don't have in front of me, Chuck, that's $3.50-something for Q4 is a track stuff. So there's another one. \n So hey, we start with the company is running earning $14 on an annualized basis now. Then we sit there and say, \"Okay, we had sales record levels this year, of which, call it, 2/3 of that will be realized in 2022 so we can see what that number is.\" Then we have a bigger sales plan for 2022, probably 20% higher, and we look at what's in here there. I'm like, \"hey, that looks good\".  \n And then we look at the deals that I mentioned that are kind of on top of that, which I think I called out together, call it, $0.50 would be kind of my commitment on the stuff that we use capital for. So that's how we build the math. We take the run rate, we take this year, next year sales. We take added things like the accretion of deals, and that helps us basically target a number that we can get to. And we haven't planned a heck of a lot of COVID recovery. Obviously, it's -- we're just obviously 12 months this year. And so we've been pretty conservative so far and getting some of that back. We still have probably $100 million, $150 million that could literally come back a different day potentially. And so those are the components.  \n And what I was trying to say -- and the other one is the macro. Obviously, fuel prices are higher here in November than they were in January and seem to be holding. And so when you roll all that up, my message is it looks super early, but it looks like a really good number. And the reason I go through all that math is to get people longer than us who are in the company some insight into how they ought to think about it. Things could happen, but the company is pretty well positioned to put up an attractive growth number for next year. David, it's Ron. It's a good question. So I'd go back to the slide that Jim put in our earnings supplement. I think it's Page 15. So again, sitting inside, our Corporate Payments business, I think we report, what, 22% organic growth and, what, 50% or something, [ friends ], for the quarter? 68%. So obviously, that's the overall number, David. But the pieces of that, again, are the direct or end-client business, the cross-border business and then this channel partner business. And so for us, the good news is the 2 big pieces, which are about 90% I'm looking at the thing are effectively flat. So because we price it, there's really no rate erosion in that out of our business. And so all of the rate erosion is really just in the mix of partners where we have tax table rates, and we have some partners that are growing like crazy. So as their volumes go up, they enjoy a bit better rates, right, in the base than the base rates. \n And so because we don't have the same kind of reliance, if you will, on the channel business, I think we're a bit more insulated, if you will, from rate compression there. And I mentioned it earlier, I'd say the super positive thing is our mix of that business is going to more full AP. And don't forget, we bought an SMB company that has higher rates. So as we roll in the full AP, the Nvoicepay mix and this Corpay One mix, those have a way higher rate than the existing businesses. So my guess is just kicking out the channel business, I see actually rate expansion over the next couple of years in that business mostly help from mix. Yes. Again, I think the driver thing is a total trucking vertical, issue, David. I don't think it's -- we don't see it obviously as significantly in the trade businesses, right? Those people have to be trained and whatever they are. So we don't see the same kind of softness, if you will, of our existing customers in those kinds of businesses. And so -- and again, we see it mostly in the large account trucking business. be the other thing, which we don't make any money in either. \n So I'd say that who knows? My guess is it's not a super easy fix for suddenly large trucking people to get the people, although you see the pictures of the at the ports of the need for more trucking. So my guess is there'll be more incentives and pressure to try to get more people into the space over the next 6 to 12 months. But I'd say it doesn't do much to us. One, it's limited only to that trucking vertical. Two, it's limited to the big firms, which don't pay as much. And, And three, honestly, it's kind of in our run rate. The softness has really been the year for the last couple of quarters. \n And so I don't see it really getting any worse, mostly because of what I said that I think there's going to be such a push to try to add people. And I think the rates are going to keep going up to attract people. So I'd say it's probably not a super duper impact on our forward thinking for the few of our business. Yes, for sure. I mean, again, George, I'd say it's pocketed. When we go look, we have bigger customers there. And so some have come through this thing kind of unscathed and then others have had a big problem. So yes, we have a select group of clients that are kind of down and have stayed down. And I think the supply chain is a big part of it. Yes. So let me take the first part, yes. We are one of the easiest things to quantify for us is to look at clients we have, let's say, clients 1 through 100 and look at their volumes and revenue in a prior period, let's say, 2019 or Q3 of 2019. And then, let's say, we still have those 100 clients to go look at their volume and revenue with us in Q3 of this year. So that's the stat we call same-store sales or the core client base. \n So yes, we -- for Corporate Payments or every business, we turn that into a revenue number and say, okay, we're some, whatever, $20 million with clients that used to give us $20 million more 2 quarters ago than they do now. And hey, we watch them to see whether some of that $20 million is coming back. So we have super clear visibility on the amount of it and the rate of recovery of it. Is that one clear? You want to say, Chuck, anything about that? Yes. It's about -- just to give you a percentage, it's about, I'd say 3% this quarter versus our plan. So hey, we guesstimated those 100 people would come back a certain way in Q3 from 2 years ago, and they came part of the way back. They come back to where we thought we'd at. That's 3 points more of growth in the things. So it's still a significant thing. And we'd be hopeful maybe we get it back and be kind of ready to get back a different day. \n On your second question, the credit question, I'd say yes, yes and yes. It's a super good question. It's record lifetime lows of credit losses, first of all, because we didn't sell much new business, obviously, in 2020. So there wasn't a lot of new business coming on. And then between the stimulus and relief and everything else, people repaid us and stuff. \n And so for sure, we've opened it up. I think Chuck said in the last call last time that we expect those losses to tick up. You can see it a bit in the roll rates, right, as we've onboarded a lot more business this year. Our Q4 losses will be a bit higher. \n And we're actually doing that juggling question now for 2022. Okay, how much do we -- how open do we want to be in credit both with existing accounts in terms of credit lines? I mean think of this, I've got fuel cards to have some credit line and the credit line is enough to pay their fuel card bills. What do they tell me they want to pay all my bill -- the bills with payment. And I said, okay, I lease with our credit. \n I mean our opportunity to increase credit to creditworthy people for our new products is like super high. And so I'd say we, for sure, will rebalance next year towards taking more risk certainly than this year and try to make that trade-off, right, between incremental sales and revenue growth and incremental losses. But we'll be careful. I want to make sure everyone on the call is clear, we're not crazy. We'll step our way in. We'll study our way in, but we will do more of it. Bob, it's a great question. I'd say the most -- to me, the most exciting thing, which is coming mostly from the world out there is this synergy, this platform concept of bringing walk-around plastic, which is the business we've mostly been in with payable together. And so it's a way of trading, in our case, a massive synergy in these businesses we've built over 20 years of getting just way more out of them. \n So I gave the example earlier, we're launching late this month or the beginning of December, the thing we call the 2-in-1, where a client that has a business card of ours or a fuel card could also pay bills with us, and literally, it would just be in one place. He could use our card and our credit to pay some of his bills. Obviously, we'd have access that it was bank account to fund the bills. His report would show all his walk-around purchases like it does now and will show all his payables, the vendors, the way it is now, and it would all be in one place. \n And so that has the opportunity in joining up businesses that we have. That's what creates profit acceleration, right, where you don't have to go fish one at a time, right, for each new client, you can go back to this pretty gigantic customer base that we built and basically start to join it up and cross up that's useful to them. And the tech that we have now makes it look -- when you look at it, it's just stitched together now. \n So I'd say, that's the -- again, I try to say the thing, I'm also excited, I know people, doubt me -- doubt us, but we got a lot of legs in the businesses we have on that page. We pitch this beyond thing, and we've added segments everywhere in all the businesses which are adding growth. So I'm obviously super happy about that. But this integration and joining up in synergy where the new guys that have some nice new shiny product, they don't have a 20-year customer base and spend, and they don't get 50,000. So I mean, most of all year, your guys had signed 50,000 clients in the quarter. So that's the super exciting thing is can we monetize this bigger business profitably, would be what I'd say is the super new opportunity for us."

I will now turn the conference over to Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. \nJames Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Charles Freund, our CFO. Following the prepared comments, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then you that can get in the line for questions. Please note that our earnings release and supplement can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com.  \n Now throughout this call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described.  \n I do need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our recovery, outlook, new products and acquisitions, expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We do not undertake any obligation to update any of these statements. These expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K, both filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov.  \n Now with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? \nRonald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q2 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 3 subjects. First, I'll share my perspective on our Q2 results, along with rest of year outlook. Second, I'll provide an update on our 2 newest acquisitions. And then lastly, I'll talk about our fuel card business, including our latest view on EV, along with a couple of innovative developments underway in that business.  \n Okay. Let me turn to our Q2 results. So very pleased to report outstanding Q2 financial results meaningfully above our internal expectations. We reported Q2 revenue of $667 million that's up 27% and cash EPS of $3.15, up 38%. Both our Q2 '21 revenue and cash EPS exceeded our Q2 '19 results, so finally moving past our pre-pandemic baseline. Organic revenue growth came in at 23% for the quarter, our full AP outsourcing platform segment up 53% versus Q2 last year.  \n The trends in the quarter are really quite good. Our same store sales metric improved to plus 18%, so hardness of 18%, many of the sectors in our client base recovering. Retention, record level, we reached nearly 94%, an all-time high since we've been reporting the metric. And interestingly, our global fuel card business reached 92% retention, also an all-time high. Credit losses remain very good, running at historic levels. And sales outstanding in the quarter finishing up almost 2x last year's Q2 and up 6% against 2019.  \n Okay. Let me transition to our view of the rest of the year. So today, we're raising guidance to $2.765 billion at the midpoint for full year revenue, raising cash EPS at the midpoint to $12.90. That's driven by our Q2 beat, the AFEX close and really the momentum that we have running into the second half. I do want to remind everyone we had previously guided to a pretty substantial second half sequential step-up already. As a reminder, cash EPS guidance up nearly $0.60 from the start of the year. So we opened the year at $12.30; today, $12.90, so obviously, better than we outlooked.  \n The second half guidance implies a few things. So first, the revenue growth will run about 20% ahead of last year and high single digits really above the second half 2019 baseline. So we are expecting the business to reach all-time highs again in both revenues and profits. Our Q4 EPS profit guidance implies nearly a $14 annualized cash EPS exit rate.  \n Okay. Let me transition now to an update on our recent acquisitions. So as a reminder, we closed AFEX, that's the add-on cross-border deal, on June 1. And then last week, we signed definitive documents to acquire ALE, which is a lodging provider to the insurance vertical.  \n So let me start with ALE, really a highly complementary add-on to our existing lodging business, and that company brings a whole set of specialized capabilities designed just to serve the insurance vertical. So we've got a pretty interesting synergy plan for that business and expect accelerated revenue and profit growth next year.  \n We're also well underway on our AFEX integration. We've already exited about $10 million of run rate payroll expense. We've implemented one unified cross-border management organization, and we've designed an IT consolidation plan to move to a single system. That will significantly reduce run rate IT and operations expense.  \n So look, both of these acquisitions, classic FLEET wheelhouse deals. We paid reasonable prices. They're extensions of our existing business, so we know them well. And both have very rich synergy opportunities. we're expecting the businesses to grow about 20% on the top on a pro forma basis next year and together deliver incremental cash EPS in 2022 in the $0.50 to $0.70 range, so big upside. So obviously, we are quite enthusiastic about the transactions.  \n All right. Let me shift gears now and talk a bit about our fuel card business, which we continue to love and which we think has a bright future. So I'll talk a bit about EV, the latest and greatest, and then talk about innovation and specifically 2 new things that we're doing to improve the growth prospects of our fuel card business.  \n So starting out with EV. I mentioned last time, we're really embracing EV as an opportunity and in no way see it putting an end to our fuel card business. Employers are going to need to reimburse employees for recharging electric vehicles much like they reimburse employees for refueling combustion engines. And I think you may find that it costs more to operate EV than people think.  \n We also think there'll be some new economics and that we've got an opportunity to achieve, very similar economics from EV measuring and reimbursing as we do from combustion engines. We've included a couple of EV exhibits in our Q2 earnings supplement. You'll see some comparisons of spend where the cost of public charging is about 70% of fossil fuel charging. And then because there's more attractive MDR rates, we believe that we can achieve pretty interesting revenue there as well.  \n In a nutshell, we expect the at-home software subscription fees to be pretty significant and augment a number of the other fees that we get in the revenue mix.  \n We are outlooking the commercial transition to EV to be slow, particularly here in the U.S., giving us ample time to build out our public charging network and implement recharging at home. We expect mixed fleets to be how things start out. So our incumbent position should give us quite an advantage in consolidating activity and data for our clients. So look, in conclusion, we're outlooking EV to really just be a different way to serve commercial fleets but one in which we think can still be attractive.  \n All right. Let me leave EV and cut over to the couple of innovations that we're working in the fuel card business. So first is digital and particularly digital selling, which now in Q2 has reached about 60% of all our new fuel card sales globally coming to us digitally. So lots of improvements in our digital selling capabilities. We've got automated keyword bidding now. We've redesigned our websites to maximize sales conversion, and we're beginning investments at the top of the funnel in the form of digital TV, radio, Facebook advertising, which is driving about 50% more visitors to our websites, so obviously leading to incremental sales.  \n The last innovation I'd like to touch on is our effort to transform our fuel card UI, which is used by over 100,000 clients, really into a broader payment platform. So we're combining our newest cloud-based SMB bill pay platform with our fuel card UI so that clients go on to pay us the fuel card bill that they'd have the option then of paying additional vendors with the same software platform. So this idea is really aimed at accelerating the number of active bill pay clients we can add to our platform and again beginning the transformation of the fuel card business into a corporate payments business. So we'll keep you updated there as we go.  \n So look, in closing, 3 thoughts for you. So one, on '21, again, we're pleased with Q2, particularly the record retention and record sales levels. And again, our second half outlook calls for new all-time highs again in revenue and profits. Second, on the fuel card business, again, we think the prospects are bright for the business. We do have a plan to monetize EV adoption by providing some new services and particularly measuring and reimbursing at-home recharging. We've got an opportunity to keep stepping up digital sales and digital advertising at the top of the funnel. We think we can drive incremental visitors and incremental sales. And we're launching a bill pay cross-sell opportunity to our fuel card clients again by turning our existing fuel UI into a broader payment platform.  \n And lastly, although early, we're quite encouraged by our 2022 setup. Our second half guidance calls for nearly $7 in cash EPS for the second half or approximately $14 annualized, again forecasting record sales for the full year, which will flow revenue into next year. Will roll off $1 billion in interest rate hedges in January. That will free up about $0.20 of incremental cash EPS. And lastly, our 2 newest acquisitions, hoping to contribute in the $0.50 to $0.70 range of incremental cash EPS. So look, taken together a lot to like about our 2022 setup.  \n So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck. He'll provide some additional details on the quarter. Chuck? \nCharles Freund: Thanks, Ron. I'm delighted to share with you the results of a very good quarter. For Q2 of 2021, we reported revenue of $667 million, up 27%; GAAP net income up 24% to $196 million; and GAAP net income per diluted share up 26% to $2.30. Adjusted net income for the quarter, or ANI, increased 36% to $268 million and ANI per diluted share increased 38% to $3.15 as we finally lapped the worst of COVID. Organic revenue growth improved 29 points sequentially to up 23% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong sales, record retention levels and same-store sales recovery.  \n Looking at organic growth across the categories. Corporate payments was up 32% in the second quarter, led by our full AP solutions. We are seeing very good success leading with our full AP and selling a more complete package versus just a stand-alone virtual card offering. Full AP is clearly what we prefer to sell, so we've reoriented our combined sales force with this focus, and it's paying off.  \n T&E card revenue was up 58% year-over-year, rebounding significantly as business activity and travel began to resume. This T&E description is a bit of a misnomer as it's really a multipurpose card that can be used as either a purchasing card or as walk-around plastic, depending on how the customer wants to use it. And while spending within T&E-related categories has rebounded, it's still below historical levels. So there's clearly room for further improvement there.  \n Cross-border revenue was up 25%. These results do include 1 month of AFEX with pro forma results for Q2 last year, so which is if we owned it in both periods. And finally, virtual card revenue was up 13%. Both of these areas are still affected by COVID softness in industries that we've discussed before, like airlines, cruise operators, hotels and restaurants, international trade and commercial construction to a lesser extent. We do believe much of this softness is recoverable, but the timing is hard to predict.  \n Fuel was up organically 19% year-over-year with strong retention trends and record digital sales helping to drive the performance. We still see opportunities for further softness recoveries in fuel once the labor shortage affecting our large trucking fleet customer subsides and offices reopen more broadly so our white-collar commuters can return to normal activity levels.  \n Tolls was up 9% compared with last year and showed impressive performance in light of the lockdowns in place for much of the quarter. This growth was driven by record first half tag sales, demonstrating the value proposition and attractiveness of our offerings even when many folks aren't driving on the roads. And approximately 1/4 of all consumer tags sold year-to-date are signed up to urban plans, which allow purchases beyond tolls, such as for parking, fueling and fast food. We also added 25% more fuel stations to our tag acceptance network during the first half with plans to add another 50% during the second half. The combination of urban tag sales and non-toll network expansion should produce Beyond total volume growth as lockdowns ease and consumer activity increases.  \n Lodging was up 39%, with workforce up 36%. The pace of improvement in workforce lodging has leveled off some as customers are being held back by the labor shortage, but we feel this volume will come back over time as the labor market normalizes. Airline lodging was up 49% as domestic air travel recovered faster than expected but still remains below historical norms. International airline lodging should come back as international air travel recovers. So despite the sizable recovery in lodging, we still see upside potential here.  \n Gift organic growth was 22% year-over-year, benefiting from continued retailer embrace of the online sales channel. We expect this trend to continue as we are experiencing success with gift clients using our proprietary platform to sell both digital and physical cards online. In fact, we expect to double the number of clients utilizing this platform by year-end. Momentum in mobile wallet services and B2B sales, where third parties sell gift cards to companies for use as employee incentives and rewards, are also contributing to the improvement.  \n Looking further down the income statement. Our operating expenses were up 18% to $370 million, totaling 55% of revenue. The increase was primarily due to higher levels of business activity, the effect of currency translation impact on international expenses and acquisitions. We've also made incremental investments in digital sales and top-of-funnel marketing efforts and incurred some nonrecurring integration-related expenses for AFEX, such as severance and platform migration costs. Operating margins improved 4 points from last year to 45% due to recovering volumes that have higher margins, higher fuel prices and solid expense control.  \n In the quarter, bad debt was $6 million or 2 basis points. Credit performance continues to be strong, although we do expect our bad debt to normalize as our new sales improve and grow. Interest expense increased 7% to $34.7 million due to a $6.2 million charge associated with our debt refinance, a higher balance on the new Term B note partially offset by lower borrowings on our revolver and lower LIBOR rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 25.2%, similar to last year, and reflects a $6.5 million adjustment to our deferred tax position due to a rate change in the U.K. In our guidance, we are increasing our expected tax rate for the year given this adjustment and an assumed lower level of excess tax benefits on stock option exercises in the second half.  \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of unrestricted cash. We also had approximately $1.2 billion of undrawn availability on our revolver. In total, we had $4.1 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $1 billion borrowed on our securitization facility. As of June 30, our leverage ratio was 2.62x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  \n We repurchased approximately 926,000 shares during the quarter for $246 million at an average price of $266 per share. The Board increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion on July 27, which now gives us $1.6 billion of share buyback capacity. Now even including the recent buybacks, the AFEX closing and the pending ALE deal, we still have low leverage and ample liquidity for additional deals and/or buybacks. Our high margin, high cash flow business, which generated $268 million of ANI this quarter quickly replenishes capital, allowing us to pursue attractive buying opportunities as they present themselves.  \n Now let me share some thoughts on our outlook. We are raising our full year revenue guidance to between $2.74 billion and $2.79 billion, which is up over $100 million at the midpoint. We are also raising our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance to between $12.80 and $13 or $12.90 at the midpoint. AFEX is a big contributor as is a better macro environment in addition to volumes that improved faster than we expected in the first half of the year. We continue to be encouraged by our strong sales and retention trends and currently expect COVID volume recovery to continue through the second half of the year. We are being mindful of the potential impact from the Delta variant, and we'll adjust our outlook and operations as necessary.  \n We are expecting Q3 2021 adjusted net income per diluted share to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.55.  \n You can see our full updated guidance and assumptions in our press release, so I won't reiterate them here. I would note that our guidance does not include the impact of the ALE acquisition that we just announced. We'll update for that when we actually close the transaction.  \n In closing, I'd like to thank my 8,000-plus FLEETCOR colleagues around the world who persevered through the pandemic, helped us return to growth this quarter and have positioned our company for a strong second half and beyond.  \n With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Ron, I'm curious what surprised you in the second quarter in terms of -- sort of relative to your expectation as you looked at the strength. And I know, Charles, you just mentioned you guys are sort of anticipating the rebound to continue, but the second half guidance didn't go up a whole lot. Understandably, last quarter, you guys took up guidance. So I'm just trying to reconcile all of that, if you could just walk us through that. \nOperator: We are having technical difficulties. Please be patient while we fix the difficulties. Just one moment, please.  \n [Technical Difficulty] \nRonald F. Clarke: Sanjay, it's Ron. I don't know if you can hear me now or not. \nSanjay Sakhrani: I can hear you now. \nRonald F. Clarke: Okay. Great, great. so what I was saying, where I cut out here, is no surprising sales, right? So I think we'd shown previously kind of the climb back, right, from a year ago where we were against the baseline. And so to basically post really a record number and really almost across the board, I'd say that's probably the most surprising, most positive thing.  \n And then the second thing, I guess, I'd say is just the ratability. Obviously, coming into this year, we were a little cautious, right? Should we give guidance? How well can we plan this business, et cetera. And so I'd say both this quarter and the first half, along with our outlook that we're -- that I'm surprised that basically, things are tracking as well or better kind of than the plan that we build. So that -- those would be the couple of things from me. \nSanjay Sakhrani: And I guess, I'm sorry, just -- if we think about the second half, you guys aren't necessarily expecting that strength -- or that strength isn't outpacing your expectations. Is that because we're sort of putting in some more conservatism or something else? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. That's a good question. So I'd say a couple of things. So again, we have taken up the second half from 90 days ago. But more importantly, I think the sequential number was already up a lot, Sanjay, I think before we printed the number for Q2. I think I commented 90 days ago that our full year number had our Q4 revenue up, I think, $100 million from Q2. So that would be my second point that we're outlooking basically making $7 in the second half versus $6 off of a good quarter here. So it's still up, but we had already basically forecasted the thing to sequentially keep improving. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Got it, got it. And my final question, just -- I always ask this question, but just M&A pipeline. I know you guys took up the share buyback. Is that a reflection of the M&A pipeline or there's opportunities to do both? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. So I think I said in the last call, we always start with a pipeline. We have attractive things in front of us. And yes, we do. That's what caused us to refi the thing and take up our liquidity. So yes, I know I sound a bit like a broken record, but in front of me is our pipeline sheet. We've got 2 or 3 things close in that we're going to decide on and we've got another kind of 2 or 3 things that we may do before the year is over. So as always, we've got some interesting things.  \n And then second, we've -- I think we've got enough liquidity. I don't have it in front of me, but circa $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We're generating, what, $250 million a quarter. So that's another $500 million in the second half. So we've really got, for once, kind of plenty liquidity. Leverage ratio, I think, is in the mid-2s. So when you put it all together, I think we feel pretty able to do, Sanjay, virtually anything we want. \nOperator: Our next question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. \nJames Faucette: I appreciate the color and commentary on the capital allocation and that kind of thing. I want to dig in a little bit on the... \n [Technical Difficulty] \nOperator: We have lost his line. So we'll just move on until he redials in. Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: I hope you can hear me okay. I think maybe building on Sanjay's question around M&A. Just Ron, should the deals look similar to the -- as you called it, the classic 2 deals you guys closed here similar in terms of size and accretion? Or are some of these things perhaps bigger or smaller? I'm just trying to get a better sense of what you're seeing and what might be different. \nRonald F. Clarke: Tien-Tsin, you can see if we don't like the questions, we just yank the guy off. So we're... \nTien-Tsin Huang: A great strategy, a great strategy. \nRonald F. Clarke: Thanks for your question. So I'd say looking at the thing in front of me, I think the difference is we've got kind of 2 flavors. We've got a couple of things that are similar to the AFEX and ALE. They're kind of more of what we do, where we like the prices and they're accretive. And then I'd say we've got a couple of things that are more adjacent. I think I called out a year ago this idea of kind of going up the value chain in corporate pay, like AP automation, as an example, kind of do more for the client between his ERP and our payments. So we've got a couple of things like that, that are not square in the categories but nest pretty close to them. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Okay. Good. That's fun -- it would be fun to see what it is. And then just on the new sales front, you said that was a nice surprise. How about in the second half? I mean do you feel like there's some pent-up demand as, let's hope, everyone sort of getting back to more normal order of business? Do you see that stepping up or maybe even more than a catch-up? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean that's also a good question. So yes, we did our kind of nice [ 93 to 10 T Box ] review halfway through the year review and the sales forecasts are in absolute numbers always higher in the back half. So we have forecast that are up in -- up even more against the 2019 baseline. And I did try to -- I know there's a lot of chitchat in these opening scripts, but I didn't want to just double down on the comment around this digital thing. I tried to call it out, but I'd say it's the most hopeful like for me that I've done. I've taken this question, 100 times of, hey, Ron, can you just spend more? Why don't you just invest more in sales and marketing, sell more and all that kind of stuff? And I've always said that, hey, we want good returns. We don't waste money. And practically, it's hard to hire 50% more people and you have turnover.  \n So at this time, Tien-Tsin, it's a bit different with the digital because you can kind of turn the crank, right, in a way and generating more visitors. On the call, I said we did that and generated 50% more visitors in Q2 than we had in the trailing baseline quarters. So that's the one place I'd say there's a ray of light there of us being able maybe to really step up the digital sales even more. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Okay. I'm glad you found that. \nOperator: Our next question is from Peter Christiansen with Citigroup. \nPeter Christiansen: Nice trends guys, really nice. Earlier in the year, I think there was this assumption that there's expectations that you'd make up roughly 2/3 of hard-hit accounts by year-end. Clearly, you're running ahead of that schedule. I was just wondering if you could update us on your thinking there.  \n And then just piggybacking on the last response, how are you thinking about incremental outperformance so far, reinvesting versus dropping that to the bottom line? How are you thinking about the decisioning there? \nCharles Freund: Peter, this is Charles. So on the softness recovery, I'd say the impact has basically tracked to our plan, but it's come in a little bit differently in that T&E spend came roaring back faster as the domestic airline travel and lodging that's associated with it. A few of the other areas were a little bit slower. So some of the industries that we called out in terms of cruise operators or hotels and lodging and such still haven't quite recovered where we thought they would, so mixed bag. The good news is it is tracking the plan. We do believe there's still further upside moving forward into the second half. So still optimistic that we'll get to where we more or less planned, but it may just come in a little bit different. \nRonald F. Clarke: Pete, it's Ron. Let me just jump on the back of Chuck's comment, your part B. Yes is the answer, maybe not obvious from our Q2 results, but we actually spent some incremental money late in the quarter both in kind of incremental digital investments that I spoke of, along with IT. So I think the answer is to the extent that we're tracking ahead of what we're committing to here, I think you would see us spend more money. We've got some places where we think we can get returns now. \nOperator: Our next question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. \nJames Faucette: I'm not sure what happened there technically but -- and I apologize if I -- you already answered this question in my absence. But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the corporate payments growth. It seemed like that was a source of better performance at least versus our model and especially accounts payable. What are the kind of key drivers of strength this quarter?  \n And as a quick follow-up, I'll just get it in now. How correlated is that segment right now with respect to fuel in particular and kind of the broader business more generally? \nCharles Freund: Yes. James, this is Charles. The corporate payments business, as you said, kind of outpaced a number of the other businesses in terms of organic growth. And it was really driven by 2 areas. Our full AP was up over 50% as was the T&E. The T&E piece helped a lot through macro recovery or environmental recovery, I should say. In terms of the full AP being up over 50%, that's driven by strong sales. And so as we came through the pandemic, we actually continue to sell a lot of that product as people were looking for digital automated solutions where you can have as many people touching invoices. And you didn't need as many people to run processes. And during a lockdown, it's super helpful to outsource that process to us. So we had a lot of demand through COVID and that's continued into this year. So sales continue to be strong there, and you're seeing the flow-through on the revenue. \nJames Faucette: Got it, got it. And just as a clarification then. And so that flow-through and benefit that you're seeing, is that driven by generally like just movement and acceleration of the business? And how much of that is tied or is being benefited by fuel prices and a little bit higher levels there? \nCharles Freund: Yes. We don't have a lot of fuel buying in the full AP area. So you have a little bit of it in T&E. And our T&E, our multi-card business fuel is about 7%, 8%, maybe the spend. But in terms of overall kind of what we call corporate payments, it's not a big factor. \nJames Faucette: Okay. Great to hear that. \nRonald F. Clarke: James, it's probably our technical thing to cut you off. But just to add to Chuck saying, again, the retention in that business is our world. It's super duper high. And obviously, we had incremental payments with clients we have. So that obviously drives the growth. That continues to inch up. \nOperator: Our next question is from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. \nTrevor Williams: Just so on the guide for the second half, if we back out the 2Q beat, the midpoint of the revenue guide at least for the second half is a raise of about $80 million from where you were. Could you just break out kind of how much of that is the contribution from AFEX? Fuel is a little bit higher than what was in the prior guide, maybe a little bit better FX versus just building in more organic revenue dollars in the second half. \nCharles Freund: Yes. So the $80 million lift, AFEX runs about $10 million roughly per quarter -- sorry, per month. So that will be a sizable contributor there. We are getting a little bit of macro love with fuel prices and we'll be coming -- FX seems to be kind of okay. So I'd say that between AFEX of, call it, 60 and then some of the macro and then we've got -- the rest would be organic lift versus where we thought. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Trevor, it's Ron. The macro is kind of going in a couple of different ways, right? There's happies like fuel prices that you called out. And then there's sads like, for us, like COVID in Brazil. Obviously, this came in worse than -- is worse than we thought. So there's kind of puts and takes in that. But to me, again, the thing I tried to say it earlier, I don't know people heard me, is it's not just so much the incremental guide, hey, we're guiding to whatever, 80 more at the midpoint. It's sequentially, even previously, we continue to believe there's an acceleration in the business. Again, that if you look at second half versus first half or even Q3 versus Q2, we're talking about revenue stepping up another, call it, $50 million. So I just don't want people to miss that, that we -- it's a business we can plan. And so we forecasted that roll rate, if you will, in the subsequent quarters. \nTrevor Williams: Okay. No, that's helpful. And I mean it's all moving in the right direction. And then just my follow-up on corporate pay. I mean there was good acceleration on the year-over-year growth rate but really no change from the first quarter, just normalizing for the easier comp. And I'm guessing just based on the numbers Charles ran through, I mean it sounds like virtual card is where there's still probably the most softness relative to '19 levels at least? I mean how much of that is the timing lag with invoicing from when you guys actually get paid there versus the potential for there being something that could be more permanent with the underlying customers. And then just as a clarification there. I mean, how much recapture from those soft virtual card customers do you have embedded in the second half guide? \nCharles Freund: Yes. So Trevor, you're spot on in terms of where the softness lies, mostly in that virtual card area where we would handle payments for cruise line operators, ticket operators, hotels, restaurants, et cetera. Commercial construction continues to lag a bit as well. There is still some softness that we're seeing -- lingering softness in the cross-border business, too, which I'd called out there, particularly Australia. That market is struggling and actually come back in a lockdown now. So I'd say you're spot on. We don't view this as structural, meaning that we believe it can come back or at least most of it will come back. It's just more of a timing issue. So the potential is there. It just hasn't recovered yet. \nRonald F. Clarke: Trevor, it's Ron again. Let me just jump on to Chuck's thing that the thing that's fascinating is it's super concentrated. I don't have the exhibit in front of me, but circa 75 clients account for 1/2 to 2/3 of the softness in that particular line. And the good news is they're still alive because they haven't showed up in our losses. So it's not an across-the-board thing. It's literally the small handful of super impacted clients that are still kind of down but not out. And so to Chuck's point, to the extent that they come back, we haven't planned a bunch in the second half for them. But to the extent that they stay open and come back, that could be happy for us next year. \nTrevor Williams: Okay. Got it. And so there's not much from them that's embedded in the second half number? \nRonald F. Clarke: Not much. \nOperator: Our next question is from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. \nKenneth Suchoski: I just want to ask about Beyond Tolls. I just wanted to get your appetite. I just wanted to ask about your appetite there to kind of open up the credit lines. And I think you mentioned that you expect Beyond Tolls to contribute to revenue growth and volume growth. So I mean what's the expectation there in terms of contribution to revenue growth in the segment or to a total company, whether that's back half of this year or next year? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Ken, it's Ron. It's a good question. So the first thing I'd say is it's been different than we planned because Brazil slid into a COVID problem kind of in the February, March period. I believe it's starting to come out. If you look at the curve, it's starting to kind of reopen. So that's the first comment is the activity and people driving obviously is less than we planned. \n But what I'd say for this particular thing is it's less credit because we do put some of the stuff on credit cards, and we do have experience with customers that we take money from their bank accounts. So we're -- we've got the credit under control. It's a network issue for us. So we spent a lot of time optimizing the digits on the software that go in parking garages and fuel sites and fast food to get the right performance, to get super high performance and stuff. And so we put a ton of capital. I think, Chuck, it's in the $10 million to $20 million range again to build out. \n So they're adding network like crazy now, which we see already even through this COVID lens volume going up because we've got obviously millions of consumers already that have the tag that just need a gas station or parking garage near them. \n And so I'd say that it's the combo of those 2 things: one, the rate at which we build out the network; and then two, the rate of recovery of people driving around again. So I don't know when those -- that thing will cross the curve, whether it's later this year or the beginning of next. But I'd say we're still -- based on the investment I just mentioned, we're super bullish on the idea. \nKenneth Suchoski: Yes. That makes a lot of sense. I guess my follow-up question. Just maybe we could touch on the Roger acquisition. I mean how is that cross-sell progressing? Are customers receptive to adopting that solution? Any comments there would be really helpful. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Another good question, Ken. So I'd say still early days. I guess we've owned it for, I think, 6 months now. We've got a few thousand. Last time I looked, having 3,000 kind of active clients, SMB clients on the platform. So it's working, it's out there. We're starting to market. Obviously, we had to do a lot of work to get the digital selling machine and the tech built in and get it combined into other FLEETCOR assets and stuff. \n And literally this month, in August, we kind of launched the cross-sell. I think I mentioned it in the top of my comments that we're taking the fuel card UI that, what was it, call it 100,000 clients use to go in and pay their bills and basically putting in the Roger payment platform to pay the FLEETCOR bill and offer to pay additional bills. So that thing is actually going live in this month. \n So we'll report back. But I'd say, again, we're -- the category is super high. We've got a super good product. We're selling a few thousands, and we're making sure the quality is good. And were on the 1-yard line here to launch the cross-sell. So early, but I'd say encouraging so far. \nOperator: Our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask you about EV. And what are you seeing in the marketplace today? Are you sort of planning for the future when it comes to thinking through this stuff? Or are you seeing fleets that are today moving in that direction? In other words, is it sort of a demand side kind of pulling you in order to make these changes? Or you just sort of trying to see what's around the curve and prepare for it? \nRonald F. Clarke: Ramsey, it's Ron. That's another really super good question. I'd say it's a mix. So the EV action, if you will, is super pocketed. So we really only see stuff in Europe. So when we convene and we talk about EV and who's doing what, I'd say it's all quiet on the Western front here in old U.S.A. But we see it in certain markets. It's pretty active, for example, in the Netherlands. It's starting to become active in the U.K. and it's -- interestingly, it's starting with the big accounts. \n And so what we are seeing is the corporate accounts, which I guess are trying to be green or whatever have more money and are willing to kind of dispose of the old-fashioned combustion assets are kind of the early adopters of the thing. So we are seeing some exchange, some transition among our client base at that level, at the corporate level. \n And then Part B is what you said. We're trying to get the model clear, okay? What spend -- I don't know if had a chance to flip through the supplement we put out. But to me, it's just almost shocking that to drive a van into a EV station in the U.K. or to drive an EV van into a public charge point, it's the same cost to the guy. The guy spends -- or the gal spends the same amount of money for those -- to fill up or the recharge. Like I don't know if that would be what people would think. \n But when you look at it based on the efficiency of the vehicles and the markup that the charge point guys are charging right there, you're like, oh, I didn't know that someone like FLEETCOR can actually get paid because there's real spend. And then this idea that we have live now of actually putting software at the employees' home to -- so he's not burdened with his own electricity costs and putting boxes and that stuff in, we're getting a bunch of money for that and a lot of demand for it. So it's a little of both. It's starting to head this way and then us trying to get out ahead of it so we can articulate what the model looks like. \nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. That's super helpful. Just a really quick follow-up. I just wanted to make sure that I got your kind of preliminary 2022 EPS view. It's effectively all in, about $14.70 to $14.90 is what you're seeing in terms of the base run rate in addition to the interest rate hedges rolling off, M&A contribution at this point. It looks like about $14.70 to $14.90. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. So let me be clear with you. We're not trying to give guidance, so let me go on the record. It's really just trying to say Chuck and I provide guidance here in the back half of $7, so just helping everybody with the math. So in a recurring business, that's an exit rate of $14, that's just what we provided. \n And then I just did want to comment on a couple of super happy things. We work on deals and these are kind of FLEETCOR wheelhouse deals. And so they're rich with synergies. So our confidence -- my confidence is super high in that kind of $0.50 to $0.70 increment because obviously, they're late coming into our company and the synergies are well as the year goes on. \n And the other thing is something the treasurer took me through a couple of weeks ago that we made a bad hedge or a roll off and so I'm happy. So I just want to make sure people are clear that there's some happy set of things in our business, including the exit rate of the business and these couple of things that we can see. But obviously, we're going to work hard to keep selling way more and buying way more. So I wouldn't, in one second, try to suggest that what I'm saying is anywhere near what the guidance is going to be. We'll cook that as we run through the year. \nOperator: Our next question is from David Koning with Baird. \nDavid Koning: I guess my first question is just in the fuel segment, thinking about Q3, normally, when we look back, it's kind of flat to up a little bit sequentially. I think this quarter, you talked about fuel will be a little bit of a sequential tailwind, which is nice. It's -- but it seems like there's going to be more -- it's going to be a nice sequential growth, just the way you're kind of guiding the year. What's all getting better like sequentially from Q2 to Q3? Like what's going to kind of drive that higher than normal? \nCharles Freund: Yes. So Dave, this is Charles. So one thing is we are seeing some higher fuel prices. So that's certainly helpful. As Ron mentioned, also great digital sales. So sales are -- and in that business, sales are recognized and turned into revenue pretty quickly, pretty quick translation. So that's helpful. Last year, as you know, sales were pretty awful. So that created a slightly different trajectory. So we're back on kind of where we want to be. So I'd say those couple of things combined with a little bit of COVID recovery still to go, but those things combined will help lift us a bit faster in Q3 versus Q2. \nRonald F. Clarke: David, it's Ron. Just the one add to Chuck's thing there is the retention. I think someone -- Sanjay asked me at the opening of the call, I should have called it, hey, what's surprised us so far? Fuel card retention. I called out at the top of the call, we hit an all-time high. I don't know if we break it out, Jim, or not, but we're showing up at 94% for the company. But inside of that, we hit 92% from the fuel card business. So when you roll that through our sequential model, that creates lift in the second half as well. So we're at all-time retention. We've had crazy good sales, to Chuck's point, and we're getting a little bit of macro happy from fuel and COVID recoveries. So you put it all together, things climb pretty good. \nDavid Koning: Yes. And then I guess just as a quick follow-up.  The credit provisions have been really low. We can see that in the cash flow statement, and you mentioned it earlier in the call, too. Does your guidance for the rest of the year assume that, that stays low? And should we think of that changing much in '22? Should we like normalize it? Or what should we think about there? \nCharles Freund: Yes, David, it's Charles. So we are forecasting for credit to kind of normalize as we exit the year. So Q3 get up a little bit, Q4 get back to kind of what we would see more historically. As we're selling a lot more now, generally, credit follows the sales. I sell somewhat, and I try to underwrite really well. However, some people do get through and they go bad, then they get weeded out and the base then performs better. So as we have way more new sales now, we would expect that it's normalized. And so what I'd say is going into next year, I'd look for more kind of what we've done historically as a baseline. \nOperator: Our next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. \nDavid Togut: The transformation of the fuel card UI into a broader bill payment platform seems intriguing and reminiscent of what you did on the fuel card side when you open that up to more of a Beyond Fuel card. So can you talk about what you need to do to build this broader bill payment platform mostly on the merchant acceptance side because that would seem to be probably the heaviest lifting with this type of a payments project. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. David, yes, it's -- no, we think it's a pretty big idea. As I said, we're going live this month. And I think the trend is coming to us, right, that more and more of our both U.S. and European fuel card clients are using UI, using their phone and using the desktop and particularly going there to pay us, right, their invoices, right, whether they get an e-mail reminder. And so we have all these clients showing up pretty frequently inside our software UI. \n And so what we've done, what we've been working on is taking the Roger bill pay software and basically making it the bill payment system of record. So when you go into the UI and look over to pay something, that platform is working. So we don't really have to rebuild the bill pay platform in the network because we got that already. And obviously, we have all those capabilities from our other businesses, merchant networks and the deals we have with our friends at MasterCard. We have all that other stuff, vendors that do paper making and everything. \n So really, it's just customers. It's just seeing if the accounts are comfortable using the UI to do more than just pay us. And we'll have certainly a report for you back, but the numbers are just staggeringly big, right? It's over 100,000 just here in the United States are paying a bill every month on these UIs. So we're hopeful, I don't know if you want to call it the super app, but the idea is more and more people are using these software apps with us. We just want them to be more useful and we've got another product that's ready to go. So it's going live. \nDavid Togut: Got it. And just as a follow-up, what does the unit pricing look like on this bill payment platform when you go beyond kind of fuel card bill pay? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. So it's kind of almost free at this point to the client. We're looking at whether we should get subscription money for the software, if you will. But really, as you know, we get paid on the back end, mostly the stuff that we run through our cards and then obviously cross-border, call it, 8% to 10% of the stuff that could be cross-border. So we'll probably make it super attractive to our client base initially, get paid on the back side and then look to feather in some software SaaS fees as we go. \nOperator: Our next question is from John Coffey with Susquehanna Financial Group. \nJohn Coffey: My question is on the corporate payments segment. And I was actually looking at a company that's not traditionally a competitor of yours, Coupa. And one thing that they've been saying, they as a software company focus on procurement, they've been getting more involved in Coupa Pay. And I think what they would say is procurement and payments or payments of the procured items are actually complementary services. And if I'm paraphrasing their position right, they say, why would you go -- if you're doing procurement with us, why would you go outside and do payment when these things -- 2 things could be bundled? \n And I was wondering what you thought of that sentiment. I was wondering if you disagree with it, why? And if you agree with it, is there any thought you would have that you would get maybe more exposed to the software side of the universe, particularly the procurement side of the universe? \nRonald F. Clarke: John, it's Ron. That's also a good question. So first, just FYI for you, the company we bought 2 years ago called Nvoicepay in Portland was the pay provider to Coupa Pay. So we're pretty clear on what Coupa Pay is trying to do. I don't think you could ask them that they've done a lot today of combining the pay with the software, but I know that that's their ambition. \n So what I'd say is for a year or 2, we've studied and looked at a bunch of companies that have software that's kind of up the value chain, right, AP automation, scheduling approval, workflow software and even on top of that kind of procurement contract compliance kind of software that you've mentioned. Our take on it is it will be all of the above, which means some clients will just take that AP automation software like they do from Coupa and not to pay. Some people will just take pay like what we offer, and some people will take both. And I think I've repeated that we probably will offer that. We probably will offer the both. I don't know if we'll offer the stand-alone AP automation software or not, but that's our take that based on the size of the company and the industry that they're in and the research that we've done is it won't be one size fits all. It's not like everybody is going to do it one way. \n So we think it's a good idea. It's something that we'll look probably to offer. We do partner with people where we offer the pay into their software. So we're studying how well they're doing it. I call it, peanut butter and jelly. Is it going to be peanut butter and jelly? Or is it going to be not peanut butter and jelly? So I think the jury is still out on it. \nOperator: And our final question is from George Mihalos with Cowen and Company. \nGeorgios Mihalos: I guess I'll ask 2 quick ones upfront. I guess on the sales momentum, the 106% of '19 levels. Just curious, Ron and Charles, where -- from a segment perspective, that seems to be outperforming where you feel you're doing better than expected and maybe sort of the pockets of any weakness, if there are any, from the new sales side. And then separately, Ron, just curious at a high level out of Washington, any thoughts about the infrastructure bill and what that might mean for FLEET? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. George, it's Ron. On the first part, the sales thing. So yes, I think I mentioned we've been surprised to the upside against the plan that we built. And I'd say this -- I'm sure it will sound funny to everybody, but it's been fuel. We've actually sold more year-to-date in the forecast. So the second half is actually higher in fuel than the plan that we built. So most of the overperformance against our internal expectations is fuel, and most of that overperformance is digital selling. We keep growing the share of new digital accounts that we're onboarding. And as I mentioned, we're investing more at the top to try to drive that. So that's the overperformance. \n I'd say everything else is kind of mostly on plan. We're super pleased with it. As you mentioned, the plan is up, way, way up from last year and even up against '19. So I'd say everybody else is kind of delivering what we hope for. \n On Part B, who knows on the infrastructure bill. I'd say, first, tell me what infrastructure is. And if it's like what it would be, what you think it would be, which is kind of fixing stuff and construction-centric, it could help us a lot. I'd say it looks a lot to us like the stimulus from last year obviously helped us get paid and helped a lot of our clients stay open and pay payroll. And so I'd say the same thing that if that comes to pass and gets funded and its regular old fashion kind of infrastructure where stuff gets built, we're pretty weighted concentrated in that construction segment. So it's got to help us. If there's more money and more work for those sets of companies, that will flow through to us. I'm not counting on it, George, by the way. It's a political thing. But if it comes to be and it comes to be the old-fashioned infrastructure, it's happy for FLEET. \nCharles Freund: And George, I would just add as Ron talked about the concentration in the construction vertical, that's not just in fleets that also pertains to our lodging business and our AP, full AP and virtual card businesses. \nRonald F. Clarke: George, anything else? \nGeorgios Mihalos: No, I think we're set. That's great color. Really appreciate it. Hopefully, that's a point of upside. \nOperator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. This is -- this concludes the conference.

            "name": "Charles Freund",
            "content": "Thanks, Ron. I'm delighted to share with you the results of a very good quarter. For Q2 of 2021, we reported revenue of $667 million, up 27%; GAAP net income up 24% to $196 million; and GAAP net income per diluted share up 26% to $2.30. Adjusted net income for the quarter, or ANI, increased 36% to $268 million and ANI per diluted share increased 38% to $3.15 as we finally lapped the worst of COVID. Organic revenue growth improved 29 points sequentially to up 23% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong sales, record retention levels and same-store sales recovery.  \n Looking at organic growth across the categories. Corporate payments was up 32% in the second quarter, led by our full AP solutions. We are seeing very good success leading with our full AP and selling a more complete package versus just a stand-alone virtual card offering. Full AP is clearly what we prefer to sell, so we've reoriented our combined sales force with this focus, and it's paying off.  \n T&E card revenue was up 58% year-over-year, rebounding significantly as business activity and travel began to resume. This T&E description is a bit of a misnomer as it's really a multipurpose card that can be used as either a purchasing card or as walk-around plastic, depending on how the customer wants to use it. And while spending within T&E-related categories has rebounded, it's still below historical levels. So there's clearly room for further improvement there.  \n Cross-border revenue was up 25%. These results do include 1 month of AFEX with pro forma results for Q2 last year, so which is if we owned it in both periods. And finally, virtual card revenue was up 13%. Both of these areas are still affected by COVID softness in industries that we've discussed before, like airlines, cruise operators, hotels and restaurants, international trade and commercial construction to a lesser extent. We do believe much of this softness is recoverable, but the timing is hard to predict.  \n Fuel was up organically 19% year-over-year with strong retention trends and record digital sales helping to drive the performance. We still see opportunities for further softness recoveries in fuel once the labor shortage affecting our large trucking fleet customer subsides and offices reopen more broadly so our white-collar commuters can return to normal activity levels.  \n Tolls was up 9% compared with last year and showed impressive performance in light of the lockdowns in place for much of the quarter. This growth was driven by record first half tag sales, demonstrating the value proposition and attractiveness of our offerings even when many folks aren't driving on the roads. And approximately 1/4 of all consumer tags sold year-to-date are signed up to urban plans, which allow purchases beyond tolls, such as for parking, fueling and fast food. We also added 25% more fuel stations to our tag acceptance network during the first half with plans to add another 50% during the second half. The combination of urban tag sales and non-toll network expansion should produce Beyond total volume growth as lockdowns ease and consumer activity increases.  \n Lodging was up 39%, with workforce up 36%. The pace of improvement in workforce lodging has leveled off some as customers are being held back by the labor shortage, but we feel this volume will come back over time as the labor market normalizes. Airline lodging was up 49% as domestic air travel recovered faster than expected but still remains below historical norms. International airline lodging should come back as international air travel recovers. So despite the sizable recovery in lodging, we still see upside potential here.  \n Gift organic growth was 22% year-over-year, benefiting from continued retailer embrace of the online sales channel. We expect this trend to continue as we are experiencing success with gift clients using our proprietary platform to sell both digital and physical cards online. In fact, we expect to double the number of clients utilizing this platform by year-end. Momentum in mobile wallet services and B2B sales, where third parties sell gift cards to companies for use as employee incentives and rewards, are also contributing to the improvement.  \n Looking further down the income statement. Our operating expenses were up 18% to $370 million, totaling 55% of revenue. The increase was primarily due to higher levels of business activity, the effect of currency translation impact on international expenses and acquisitions. We've also made incremental investments in digital sales and top-of-funnel marketing efforts and incurred some nonrecurring integration-related expenses for AFEX, such as severance and platform migration costs. Operating margins improved 4 points from last year to 45% due to recovering volumes that have higher margins, higher fuel prices and solid expense control.  \n In the quarter, bad debt was $6 million or 2 basis points. Credit performance continues to be strong, although we do expect our bad debt to normalize as our new sales improve and grow. Interest expense increased 7% to $34.7 million due to a $6.2 million charge associated with our debt refinance, a higher balance on the new Term B note partially offset by lower borrowings on our revolver and lower LIBOR rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 25.2%, similar to last year, and reflects a $6.5 million adjustment to our deferred tax position due to a rate change in the U.K. In our guidance, we are increasing our expected tax rate for the year given this adjustment and an assumed lower level of excess tax benefits on stock option exercises in the second half.  \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of unrestricted cash. We also had approximately $1.2 billion of undrawn availability on our revolver. In total, we had $4.1 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $1 billion borrowed on our securitization facility. As of June 30, our leverage ratio was 2.62x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  \n We repurchased approximately 926,000 shares during the quarter for $246 million at an average price of $266 per share. The Board increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion on July 27, which now gives us $1.6 billion of share buyback capacity. Now even including the recent buybacks, the AFEX closing and the pending ALE deal, we still have low leverage and ample liquidity for additional deals and/or buybacks. Our high margin, high cash flow business, which generated $268 million of ANI this quarter quickly replenishes capital, allowing us to pursue attractive buying opportunities as they present themselves.  \n Now let me share some thoughts on our outlook. We are raising our full year revenue guidance to between $2.74 billion and $2.79 billion, which is up over $100 million at the midpoint. We are also raising our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance to between $12.80 and $13 or $12.90 at the midpoint. AFEX is a big contributor as is a better macro environment in addition to volumes that improved faster than we expected in the first half of the year. We continue to be encouraged by our strong sales and retention trends and currently expect COVID volume recovery to continue through the second half of the year. We are being mindful of the potential impact from the Delta variant, and we'll adjust our outlook and operations as necessary.  \n We are expecting Q3 2021 adjusted net income per diluted share to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.55.  \n You can see our full updated guidance and assumptions in our press release, so I won't reiterate them here. I would note that our guidance does not include the impact of the ALE acquisition that we just announced. We'll update for that when we actually close the transaction.  \n In closing, I'd like to thank my 8,000-plus FLEETCOR colleagues around the world who persevered through the pandemic, helped us return to growth this quarter and have positioned our company for a strong second half and beyond.  \n With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. Peter, this is Charles. So on the softness recovery, I'd say the impact has basically tracked to our plan, but it's come in a little bit differently in that T&E spend came roaring back faster as the domestic airline travel and lodging that's associated with it. A few of the other areas were a little bit slower. So some of the industries that we called out in terms of cruise operators or hotels and lodging and such still haven't quite recovered where we thought they would, so mixed bag. The good news is it is tracking the plan. We do believe there's still further upside moving forward into the second half. So still optimistic that we'll get to where we more or less planned, but it may just come in a little bit different. Yes. James, this is Charles. The corporate payments business, as you said, kind of outpaced a number of the other businesses in terms of organic growth. And it was really driven by 2 areas. Our full AP was up over 50% as was the T&E. The T&E piece helped a lot through macro recovery or environmental recovery, I should say. In terms of the full AP being up over 50%, that's driven by strong sales. And so as we came through the pandemic, we actually continue to sell a lot of that product as people were looking for digital automated solutions where you can have as many people touching invoices. And you didn't need as many people to run processes. And during a lockdown, it's super helpful to outsource that process to us. So we had a lot of demand through COVID and that's continued into this year. So sales continue to be strong there, and you're seeing the flow-through on the revenue. Yes. We don't have a lot of fuel buying in the full AP area. So you have a little bit of it in T&E. And our T&E, our multi-card business fuel is about 7%, 8%, maybe the spend. But in terms of overall kind of what we call corporate payments, it's not a big factor. Yes. So the $80 million lift, AFEX runs about $10 million roughly per quarter -- sorry, per month. So that will be a sizable contributor there. We are getting a little bit of macro love with fuel prices and we'll be coming -- FX seems to be kind of okay. So I'd say that between AFEX of, call it, 60 and then some of the macro and then we've got -- the rest would be organic lift versus where we thought. Yes. So Trevor, you're spot on in terms of where the softness lies, mostly in that virtual card area where we would handle payments for cruise line operators, ticket operators, hotels, restaurants, et cetera. Commercial construction continues to lag a bit as well. There is still some softness that we're seeing -- lingering softness in the cross-border business, too, which I'd called out there, particularly Australia. That market is struggling and actually come back in a lockdown now. So I'd say you're spot on. We don't view this as structural, meaning that we believe it can come back or at least most of it will come back. It's just more of a timing issue. So the potential is there. It just hasn't recovered yet. Yes. So Dave, this is Charles. So one thing is we are seeing some higher fuel prices. So that's certainly helpful. As Ron mentioned, also great digital sales. So sales are -- and in that business, sales are recognized and turned into revenue pretty quickly, pretty quick translation. So that's helpful. Last year, as you know, sales were pretty awful. So that created a slightly different trajectory. So we're back on kind of where we want to be. So I'd say those couple of things combined with a little bit of COVID recovery still to go, but those things combined will help lift us a bit faster in Q3 versus Q2. Yes, David, it's Charles. So we are forecasting for credit to kind of normalize as we exit the year. So Q3 get up a little bit, Q4 get back to kind of what we would see more historically. As we're selling a lot more now, generally, credit follows the sales. I sell somewhat, and I try to underwrite really well. However, some people do get through and they go bad, then they get weeded out and the base then performs better. So as we have way more new sales now, we would expect that it's normalized. And so what I'd say is going into next year, I'd look for more kind of what we've done historically as a baseline. And George, I would just add as Ron talked about the concentration in the construction vertical, that's not just in fleets that also pertains to our lodging business and our AP, full AP and virtual card businesses."

            "name": "Ronald F. Clarke",
            "content": "Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q2 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 3 subjects. First, I'll share my perspective on our Q2 results, along with rest of year outlook. Second, I'll provide an update on our 2 newest acquisitions. And then lastly, I'll talk about our fuel card business, including our latest view on EV, along with a couple of innovative developments underway in that business.  \n Okay. Let me turn to our Q2 results. So very pleased to report outstanding Q2 financial results meaningfully above our internal expectations. We reported Q2 revenue of $667 million that's up 27% and cash EPS of $3.15, up 38%. Both our Q2 '21 revenue and cash EPS exceeded our Q2 '19 results, so finally moving past our pre-pandemic baseline. Organic revenue growth came in at 23% for the quarter, our full AP outsourcing platform segment up 53% versus Q2 last year.  \n The trends in the quarter are really quite good. Our same store sales metric improved to plus 18%, so hardness of 18%, many of the sectors in our client base recovering. Retention, record level, we reached nearly 94%, an all-time high since we've been reporting the metric. And interestingly, our global fuel card business reached 92% retention, also an all-time high. Credit losses remain very good, running at historic levels. And sales outstanding in the quarter finishing up almost 2x last year's Q2 and up 6% against 2019.  \n Okay. Let me transition to our view of the rest of the year. So today, we're raising guidance to $2.765 billion at the midpoint for full year revenue, raising cash EPS at the midpoint to $12.90. That's driven by our Q2 beat, the AFEX close and really the momentum that we have running into the second half. I do want to remind everyone we had previously guided to a pretty substantial second half sequential step-up already. As a reminder, cash EPS guidance up nearly $0.60 from the start of the year. So we opened the year at $12.30; today, $12.90, so obviously, better than we outlooked.  \n The second half guidance implies a few things. So first, the revenue growth will run about 20% ahead of last year and high single digits really above the second half 2019 baseline. So we are expecting the business to reach all-time highs again in both revenues and profits. Our Q4 EPS profit guidance implies nearly a $14 annualized cash EPS exit rate.  \n Okay. Let me transition now to an update on our recent acquisitions. So as a reminder, we closed AFEX, that's the add-on cross-border deal, on June 1. And then last week, we signed definitive documents to acquire ALE, which is a lodging provider to the insurance vertical.  \n So let me start with ALE, really a highly complementary add-on to our existing lodging business, and that company brings a whole set of specialized capabilities designed just to serve the insurance vertical. So we've got a pretty interesting synergy plan for that business and expect accelerated revenue and profit growth next year.  \n We're also well underway on our AFEX integration. We've already exited about $10 million of run rate payroll expense. We've implemented one unified cross-border management organization, and we've designed an IT consolidation plan to move to a single system. That will significantly reduce run rate IT and operations expense.  \n So look, both of these acquisitions, classic FLEET wheelhouse deals. We paid reasonable prices. They're extensions of our existing business, so we know them well. And both have very rich synergy opportunities. we're expecting the businesses to grow about 20% on the top on a pro forma basis next year and together deliver incremental cash EPS in 2022 in the $0.50 to $0.70 range, so big upside. So obviously, we are quite enthusiastic about the transactions.  \n All right. Let me shift gears now and talk a bit about our fuel card business, which we continue to love and which we think has a bright future. So I'll talk a bit about EV, the latest and greatest, and then talk about innovation and specifically 2 new things that we're doing to improve the growth prospects of our fuel card business.  \n So starting out with EV. I mentioned last time, we're really embracing EV as an opportunity and in no way see it putting an end to our fuel card business. Employers are going to need to reimburse employees for recharging electric vehicles much like they reimburse employees for refueling combustion engines. And I think you may find that it costs more to operate EV than people think.  \n We also think there'll be some new economics and that we've got an opportunity to achieve, very similar economics from EV measuring and reimbursing as we do from combustion engines. We've included a couple of EV exhibits in our Q2 earnings supplement. You'll see some comparisons of spend where the cost of public charging is about 70% of fossil fuel charging. And then because there's more attractive MDR rates, we believe that we can achieve pretty interesting revenue there as well.  \n In a nutshell, we expect the at-home software subscription fees to be pretty significant and augment a number of the other fees that we get in the revenue mix.  \n We are outlooking the commercial transition to EV to be slow, particularly here in the U.S., giving us ample time to build out our public charging network and implement recharging at home. We expect mixed fleets to be how things start out. So our incumbent position should give us quite an advantage in consolidating activity and data for our clients. So look, in conclusion, we're outlooking EV to really just be a different way to serve commercial fleets but one in which we think can still be attractive.  \n All right. Let me leave EV and cut over to the couple of innovations that we're working in the fuel card business. So first is digital and particularly digital selling, which now in Q2 has reached about 60% of all our new fuel card sales globally coming to us digitally. So lots of improvements in our digital selling capabilities. We've got automated keyword bidding now. We've redesigned our websites to maximize sales conversion, and we're beginning investments at the top of the funnel in the form of digital TV, radio, Facebook advertising, which is driving about 50% more visitors to our websites, so obviously leading to incremental sales.  \n The last innovation I'd like to touch on is our effort to transform our fuel card UI, which is used by over 100,000 clients, really into a broader payment platform. So we're combining our newest cloud-based SMB bill pay platform with our fuel card UI so that clients go on to pay us the fuel card bill that they'd have the option then of paying additional vendors with the same software platform. So this idea is really aimed at accelerating the number of active bill pay clients we can add to our platform and again beginning the transformation of the fuel card business into a corporate payments business. So we'll keep you updated there as we go.  \n So look, in closing, 3 thoughts for you. So one, on '21, again, we're pleased with Q2, particularly the record retention and record sales levels. And again, our second half outlook calls for new all-time highs again in revenue and profits. Second, on the fuel card business, again, we think the prospects are bright for the business. We do have a plan to monetize EV adoption by providing some new services and particularly measuring and reimbursing at-home recharging. We've got an opportunity to keep stepping up digital sales and digital advertising at the top of the funnel. We think we can drive incremental visitors and incremental sales. And we're launching a bill pay cross-sell opportunity to our fuel card clients again by turning our existing fuel UI into a broader payment platform.  \n And lastly, although early, we're quite encouraged by our 2022 setup. Our second half guidance calls for nearly $7 in cash EPS for the second half or approximately $14 annualized, again forecasting record sales for the full year, which will flow revenue into next year. Will roll off $1 billion in interest rate hedges in January. That will free up about $0.20 of incremental cash EPS. And lastly, our 2 newest acquisitions, hoping to contribute in the $0.50 to $0.70 range of incremental cash EPS. So look, taken together a lot to like about our 2022 setup.  \n So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck. He'll provide some additional details on the quarter. Chuck? Sanjay, it's Ron. I don't know if you can hear me now or not. Okay. Great, great. so what I was saying, where I cut out here, is no surprising sales, right? So I think we'd shown previously kind of the climb back, right, from a year ago where we were against the baseline. And so to basically post really a record number and really almost across the board, I'd say that's probably the most surprising, most positive thing.  \n And then the second thing, I guess, I'd say is just the ratability. Obviously, coming into this year, we were a little cautious, right? Should we give guidance? How well can we plan this business, et cetera. And so I'd say both this quarter and the first half, along with our outlook that we're -- that I'm surprised that basically, things are tracking as well or better kind of than the plan that we build. So that -- those would be the couple of things from me. Yes. That's a good question. So I'd say a couple of things. So again, we have taken up the second half from 90 days ago. But more importantly, I think the sequential number was already up a lot, Sanjay, I think before we printed the number for Q2. I think I commented 90 days ago that our full year number had our Q4 revenue up, I think, $100 million from Q2. So that would be my second point that we're outlooking basically making $7 in the second half versus $6 off of a good quarter here. So it's still up, but we had already basically forecasted the thing to sequentially keep improving. Yes. So I think I said in the last call, we always start with a pipeline. We have attractive things in front of us. And yes, we do. That's what caused us to refi the thing and take up our liquidity. So yes, I know I sound a bit like a broken record, but in front of me is our pipeline sheet. We've got 2 or 3 things close in that we're going to decide on and we've got another kind of 2 or 3 things that we may do before the year is over. So as always, we've got some interesting things.  \n And then second, we've -- I think we've got enough liquidity. I don't have it in front of me, but circa $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We're generating, what, $250 million a quarter. So that's another $500 million in the second half. So we've really got, for once, kind of plenty liquidity. Leverage ratio, I think, is in the mid-2s. So when you put it all together, I think we feel pretty able to do, Sanjay, virtually anything we want. Tien-Tsin, you can see if we don't like the questions, we just yank the guy off. So we're... Thanks for your question. So I'd say looking at the thing in front of me, I think the difference is we've got kind of 2 flavors. We've got a couple of things that are similar to the AFEX and ALE. They're kind of more of what we do, where we like the prices and they're accretive. And then I'd say we've got a couple of things that are more adjacent. I think I called out a year ago this idea of kind of going up the value chain in corporate pay, like AP automation, as an example, kind of do more for the client between his ERP and our payments. So we've got a couple of things like that, that are not square in the categories but nest pretty close to them. Yes. I mean that's also a good question. So yes, we did our kind of nice [ 93 to 10 T Box ] review halfway through the year review and the sales forecasts are in absolute numbers always higher in the back half. So we have forecast that are up in -- up even more against the 2019 baseline. And I did try to -- I know there's a lot of chitchat in these opening scripts, but I didn't want to just double down on the comment around this digital thing. I tried to call it out, but I'd say it's the most hopeful like for me that I've done. I've taken this question, 100 times of, hey, Ron, can you just spend more? Why don't you just invest more in sales and marketing, sell more and all that kind of stuff? And I've always said that, hey, we want good returns. We don't waste money. And practically, it's hard to hire 50% more people and you have turnover.  \n So at this time, Tien-Tsin, it's a bit different with the digital because you can kind of turn the crank, right, in a way and generating more visitors. On the call, I said we did that and generated 50% more visitors in Q2 than we had in the trailing baseline quarters. So that's the one place I'd say there's a ray of light there of us being able maybe to really step up the digital sales even more. Pete, it's Ron. Let me just jump on the back of Chuck's comment, your part B. Yes is the answer, maybe not obvious from our Q2 results, but we actually spent some incremental money late in the quarter both in kind of incremental digital investments that I spoke of, along with IT. So I think the answer is to the extent that we're tracking ahead of what we're committing to here, I think you would see us spend more money. We've got some places where we think we can get returns now. James, it's probably our technical thing to cut you off. But just to add to Chuck saying, again, the retention in that business is our world. It's super duper high. And obviously, we had incremental payments with clients we have. So that obviously drives the growth. That continues to inch up. Yes. Trevor, it's Ron. The macro is kind of going in a couple of different ways, right? There's happies like fuel prices that you called out. And then there's sads like, for us, like COVID in Brazil. Obviously, this came in worse than -- is worse than we thought. So there's kind of puts and takes in that. But to me, again, the thing I tried to say it earlier, I don't know people heard me, is it's not just so much the incremental guide, hey, we're guiding to whatever, 80 more at the midpoint. It's sequentially, even previously, we continue to believe there's an acceleration in the business. Again, that if you look at second half versus first half or even Q3 versus Q2, we're talking about revenue stepping up another, call it, $50 million. So I just don't want people to miss that, that we -- it's a business we can plan. And so we forecasted that roll rate, if you will, in the subsequent quarters. Trevor, it's Ron again. Let me just jump on to Chuck's thing that the thing that's fascinating is it's super concentrated. I don't have the exhibit in front of me, but circa 75 clients account for 1/2 to 2/3 of the softness in that particular line. And the good news is they're still alive because they haven't showed up in our losses. So it's not an across-the-board thing. It's literally the small handful of super impacted clients that are still kind of down but not out. And so to Chuck's point, to the extent that they come back, we haven't planned a bunch in the second half for them. But to the extent that they stay open and come back, that could be happy for us next year. Not much. Yes. Ken, it's Ron. It's a good question. So the first thing I'd say is it's been different than we planned because Brazil slid into a COVID problem kind of in the February, March period. I believe it's starting to come out. If you look at the curve, it's starting to kind of reopen. So that's the first comment is the activity and people driving obviously is less than we planned. \n But what I'd say for this particular thing is it's less credit because we do put some of the stuff on credit cards, and we do have experience with customers that we take money from their bank accounts. So we're -- we've got the credit under control. It's a network issue for us. So we spent a lot of time optimizing the digits on the software that go in parking garages and fuel sites and fast food to get the right performance, to get super high performance and stuff. And so we put a ton of capital. I think, Chuck, it's in the $10 million to $20 million range again to build out. \n So they're adding network like crazy now, which we see already even through this COVID lens volume going up because we've got obviously millions of consumers already that have the tag that just need a gas station or parking garage near them. \n And so I'd say that it's the combo of those 2 things: one, the rate at which we build out the network; and then two, the rate of recovery of people driving around again. So I don't know when those -- that thing will cross the curve, whether it's later this year or the beginning of next. But I'd say we're still -- based on the investment I just mentioned, we're super bullish on the idea. Yes. Another good question, Ken. So I'd say still early days. I guess we've owned it for, I think, 6 months now. We've got a few thousand. Last time I looked, having 3,000 kind of active clients, SMB clients on the platform. So it's working, it's out there. We're starting to market. Obviously, we had to do a lot of work to get the digital selling machine and the tech built in and get it combined into other FLEETCOR assets and stuff. \n And literally this month, in August, we kind of launched the cross-sell. I think I mentioned it in the top of my comments that we're taking the fuel card UI that, what was it, call it 100,000 clients use to go in and pay their bills and basically putting in the Roger payment platform to pay the FLEETCOR bill and offer to pay additional bills. So that thing is actually going live in this month. \n So we'll report back. But I'd say, again, we're -- the category is super high. We've got a super good product. We're selling a few thousands, and we're making sure the quality is good. And were on the 1-yard line here to launch the cross-sell. So early, but I'd say encouraging so far. Ramsey, it's Ron. That's another really super good question. I'd say it's a mix. So the EV action, if you will, is super pocketed. So we really only see stuff in Europe. So when we convene and we talk about EV and who's doing what, I'd say it's all quiet on the Western front here in old U.S.A. But we see it in certain markets. It's pretty active, for example, in the Netherlands. It's starting to become active in the U.K. and it's -- interestingly, it's starting with the big accounts. \n And so what we are seeing is the corporate accounts, which I guess are trying to be green or whatever have more money and are willing to kind of dispose of the old-fashioned combustion assets are kind of the early adopters of the thing. So we are seeing some exchange, some transition among our client base at that level, at the corporate level. \n And then Part B is what you said. We're trying to get the model clear, okay? What spend -- I don't know if had a chance to flip through the supplement we put out. But to me, it's just almost shocking that to drive a van into a EV station in the U.K. or to drive an EV van into a public charge point, it's the same cost to the guy. The guy spends -- or the gal spends the same amount of money for those -- to fill up or the recharge. Like I don't know if that would be what people would think. \n But when you look at it based on the efficiency of the vehicles and the markup that the charge point guys are charging right there, you're like, oh, I didn't know that someone like FLEETCOR can actually get paid because there's real spend. And then this idea that we have live now of actually putting software at the employees' home to -- so he's not burdened with his own electricity costs and putting boxes and that stuff in, we're getting a bunch of money for that and a lot of demand for it. So it's a little of both. It's starting to head this way and then us trying to get out ahead of it so we can articulate what the model looks like. Yes. So let me be clear with you. We're not trying to give guidance, so let me go on the record. It's really just trying to say Chuck and I provide guidance here in the back half of $7, so just helping everybody with the math. So in a recurring business, that's an exit rate of $14, that's just what we provided. \n And then I just did want to comment on a couple of super happy things. We work on deals and these are kind of FLEETCOR wheelhouse deals. And so they're rich with synergies. So our confidence -- my confidence is super high in that kind of $0.50 to $0.70 increment because obviously, they're late coming into our company and the synergies are well as the year goes on. \n And the other thing is something the treasurer took me through a couple of weeks ago that we made a bad hedge or a roll off and so I'm happy. So I just want to make sure people are clear that there's some happy set of things in our business, including the exit rate of the business and these couple of things that we can see. But obviously, we're going to work hard to keep selling way more and buying way more. So I wouldn't, in one second, try to suggest that what I'm saying is anywhere near what the guidance is going to be. We'll cook that as we run through the year. David, it's Ron. Just the one add to Chuck's thing there is the retention. I think someone -- Sanjay asked me at the opening of the call, I should have called it, hey, what's surprised us so far? Fuel card retention. I called out at the top of the call, we hit an all-time high. I don't know if we break it out, Jim, or not, but we're showing up at 94% for the company. But inside of that, we hit 92% from the fuel card business. So when you roll that through our sequential model, that creates lift in the second half as well. So we're at all-time retention. We've had crazy good sales, to Chuck's point, and we're getting a little bit of macro happy from fuel and COVID recoveries. So you put it all together, things climb pretty good. Yes. David, yes, it's -- no, we think it's a pretty big idea. As I said, we're going live this month. And I think the trend is coming to us, right, that more and more of our both U.S. and European fuel card clients are using UI, using their phone and using the desktop and particularly going there to pay us, right, their invoices, right, whether they get an e-mail reminder. And so we have all these clients showing up pretty frequently inside our software UI. \n And so what we've done, what we've been working on is taking the Roger bill pay software and basically making it the bill payment system of record. So when you go into the UI and look over to pay something, that platform is working. So we don't really have to rebuild the bill pay platform in the network because we got that already. And obviously, we have all those capabilities from our other businesses, merchant networks and the deals we have with our friends at MasterCard. We have all that other stuff, vendors that do paper making and everything. \n So really, it's just customers. It's just seeing if the accounts are comfortable using the UI to do more than just pay us. And we'll have certainly a report for you back, but the numbers are just staggeringly big, right? It's over 100,000 just here in the United States are paying a bill every month on these UIs. So we're hopeful, I don't know if you want to call it the super app, but the idea is more and more people are using these software apps with us. We just want them to be more useful and we've got another product that's ready to go. So it's going live. Yes. So it's kind of almost free at this point to the client. We're looking at whether we should get subscription money for the software, if you will. But really, as you know, we get paid on the back end, mostly the stuff that we run through our cards and then obviously cross-border, call it, 8% to 10% of the stuff that could be cross-border. So we'll probably make it super attractive to our client base initially, get paid on the back side and then look to feather in some software SaaS fees as we go. John, it's Ron. That's also a good question. So first, just FYI for you, the company we bought 2 years ago called Nvoicepay in Portland was the pay provider to Coupa Pay. So we're pretty clear on what Coupa Pay is trying to do. I don't think you could ask them that they've done a lot today of combining the pay with the software, but I know that that's their ambition. \n So what I'd say is for a year or 2, we've studied and looked at a bunch of companies that have software that's kind of up the value chain, right, AP automation, scheduling approval, workflow software and even on top of that kind of procurement contract compliance kind of software that you've mentioned. Our take on it is it will be all of the above, which means some clients will just take that AP automation software like they do from Coupa and not to pay. Some people will just take pay like what we offer, and some people will take both. And I think I've repeated that we probably will offer that. We probably will offer the both. I don't know if we'll offer the stand-alone AP automation software or not, but that's our take that based on the size of the company and the industry that they're in and the research that we've done is it won't be one size fits all. It's not like everybody is going to do it one way. \n So we think it's a good idea. It's something that we'll look probably to offer. We do partner with people where we offer the pay into their software. So we're studying how well they're doing it. I call it, peanut butter and jelly. Is it going to be peanut butter and jelly? Or is it going to be not peanut butter and jelly? So I think the jury is still out on it. Yes. George, it's Ron. On the first part, the sales thing. So yes, I think I mentioned we've been surprised to the upside against the plan that we built. And I'd say this -- I'm sure it will sound funny to everybody, but it's been fuel. We've actually sold more year-to-date in the forecast. So the second half is actually higher in fuel than the plan that we built. So most of the overperformance against our internal expectations is fuel, and most of that overperformance is digital selling. We keep growing the share of new digital accounts that we're onboarding. And as I mentioned, we're investing more at the top to try to drive that. So that's the overperformance. \n I'd say everything else is kind of mostly on plan. We're super pleased with it. As you mentioned, the plan is up, way, way up from last year and even up against '19. So I'd say everybody else is kind of delivering what we hope for. \n On Part B, who knows on the infrastructure bill. I'd say, first, tell me what infrastructure is. And if it's like what it would be, what you think it would be, which is kind of fixing stuff and construction-centric, it could help us a lot. I'd say it looks a lot to us like the stimulus from last year obviously helped us get paid and helped a lot of our clients stay open and pay payroll. And so I'd say the same thing that if that comes to pass and gets funded and its regular old fashion kind of infrastructure where stuff gets built, we're pretty weighted concentrated in that construction segment. So it's got to help us. If there's more money and more work for those sets of companies, that will flow through to us. I'm not counting on it, George, by the way. It's a political thing. But if it comes to be and it comes to be the old-fashioned infrastructure, it's happy for FLEET. George, anything else?"

        "content": "Operator: Greetings. Welcome to FLEETCOR Technologies First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jim Eglseder. Thank you. You may begin. \nJames Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Charles Freund, our CFO. Following their prepared comments, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then that you can get in the line for questions. Please note that our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com.  \n Now throughout this call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website, as previously described.  \n I do need to remind everybody that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our recovery, outlook, new products and acquisitions and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We do not undertake any obligation to update any of these statements. \n These expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. \n Before we begin, I would like to make you aware that over the last few weeks, we posted 2 short videos to the Investor Relations website. The first is around our approach and strategy for electric vehicles as discussed by Alan King, who is the head of the U.K., Europe and ANZ for Fuel and heading up that effort for us. The second is a video providing some insight into our downmarket full AP product so you can get a feel for what it is and how it works. We had mentioned that we would likely spend some more time on these topics in the future, and this is an interim step while we continue to work on those efforts.  \n So now with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? \nRonald F. Clarke: Okay. Jim, thanks. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our first quarter 2021 earnings call. So upfront here, 3 subjects: first, my view of Q1 results; second, I'll share our rest of year outlook; and then third, talk a bit about how we're positioned for growth over the midterm.  \n Okay, let me turn to Q1 results. So we reported Q1 revenue of $609 million, really kind of spot on our expectations. Reported cash EPS of $2.82. That's a bit better than our guide, mostly helped by lower credit losses and fewer outstanding shares. The macro, not much of a factor. We really called the macro pretty well versus our guidance. We did have higher fuel prices but a bit lower spreads and so really no impact there.  \n Against the prior year, we reported a revenue decline of 8% and an organic revenue decline of 6%. Unfavorable Brazil FX hurting our prints and continued weak same-store client volume softness impacting our organic growth.  \n All right, let me make a turn to the trends in the quarter and share with you what we're seeing. So volume, sequential volume in Q1 versus Q4, pretty stable, as we expected, but we are now beginning to see a bit of an uptick here in April, so early signs of volume recovery. Same-store sales or what we call client softness really stuck at approximately minus 6%. This continues to reflect a small segment of our client base that is struggling to recover but fortunately still trying.  \n Retention, really terrific in Q1. We reported 93% overall retention. That's our best result in years. Credit losses, very low for the quarter, $2 million. That was helped by a $6 million recovery and again, lower sales rolling into this year. But the real story of Q1 is sales, so Q1 sales results, nothing -- really nothing short of fantastic. Consolidated sales finished 7% ahead of last year. Yes, 7% ahead of last year, so finally growing again.  \n If you rewind sales over the last 4 quarters, so sales versus prior year, 55%, 81%, 92% and now 107%. Inside of that, our fuel card businesses, both here and international, coming in ahead of the prior year, driven mostly by record digital sales. So for Q1, we signed 35,000 new business clients worldwide, 35,000. So again, a terrific result. So the summary for Q1, I'd call it an in-line result for volume, revenue and cash EPS, and I call it an outstanding result for credit performance, retention performance and most importantly, sales performance.  \n Okay. Let me transition to our rest of year 2021 outlook, along with the assumptions behind that. Included in our Q1 earnings supplement on Page 12, you'll see our updated guidance for the year. So full year '21 revenue expectations at the midpoint, $2,650,000,000. That's unchanged from last time. Reasons that we're staying put are: one, Q1 revenue, again, coming in kind of on plan; two, we've built in significant sequential revenue step-up in the forward quarters, probably in the range of $100 million up from Q1 to Q4. So our Q2, Q3, Q4 revenue guidance now assumes revenue growth in the high teens.  \n In terms of the COVID recovery in our outlook, I'd say it's a bit mixed. U.S. and U.K. look maybe better than our planned outline. But in our case, the Brazil COVID situation, worse, and so a pushback there in terms of recovery.  \n On the cash EPS front, we will flow through our $0.12 Q1 beat. We'll raise full year '21 cash EPS guidance at the midpoint to $12.42, so $12.42 for the base business. In terms of the AFEX acquisition, hopeful now to close that deal on June 1. Initially, we thought May 1. So as a result of the 1-month delay, we're going to take the expected in-year AFEX accretion at the midpoint to $0.18 versus $0.20 previously.  \n If you combine the base business and AFEX, our consolidated EPS outlook at the midpoint would be $12.60, $12.60 for the full year. I do want to add, we feel very good about the AFEX cross-border deal. They had a great Q1 performance and their management is really holding steady their rest of year forecast. \n All right. Let me make a turn over to our last subject today, which is how is FLEETCOR positioned for growth in '22 and beyond. So I do want to highlight just a few factors that give us confidence in sustainable growth. So one is the exit rate. So if we hit this rest of year guidance, our Q4 step-off will be quite strong heading into '22. And if we hit our rest of year sales plan, again, that will pour in-year revenues into 2022. \n Digital, I can't say enough about digital and the investments we're making in digital selling, digital UIs and customer experience, new ways of underwriting credit, and so the digital transformation making a big impact on the company. Third is EV. We're actually embracing EV, particularly in Europe. Early feedback really, really positive there that we may actually be advantaged in selling because of our integrated mixed fleet experience as well as this at-home recharging opportunity. It looks real. It looks like clients will pay subscriptions to basically measure and reimburse employee recharging at home. So potentially a new meaningful revenue opportunity that is nonexistent today.  \n Fourth factor, our Beyond strategy or our entry into new segments. So as we've discussed before, we're extending into new customer segments really in each of our major lines of business. So in corporate pay, the Roger deal helped us enter the SMB space. In lodging, a couple of deals last year helped us enter the airline accommodation space. And in Brazil, we've entered what we call the urban driver space. So in each of these cases, basically, we're extending our businesses, extending our TAM and obviously extending our longer-term sales opportunity.  \n Fifth factor is brand. We've just introduced our new Corpay brand aimed at unifying all of our various corporate payment assets. So this single brand will help our corporate payment business go to market with a single identity and hopefully give us an advantage with this broader bundle that we've got.  \n And then last factor is capital. Our balance sheet's in terrific shape. Leverage ratio 2.5x, liquidity approaching $2 billion. Again, our plan is to generate $1 billion-plus of annual free cash flow. We have the ability to lever up to 3x target, which would produce circa $8 billion in capital to invest in either M&A or buybacks over the forecast period. So obviously, upside for us via capital allocation.  \n So look, the takeaways from today: so one, Q1, I'd say again, an in-line Q1 financial performance but an outstanding Q1 sales performance. Rest of year, again, we're raising rest of year cash EPS at the midpoint to $12.42. That's excluding acquisitions, and the $12.60 at the midpoint, that's including AFEX, so tracking to deliver that, although again, fully aware of the uncertainties.  \n And then lastly, in terms of positioning, we really do feel well positioned to grow the company next year and beyond. Again, we expect a strong exit, which will pour into '22. We're extending each of our businesses into bigger TAMs, and we've got the available capital to drive incremental returns if we manage it well. \n So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter. \nCharles Freund: Thanks, Ron. For Q1 of 2021, we reported revenue of $609 million, down 8%; GAAP net income up 25% to $184 million, and GAAP net income per diluted share up 29% to $2.15. Included in our Q1 2020 results was the impact of the $90 million onetime loss related to a customer receivable in our cross-border payments business, which equated to $0.74 per diluted share, as reported last year.  \n Adjusted net income for the quarter decreased 8% to $242 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share decreased 6% to $2.82 as we continue to feel the effects of COVID on our businesses. Organic revenue growth improved 2 points sequentially to down 6% on a year-over-year basis. We saw improvement in every category except tolls as Brazil continues to grapple with incremental COVID-related shutdowns.  \n As a reminder, organic revenue neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads and includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed during the 2 years being compared. Our fuel category was down organically about 6% year-over-year, which was a 4-point improvement from Q4. The international fuel business growth was a bit better than North American growth as those international markets shut down earlier in the quarter last year, so had easier comps. \n The corporate payments category was down 5% in the first quarter, 1 point better than Q4, as improvements in virtual card and full AP were offset by FX, which was lapping a very strong Q1 last year. Full AP growth accelerated 14 points sequentially to 21% growth year-over-year, powered by continued strong new sales.  \n Tolls was up 3% compared with last year but down 4 points from Q4 of 2020 due to the aforementioned shutdowns in Brazil. Looking longer term, compared with Q1 of 2019, revenue was up 13% organically. The lodging category was down 14%, which was an improvement from down 25% last quarter, with domestic airline activity recovering faster than we expected. Gift showed organic growth of 2% year-over-year as that business felt the effects of COVID earlier in Q1 of 2020 than most of our other businesses. \n That said, we've seen real traction in digital card sales and in our B2B sales efforts where we are selling gift cards to businesses for use as incentives. Recognizing that the comps to 2020 may not be very helpful, we did add some comparisons to 2019 for organic revenue growth and sales, so you can see how we are trending compared with the most recent pre-COVID or \"normal year.\" That's available in the supplement we provided today.\n Looking further down the income statement. Total operating expenses were down 7% to $343 million, excluding the impact of the onetime loss in our cross-border payments business last year. The decrease was primarily due to better bad debt expense, lower expenses in Brazil due to the currency translation impact and lower T&E costs as travel and the associated expenses are much lower than last year. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses excluding the onetime loss were stable compared with Q1 of 2020 at approximately 56%.  \n In the quarter, bad debt was only $2.5 million or 1 basis point, as it included the benefit of a $6 million recovery for credit loss recorded in the first quarter of last year. Credit continues to be a bright spot, but we expect our bad debt to normalize as our new sales levels recover and grow. Interest expense decreased 20% to $29 million due to lower borrowings on our revolver and decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt.  \n Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 21.8%. Excluding the impact of the onetime loss in our cross-border payments business last year, our effective tax rate in Q1 of 2020 was 18.9%. The increase over last year's adjusted tax rate was due primarily to the level of excess tax benefit on employee stock option exercises relative to pretax income. \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $958 million of unrestricted cash, and we also had approximately $1 billion of undrawn availability on our revolver. In total, we had $3.5 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $915 million borrowed on our securitization facility. As of March 31, our leverage ratio was 2.48x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  \n We refinanced our securitization facility at the end of the first quarter, less than 6 months after our last refi. Recall that our normal 3-year term expired last fall when credit markets were unfavorable, so we entered into a 1-year note at LIBOR plus 125 basis points with a 37.5 basis point floor, expecting to refinance again when conditions improved. Our new securitization has a duration of 3 years at LIBOR plus 100 basis points with a floor of 0, so our effective all-in rate is approximately 50 basis points better, given the current level of LIBOR.  \n We've also just completed a refinance of our Term B credit facility, upsizing it to $1.15 billion for a new term of 7 years and maintaining the rate of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. We used the proceeds to pay off our existing Term B note, pay down the revolver, fund the AFEX acquisition and improve our liquidity position for future capital actions. \n We repurchased approximately 640,000 shares during the quarter for $170 million at an average price of $266 per share, and we have approximately $836 million in repurchase capacity remaining under our current authorization.  \n Now let me share some thoughts on our outlook. We are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion as improvements in some businesses such as domestic airline lodging are being offset by other places like Brazil and Europe that are experiencing incremental virus flare-ups and associated lockdowns. \n As we explained last quarter, our full year guidance assumes we recover about 1/3 of our Q4 exit revenue softness during calendar 2021, and that this recovery would account for about 4 to 5 percentage points of revenue growth in the second half.  \n Within that expectation, there is very little recovery impact assumed for Q1, a modest amount for Q2 and then an acceleration into the back half of the year. While we are seeing some puts and takes between businesses, our overall outlook remains intact. You can see our full updated guidance and assumptions in both our press release and our earnings supplement, so I won't reiterate them here.  \n We are raising the midpoint of our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance $0.12 to $12.42 to reflect our first quarter results compared to our expectations. Looking ahead, we are expecting Q2 2021 adjusted net income per diluted share to be in the range of $2.80 to $3 per share. Volumes should build throughout the year with the COVID recovery and our new growth initiatives gaining momentum.  \n As for AFEX, the closing is taking longer than we had hoped, but we still believe the deal will close by the end of the second quarter as we're nearing the finish line with all of the approvals we need from the various regulators globally. Because of the delay, the in-year benefit will be slightly less than what we expected in February. But the upside is that we've had more time to refine our integration plans, so we'll hit the ground running at full speed once we do close. \n With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: I was wondering if you could provide us with a little more detail on the Corpay initiative. Is this more of kind of a branding exercise? Or is there sort of tech integration and kind of organizational changes and sort of unifying the sales strategy underneath it all? Maybe if you could also just comment on Roger and your go-to -- the progress with your go-to-market efforts with that product, that would be great. \nRonald F. Clarke: Ramsey, it's Ron. It's mostly trying to unify the middle market corporate pay assets, but we're also going to rebrand the Roger SMB Corpay. So basically from small to middle market, we'll have 1 brand. \nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. All right. I also wanted to ask about the pace of the recovery at the enterprise versus SMB level. I know that's something that you've called out in the past. Are you starting to see a more even recovery evolve across the business or is it really still the large customers that are driving some of the recovery? \nRonald F. Clarke: That's a great question. The answer is it is becoming more even. We're seeing more recovery now among the SMB group, which is obviously helpful. So our revenues are improving a bit faster than our volume recovery. So it's good news. \nRamsey El-Assal: Starting to smooth out. All right. \nOperator: Our next question is from Pete Christiansen from Citigroup. \nPeter Christiansen: Nice push on the sales. I was wondering if you could provide us a bit of a breakdown on new sales in the corporate payments segment. What's the ear to the ground on there right now, I guess, ahead of launching this go-to-market with Corpay? And then my follow-up is along the lines of Ramsey's question is, how should we think about the main go-to-market push here with Corpay? Is this aligned with the whole UCX execution strategy in the back end? Just a sense of timing there would be helpful. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. In terms of the first part of the question, the sales, the answer is yes, kind of all the segments. I think I called out the fuel card businesses were ahead of the prior year, so was the corporate payments business. So really strength virtually everywhere, except, I'd say, Brazil. Brazil was a bit softer than we had outlooked mostly because of the COVID situation. So with that exception, really, the sales were super terrific. \n Yes. On the Corpay question, again, the answer is yes. I mean, again, as I mentioned earlier, it's unifying all of the products, which helps in a lot of ways, to your point. It helps not only with the UI in terms of being able to cross-sell and showcase but it also helps at the top of the funnel, being able to promote a broader line of things to prospective clients that are earlier in the cycle because who knows, per se, which product may be interesting at that moment? So we think there'll be benefits both engaging prospects at the top of the funnel, and then once we've got a client on one of the products, it would facilitate our ability to cross-sell it. \n So -- and then again, the comment I mentioned earlier that we're going to use the same brand kind of down market in SMB land is in the middle market. So it will look, we hope, as we put this thing out, pretty seamless to whoever is looking in. \nOperator: Our next question is from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. \nKenneth Suchoski: I just wanted to ask about the corporate payments segment as well. I guess, can you just talk about your ability to go direct to corporate payment customers in the SMB channel? Because we've heard that churn rates are higher there, so the unit economics might not make sense unless you kind of have that strong brand and history operating in that segment. So I'm just curious if you could talk about the opportunity there. Or is this really a cross-sell play into the existing base? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Ken, it's Ron again. It's a good question. I'd say that it is both. We're super excited about being able to take a bill pay product back to the hundreds of thousands of clients, both here and in Europe, and we've actually come up with some creative ways, we think, to get that product in front of our existing accounts. So that's one. \n But then the second one, to your point is, yes, we'll go out directly to SMB prospects. And clearly, digital has now become, I don't think 60% of our fuel card sales. We're getting lots of new smaller accounts via that channel. And we have a lot of other assets in corporate pay to be able to monetize it, for example, in the back end with our merchant network in terms of putting some of the payments through virtual cards. So we think that we can go out with pretty attractive proposals, if you will, out to the prospective accounts and still make a bunch of money, if you will, on the back end. So we'll go out both ways, both to existing clients and to prospective ones. \nKenneth Suchoski: Okay, that's really helpful. And I guess maybe just as a quick follow-up. I think you mentioned that there was some lower T&E expense in the quarter. I mean, what's the expectation to put some of those expenses back into the P&L now that sales are bouncing back? \nCharles Freund: Yes, Ken, this is Charles. What I'd say is that as always, we balance our investment with expenses with revenue. So as we continue to perform and grow, we'll be adding some of that expense back. We'll be reopening travel fairly soon here, so that will start to flow through, all of it, mostly to support sales and growth. And then as the volume does recover, there will be some throughput of that on the expense side and processing. \nOperator: Our next question is from John Coffey with Susquehanna Financial Group. \nJohn Coffey: My -- I guess, this the fourth or fifth question on corporate payments but it's a short one. When I see your revenues in the quarter, it looks like you actually had sequential growth in corporate payments. And I was wondering, I think in the call last quarter, you mentioned there was a lot of political-driven spend in Q4, which probably would have seemed like a bit of a onetime thing that would have really elevated Q4's revenues a bit, and I guess I thought maybe you would have seen a little bit of a decline there going into Q1. Is there any like 1 factor you would say that really drove this sequential growth in corporate payments? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. John, it's Ron. That's a super good question. Yes is the short answer. Everything you said was right. We did have a nice spike in Q4 from the political. It's really this full AP. If you recall, we bought a company just about 2 years ago called Nvoicepay that does AP automation, kind of full AP outsourcing, if you will, payments. And so that business, it's just going gangbusters is the short answer. \n We've, I think going back to the baseline of 2019, more than doubled the spend and revenue in that business. And I think we've got a plan to sell this year in '21 like 60% or 70% of the base of that business. So that business was picking over $50 million. We've got a plan to sell $35 million or $40 million. So we've got more of our sales energy and people basically against that particular product line. So that's what's creating the delta. \nJohn Coffey: Okay. Great. And by the way, as far as corporate payments go, with that being said about Nvoicepay, is there a good way to think of the cadence of revenues throughout the year? \nCharles Freund: Specifically for corporate pay? \nJohn Coffey: Yes. \nCharles Freund: Yes. So if we're looking at that business, we should also add to Ron's comments that the sales there are also quite good. The sales were up 18% year-over-year. If we look at then the sequential growth in full AP -- just 1 second. Yes. I mean, normally, I wouldn't give out too specific but I'd say it's going up circa 15% sequentially each quarter. \nOperator: Our next question is from David Koning with Baird. \nDavid Koning: I guess, my first question, just on the fuel segment itself, historically, I think sequentially, it would often be up about 5% or so. I guess I'm wondering, are we back to kind of normal seasonality? I know on a year-over-year basis, I guess, the one thing to think about spreads benefited $26 million, I think, last Q2. So just putting those 2 things in perspective, I guess, sequentially, maybe up 5% normally again and then the spread impact, are we thinking of that right? \nRonald F. Clarke: David, I'm not -- It's Ron. I'm not sure I got the question. Are you asking, \"Hey, as we exit this COVID time frame, do we think that the fuel card business is a 5% kind of normalized grower if you kick out spreads and COVID?\" Is that the question? \nDavid Koning: Yes. I'm actually just asking more just sequentially. I think in Q2, you used to grow, give or take, 5% sequentially, just kind of typical seasonal patterns. And are we back to kind of a little more normal seasonal pattern now sequentially in Q2? And then separately, just thinking about the spread impact. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. On the first part, I would say, even through COVID, we saw very similar seasonal patterns, to your point. Historically, there's more work days in Q2 and Q3, and obviously, the busier time certainly here in the U.S. and stuff vis-\u00e0-vis holiday. So yes, the answer to seasonality is it's kind of same old, same old. And yes, it would be in our guidance and stuff reflected the way that you just said. In terms of spreads, Chuck, do you want to take that one? \nCharles Freund: Yes, I'd say our view of spreads going into Q2 sequentially is relatively flat, maybe slightly improved as fuel prices are leveling out. To your point, year-over-year, they're going to be way down. Q2 of 2020 had kind of record spreads. \n In terms of the seasonality and sequential revenue within fuel, what I'd say is I'd remind you that we do have some COVID recovery planned in our forecast. So assuming that, that comes back, we should get a little bit higher than normal in terms of sequential growth in that business. But again, a lot of that recovery is still back-half focused but we have some plan for Q2. And we're seeing early, early signs in April. But as Ron mentioned, it's still early. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Dave, just to jump 1 last thing on what Chuck said. Your comment is right. Obviously, if you looked at the fuel prices in Q1, they were generally upticking kind of throughout the quarter, which obviously pressures spreads a bit. So as we were exiting the quarter and obviously, we've seen April, what you said is true. We'll have a bit better overall quarter if fuel prices stabilize because spreads have kind of normalized, to Chuck's point. So you're right that this quarter would be better than the full Q1. But if fuel prices stay the same, then we'd expect spreads to kind of stay normalized the balance of the year. \nDavid Koning: Got you. And just 1 quick follow-up. The provisions you called out, I saw in the cash flow statement the $2 million of credit provisions. Should we get back to the more $15 million to $20 million per quarter type range in the future or might it stay pretty low for a while? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Let me start and then Chuck can pick up. I'd say that probably short term, kind of this quarter, maybe in the next, it will probably continue to run a bit lower. And that's a function of a couple of things. One, the credit policies we had in place a lot in 2020, right, to be protective of the assets of the company. And then two, unfortunately, the amount of new sales we had in 2020 were lower than normal and lower than planned and they carry higher losses. \n So when you have a mix of less new to existing, you'll have lower credit losses. So those couple of things will make it a bit better. But I think as you roll forward, I think we would probably anticipate we get back more, David, to normalized levels because we've opened the credit patches, if you will, now, and again, our sales are way up as we said. So maybe a little bit kind of short term and then normalizing as you head to the back of the year. \nOperator: Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Ron, I want to ask about acquisitions and your appetite there. And any update? We've seen some of your peers pick up, I guess, in M&A activity and definitely there's some capital raising going on as well on the private side. So where's your head at there? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Tien-Tsin, good to hear your voice. Better, I'd say, probably like the peers that you call out. We were telling someone earlier today, we've actually gone back to real in-person meetings. I actually did a real-life M&A call a couple of weeks ago. We met the principals in real life, so that's kind of nice to actually see people. So yes, I mean, obviously, one of the reasons that we did the refi and upsized the thing is we do have a pipeline of deals. Like I mentioned, we're looking to close upon this AFEX thing here in a few weeks. And we have a couple of other things close in that we like. And so that was the basis for kind of lifting that liquidity. \n So it feels better to me. I mean, I don't say it's back to normal, but we've got things in the categories we like. We've got some accretive deals, which we tend to really like. So yes, we're in a -- I feel like we're back in really a better place, feeling comfortable, if you will, with some of the transactions in front of us. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Okay. Good. No, that's encouraging to hear. And I think on the -- just as a quick follow-up. I think you guys mentioned same-store was sort of still hovering in that down 6% level. I'm curious, because I get this question, on the client side, like how much of that is cyclical versus maybe structural? I know your client base is somewhat diversified, but any observations there on when they'll get back up to speed on the recovery? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. It's a super good question. So 2 comments, Tien-Tsin, back on that. The first one, which I think I mentioned in my opening comment, is we have the luxury of seeing April volume. So I'd say the first thing is we're actually seeing the thaw, if you will, in some of that same-store stuff, so some recovery literally already in some of the lines in April. \n And so our expectation -- my expectation is Q2 here is going to be the thawing that will move off of that 6% kind of flat line and see less of that, right, in this quarter. And then the second one, to your point, is we studied it to death here and it's just a super narrow set of clients again. So when we go in and look at the, call it, that 6% overall or consolidated softness and you run the distribution, you've got 1 decile that accounts for 100% of it. \n It's just there's a narrow set of clients that are in super impacted -- movie theater companies, cruise line companies, you name it, we've got clients that are in super hurt businesses. And so we're seeing, again, some that aren't that impacted already coming back in April. And my -- our sense, which is kind of built a bit into our guidance, is that some of those that are still significantly down will start to rebound here in the second half. \nOperator: Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: I know, Ron, you mentioned the U.S., U.K. are ahead of expectation, Brazil behind. But as the reopening's happening, anything that you're seeing that sort of stands out to you, especially relative to pre-pandemic trends as they come back? \nRonald F. Clarke: Nothing other than it's just incredibly pocketed, I guess, is what I'd say. I did call out the U.K., but as you know, we do have broader businesses in more countries over there. We're on the continent in 4 or 5 countries. We're in Russia. We're in Australia, New Zealand. And so to me, the fascinating thing is just how different the recovery and the softness is across those 5, 6, 7 countries would be the first call out. Like Russia is kind of -- I don't know if they had COVID, is booming again. And Australia and New Zealand are celebrating. They'd rid the thing. We see huge rebounds there. The U.K., the thawing is happening here in the second quarter. The Czech is going backwards. So the first comment is it's just incredibly kind of pocketed by place. \n And then the second one is really the comment I made to Tien-Tsin, which is it's incredibly, in our case, narrowly focused on a very, very small set of clients that again are causing the overall number, right, the consolidated number to be negative. And so those are the 2 things we see. And I did mention, and I think we're super surprised by the Brazil thing. Probably like others, we didn't anticipate that coming into the year that, that thing would get worse and that they would raise the restrictions and stuff. So that one, I'd say, is the one thing that's really mostly the surprise to us. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. And then maybe just to follow up on Tien-Tsin's question and your answers on the M&A. You also talked about the significant amount of liquidity or dry powder you have. I guess, how much of that dry powder do you think these deals that you're contemplating would eat up? And how long do you envision sort of having this much dry powder around? I mean, what -- would you consider stepping up the buyback if you felt like the inorganic opportunities weren't there? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, this particular situation, we have some transactions. Obviously, we announced publicly the AFEX thing at what, $450 million, Chuck, $450 million. And as I mentioned, we do have a few, call it, 3 deals that are quite late. And so the combination of those 2 things is what caused us to basically upsize the facility now. So that's kind of the short-term thing that we try to obviously prepare our liquidity situation for the pipeline that we see. \n But I think longer term, we really don't think about it that way. Deals are bumpy. Sometimes you spend a lot of money in a year. Sometimes we don't spend a lot, and we'd have enormous opportunities for liquidity based on where our leverage ratio is and the cash that we generate. So we really, I think, try to think about it short term, when we see a situation where we've got some stuff lined up. And then longer term, we really just focus it, honestly, on the M&A side. \n We look for super attractive things we have conviction in and then back our way into how to pay for it versus the other way around. But on your other comment, if we don't like our stock price, which obviously, there's been times we don't, we'll obviously increase liquidity and buy back shares. So again, I think the headline to you guys is we start by looking out at attractiveness of deals and how we feel about the price of our stock and then work our way back into what liquidity we need. \nSanjay Sakhrani: And I guess just 1 -- I'm sorry, 1 quick follow-up. Just the types of deals that you're looking at, are they pretty much bolt-on or are they getting into different verticals? \nRonald F. Clarke: We're actually looking at both. We've got a couple of deals, to use your word, bolt-ons. We call them in-category, so they're transactions that fit inside the 4 or 5 categories that we articulate to you guys that we like because they're super accretive. And we've got 1 thing in particular we're looking at that's kind of an adjacent, kind of not right in the middle of those 4 or 5 and kind of midsized $0.5 billion kind of sized deal. So it's a very interesting set of things sitting in front of us. \nOperator: Our next question is from Georgios Mihalos with Cowen and Company. \nPhilip Caldwell: This is Philip on for George. So I think you talked at the beginning of the call about your investment in the U.K. EV company, Mina. And you talked about the new subscription at-home option. I was just wondering, is that giving you more confidence that the economics around EV in the future will be more comparable to the current fuel card business? Or what is giving you confidence around your ability to compete in EV vehicles in the future? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, it does, Philip. It's a good question. So the headline answer is it does. And it does because we have actual real clients. And to your point, we actually have a real software solution that we're implementing. And so if you run a company in the U.K. and have gone to some mixed fleet, you've added 20 EV vehicles and you want us to help measure and reimburse that. And we talked to you about how we're going to get paid for it. The fact that real clients are paying meaningful amounts of subscription does help equalize, to your point, the economics of this thing as this thing converts. \n In addition, obviously, I try to say it a bit on the call is during this transition time, I really love our chances because it creates an advantage, right, as the company adds 10 new EV things, it's hard for anyone who doesn't already have the incumbency position and data on all the vehicles to go sell a guy some kind of phone, mobile solution or something to deal with the 10. Like why would they ever want that when we've made our card and mobile programs work at all the public EV recharging places as well as at home? \n And so in a kind of a really interesting twist here, the old-fashioned fuel car guy actually has the advantage because you can't blink and change out the installed base of all the vehicles in a day without obviously flushing a lot of value. So I'd say, as this thing has manifested itself, we're feeling better and better about the economic model of the future. \nPhilip Caldwell: Okay. Great. That's great color. And then just on a follow-up. With an infrastructure build being bandied around at the federal level in Washington, do you have any initial thoughts on how that might help your customers? I know you have a pretty decent exposure to construction customers. Is that something that you're thinking about impacting '21, '22 growth or not contemplated yet? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, who knows, to your point, where that bill goes? But the answer is yes to your question. I mean, we saw it in spades in this last bailout, the ability of a lot of our clients to be able to pay their invoices, and we got scared and credit and found out it was one of our best collection years ever. So obviously, stimulus money does find its way back. And to your point, a large part of our business, both here and in Europe, call it, circa 30% is in various forms of construction. \n So to the extent that the stimulus actually goes to that versus, I guess, some of the other things that are in the bill, it has to help us, to your point. It has to make the existing clients we have busier and obviously results in more revenue to us. So yes, it would be happy going into next year, for sure. \nOperator: Our next question is from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. \nTrevor Williams: On new sales, so it's good to see the step-up in the first quarter getting back above 2019. So if you just thinking if you continue to see that ramp throughout the year and especially in fuel, I mean, how quickly could you see some of those sales start to layer onto revenue? Just thinking about whether there could be some benefit even to numbers this year. And if there could be, if there's any impact embedded in the guide, or if we should be thinking more about the bulk of new sales as being a 2022 leading indicator. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I'd say, Trevor, it's Ron, that it's mostly the second thing. So we've got a lot of experience in the company by category of the translation of what we call new bookings or sales will start to roll call, right, the recognition of a new account. And when it converts, to your point, into in-year revenue, and that conversion rate varies a tremendous amount by the products we have. \n So for example, in fuel cards, it's probably 50%. If you sold $100 million, you'd get $50 million in-year. Or Brazil, if you sold $100 million, you might get $60 million or $70 million. But if you sold corporate pay in the middle market, you might get $20 million. So the conversion rates vary tremendously by the product category. But what I would say is, clearly, we're good at math, and so we built our '21 plan and guidance anticipating good sales. \n These sales were above what we did plan. But generally, that's all cooked into the plan and the guidance that we have. And so the biggest help is what I said, if we make this plan, which would be up over 30%, right? As you go into the next quarter, it's like we'll probably double Q2 sales because it was pretty low, but hopefully, be up over 30% for the full year. You've got lots of those categories like corporate pay where that revenue pours into '22. So people should listen carefully to the sales numbers, which I did try to call out. They really are an early leading indicator really of '22 revenue. \nTrevor Williams: Okay. No, that's really helpful. And then, Ron, you mentioned you're seeing some uptick in April, it sounds like. I mean, any way you guys could give us a sense of how things are trending quarter-to-date in April or even exited Q1 relative to 2019? The slide in the deck is really helpful, but just I'm curious if at any of the segments, if any of them either exited Q1 or quarter-to-date in April are trending higher relative to '19 than they did for Q1? Just to see where we might get some kind of meaningful sequential acceleration in Q2. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. That's another really good question. So again, it's super early. The data is kind of hot off the press. But what I mentioned is, selectively, we see areas where sequentially, the volumes are starting to come back to par, if you will. And even against the base period of 2019, we're seeing growth. \n So just to call out one, like in our international fuel card business, for example, which we kind of break into 4 markets, the U.K., Russia, Central Europe and Australia, 3 of those, the volumes in April are higher than they were in April of '19. And the 1 that's not is Central Europe, where again, the COVID restrictions are still in place. So we're seeing same in corporate pay. We see areas like the virtual card business that's way ahead of its baseline from April. The full AP, I think, I mentioned is more than double. The cross-border business is up. So a lot of the businesses are now, in April, ahead of their '19 baseline. \n There's a handful of stubborn ones that I mentioned that are more COVID-impacted like again, Central Europe, like the T&E card, which requires people like us to travel. Like the airline lodging business that we bought, it's coming back, but it's still soft against the prior period. So there's a handful 3 or 4 areas that are pretty stubborn and then 8, 10 areas that we're seeing the thing come back. So as I said, our view is we're going to see a change in same-store this quarter, Q2. And then we plan a pretty significant recovery again in Q3 and Q4, which will pour revenue and, more importantly, profit dollars into the second half. \nOperator: Our next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. \nRobert Napoli: Ron, a question on the corporate payments business in the long term. And your thoughts on balancing growth with margins, and you have a number of high-growth public and private companies that are investing very aggressively and looking at margins down the road where you're generating strong margins today. Do you have thoughts of aggressive -- and given the TAM and investing more aggressively at the expense of margins to accelerate growth, is that something that you've considered or would consider? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Bob, it's Ron. It's a terrific question. We actually had our Board meeting last week and actually covered this particular subject, competing in this strange time that we're in. And I think the couple of comments I'd give you is, one, we tried to build plans to invest more -- differentially more in that business than some of our others to try to target that business closer to 20% on the top versus kind of 10%, if you will, for the consolidated company. So that's point one, that inherent in our base plans, our overall profit plan, there's incremental investment to grow faster already. \n And then second, I think the conclusion that we got to coming out of the Board meeting on this is it depends on the investment. So if there's a clear investment we can make that's got an attractive return profile, we'll be back to you and the buy side with, \"Hey, look, we're going to slow earnings a bit, whatever, if we think we can make some great return.\" But again, it's got to be a return we can execute. So hey, if it's hire 100 people, I've told you a bunch of times, that's hard to add all those people execution-wise and make it work, versus if we could pour money into the top of the funnel of the digital thing, which is one of the lot -- reasons we did this Corpay unification, that might be a basis, right, where we could spend money effectively and see good returns. \n So I'd say nothing staring us in the face now. We've got lots of money, incremental capital. I think we're spending $20 million, $25 million of incremental capital above last year in IT. Half of that's in corporate pay. We're spending more in sales. And so if we got the right kind of investment, I think the answer is we would do it. \nRobert Napoli: That's helpful. And then a question on the lodging business, and I don't think we really touched too much on that. I was wondering just your thoughts on -- that business, I know, has been a very attractive return business. You've been investing in it over the years. What are you seeing in that business sequentially like through the first quarter into April? And then your thoughts on the opportunities to invest in that business over the longer term because I do think you drive some of your higher margins there. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. It's a super business, to your point, because again, we're pretty specialized, right? We're in the workforce segment, think blue collar people that drive off and cut trees and then in the airline accommodation where we're connected literally into the airline's systems. So we know that the 2 or plus pilots are going to show up somewhere tomorrow. \n So the answer is, obviously, it's recovering. It was one of those businesses hurt really the most a year ago. So we've gotten a lot of it back already in the workforce side. And I'd say we're probably half of the way back. In fact, it's the 1 area that outperformed the COVID recovery in the first quarter. For each line of business, we plan a certain amount of softness, if you will, coming back, and the airline business actually came back faster than we planned. \n So I think it's on track, depending on what happens over the next couple of months, to have a huge recovery, right, in the second half. And we're selling a lot. Like I'm looking at the sales, we continue to sell a lot in that business. We've got some attractive adjacencies in the business. It's probably our highest margin business. So to your point, there's a lot to like about it, and people should keep their eyes open. We're probably going to do more of it. \nOperator: And our final question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. \nDavid Togut: On a normalized basis, post-COVID, do you expect to resume FLEET's historic growth model of high single to low double-digit organic revenue growth plus a couple of points of acquisition growth and/or share repurchase, driving 15% to 20% EPS growth? And if so, when do you expect to reestablish that growth model? \nRonald F. Clarke: David, it's Ron. It's a great question. I think if I've been repetitive on something it's been 10-13-19, 10-13-19, which is if we can grow revenues organically 10%, we can grow operating EBITDA, if you will, faster because of the operating leverage and then use the $1 billion of capital to either buy earnings or buy shares. So we've proven, I guess, Chuck, over 20 years, we've compounded, David, at over 20%. \n So the reminder to you and others out there is, I think for full year calendar '18 and full year calendar '19, the business grew 10% organically in those 2 most recent years until we hit COVID here in 2020. And so my expectation is that we will be back there in -- certainly in '22. And part of it is, again, the setup is just so good in terms of the exit rate that if we get this recovery in the second half and we make the sales that we're making, the exit rate pouring into '22 will obviously be super attractive. \n And then to your point, the deal we've announced and a couple we're working on will be, as I've mentioned before, quite accretive. And so it all points, I tried to say it in the thing, I think the business, because of the pain we took last year, is particularly well set up to get a good number in '22. And then what I'd say to you is we like our chances after that because we're diversifying the space, right, in the businesses, the fuel card thing chasing EV and launching, chasing new categories and getting into SMB and corporate payments. We're not sitting still just kind of twiddling the places that we're in, David. \n And so I think it's -- I think we sit here more optimistic about the future because we're coming out. We're freaking coming out, finally coming out of the woods here and can kind of see the other side, and that sets up well for us. So I'd say, '22 will be better and then we like our chances after that. \nOperator: We have reached the end of today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Charles Freund",
            "content": "Thanks, Ron. For Q1 of 2021, we reported revenue of $609 million, down 8%; GAAP net income up 25% to $184 million, and GAAP net income per diluted share up 29% to $2.15. Included in our Q1 2020 results was the impact of the $90 million onetime loss related to a customer receivable in our cross-border payments business, which equated to $0.74 per diluted share, as reported last year.  \n Adjusted net income for the quarter decreased 8% to $242 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share decreased 6% to $2.82 as we continue to feel the effects of COVID on our businesses. Organic revenue growth improved 2 points sequentially to down 6% on a year-over-year basis. We saw improvement in every category except tolls as Brazil continues to grapple with incremental COVID-related shutdowns.  \n As a reminder, organic revenue neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads and includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed during the 2 years being compared. Our fuel category was down organically about 6% year-over-year, which was a 4-point improvement from Q4. The international fuel business growth was a bit better than North American growth as those international markets shut down earlier in the quarter last year, so had easier comps. \n The corporate payments category was down 5% in the first quarter, 1 point better than Q4, as improvements in virtual card and full AP were offset by FX, which was lapping a very strong Q1 last year. Full AP growth accelerated 14 points sequentially to 21% growth year-over-year, powered by continued strong new sales.  \n Tolls was up 3% compared with last year but down 4 points from Q4 of 2020 due to the aforementioned shutdowns in Brazil. Looking longer term, compared with Q1 of 2019, revenue was up 13% organically. The lodging category was down 14%, which was an improvement from down 25% last quarter, with domestic airline activity recovering faster than we expected. Gift showed organic growth of 2% year-over-year as that business felt the effects of COVID earlier in Q1 of 2020 than most of our other businesses. \n That said, we've seen real traction in digital card sales and in our B2B sales efforts where we are selling gift cards to businesses for use as incentives. Recognizing that the comps to 2020 may not be very helpful, we did add some comparisons to 2019 for organic revenue growth and sales, so you can see how we are trending compared with the most recent pre-COVID or \"normal year.\" That's available in the supplement we provided today.\n Looking further down the income statement. Total operating expenses were down 7% to $343 million, excluding the impact of the onetime loss in our cross-border payments business last year. The decrease was primarily due to better bad debt expense, lower expenses in Brazil due to the currency translation impact and lower T&E costs as travel and the associated expenses are much lower than last year. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses excluding the onetime loss were stable compared with Q1 of 2020 at approximately 56%.  \n In the quarter, bad debt was only $2.5 million or 1 basis point, as it included the benefit of a $6 million recovery for credit loss recorded in the first quarter of last year. Credit continues to be a bright spot, but we expect our bad debt to normalize as our new sales levels recover and grow. Interest expense decreased 20% to $29 million due to lower borrowings on our revolver and decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt.  \n Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 21.8%. Excluding the impact of the onetime loss in our cross-border payments business last year, our effective tax rate in Q1 of 2020 was 18.9%. The increase over last year's adjusted tax rate was due primarily to the level of excess tax benefit on employee stock option exercises relative to pretax income. \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $958 million of unrestricted cash, and we also had approximately $1 billion of undrawn availability on our revolver. In total, we had $3.5 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $915 million borrowed on our securitization facility. As of March 31, our leverage ratio was 2.48x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  \n We refinanced our securitization facility at the end of the first quarter, less than 6 months after our last refi. Recall that our normal 3-year term expired last fall when credit markets were unfavorable, so we entered into a 1-year note at LIBOR plus 125 basis points with a 37.5 basis point floor, expecting to refinance again when conditions improved. Our new securitization has a duration of 3 years at LIBOR plus 100 basis points with a floor of 0, so our effective all-in rate is approximately 50 basis points better, given the current level of LIBOR.  \n We've also just completed a refinance of our Term B credit facility, upsizing it to $1.15 billion for a new term of 7 years and maintaining the rate of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. We used the proceeds to pay off our existing Term B note, pay down the revolver, fund the AFEX acquisition and improve our liquidity position for future capital actions. \n We repurchased approximately 640,000 shares during the quarter for $170 million at an average price of $266 per share, and we have approximately $836 million in repurchase capacity remaining under our current authorization.  \n Now let me share some thoughts on our outlook. We are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion as improvements in some businesses such as domestic airline lodging are being offset by other places like Brazil and Europe that are experiencing incremental virus flare-ups and associated lockdowns. \n As we explained last quarter, our full year guidance assumes we recover about 1/3 of our Q4 exit revenue softness during calendar 2021, and that this recovery would account for about 4 to 5 percentage points of revenue growth in the second half.  \n Within that expectation, there is very little recovery impact assumed for Q1, a modest amount for Q2 and then an acceleration into the back half of the year. While we are seeing some puts and takes between businesses, our overall outlook remains intact. You can see our full updated guidance and assumptions in both our press release and our earnings supplement, so I won't reiterate them here.  \n We are raising the midpoint of our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance $0.12 to $12.42 to reflect our first quarter results compared to our expectations. Looking ahead, we are expecting Q2 2021 adjusted net income per diluted share to be in the range of $2.80 to $3 per share. Volumes should build throughout the year with the COVID recovery and our new growth initiatives gaining momentum.  \n As for AFEX, the closing is taking longer than we had hoped, but we still believe the deal will close by the end of the second quarter as we're nearing the finish line with all of the approvals we need from the various regulators globally. Because of the delay, the in-year benefit will be slightly less than what we expected in February. But the upside is that we've had more time to refine our integration plans, so we'll hit the ground running at full speed once we do close. \n With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions. Yes, Ken, this is Charles. What I'd say is that as always, we balance our investment with expenses with revenue. So as we continue to perform and grow, we'll be adding some of that expense back. We'll be reopening travel fairly soon here, so that will start to flow through, all of it, mostly to support sales and growth. And then as the volume does recover, there will be some throughput of that on the expense side and processing. Specifically for corporate pay? Yes. So if we're looking at that business, we should also add to Ron's comments that the sales there are also quite good. The sales were up 18% year-over-year. If we look at then the sequential growth in full AP -- just 1 second. Yes. I mean, normally, I wouldn't give out too specific but I'd say it's going up circa 15% sequentially each quarter. Yes, I'd say our view of spreads going into Q2 sequentially is relatively flat, maybe slightly improved as fuel prices are leveling out. To your point, year-over-year, they're going to be way down. Q2 of 2020 had kind of record spreads. \n In terms of the seasonality and sequential revenue within fuel, what I'd say is I'd remind you that we do have some COVID recovery planned in our forecast. So assuming that, that comes back, we should get a little bit higher than normal in terms of sequential growth in that business. But again, a lot of that recovery is still back-half focused but we have some plan for Q2. And we're seeing early, early signs in April. But as Ron mentioned, it's still early."

            "name": "Ronald F. Clarke",
            "content": "Okay. Jim, thanks. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our first quarter 2021 earnings call. So upfront here, 3 subjects: first, my view of Q1 results; second, I'll share our rest of year outlook; and then third, talk a bit about how we're positioned for growth over the midterm.  \n Okay, let me turn to Q1 results. So we reported Q1 revenue of $609 million, really kind of spot on our expectations. Reported cash EPS of $2.82. That's a bit better than our guide, mostly helped by lower credit losses and fewer outstanding shares. The macro, not much of a factor. We really called the macro pretty well versus our guidance. We did have higher fuel prices but a bit lower spreads and so really no impact there.  \n Against the prior year, we reported a revenue decline of 8% and an organic revenue decline of 6%. Unfavorable Brazil FX hurting our prints and continued weak same-store client volume softness impacting our organic growth.  \n All right, let me make a turn to the trends in the quarter and share with you what we're seeing. So volume, sequential volume in Q1 versus Q4, pretty stable, as we expected, but we are now beginning to see a bit of an uptick here in April, so early signs of volume recovery. Same-store sales or what we call client softness really stuck at approximately minus 6%. This continues to reflect a small segment of our client base that is struggling to recover but fortunately still trying.  \n Retention, really terrific in Q1. We reported 93% overall retention. That's our best result in years. Credit losses, very low for the quarter, $2 million. That was helped by a $6 million recovery and again, lower sales rolling into this year. But the real story of Q1 is sales, so Q1 sales results, nothing -- really nothing short of fantastic. Consolidated sales finished 7% ahead of last year. Yes, 7% ahead of last year, so finally growing again.  \n If you rewind sales over the last 4 quarters, so sales versus prior year, 55%, 81%, 92% and now 107%. Inside of that, our fuel card businesses, both here and international, coming in ahead of the prior year, driven mostly by record digital sales. So for Q1, we signed 35,000 new business clients worldwide, 35,000. So again, a terrific result. So the summary for Q1, I'd call it an in-line result for volume, revenue and cash EPS, and I call it an outstanding result for credit performance, retention performance and most importantly, sales performance.  \n Okay. Let me transition to our rest of year 2021 outlook, along with the assumptions behind that. Included in our Q1 earnings supplement on Page 12, you'll see our updated guidance for the year. So full year '21 revenue expectations at the midpoint, $2,650,000,000. That's unchanged from last time. Reasons that we're staying put are: one, Q1 revenue, again, coming in kind of on plan; two, we've built in significant sequential revenue step-up in the forward quarters, probably in the range of $100 million up from Q1 to Q4. So our Q2, Q3, Q4 revenue guidance now assumes revenue growth in the high teens.  \n In terms of the COVID recovery in our outlook, I'd say it's a bit mixed. U.S. and U.K. look maybe better than our planned outline. But in our case, the Brazil COVID situation, worse, and so a pushback there in terms of recovery.  \n On the cash EPS front, we will flow through our $0.12 Q1 beat. We'll raise full year '21 cash EPS guidance at the midpoint to $12.42, so $12.42 for the base business. In terms of the AFEX acquisition, hopeful now to close that deal on June 1. Initially, we thought May 1. So as a result of the 1-month delay, we're going to take the expected in-year AFEX accretion at the midpoint to $0.18 versus $0.20 previously.  \n If you combine the base business and AFEX, our consolidated EPS outlook at the midpoint would be $12.60, $12.60 for the full year. I do want to add, we feel very good about the AFEX cross-border deal. They had a great Q1 performance and their management is really holding steady their rest of year forecast. \n All right. Let me make a turn over to our last subject today, which is how is FLEETCOR positioned for growth in '22 and beyond. So I do want to highlight just a few factors that give us confidence in sustainable growth. So one is the exit rate. So if we hit this rest of year guidance, our Q4 step-off will be quite strong heading into '22. And if we hit our rest of year sales plan, again, that will pour in-year revenues into 2022. \n Digital, I can't say enough about digital and the investments we're making in digital selling, digital UIs and customer experience, new ways of underwriting credit, and so the digital transformation making a big impact on the company. Third is EV. We're actually embracing EV, particularly in Europe. Early feedback really, really positive there that we may actually be advantaged in selling because of our integrated mixed fleet experience as well as this at-home recharging opportunity. It looks real. It looks like clients will pay subscriptions to basically measure and reimburse employee recharging at home. So potentially a new meaningful revenue opportunity that is nonexistent today.  \n Fourth factor, our Beyond strategy or our entry into new segments. So as we've discussed before, we're extending into new customer segments really in each of our major lines of business. So in corporate pay, the Roger deal helped us enter the SMB space. In lodging, a couple of deals last year helped us enter the airline accommodation space. And in Brazil, we've entered what we call the urban driver space. So in each of these cases, basically, we're extending our businesses, extending our TAM and obviously extending our longer-term sales opportunity.  \n Fifth factor is brand. We've just introduced our new Corpay brand aimed at unifying all of our various corporate payment assets. So this single brand will help our corporate payment business go to market with a single identity and hopefully give us an advantage with this broader bundle that we've got.  \n And then last factor is capital. Our balance sheet's in terrific shape. Leverage ratio 2.5x, liquidity approaching $2 billion. Again, our plan is to generate $1 billion-plus of annual free cash flow. We have the ability to lever up to 3x target, which would produce circa $8 billion in capital to invest in either M&A or buybacks over the forecast period. So obviously, upside for us via capital allocation.  \n So look, the takeaways from today: so one, Q1, I'd say again, an in-line Q1 financial performance but an outstanding Q1 sales performance. Rest of year, again, we're raising rest of year cash EPS at the midpoint to $12.42. That's excluding acquisitions, and the $12.60 at the midpoint, that's including AFEX, so tracking to deliver that, although again, fully aware of the uncertainties.  \n And then lastly, in terms of positioning, we really do feel well positioned to grow the company next year and beyond. Again, we expect a strong exit, which will pour into '22. We're extending each of our businesses into bigger TAMs, and we've got the available capital to drive incremental returns if we manage it well. \n So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter. Ramsey, it's Ron. It's mostly trying to unify the middle market corporate pay assets, but we're also going to rebrand the Roger SMB Corpay. So basically from small to middle market, we'll have 1 brand. That's a great question. The answer is it is becoming more even. We're seeing more recovery now among the SMB group, which is obviously helpful. So our revenues are improving a bit faster than our volume recovery. So it's good news. Yes. In terms of the first part of the question, the sales, the answer is yes, kind of all the segments. I think I called out the fuel card businesses were ahead of the prior year, so was the corporate payments business. So really strength virtually everywhere, except, I'd say, Brazil. Brazil was a bit softer than we had outlooked mostly because of the COVID situation. So with that exception, really, the sales were super terrific. \n Yes. On the Corpay question, again, the answer is yes. I mean, again, as I mentioned earlier, it's unifying all of the products, which helps in a lot of ways, to your point. It helps not only with the UI in terms of being able to cross-sell and showcase but it also helps at the top of the funnel, being able to promote a broader line of things to prospective clients that are earlier in the cycle because who knows, per se, which product may be interesting at that moment? So we think there'll be benefits both engaging prospects at the top of the funnel, and then once we've got a client on one of the products, it would facilitate our ability to cross-sell it. \n So -- and then again, the comment I mentioned earlier that we're going to use the same brand kind of down market in SMB land is in the middle market. So it will look, we hope, as we put this thing out, pretty seamless to whoever is looking in. Yes. Ken, it's Ron again. It's a good question. I'd say that it is both. We're super excited about being able to take a bill pay product back to the hundreds of thousands of clients, both here and in Europe, and we've actually come up with some creative ways, we think, to get that product in front of our existing accounts. So that's one. \n But then the second one, to your point is, yes, we'll go out directly to SMB prospects. And clearly, digital has now become, I don't think 60% of our fuel card sales. We're getting lots of new smaller accounts via that channel. And we have a lot of other assets in corporate pay to be able to monetize it, for example, in the back end with our merchant network in terms of putting some of the payments through virtual cards. So we think that we can go out with pretty attractive proposals, if you will, out to the prospective accounts and still make a bunch of money, if you will, on the back end. So we'll go out both ways, both to existing clients and to prospective ones. Yes. John, it's Ron. That's a super good question. Yes is the short answer. Everything you said was right. We did have a nice spike in Q4 from the political. It's really this full AP. If you recall, we bought a company just about 2 years ago called Nvoicepay that does AP automation, kind of full AP outsourcing, if you will, payments. And so that business, it's just going gangbusters is the short answer. \n We've, I think going back to the baseline of 2019, more than doubled the spend and revenue in that business. And I think we've got a plan to sell this year in '21 like 60% or 70% of the base of that business. So that business was picking over $50 million. We've got a plan to sell $35 million or $40 million. So we've got more of our sales energy and people basically against that particular product line. So that's what's creating the delta. David, I'm not -- It's Ron. I'm not sure I got the question. Are you asking, \"Hey, as we exit this COVID time frame, do we think that the fuel card business is a 5% kind of normalized grower if you kick out spreads and COVID?\" Is that the question? Yes. On the first part, I would say, even through COVID, we saw very similar seasonal patterns, to your point. Historically, there's more work days in Q2 and Q3, and obviously, the busier time certainly here in the U.S. and stuff vis-a\u0300-vis holiday. So yes, the answer to seasonality is it's kind of same old, same old. And yes, it would be in our guidance and stuff reflected the way that you just said. In terms of spreads, Chuck, do you want to take that one? Yes. Dave, just to jump 1 last thing on what Chuck said. Your comment is right. Obviously, if you looked at the fuel prices in Q1, they were generally upticking kind of throughout the quarter, which obviously pressures spreads a bit. So as we were exiting the quarter and obviously, we've seen April, what you said is true. We'll have a bit better overall quarter if fuel prices stabilize because spreads have kind of normalized, to Chuck's point. So you're right that this quarter would be better than the full Q1. But if fuel prices stay the same, then we'd expect spreads to kind of stay normalized the balance of the year. Yes. Let me start and then Chuck can pick up. I'd say that probably short term, kind of this quarter, maybe in the next, it will probably continue to run a bit lower. And that's a function of a couple of things. One, the credit policies we had in place a lot in 2020, right, to be protective of the assets of the company. And then two, unfortunately, the amount of new sales we had in 2020 were lower than normal and lower than planned and they carry higher losses. \n So when you have a mix of less new to existing, you'll have lower credit losses. So those couple of things will make it a bit better. But I think as you roll forward, I think we would probably anticipate we get back more, David, to normalized levels because we've opened the credit patches, if you will, now, and again, our sales are way up as we said. So maybe a little bit kind of short term and then normalizing as you head to the back of the year. Yes. Tien-Tsin, good to hear your voice. Better, I'd say, probably like the peers that you call out. We were telling someone earlier today, we've actually gone back to real in-person meetings. I actually did a real-life M&A call a couple of weeks ago. We met the principals in real life, so that's kind of nice to actually see people. So yes, I mean, obviously, one of the reasons that we did the refi and upsized the thing is we do have a pipeline of deals. Like I mentioned, we're looking to close upon this AFEX thing here in a few weeks. And we have a couple of other things close in that we like. And so that was the basis for kind of lifting that liquidity. \n So it feels better to me. I mean, I don't say it's back to normal, but we've got things in the categories we like. We've got some accretive deals, which we tend to really like. So yes, we're in a -- I feel like we're back in really a better place, feeling comfortable, if you will, with some of the transactions in front of us. Yes. It's a super good question. So 2 comments, Tien-Tsin, back on that. The first one, which I think I mentioned in my opening comment, is we have the luxury of seeing April volume. So I'd say the first thing is we're actually seeing the thaw, if you will, in some of that same-store stuff, so some recovery literally already in some of the lines in April. \n And so our expectation -- my expectation is Q2 here is going to be the thawing that will move off of that 6% kind of flat line and see less of that, right, in this quarter. And then the second one, to your point, is we studied it to death here and it's just a super narrow set of clients again. So when we go in and look at the, call it, that 6% overall or consolidated softness and you run the distribution, you've got 1 decile that accounts for 100% of it. \n It's just there's a narrow set of clients that are in super impacted -- movie theater companies, cruise line companies, you name it, we've got clients that are in super hurt businesses. And so we're seeing, again, some that aren't that impacted already coming back in April. And my -- our sense, which is kind of built a bit into our guidance, is that some of those that are still significantly down will start to rebound here in the second half. Nothing other than it's just incredibly pocketed, I guess, is what I'd say. I did call out the U.K., but as you know, we do have broader businesses in more countries over there. We're on the continent in 4 or 5 countries. We're in Russia. We're in Australia, New Zealand. And so to me, the fascinating thing is just how different the recovery and the softness is across those 5, 6, 7 countries would be the first call out. Like Russia is kind of -- I don't know if they had COVID, is booming again. And Australia and New Zealand are celebrating. They'd rid the thing. We see huge rebounds there. The U.K., the thawing is happening here in the second quarter. The Czech is going backwards. So the first comment is it's just incredibly kind of pocketed by place. \n And then the second one is really the comment I made to Tien-Tsin, which is it's incredibly, in our case, narrowly focused on a very, very small set of clients that again are causing the overall number, right, the consolidated number to be negative. And so those are the 2 things we see. And I did mention, and I think we're super surprised by the Brazil thing. Probably like others, we didn't anticipate that coming into the year that, that thing would get worse and that they would raise the restrictions and stuff. So that one, I'd say, is the one thing that's really mostly the surprise to us. Yes. I mean, this particular situation, we have some transactions. Obviously, we announced publicly the AFEX thing at what, $450 million, Chuck, $450 million. And as I mentioned, we do have a few, call it, 3 deals that are quite late. And so the combination of those 2 things is what caused us to basically upsize the facility now. So that's kind of the short-term thing that we try to obviously prepare our liquidity situation for the pipeline that we see. \n But I think longer term, we really don't think about it that way. Deals are bumpy. Sometimes you spend a lot of money in a year. Sometimes we don't spend a lot, and we'd have enormous opportunities for liquidity based on where our leverage ratio is and the cash that we generate. So we really, I think, try to think about it short term, when we see a situation where we've got some stuff lined up. And then longer term, we really just focus it, honestly, on the M&A side. \n We look for super attractive things we have conviction in and then back our way into how to pay for it versus the other way around. But on your other comment, if we don't like our stock price, which obviously, there's been times we don't, we'll obviously increase liquidity and buy back shares. So again, I think the headline to you guys is we start by looking out at attractiveness of deals and how we feel about the price of our stock and then work our way back into what liquidity we need. We're actually looking at both. We've got a couple of deals, to use your word, bolt-ons. We call them in-category, so they're transactions that fit inside the 4 or 5 categories that we articulate to you guys that we like because they're super accretive. And we've got 1 thing in particular we're looking at that's kind of an adjacent, kind of not right in the middle of those 4 or 5 and kind of midsized $0.5 billion kind of sized deal. So it's a very interesting set of things sitting in front of us. Yes, it does, Philip. It's a good question. So the headline answer is it does. And it does because we have actual real clients. And to your point, we actually have a real software solution that we're implementing. And so if you run a company in the U.K. and have gone to some mixed fleet, you've added 20 EV vehicles and you want us to help measure and reimburse that. And we talked to you about how we're going to get paid for it. The fact that real clients are paying meaningful amounts of subscription does help equalize, to your point, the economics of this thing as this thing converts. \n In addition, obviously, I try to say it a bit on the call is during this transition time, I really love our chances because it creates an advantage, right, as the company adds 10 new EV things, it's hard for anyone who doesn't already have the incumbency position and data on all the vehicles to go sell a guy some kind of phone, mobile solution or something to deal with the 10. Like why would they ever want that when we've made our card and mobile programs work at all the public EV recharging places as well as at home? \n And so in a kind of a really interesting twist here, the old-fashioned fuel car guy actually has the advantage because you can't blink and change out the installed base of all the vehicles in a day without obviously flushing a lot of value. So I'd say, as this thing has manifested itself, we're feeling better and better about the economic model of the future. Yes. I mean, who knows, to your point, where that bill goes? But the answer is yes to your question. I mean, we saw it in spades in this last bailout, the ability of a lot of our clients to be able to pay their invoices, and we got scared and credit and found out it was one of our best collection years ever. So obviously, stimulus money does find its way back. And to your point, a large part of our business, both here and in Europe, call it, circa 30% is in various forms of construction. \n So to the extent that the stimulus actually goes to that versus, I guess, some of the other things that are in the bill, it has to help us, to your point. It has to make the existing clients we have busier and obviously results in more revenue to us. So yes, it would be happy going into next year, for sure. Yes. I'd say, Trevor, it's Ron, that it's mostly the second thing. So we've got a lot of experience in the company by category of the translation of what we call new bookings or sales will start to roll call, right, the recognition of a new account. And when it converts, to your point, into in-year revenue, and that conversion rate varies a tremendous amount by the products we have. \n So for example, in fuel cards, it's probably 50%. If you sold $100 million, you'd get $50 million in-year. Or Brazil, if you sold $100 million, you might get $60 million or $70 million. But if you sold corporate pay in the middle market, you might get $20 million. So the conversion rates vary tremendously by the product category. But what I would say is, clearly, we're good at math, and so we built our '21 plan and guidance anticipating good sales. \n These sales were above what we did plan. But generally, that's all cooked into the plan and the guidance that we have. And so the biggest help is what I said, if we make this plan, which would be up over 30%, right? As you go into the next quarter, it's like we'll probably double Q2 sales because it was pretty low, but hopefully, be up over 30% for the full year. You've got lots of those categories like corporate pay where that revenue pours into '22. So people should listen carefully to the sales numbers, which I did try to call out. They really are an early leading indicator really of '22 revenue. Yes. That's another really good question. So again, it's super early. The data is kind of hot off the press. But what I mentioned is, selectively, we see areas where sequentially, the volumes are starting to come back to par, if you will. And even against the base period of 2019, we're seeing growth. \n So just to call out one, like in our international fuel card business, for example, which we kind of break into 4 markets, the U.K., Russia, Central Europe and Australia, 3 of those, the volumes in April are higher than they were in April of '19. And the 1 that's not is Central Europe, where again, the COVID restrictions are still in place. So we're seeing same in corporate pay. We see areas like the virtual card business that's way ahead of its baseline from April. The full AP, I think, I mentioned is more than double. The cross-border business is up. So a lot of the businesses are now, in April, ahead of their '19 baseline. \n There's a handful of stubborn ones that I mentioned that are more COVID-impacted like again, Central Europe, like the T&E card, which requires people like us to travel. Like the airline lodging business that we bought, it's coming back, but it's still soft against the prior period. So there's a handful 3 or 4 areas that are pretty stubborn and then 8, 10 areas that we're seeing the thing come back. So as I said, our view is we're going to see a change in same-store this quarter, Q2. And then we plan a pretty significant recovery again in Q3 and Q4, which will pour revenue and, more importantly, profit dollars into the second half. Yes. Bob, it's Ron. It's a terrific question. We actually had our Board meeting last week and actually covered this particular subject, competing in this strange time that we're in. And I think the couple of comments I'd give you is, one, we tried to build plans to invest more -- differentially more in that business than some of our others to try to target that business closer to 20% on the top versus kind of 10%, if you will, for the consolidated company. So that's point one, that inherent in our base plans, our overall profit plan, there's incremental investment to grow faster already. \n And then second, I think the conclusion that we got to coming out of the Board meeting on this is it depends on the investment. So if there's a clear investment we can make that's got an attractive return profile, we'll be back to you and the buy side with, \"Hey, look, we're going to slow earnings a bit, whatever, if we think we can make some great return.\" But again, it's got to be a return we can execute. So hey, if it's hire 100 people, I've told you a bunch of times, that's hard to add all those people execution-wise and make it work, versus if we could pour money into the top of the funnel of the digital thing, which is one of the lot -- reasons we did this Corpay unification, that might be a basis, right, where we could spend money effectively and see good returns. \n So I'd say nothing staring us in the face now. We've got lots of money, incremental capital. I think we're spending $20 million, $25 million of incremental capital above last year in IT. Half of that's in corporate pay. We're spending more in sales. And so if we got the right kind of investment, I think the answer is we would do it. Yes. It's a super business, to your point, because again, we're pretty specialized, right? We're in the workforce segment, think blue collar people that drive off and cut trees and then in the airline accommodation where we're connected literally into the airline's systems. So we know that the 2 or plus pilots are going to show up somewhere tomorrow. \n So the answer is, obviously, it's recovering. It was one of those businesses hurt really the most a year ago. So we've gotten a lot of it back already in the workforce side. And I'd say we're probably half of the way back. In fact, it's the 1 area that outperformed the COVID recovery in the first quarter. For each line of business, we plan a certain amount of softness, if you will, coming back, and the airline business actually came back faster than we planned. \n So I think it's on track, depending on what happens over the next couple of months, to have a huge recovery, right, in the second half. And we're selling a lot. Like I'm looking at the sales, we continue to sell a lot in that business. We've got some attractive adjacencies in the business. It's probably our highest margin business. So to your point, there's a lot to like about it, and people should keep their eyes open. We're probably going to do more of it. David, it's Ron. It's a great question. I think if I've been repetitive on something it's been 10-13-19, 10-13-19, which is if we can grow revenues organically 10%, we can grow operating EBITDA, if you will, faster because of the operating leverage and then use the $1 billion of capital to either buy earnings or buy shares. So we've proven, I guess, Chuck, over 20 years, we've compounded, David, at over 20%. \n So the reminder to you and others out there is, I think for full year calendar '18 and full year calendar '19, the business grew 10% organically in those 2 most recent years until we hit COVID here in 2020. And so my expectation is that we will be back there in -- certainly in '22. And part of it is, again, the setup is just so good in terms of the exit rate that if we get this recovery in the second half and we make the sales that we're making, the exit rate pouring into '22 will obviously be super attractive. \n And then to your point, the deal we've announced and a couple we're working on will be, as I've mentioned before, quite accretive. And so it all points, I tried to say it in the thing, I think the business, because of the pain we took last year, is particularly well set up to get a good number in '22. And then what I'd say to you is we like our chances after that because we're diversifying the space, right, in the businesses, the fuel card thing chasing EV and launching, chasing new categories and getting into SMB and corporate payments. We're not sitting still just kind of twiddling the places that we're in, David. \n And so I think it's -- I think we sit here more optimistic about the future because we're coming out. We're freaking coming out, finally coming out of the woods here and can kind of see the other side, and that sets up well for us. So I'd say, '22 will be better and then we like our chances after that."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Eglseder, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nJames Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Alissa Vickery, our Interim CFO. Following the prepared comments, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then that you can get in line for questions. Please note, our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com.\n Now throughout this call, we will be covering organic revenue growth. And as a reminder, this metric neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads. It also includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed during the 2 years being compared. We will also be covering non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than that at other companies. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website.\n I do need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our outlook, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We undertake no obligation to update any of these statements. These expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release, on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K, both filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. \n So now with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? \nRonald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and appreciate you joining our Q4 2022 earnings call. At the top here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects. So first, I'll provide my take on our Q4 results. Second, I'll recap our full year 2022 performance. Third, I'll share our initial 2023 guidance. And then lastly, I'll update you on a few of the key priorities that we're working.\n Okay. Let me make the turn to our Q4 results, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range, so better than we expected. We reported revenue of $884 million, that's up 10%; and cash EPS of $4.04, that's up 9%. Our cash EPS was helped in the quarter by a Brazil tax-happy which did lower our Q4 overall tax rate. Organic revenue growth coming in at 7% overall. Inside of that, our corporate payments business, super good, growing 20% in the quarter.\n Against the prior year, our Q4 organic revenue growth was negatively impacted by about, I don't know, $20 million to $25 million of onetime revenues sitting in Q4 of '21, so that reduced organic revenue growth by about 2% to 3% in Q4. We do expect Q1 2023 organic growth to return to the 9% to 10% range. \n Cash EPS in the quarter pressured by both higher bad debt and significantly higher interest expense. And as a result of the rising delinquencies we're seeing in our U.S. fuel business, we did make the decision in Q4 to slow what we call our new micro-digital sales, so our very smallest account. We also began tightening terms of our existing SMB account. \n Both of those things really a cautionary move to try to control bad debt expense here in 2023. Fortunately, our credit risk is really narrowly concentrated in what we call these very small micro-accounts and also in our newest vintages, think 12 to 24 months. So it really impacts a pretty small portion of our overall business. \n Turning to the trends. Fundamentals in the quarter are quite good. Same-stores finished plus 2% for the quarter, retention remaining steady at 92%, and sales grew 19% in the quarter despite our decision to again to slow the micro sales and fuel. So look, all in all, a bit better finish than we had expected and continuing strong trends helping us here as we roll into '23.\n Okay, let me turn to our full year 2022 performance along with the progress that we made to better position the company for the midterm. So for the full year 2022, we reported revenue of $3.4 billion. That's up 21% and up almost $600 million over 2021. Cash EPS of $16.10, that's up 22% versus prior year and a full $0.85 ahead of our initial 2022 guidance. Our full year organic revenue growth of 13%. Full year sales or new bookings growth of 21%, and we closed 5 capability acquisitions, if you include the GRG deal on January 1. So really good, really outstanding performance against the primary objectives that we set. \n So in addition to the financial goals, we really did advance pretty meaningfully our Beyond strategy in '22 in which we extend either or both the product set of the business or the customer segment that we serve. This is helpful, obviously, because it grows the TAM and obviously better positions the business for long-term growth. \n So just a few of our Beyond highlights for 2022. So in global fleet, significant progress on our EV capabilities. We acquired a European public charging network. We've got mapping and payment applications. We've got at-home charging software and we've integrated all that to our ICE fueling solution, so great progress there. \n In corporate payments, we added an AP automation software front end to our whole AP payment execution business, which is the company's fastest-growing business, so super delighted with that. In lodging, we've gone beyond our workforce, core workforce business, to 2 new verticals, the airline vertical and the insurance vertical, each of those reaching almost $100 million in revenue in '22. And then finally in Brazil, we keep expanding our tag fueling solution. We've gone to even more accepting sites now and more users and I think, exiting Q4, reached about 10 million annualized transactions. So look, the combo in '22 of really good financial performance and what I'd call significant strategic progress. So we're quite pleased.\n All right. Let me shift gears and make the turn to our 2023 outlook. We've worked hard to build a plan to meet our most important objectives in what is a challenging environment. So here is our 2023 guidance at the midpoint. So revenue of $3.825 billion, that would be up 12% or approximately $400 million. EBITDA of $2.025 billion, that reflects up 15% or up about $260 million. And then cash EPS of $17 at the midpoint, that would reflect up 6%. We're certainly outlooking a pretty unfavorable macro environment this year with a smidge lower fuel price and significantly higher interest rates. So those 2 things are expected to reduce our 2023 cash EPS by about $1.75, implying we'd be giving an $18.75 cash EPS guide in kind of an apples-to-apples environment. \n Our '23 plan does set out a number of pretty important objectives: to deliver organic growth 10%-plus, to grow new sales 15%-plus and to diet or control our operating expenses with a plan to expand margins about 150 basis points for the full year and 200 basis points exiting 2023. \n Major assumptions underlying our 2023 guidance are, first, that our '22 acquisitions will add about 2% to 3% to our 2023 print revenue growth. This '23 guidance does include Russia and will until we have certainty of the divestiture. Guidance assumes that we can manage bad debt equal to the 2022 level, although we do think it will be more elevated in the first half than the second half. And then finally, we have not assumed a U.S. or global recession but rather built our '23 plan and volumes really just based on what we can see and projected from there. \n Our confidence in this '23 plan or outlook is bolstered by a few things. First, we've now seen our '22 finish good, better than we thought. We closed the Global Reach cross-border deal, so that's in our numbers. We've made expense cuts already so those are behind us. We're seeing some recent improvement, slight but improvement, in both fuel price and FX trends. We just recently implemented 2 interest rate swaps that will lower our 2023 interest expense and obviously fix rates. And then lastly, we qualified for Brazil tax-happy that will slightly lower our 2023 consolidated tax rate, a bit better than our earlier expectations. \n Okay, let me transition to my last subject, which is an update on some of our important priorities. So Russia, let me start out with Russia, so making good progress on the sale of our Russia business. We've had lots of interest, a number of parties that have bid for the asset. And we've recently moved a select group of buyers, potential buyers, into the diligence phase. Timing is probably somewhere late Q2. And at this point, our plan would be to use the Russia sale proceeds to buy back FLT stock. If we did that with kind of a midyear close, we're looking at about $0.30 to $0.35 of in-year cash EPS dilution.\n Okay, let me turn next to the FTC matter. Appears to be finally in the home stretch. We're at a point now where we do expect the court to issue an order likely here sometime in Q1, detailing incremental processes and disclosures that we'll need to implement. So obviously, once clear, we'll move quickly to implement those things, although we will require some time. I mean, just as a reminder, the disclosure enhancements and process changes that we have voluntarily made over the last few years have not had a material impact on our financial performance nor do we believe that this court order will have a material impact on our financial performance going forward. \n So last up, EV, again, really good progress on that initiative. So in the U.K., we're now in market with what we call our 3-in-1 EV solution for commercial fleet clients. So in this case, it includes a U.K. public EV charging network, at-home charging software and, of course, traditional ICE fueling, all of those integrated into one. And I think we've got about 1,000 of our U.K. commercial fleet clients using the solution, so doing well there. \n Additionally, we're in the market in Continental Europe with an EV solution really for new customer segments, so beyond commercial fleet. So the new segments would include EV car manufacturers, charge point operators, even EV drivers. And fortunately, we are seeing adoption by all 3 of those customer segments which, for us, is clearly all incremental to our fleet payment business. So look, the goal again is to be a major player in this EV transition. And I do want to report, we are officially out of the blocks.\n Okay. So in closing, again, we finished 2022 pretty well. Again, positive sales and retention trends. That obviously helps the setup for this year. '22 full year financial performance, super good, 21% and 22% top and bottom line, way ahead of the initial guide. Again, we've advanced last year a number of important Beyond ideas that supports the future growth of the company. Our outlook for '23, we think positive, outlooking double-digit revenue expectations, improving operating margins and EBITDA, although our absolute profits for sure will be weighed down by the interest rate spike. \n We do expect to clear our Russia and FTC overhang here in the first half. At the same time, we're going to continue to stake out our position in the new EV world, again, a big opportunity for us. And lastly, our midterm objectives remain intact. We want to grow cash EPS in the 15% to 20% range once we lap the 2023 interest expense headwinds. \n So with that, let me turn the call back over to Alissa to provide a bit more detail on the quarter. Alissa? \nAlissa Vickery: Thanks, Ron. First, the financial details. As mentioned, we posted 10% growth in revenue in the quarter driven by 7% organic growth or $57 million, which I'll delve into in a moment. The remaining percentages came from $20 million of macro tailwinds and $4 million from acquisitions made over the past year. Organic revenue growth was negatively affected by the impact of one-off items not expected to repeat from the fourth quarter of 2021, including breakage, backlogged card orders, accounting true-ups in the normal course and acquisition accruals. We expect 2023 organic revenue growth to meet our double-digit targets.\n Corporate payments average revenue growth was 20% driven by continued strong new sales across both direct and cross-border. Specifically, our direct corporate payments business grew 27% and continues to demonstrate very robust growth. Cross-border was up 24%, another very good quarter as new sales remained strong, activity levels were robust across nearly all geographies and we completed the full tech integration of AFEX into our cross-border platforms. Lodging continued to perform well, up 14%. \n While we've largely lapped the airline COVID recovery benefit, the airline business was still up 38% in the quarter. The suite of services we've bought into this business substantially enlarges the TAM and durability of our lodging growth profile over the medium term. Fuel was up organically 2%, with growth in international fuel largely offset by softness in our U.S. micro SMB customer segment. And by micro, we mean companies with less than 5 vehicles, so the smallest of the small. The economic cost of higher fuel prices, inflation and, in the case of micro SMB trucking, lower spot rates, have negatively affected their ability to manage expenses, including their fuel bills, which has resulted in higher bad debt. \n We have also seen some negative mix shift among that micro trucking segment as higher-margin independent trucking volume is moving to lower-margin volume as those drivers move to the larger contract carriers. This micro segment generated more than 75% of our U.S. fuel bad debt losses in both the fourth quarter and full year 2022, fully feeling the brunt of these economic headwinds. Given the higher loss rates of the micro client segment that we are experiencing, we have significantly tightened credit approval standards and have purposefully targeted a narrow way in order to get ahead of any further stress in this micro segment. The result was a drag in organic fuel growth in the quarter. \n We are taking a balanced approach to new customer demand gen activities, prioritizing customer segments and industries that are healthier to drive fuel growth in 2023, all while limiting our bad debt exposure. We will continue to feel the residual effect of tighter credit and higher losses in that micro segment in the first half of 2023 but would expect to clear this overhang and return to normalized fuel growth rates in the back half of the year. This will likely cause 2023 fuel organic growth to be at the low end of our normal range. \n Tolls was up 6% compared with last year as the impact of strong new sales was masked by almost $5 million of nonrecurring revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. Toll sales were strong in the current quarter, recovering from softer sales midyear and helping offset some of the prior year onetime benefit impact. We expect tolls to return to its low to mid-teens growth rate in 2023. \n We've made great progress building out the Beyond Toll network and now have over 5,400 Beyond Toll locations, including 2,200 fueling stations, 2,300 parking lots, 750 drive-throughs and 150 carwashes that accept our tag. As an additional service to our customers, we are a reseller of insurance from other companies to our more than 6 million tag holders in Brazil, for whom we have negotiated preferential pricing. This insurance offering is growing quite fast. We sold more than 58,000 insurance policies in the quarter. We also signed up Santander as a toll distribution partner, which is the fifth largest bank in the country. All in all, we're very bullish on the outlook for our Brazil business.\n Gift organic growth in Q4 was down 11% over prior year Q4 as the card orders that pulled forward in the last 2 quarters and in Q4 prior year did not repeat. Due to the lumpy nature of card orders between quarters, it is best to look at full year gift organic growth, which was 11%, as the newer online card sales programs and that the B2B program have improved the growth of that business. \n Looking further down the income statement, operating expenses of $514 million represented an increase over prior Q4, primarily due to recent acquisitions, higher bad debt and volume-related increases. We did recognize $5 million in expense associated with reductions to staffing levels and the termination of office space leases as we adjusted our expense base for the current challenging environment. We will continue to manage our expenses with a very close eye on our outlook. Bad debt expense was $41 million or 9 basis points, consistent with the third quarter 2022 level. I've already talked about what we're doing to manage this, but suffice it to say, we're very focused on it.\n Moving below the line, interest expense was $74 million for the quarter, up 168% over the prior Q4 and $165 million for the full year, up 45%. These increases were driven by higher reference rates on our floating rate debt as well as incremental borrowings for share repurchases and acquisitions. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.2% versus 25.6% last year and lower than our guidance. The primary driver was the impact of a pandemic-related tax benefit election in Brazil realized for 2022 in the quarter. \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with over $1.4 billion in unrestricted cash and approximately $600 million available on our revolver. There was $5.7 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, and we had $1.3 billion borrowed on our securitization facility. As a reminder, earlier in the year, we upsized and extended our credit facility by approximately $500 million and extended the maturity through June 2027 at quite attractive rates. As of December 30, our leverage ratio was 2.8x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. \n Our capital allocation was once again balanced in 2022. In the quarter, we repurchased roughly 600,000 shares at an average price of $188 per share. In total, we've repurchased about 6.2 million shares during 2022 for $1.4 billion. Our guidance for share count for 2023 is 5 million shares lower than what we guided to a year ago. In total, we've bought back 11.7 million shares over the last 2 years. We still have over $1.2 billion authorized for future repurchases. In 2022, we spent $217 million on acquisitions and minority investments, excluding Global Reach on January 1, 2023, solidifying our positions in EV, corporate payments and lodging. \n Now let me share some thoughts on our Q1 outlook and our full year assumptions. Looking ahead, we're expecting Q1 2023 revenue to be between $875 million and $890 million and adjusted net income per share to be between $3.55 and $3.75. This is largely due to revenue seasonality for certain businesses, such as fuel, lodging and tolls tend to have lighter first quarters due to weather and holidays. As such, the first quarter tends to be the lowest in terms of both revenue and profit for our company. \n We have a bit of a preview for the first few weeks of the year, and we are tracking to the guidance we are providing. Of note, for the full year 2023, we anticipate managing bad debt flat to the 2022 levels, expecting it will be higher in the first half of the year and then improve into the second half. We expect 2023 net interest expense to be between $312 million and $332 million based on the forward curve as of February 1, 2023, which implies reference rates will peak sometime during the third quarter of 2023. \n As we disclosed in the earnings release and you can see on Slides 21 and 22 of our supplement, we entered into a series of interest rate swap agreement to fixed rates on approximately $1.5 billion of our floating rate debt. These swaps will provide some relief on our 2023 rate and help limit the downside risk from further rising interest rates. The inverted forward rate curve enabled us to reduce 2023 interest expense by locking in lower future rates over a 3-year period. With these new swaps, along with our previous outstanding swaps, we now have fixed interest rates on a total of $2 billion of our variable rate debt for most of 2023. \n Last week, we also entered into a euro cross-currency swap to benefit from the lower euro interest rates with an implied interest savings of 1.96% on $500 million of notional debt. With these various swaps, we have now managed interest rate and FX risk on $2.5 billion or 47% of our debt, excluding the securitization. We believe these actions will help mitigate the risk associated with continued increasing interest rates in 2023. We estimate these swaps to reduce interest expense by approximately $35 million in 2023. \n And finally, our tax rate in 2023 is expected to be slightly higher, between 26% and 27%, as the continued benefit from the Brazil tax holiday is more than offset by higher tax rates in the U.K. as the U.K. statutory tax rate increases from 19% to 25% in April of 2023. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement.\n As I complete my prepared remarks, I would like to extend our gratitude to our more than 10,000 employees around the world who helped us deliver such a strong finish to a great year and who will be the driving force to even greater heights throughout '23. Thank you for your interest in our company. \n And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Ron, you talked a little bit about these rising delinquencies among the micro SMEs. I'm just curious, was that fairly contained inside of fuel or the fleet business? Or was there any other weakness among the SMEs? And I'm just curious if you think that this might be a leading indicator of more things to come if you go upmarket. I know you guys haven't assumed any additional macro pressures and such. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, it's a good question, Sanjay. Yes is the short answer. The fuel business, and really the U.S. fuel business, because the terms and the way we collect money and bill internationally is fundamentally different, the terms, we pool all the money, et cetera. So yes, the only place that we've seen the micro, and again, we're talking super-duper small, mostly 1- and 2-card accounts and super-duper new on the books, again, a year or 2, that portion of the overall sales is about 75% of the credit losses. So although the credit losses from that group were sizable, the amount of business from that group is not super sizable. \n So yes, that's the only place we're seeing it. In fact, when we studied the cohorts that are a bit larger or more mature, longer on the books, it's super ratable with the trailing 12 to 24 months. So it's super-duper pocketed for some reason. \nSanjay Sakhrani: And you don't think it's a leading indicator or anything, like historically? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, look, you guys' guess is as good as mine. We've been talking about a macro recession for 6 months now. And we study and look everywhere and we just don't see it. We don't see it in volumes. We don't see it in sales. This is the one place where it showed up. And it started, I don't know, call it, maybe 6 months ago. Kind of September, October, we saw the delinquencies start to step up. So my personal view is that these are quasi-consumer businesses. And as the funds ran out and as the savings got depleted, there's just more pressure on these kind of businesses than others, which is [ what's to embody right ]. When we saw that, we said, okay, you guys always ask, hey, grow corporate payments faster. So we giddyap and go and moved sales dollars and implementation dollars away from our tiny fuel business over there until we see how that plays out. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Great. Just one quick follow-up for Alissa on some of these impacts that happened to the growth rate in the fourth quarter. As I look across the different segments, there's been a lot of variability in the growth rate. I'm just curious, did that affect multiple lines, those items, those one-off items? \nAlissa Vickery: It did. And so we saw a decent amount in our toll business as well as a little bit in our fuel business. \nRonald F. Clarke: Those 2. \nAlissa Vickery: And I would just add, this is all normal course of business stuff. It just seemed to be a collection. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, I do want to point out, Sanjay, it's Ron again, that we view it kind of as more of a bump than a trend. I did try to call out in the opening basically that we're outlooking this quarter, we're sitting in, let's say, back at 9% or 10%. So really, in our minds, it's a comp issue, not a run rate issue. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. \nRobert Napoli: So I mean, Ron, the corporate payments business, very strong. Within that, you talked about AP being strong, maybe a little more color on what the stronger areas were in the quarter. And did you see any deceleration, significant deceleration, in any areas? A lot of watch and focus on the SMB market. \nRonald F. Clarke: Bob, it's always good to hear you and hear you doing well. So we posted 20% organic for the quarter for the category, and that's probably our number for '23. You haven't asked me yet, but I'd say, inside of our overall 10%, we're outlooking really about 20% now, so more than high teens. So really inside of it, everything did well, except the channel partner thing. We've said it before that some of the partners that have been with us 4 or 5 years moved some volumes out of people to get different rates. So that business has been flat or going backwards, which means the direct businesses are growing probably 25%. And I think the full AP, where we have every modality, is the fastest growing. I think that particular line of business is probably up 40% to 50% in the quarter. And now we've stuck some software on the front end, so even our lead volume is up. \n So I'd say the whole business is doing well. Again, the cross-border sales were rock. And I'm looking at the page in front of me, they were up 60%, the sales in Q4, obviously just the process of eating another piece of business which deepens us in the geography. And so I'd say, other than the partner thing, it's firing literally on all cylinders. \nRobert Napoli: And then your investments in EV, appreciate the continued forward-looking moves there, if you would. Can you give any more color, and we get this question a lot, I'm sure everybody else does, of the economics? As you have more experience, especially in Europe, I guess, can you give any color on the economics of EV versus gas and your confidence in that? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, another super good question. So the best place for us to look, really kind of the only place to look, for us is the U.K., right? We've got a big, right, commercial fleet business there and they've been out of the blocks pretty early. So we've got, I think, about 1,200 when I looked of active clients that use both our traditional fueling and some amount of EV. I think the average is about 15% penetration of the EV among those accounts.\n What I know for sure is that the enterprise, the bigger accounts, the economics are super favorable to us as they move to EV. The reason is probably pretty obvious, that you get less fees generally from big accounts, right, that didn't negotiate, but they need these new EV things, and so the ability to get fees from enterprise customers. So the report that I looked at, a sample of, I don't know, 10 or 20 accounts, it's up something like 50% our revenues among the enterprise. I'm guessing that, that probably won't be exactly the same story with a super small account. \n So what we'll agree to do, I told our guys, is come back probably in 90 days and report out, provide some actual data on this question because it's the million-dollar question, right, for the commercial fleet business, as the stuff comes across, are we in a different base in the economics? I'd say early on, it looks like yes, we are, but more to follow. \nRobert Napoli: Are EVs growing rapidly? \nRonald F. Clarke: No, not really. I mean, again, the new sales are obviously, right, the mix of every 100 new vehicles, the percent EV is growing. But the base, as you know, like in the United States, I think there's, I don't know, 300 million registered vehicles and the new car sales are 18 million a year. So if half of them were EV, it's 9 million on 300 million. So it's super hard, Bob, to move the base is what I'd say, which is, again, the other thing, as you know, is the EV adoption is happening more in consumer and lighter vehicles, right, versus like 18-wheelers, which is the other motivation for us to chase these EV car manufacturers and EV consumers because there's going to be way more of those in the coming years than there are going to be heavy trucks on EV. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. \nDarrin Peller: Ron, can we go back to the corporate payments segment for a minute again, just because there's obviously been a lot of data points in the industry around SMBs having some challenges and B2B activity having decelerated. You don't seem like you're seeing that as much, so maybe a little color on what you are seeing in the marketplace.\n And then more importantly, just medium to long term, that's obviously an area that we've talked a lot about in terms of convergence of some of the assets to really offer a more holistic solution on the account payables side. And combine that with payments, whether it's invoice pay and some of the other assets you've acquired, how has that been progressing, just maybe a little update there as well. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Darrin, it's a good question. So the good news for us is that our corporate payments business is a middle market business. So our average account there would look like $200 million to $300 million in revenue for the client, so a decent-sized company, a creditworthy kind of company. So I'd say 95% of our corporate payment business is what we all would call a middle market client.\n So the SMB move that we made, whatever, 1.5 years ago, was really trying to be upside, us trying to extend kind of down-market. So given what's going on with some of our friends in SMB, maybe we're lucky, we haven't made as much progress there. So that's the headline. We're seeing nothing. Volumes are up, spend is up. As you can see in the numbers, the revenue, again, if you kick out the partner piece, is compounding at 25%. And we're out looking at the same kind of number on the direct business here in '23.\n On your second question, which is also a super good one is, we've gotten all the stuff now. I feel like making a Thanksgiving dinner is 8 million ingredients to comp again, then all of a sudden, someday, there's a plate and there's 6 items on the plate. We're kind of, I don't want to say done, but close to done. We've got all the stuff. We've got smart cars. We've got front-end AP automation software. We pay every modality. We've got a global international payment capability. We've got networks. So we kind of have the stuff, Darrin, to offer the whole package now to these middle market clients. And we're getting more and more of the clients to buy both our smart card and our AP stuff because we're in the CFO office. And as you know, we moved the branding, so it makes more sense now. One company is coming in with a full line. \n So I would say that it's the marketing challenge in front of us. We've got the stuff to have an integrated pack. And now between the brand and educating sales guys in the market, I think we're going to sell way more of the package stuff as we move forward here. \nDarrin Peller: Okay. Okay. Timing-wise, Ron. I actually do have a quick follow-up for Alissa, if that's okay, on the revenue growth rate. Maybe I'll just throw it in now, which is, when we look at the cadence on revenue growth trends, I know there's some seasonality to it. But again, you're coming off of the 7% rate. Obviously, there were those onetime items that you called out last year's quarter. Just to make sure, do you see any other kind of impediments to that growth rate this year beyond macro in terms of onetime items that we have to grow over or anything else? Or do you see that being pretty clean from a macro adjusted basis? \nAlissa Vickery: Yes. I mean, I would expect that short of the macro adjustments we make always for organic revenue growth, which neutralizes those items, that we wouldn't expect anything meaningful other than as we perhaps called out in the same quarter prior year, so I would encourage you to look back at those notes. But I mean, I think other than as we've spoken to the micro SMB customer segment in our fuel business, I think that's going to be the only item to speak of. \nRonald F. Clarke: Darrin, it's Ron again, the guide is 10% and 12%, right? We're guiding kind of 10% organic at the midpoint and add a couple of points for the role of the acquisitions of the print at 12%. That's what we're sitting here telling you. That's what we're chasing. That's the number. \nAlissa Vickery: Yes. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: I wanted to ask on the margin outlook. I think you mentioned up 150 bps, Ron. So I think 90 days ago, you previewed 200 to 300 bps, so I'm curious what's changed in the last 90 days. Is it more about investing or changes in thinking around costs, things like that, or mix? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Good question, Tien-Tsin. So yes, the plan that we landed is, I guess, 150 full year and Q4, 200. And the short answer is I just decided to spend more money on the acquired businesses. So if you look at our core OpEx, so kick out all the '22 acquisitions we did, it's below 5%. I think it's only 3% or 4%. But the pile of acquisitions, we're spending another, I don't know, $70 million or $80 million incremental year-over-year. And so a bunch of those are dilutive things. They're EV things. They're onetime things to integrate like the Global Reach, their sales investments and stuff. \n And so that was the call. The call was really to make sure that we gave enough oxygen to these sets of new assets that we just got so that we can get a return on them. And since we could kind of make all the numbers work, we start with the design, we start with what's the goal and then work our way around it. So I felt like we kind of made the number we want, kind of 10% to 12% on the top, sales in the high teens across the kind of where we guided to, EBITDA growth of 15%, so growing obviously operating earnings faster. So it kind of fit into the envelope, so we made the call to do it. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Got you. No, I trust that's the right investment to make. Then just as my quick follow-up then on your appetite to do deals. I know I always ask you this, Ron, but just from a deals perspective, how does the pipeline look? I know you have a lot going on. You're spending more on acquired assets, including in EVs. Is there more to do in the short run? Or could we see a little bit of a pause from a deal-making standpoint? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. You certainly know us well, Tien-Tsin. We never will run out a pipeline. So yes, we had deals. I'd say it's kind of, in my mind, a little bit of good and bad on the deal front. I think the good is I really am seeing some reset on the valuation side, right? Prices have been down longer. I think people that were waiting have waited longer, they're not seeing the bids. People aren't hitting the bids they're looking for, the apps they're looking for. The bad is obviously the cost of capital. So it raises your confidence in your thesis, right, to pull the trigger, to make sure we're generating the right kind of returns. So I'd say there's a little bit of tension between those. So a better maybe valuation outlook but a bit higher cost of capital. \n But look, we've always, as you know, not been a financial buyer of things where we just buy it and absorb it. We've always had some view of how to double-profit. So again, we have things in the pipeline that we like that we think we can make returns on. And if we can, we will. We'll full-throttle on it. \n I'd say we're probably, back to capital allocation, less excited about buybacks. Sitting here again, given the cost of capital, the incretion at least short term, maybe longer term, is okay. But short term isn't quite as attractive. And delevering, frankly, is a bit crazy, more attractive, given the spreads are wider, right, between deposit rates and borrowing rates. So I'd say that the kind of some of these changes is affecting a bit how we're thinking about, was it $1.3 billion, Alissa? $1.3 billion is the plan, Tien-Tsin. So I'd say my first and foremost is all these deals that we can make returns on. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: I wanted to follow up on your response to Darrin's question earlier about having all the ingredients in place within corporate payments to kind of realize that sort of power. My question is actually broader across the entire enterprise and maybe all of the segments, within the segments. Are you now kind of organizationally, technologically well positioned for cross-selling? Or are there still initiatives and capabilities and linkages that need to be made in order to kind of unlock the synergy potential in the broader enterprise? \nRonald F. Clarke: Ramsey, it's Ron. It's a super, super good question. I'd say we're out ahead on the synergy and relatedness in corporate payments, and the primary reason is it's a middle market business. So whenever you go to a client that's got $200 million to $300 million in revenue, it has more needs, right? It does more things. Obviously, it's got a lot of AP, right? If it's got $200 million to $300 million in revenue, it's obviously got a lot of employees probably running around in vehicles. And so you'll see us selling fleet cards, for example, to our corporate payment clients. And fuel runs 10% to 12% of all the spend volume among our middle market corporate payment clients, which I guess wouldn't be shocking. So in that area, I would say, for sure, there will be a broad package of services that will all be sold into the same client.\n As you move into the SMB thing, I think we're going to move organizationally towards a more integrated model like you're saying because the tech, I think, frankly, is ahead of our org. And so we're looking at starting to consolidate the vehicle-related purchases. So if you're sitting in a car and you buy fuel or you recharge on EV or you pay for a toll, when you go into a parking spot, whatever, all of those, even 92% of our lodging clients drive a company vehicle, the tree-cutting truck to the actual hotel.\n So we're in the business mostly of vehicles, company vehicles, running around and us helping make the payments. And so it's a way more super-related thing than what we've talked about before as though they're discrete things. And so you'll see us start to move organizationally more to looking at that set of solutions as vehicle-related payments and then the corporate payments, again, as a thing for the middle market. \nRamsey El-Assal: That was super helpful. It makes a ton of sense. A quick follow-up from me, I think on the 2023 guidance, you were able to call out in the course of the call a segment specific expectation for corporate payments. And I think Alissa something for tolls and fuel. Would you mind rounding that out and just giving us your expectations for lodging and, if applicable, guests for the year, so just for sort of modeling purposes? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Sure. So again, at the midpoint, it'd be 10% overall. So fleet, kind of mid-single but weaker first half, stronger second half. Lodging in Brazil, mid-teens, maybe a smidge below 15%, a smidge above. And corporate payments, even with the channel in it, I'm going to give a number probably 20%, maybe north of 20%, and obviously, way north of 20% if you kick out the channel. So that's the mix that rounds to 10%. \n And again, you guys have heard this before, we're super thoughtful on the design. When we saw the super micro segment weaken, we just literally reallocated. We just said, okay, I want, in terms of marketing and sales investment, more into the middle market. Darrin brought up earlier that certainly not as many macro kind of risk and basically just kind of tread water a little bit until we see more about how this micro and SMB segment plays out this year. So we're kind of derisking the plan a bit, I tell you. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Sheriq Sumar with Evercore ISI. \nSheriq Sumar: I have a question on the 2023 outlook and especially on the share count. It's say 75 million for the full year. Does that assume any sort of buybacks throughout the year or it does not? And if it does not, then would there be more upside to the EPS, assuming that you accelerate the buyback throughout the year? \nAlissa Vickery: Sheriq, it's Alissa. It's a good question. On share count, I'll first say, in our guidance, we never include the impact of potential buybacks because we see it similar to our capital allocation decisions, like acquisition or divestiture. We're going to hold those decisions until they make sense. And so we do not build that into guidance. And then I guess, in terms of the share count as we run in, the number you see that we presented in our assumptions is consistent with what we expect for the rest of the year. \nRonald F. Clarke: And what we printed for Q3 and Q4, correct? \nAlissa Vickery: And fairly aligned with where you saw us come out of Q3 and what you can now see in the Q4 number. \nRonald F. Clarke: Sheriq, it's Ron. Our default is always just delevering, right? We plan to generate $1.3 billion of free cash flow in our models, assuming that we just reduce debt as we run through the year. And then to the extent that we take money to do a buyback in Q2, we'll update the guidance to reflect that different use of capital. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Jeff Cantwell with Wells Fargo. \nJeffrey Cantwell: Congrats on the results. Ron, just as a follow-up on Darrin's question earlier. In your prepared remarks, you said that in 2022, you added an AP automation software front end to your whole AP execution business. And we all know what that is, what you've been doing there. So my question is, what does that mean that your execution there on the front end going forward would impact others that you've been partnering with over the years in any way? Does that mean that you're trying to capture those volumes on the front end? Can you just help us understand the strategy there and how to think about that going forward? \nRonald F. Clarke: Jeff, I'm not positive I'm picking up the question. Can you just rephrase it for me? \nJeffrey Cantwell: Yes. So we've been watching what you did with Roger and Corpay. And we know that you have Comdata as well. So we're trying to figure out if there's some competitive angle to what you're doing on the front end as you start to bring that into the picture with how you're going to market with SMBs. \nRonald F. Clarke: Okay. Yes, there's clearly a competitive angle. I think historically, stand-alone AP automation software companies sold AP automation software. Knock-knock, \"I've got software that simplifies your processes, automates approvals, digitizes stuff, so you don't lose it. Hey, that's what we do.\" And then knock-knock, a bank said, \"Hi, I can help you actually execute electronic payments for you or cross-border payments.\"\n And so the idea we've been at a long time is, well, let's do both, which we've connected them already, obviously. So hey, knock-knock, \"We can help you make the process work better in your company and save you time and reduce risk, and we will pay all the different ways. Every modality, we'll execute at all. You don't need to call your bank or FX specialist or your printing company to print out paper checks. We'll do the whole thing.\" So we think that it's a huge advantage to have that package to provide more value to clients. \n It seemingly, early on, generates more leads because historically, people have been interested in both sides of that thing. We're not the biggest. We've got to be one of the biggest nonbank full AP payers already. So I think it is a pretty big advantage for us going forward. \nJeffrey Cantwell: Got it. Okay. Great. And just wanted to follow up just on Bob's question earlier on EV. And I guess the question is, just to frame it for you, you're a $16 billion market cap company and you're generating over $3.8 billion in annual revenue this coming year. So can you just remind us, can you size that revenue opportunity for us maybe, call it, 2, 3, 5 years out? We'll all just trying to figure out this substitution effect and incremental revenue impacts, et cetera, et cetera. So how would you frame that as we think about our models? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. That's another super good question. So first off, it's obviously a long time out. So the first thing I'd say is, on the defensive side, so on the commercial fleet side, the opportunity is the size of our whole business, right? If you went 40 years into the future and we've got, what, a $1.5 billion revenue global fleet business, the hope is, if we replace the business 50 years to today, everything was EV, we'd have a $1.5 billion business plus however we'd grow between now and then.\n But for us, I think the bigger opportunity that's nearer in is this consumer lighter vehicle thing that we're going to get to through the EV carmakers and through the new gas station operators that are called charge point operators. So the big part of our strategy that we're spending money on is going offensive and chasing 2 new segments that aren't any part of our business today that we think are going to show up sooner because the vehicles work better, right, the light vehicles. I mean, again, it's just a function of adoption. That's massive obviously, right? It's every vehicle that's not a commercial fleet, you're into there in terms of the TAM. So it's a massive, massive business. \n And I think I said repeatedly, our strategy in the thing is to be the network guy. Our company is built on proprietary networks that have unique data that we pick up and then the volume that we have that creates better economics. And our idea is the same, we're going to put together EV acceptance networks where we collect data that's interesting to clients, like what kind of chargers are there, is the charger open now if I drive there. And we think that providing that in some simple way is going to be super interesting. And we've got 5 or 10 already big EV carmakers using our software and our network to try to reduce charge anxiety, right, of new buyers. So it's massive. The question is just when, how long, right, before either side, either the commercial side or the consumer side, gets big. \nJeffrey Cantwell: Okay. Great. That's super helpful. Congrats again. \n [Technical Difficulty] \nPeter Christiansen: Hello? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, Pete, we can hear you. \nPeter Christiansen: Sorry about that. I didn't hear the intro. Just wanted to dig into the fuel card business a little bit. Given some of the pockets of weakness that you called out on the credit side, Ron, are you going to sell any differently in '23? How are you augmenting your sales strategy there? And then as a follow-up on the partner side of the fuel card business, just wondering if you could shed any color on like RFP activity or if there's any major contract renewals coming up. Any help would be great there. \nRonald F. Clarke: You got it, pal. So on the first part of the question, hey, what are we doing for selling in 2023, the answer is yes, there'll be some different things. So the first thing we've done, which we're about 90 days into, is we're repointing our digital machine and algorithm to larger accounts. So the guy that runs our digital sales business tweaked the models effectively to point at what I would call larger and more creditworthy accounts. So you'll see that. For sure, our sales size of new accounts will go up starting here in Q1 versus Q4. So that's point 1. We'll modify the targeting of our digital engine. \n And then number two is I've moved dollars. We've reallocated dollars to the corporate payments business. So I just said, okay, I'm not going to grow sales investment or sales as much in a space that has potentially more macro risk. We're going to earmark at least here in 2023 into the middle market that we have. There's more stability, if you will, in the macro. So those are really the 2 things we're doing selling-wise. \n And again, it's pretty small, it's a pile of bad debt, this micro super-duper new thing, but it's not big per se, right, against the total business, right, the total revenue. So that's that point. On the second one, there's not much. I'd say it's pretty quiet. Also, the other people that play the game have a lot of long-term contracts, both here and in Europe, so there's really nothing on the radar, I'd say, significant that we're looking at in 2023. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Nik Cremo with Credit Suisse. \nNikolai Cremo: I just wanted to touch back on the fuel segment first. How did the same-store sales come in across the various parts of that business in the quarter? And just looking to 2023, what parts of the fuel business gives you confidence that the segment can reaccelerate in the back half given the deceleration we've seen in the last few quarters? \nAlissa Vickery: Yes. So Nik, it's Alissa. It's a good question. To make sure I got all your question, I think you're asking what is kind of same-store sales look and how are we outlooking? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. How would you get to the reacceleration? \nAlissa Vickery: Oh, reacceleration. So yes, so for same-store sales, I would say we always say that same-store sales sort of a massive easy comp is usually in the minus 1% to plus 1% range. And I would say that we did see it soften just a little bit more than that in the fourth quarter to minus 2%. But as we look into reacceleration, it really is just retweaking the engine as we head into '23, repointing that digital engine to higher credit quality customers and then just refocusing the entire sales engine across the board to target those, I'll just call it, healthier customer bases in segments. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Let me make sure, Nik, you're clear that we pull this trigger. Like, we're super conscious that the health of these super-duper small accounts was deteriorating. So we said, okay, let's stop selling to them, so stop, and then repoint to the bank. And then second, because their delinquency was up, it creates more involuntary attrition, so a great volume softness, too. So basically, both of those things happen, right? We're not going to keep this picket open. We're tightening terms if you look shaky. And so we did it to make sure that a small, little, tiny part of our business didn't turn into a bigger problem. So we went right with our eyes wide open doing this thing. \n And so the answer is we've been, for 90 days, repointing the thing to bigger fuel accounts and then moving money to the mid-market. So we're happy. There's nothing wrong. We're not worried about the thing. Again, our plan is to have more in the second half. I think if it's 5%, it will be [ 2% and 7% ] or something, right, first half, second half. But I want you to hear it, we made the decisions to do both of these things for cautionary reasons and not get run over later. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. \nJulian Broche: This is Julian on for Andrew. So I have a quick modeling one and then kind of more general one. So is the lodging business, like normalized growth rate, how do we think about that, like high teens to 20%? Is that the right way to think about that? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, 15% to 20%. \nJulian Broche: 15% to 20%. Okay. Got it. And then I know you said that you're off the block on EV. Obviously, airline did really well this quarter, 38% up. I know that you had an in-house prior option. Any updates there? Like, is that something in the pipeline in terms of deals that you're seeing? Like, are you looking to expand there? Kind of elaborate on that a little bit. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. So really, a couple of comments, I think, on the airline growth. So one of it is just continued recovery, right? Airline was super down so I think there's still some \"long-tail\" COVID recovery and still, sitting here today, we still don't have Asia back. There's still more to come as the Asia volume picks back up. But I think the new things that we've done there, we bought a company a year ago, that's really working. \n Like I mentioned, we won a couple of accounts that we had when we put this app in to speed, de-stress people, right, to their hotels instead of queuing up at the line. Well, now we've added, sold the first contract, which you'll see in the forward numbers, basically rebooking simultaneously with the lodging. So your plane gets canceled here in Atlanta tonight. First, you got to find a place to sleep and then you got to figure out how to go. Well, let's say you're on Air Canada and it doesn't have any flights or any flights available, our tech basically looks and books you on other airlines. \n Literally, as you're walking off the plane, you're getting a hotel and getting rebooked. So the customer sat that the airlines are getting from having less unhappy people when they get off a plane, I think this is going to become table stakes. So if a couple of airlines sees a couple that are picking this thing from us early, that this thing, we could literally run the table on this. So this is an example of bringing kind of some tech to kind of an old-fashioned problem, and it's working. \nJulian Broche: Got it. And then if I could sneak one more in, could you talk maybe a little bit about your digital marketing, how that's coming along, maybe any recent examples of success there? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, other than the micro thing, I think the answer is it's representing, obviously, in every business, a larger and larger piece. For example, lodging which we just talked about, I think it's up now about 15% of the sales in that line of business. It was probably 5% 2 or 3 years ago. It's taking a way bigger chunk of the marketing leads. We used to do old-fashioned trade shows for middle markets and things like that. So I'd say that not only are digital sales that we close on compounding a good rate, but I think the lead sources from digital are also way up. Again, a lot of this is the world, right? We're just chasing along with the world, making sure that we're in the right places. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. \nTrevor Williams: I guess with Global Reach now closed, just wanted to see if you could give us an update on the revenue mix within corporate payments, between FX, cross-border, virtual card, full AP. And then within the 20% growth outlook for the year, just any sense for which of those buckets you expect to be the primary contributors. I know this is a really good FX year with elevated currency vol, so just kind of how you're thinking of the moving pieces within the segment for '23. \nJames Eglseder: Yes, Trevor, this is Jim. I mean, the best way to think about it is that cross-border is probably going to be closer to 65%, and call it, 25% direct and then 10% channel. \nRonald F. Clarke: 60%? 60-40? \nJames Eglseder: Yes. So all-in cross-border, 60%. Domestic corporate payments, 40%. So they're going to move around a little bit. \nRonald F. Clarke: I mean, your question is a good one, Trevor, in terms of the growth thing, having markets that are pacing, interest rate moves differently, right? Like, Brazil got out super early. And then I guess we, the U.S., got out. And now Europe is chasing. So having different timing and differential in the rates obviously creates FX volatility. So that obviously is helpful running here into the beginning of '23.\n But all of these is worthy, right? To get to an aggregate number, we're giving you, hey, look, we're looking, a year from today, 20% revenue growth organic plus, obviously, the print would be way higher because we're adding this deal. Clearly, most everything, Trevor, has to be working. I'm telling you that the channel, which is a pretty small piece, less than 10% probably, is going backwards. So everything else has got to be somewhere in the low to mid-20s to get the entire thing to be 20%. So I don't want to sound too cocky on it, but it's like all working. We're just selling a lot. Retention is super great in those sets of businesses. Obviously, spend is growing in the middle market, right, as smaller companies fall, so obviously bigger companies, particularly like in trucking and other areas, are picking it up. \n So I think the message to you guys is, our product line is better and more complete, I just think that this business has kind of really coming into its own now for us. And it's big finally, right? It's going to surpass $1 billion. And I don't know what it was, but not a $1 billion a few years ago. So it's become a sizable thing now for the company. \nTrevor Williams: Yes. That's great. And just one more on corporate pay, Corpay One, any update you can give us there? I think last year, you were talking about taking more of a measured approach with some of the migrations. But just any update on progress there or just overall strategic thinking on your plan for it over the next couple of years and the cross-sell opportunity? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. So that one is really still a work in process because the core business is middle market. I'd say this is an acorn, but it's a pretty small part. And so when we took a swing and miss at the cross-sell, I did, we did, not a super smart thing. We've really said, okay, how do we get the product to be right for the scene and how do we get the distribution to be right for the scene. So what we've concluded is we are not going to chase super-duper small accounts that don't have much AP that are at the very bottom. \n And so we're really kind of retooling the product and distribution to be upmarket a bit, so still below middle market but kind of off of the floor. And particularly, given what we're seeing and hearing in the marketplace, that seems like the right call to have not rushed into like super micro kind of AP accounts. So we'll report more. [ I'd say it doesn't matter how ] it is a priority since we did the swing and the miss on the cross-sell, but we are continuing to work it. \nOperator: And we've reached the allotted time for questions today, so we'd like to thank you for attending today's presentation. This will conclude the question-and-answer session. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "content": "Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and appreciate you joining our Q4 2022 earnings call. At the top here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects. So first, I'll provide my take on our Q4 results. Second, I'll recap our full year 2022 performance. Third, I'll share our initial 2023 guidance. And then lastly, I'll update you on a few of the key priorities that we're working.\n Okay. Let me make the turn to our Q4 results, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range, so better than we expected. We reported revenue of $884 million, that's up 10%; and cash EPS of $4.04, that's up 9%. Our cash EPS was helped in the quarter by a Brazil tax-happy which did lower our Q4 overall tax rate. Organic revenue growth coming in at 7% overall. Inside of that, our corporate payments business, super good, growing 20% in the quarter.\n Against the prior year, our Q4 organic revenue growth was negatively impacted by about, I don't know, $20 million to $25 million of onetime revenues sitting in Q4 of '21, so that reduced organic revenue growth by about 2% to 3% in Q4. We do expect Q1 2023 organic growth to return to the 9% to 10% range. \n Cash EPS in the quarter pressured by both higher bad debt and significantly higher interest expense. And as a result of the rising delinquencies we're seeing in our U.S. fuel business, we did make the decision in Q4 to slow what we call our new micro-digital sales, so our very smallest account. We also began tightening terms of our existing SMB account. \n Both of those things really a cautionary move to try to control bad debt expense here in 2023. Fortunately, our credit risk is really narrowly concentrated in what we call these very small micro-accounts and also in our newest vintages, think 12 to 24 months. So it really impacts a pretty small portion of our overall business. \n Turning to the trends. Fundamentals in the quarter are quite good. Same-stores finished plus 2% for the quarter, retention remaining steady at 92%, and sales grew 19% in the quarter despite our decision to again to slow the micro sales and fuel. So look, all in all, a bit better finish than we had expected and continuing strong trends helping us here as we roll into '23.\n Okay, let me turn to our full year 2022 performance along with the progress that we made to better position the company for the midterm. So for the full year 2022, we reported revenue of $3.4 billion. That's up 21% and up almost $600 million over 2021. Cash EPS of $16.10, that's up 22% versus prior year and a full $0.85 ahead of our initial 2022 guidance. Our full year organic revenue growth of 13%. Full year sales or new bookings growth of 21%, and we closed 5 capability acquisitions, if you include the GRG deal on January 1. So really good, really outstanding performance against the primary objectives that we set. \n So in addition to the financial goals, we really did advance pretty meaningfully our Beyond strategy in '22 in which we extend either or both the product set of the business or the customer segment that we serve. This is helpful, obviously, because it grows the TAM and obviously better positions the business for long-term growth. \n So just a few of our Beyond highlights for 2022. So in global fleet, significant progress on our EV capabilities. We acquired a European public charging network. We've got mapping and payment applications. We've got at-home charging software and we've integrated all that to our ICE fueling solution, so great progress there. \n In corporate payments, we added an AP automation software front end to our whole AP payment execution business, which is the company's fastest-growing business, so super delighted with that. In lodging, we've gone beyond our workforce, core workforce business, to 2 new verticals, the airline vertical and the insurance vertical, each of those reaching almost $100 million in revenue in '22. And then finally in Brazil, we keep expanding our tag fueling solution. We've gone to even more accepting sites now and more users and I think, exiting Q4, reached about 10 million annualized transactions. So look, the combo in '22 of really good financial performance and what I'd call significant strategic progress. So we're quite pleased.\n All right. Let me shift gears and make the turn to our 2023 outlook. We've worked hard to build a plan to meet our most important objectives in what is a challenging environment. So here is our 2023 guidance at the midpoint. So revenue of $3.825 billion, that would be up 12% or approximately $400 million. EBITDA of $2.025 billion, that reflects up 15% or up about $260 million. And then cash EPS of $17 at the midpoint, that would reflect up 6%. We're certainly outlooking a pretty unfavorable macro environment this year with a smidge lower fuel price and significantly higher interest rates. So those 2 things are expected to reduce our 2023 cash EPS by about $1.75, implying we'd be giving an $18.75 cash EPS guide in kind of an apples-to-apples environment. \n Our '23 plan does set out a number of pretty important objectives: to deliver organic growth 10%-plus, to grow new sales 15%-plus and to diet or control our operating expenses with a plan to expand margins about 150 basis points for the full year and 200 basis points exiting 2023. \n Major assumptions underlying our 2023 guidance are, first, that our '22 acquisitions will add about 2% to 3% to our 2023 print revenue growth. This '23 guidance does include Russia and will until we have certainty of the divestiture. Guidance assumes that we can manage bad debt equal to the 2022 level, although we do think it will be more elevated in the first half than the second half. And then finally, we have not assumed a U.S. or global recession but rather built our '23 plan and volumes really just based on what we can see and projected from there. \n Our confidence in this '23 plan or outlook is bolstered by a few things. First, we've now seen our '22 finish good, better than we thought. We closed the Global Reach cross-border deal, so that's in our numbers. We've made expense cuts already so those are behind us. We're seeing some recent improvement, slight but improvement, in both fuel price and FX trends. We just recently implemented 2 interest rate swaps that will lower our 2023 interest expense and obviously fix rates. And then lastly, we qualified for Brazil tax-happy that will slightly lower our 2023 consolidated tax rate, a bit better than our earlier expectations. \n Okay, let me transition to my last subject, which is an update on some of our important priorities. So Russia, let me start out with Russia, so making good progress on the sale of our Russia business. We've had lots of interest, a number of parties that have bid for the asset. And we've recently moved a select group of buyers, potential buyers, into the diligence phase. Timing is probably somewhere late Q2. And at this point, our plan would be to use the Russia sale proceeds to buy back FLT stock. If we did that with kind of a midyear close, we're looking at about $0.30 to $0.35 of in-year cash EPS dilution.\n Okay, let me turn next to the FTC matter. Appears to be finally in the home stretch. We're at a point now where we do expect the court to issue an order likely here sometime in Q1, detailing incremental processes and disclosures that we'll need to implement. So obviously, once clear, we'll move quickly to implement those things, although we will require some time. I mean, just as a reminder, the disclosure enhancements and process changes that we have voluntarily made over the last few years have not had a material impact on our financial performance nor do we believe that this court order will have a material impact on our financial performance going forward. \n So last up, EV, again, really good progress on that initiative. So in the U.K., we're now in market with what we call our 3-in-1 EV solution for commercial fleet clients. So in this case, it includes a U.K. public EV charging network, at-home charging software and, of course, traditional ICE fueling, all of those integrated into one. And I think we've got about 1,000 of our U.K. commercial fleet clients using the solution, so doing well there. \n Additionally, we're in the market in Continental Europe with an EV solution really for new customer segments, so beyond commercial fleet. So the new segments would include EV car manufacturers, charge point operators, even EV drivers. And fortunately, we are seeing adoption by all 3 of those customer segments which, for us, is clearly all incremental to our fleet payment business. So look, the goal again is to be a major player in this EV transition. And I do want to report, we are officially out of the blocks.\n Okay. So in closing, again, we finished 2022 pretty well. Again, positive sales and retention trends. That obviously helps the setup for this year. '22 full year financial performance, super good, 21% and 22% top and bottom line, way ahead of the initial guide. Again, we've advanced last year a number of important Beyond ideas that supports the future growth of the company. Our outlook for '23, we think positive, outlooking double-digit revenue expectations, improving operating margins and EBITDA, although our absolute profits for sure will be weighed down by the interest rate spike. \n We do expect to clear our Russia and FTC overhang here in the first half. At the same time, we're going to continue to stake out our position in the new EV world, again, a big opportunity for us. And lastly, our midterm objectives remain intact. We want to grow cash EPS in the 15% to 20% range once we lap the 2023 interest expense headwinds. \n So with that, let me turn the call back over to Alissa to provide a bit more detail on the quarter. Alissa? Yes, it's a good question, Sanjay. Yes is the short answer. The fuel business, and really the U.S. fuel business, because the terms and the way we collect money and bill internationally is fundamentally different, the terms, we pool all the money, et cetera. So yes, the only place that we've seen the micro, and again, we're talking super-duper small, mostly 1- and 2-card accounts and super-duper new on the books, again, a year or 2, that portion of the overall sales is about 75% of the credit losses. So although the credit losses from that group were sizable, the amount of business from that group is not super sizable. \n So yes, that's the only place we're seeing it. In fact, when we studied the cohorts that are a bit larger or more mature, longer on the books, it's super ratable with the trailing 12 to 24 months. So it's super-duper pocketed for some reason. Yes. I mean, look, you guys' guess is as good as mine. We've been talking about a macro recession for 6 months now. And we study and look everywhere and we just don't see it. We don't see it in volumes. We don't see it in sales. This is the one place where it showed up. And it started, I don't know, call it, maybe 6 months ago. Kind of September, October, we saw the delinquencies start to step up. So my personal view is that these are quasi-consumer businesses. And as the funds ran out and as the savings got depleted, there's just more pressure on these kind of businesses than others, which is [ what's to embody right ]. When we saw that, we said, okay, you guys always ask, hey, grow corporate payments faster. So we giddyap and go and moved sales dollars and implementation dollars away from our tiny fuel business over there until we see how that plays out. Those 2. Yes, I do want to point out, Sanjay, it's Ron again, that we view it kind of as more of a bump than a trend. I did try to call out in the opening basically that we're outlooking this quarter, we're sitting in, let's say, back at 9% or 10%. So really, in our minds, it's a comp issue, not a run rate issue. Bob, it's always good to hear you and hear you doing well. So we posted 20% organic for the quarter for the category, and that's probably our number for '23. You haven't asked me yet, but I'd say, inside of our overall 10%, we're outlooking really about 20% now, so more than high teens. So really inside of it, everything did well, except the channel partner thing. We've said it before that some of the partners that have been with us 4 or 5 years moved some volumes out of people to get different rates. So that business has been flat or going backwards, which means the direct businesses are growing probably 25%. And I think the full AP, where we have every modality, is the fastest growing. I think that particular line of business is probably up 40% to 50% in the quarter. And now we've stuck some software on the front end, so even our lead volume is up. \n So I'd say the whole business is doing well. Again, the cross-border sales were rock. And I'm looking at the page in front of me, they were up 60%, the sales in Q4, obviously just the process of eating another piece of business which deepens us in the geography. And so I'd say, other than the partner thing, it's firing literally on all cylinders. Yes, another super good question. So the best place for us to look, really kind of the only place to look, for us is the U.K., right? We've got a big, right, commercial fleet business there and they've been out of the blocks pretty early. So we've got, I think, about 1,200 when I looked of active clients that use both our traditional fueling and some amount of EV. I think the average is about 15% penetration of the EV among those accounts.\n What I know for sure is that the enterprise, the bigger accounts, the economics are super favorable to us as they move to EV. The reason is probably pretty obvious, that you get less fees generally from big accounts, right, that didn't negotiate, but they need these new EV things, and so the ability to get fees from enterprise customers. So the report that I looked at, a sample of, I don't know, 10 or 20 accounts, it's up something like 50% our revenues among the enterprise. I'm guessing that, that probably won't be exactly the same story with a super small account. \n So what we'll agree to do, I told our guys, is come back probably in 90 days and report out, provide some actual data on this question because it's the million-dollar question, right, for the commercial fleet business, as the stuff comes across, are we in a different base in the economics? I'd say early on, it looks like yes, we are, but more to follow. No, not really. I mean, again, the new sales are obviously, right, the mix of every 100 new vehicles, the percent EV is growing. But the base, as you know, like in the United States, I think there's, I don't know, 300 million registered vehicles and the new car sales are 18 million a year. So if half of them were EV, it's 9 million on 300 million. So it's super hard, Bob, to move the base is what I'd say, which is, again, the other thing, as you know, is the EV adoption is happening more in consumer and lighter vehicles, right, versus like 18-wheelers, which is the other motivation for us to chase these EV car manufacturers and EV consumers because there's going to be way more of those in the coming years than there are going to be heavy trucks on EV. Yes. Darrin, it's a good question. So the good news for us is that our corporate payments business is a middle market business. So our average account there would look like $200 million to $300 million in revenue for the client, so a decent-sized company, a creditworthy kind of company. So I'd say 95% of our corporate payment business is what we all would call a middle market client.\n So the SMB move that we made, whatever, 1.5 years ago, was really trying to be upside, us trying to extend kind of down-market. So given what's going on with some of our friends in SMB, maybe we're lucky, we haven't made as much progress there. So that's the headline. We're seeing nothing. Volumes are up, spend is up. As you can see in the numbers, the revenue, again, if you kick out the partner piece, is compounding at 25%. And we're out looking at the same kind of number on the direct business here in '23.\n On your second question, which is also a super good one is, we've gotten all the stuff now. I feel like making a Thanksgiving dinner is 8 million ingredients to comp again, then all of a sudden, someday, there's a plate and there's 6 items on the plate. We're kind of, I don't want to say done, but close to done. We've got all the stuff. We've got smart cars. We've got front-end AP automation software. We pay every modality. We've got a global international payment capability. We've got networks. So we kind of have the stuff, Darrin, to offer the whole package now to these middle market clients. And we're getting more and more of the clients to buy both our smart card and our AP stuff because we're in the CFO office. And as you know, we moved the branding, so it makes more sense now. One company is coming in with a full line. \n So I would say that it's the marketing challenge in front of us. We've got the stuff to have an integrated pack. And now between the brand and educating sales guys in the market, I think we're going to sell way more of the package stuff as we move forward here. Darrin, it's Ron again, the guide is 10% and 12%, right? We're guiding kind of 10% organic at the midpoint and add a couple of points for the role of the acquisitions of the print at 12%. That's what we're sitting here telling you. That's what we're chasing. That's the number. Yes. Good question, Tien-Tsin. So yes, the plan that we landed is, I guess, 150 full year and Q4, 200. And the short answer is I just decided to spend more money on the acquired businesses. So if you look at our core OpEx, so kick out all the '22 acquisitions we did, it's below 5%. I think it's only 3% or 4%. But the pile of acquisitions, we're spending another, I don't know, $70 million or $80 million incremental year-over-year. And so a bunch of those are dilutive things. They're EV things. They're onetime things to integrate like the Global Reach, their sales investments and stuff. \n And so that was the call. The call was really to make sure that we gave enough oxygen to these sets of new assets that we just got so that we can get a return on them. And since we could kind of make all the numbers work, we start with the design, we start with what's the goal and then work our way around it. So I felt like we kind of made the number we want, kind of 10% to 12% on the top, sales in the high teens across the kind of where we guided to, EBITDA growth of 15%, so growing obviously operating earnings faster. So it kind of fit into the envelope, so we made the call to do it. Yes. You certainly know us well, Tien-Tsin. We never will run out a pipeline. So yes, we had deals. I'd say it's kind of, in my mind, a little bit of good and bad on the deal front. I think the good is I really am seeing some reset on the valuation side, right? Prices have been down longer. I think people that were waiting have waited longer, they're not seeing the bids. People aren't hitting the bids they're looking for, the apps they're looking for. The bad is obviously the cost of capital. So it raises your confidence in your thesis, right, to pull the trigger, to make sure we're generating the right kind of returns. So I'd say there's a little bit of tension between those. So a better maybe valuation outlook but a bit higher cost of capital. \n But look, we've always, as you know, not been a financial buyer of things where we just buy it and absorb it. We've always had some view of how to double-profit. So again, we have things in the pipeline that we like that we think we can make returns on. And if we can, we will. We'll full-throttle on it. \n I'd say we're probably, back to capital allocation, less excited about buybacks. Sitting here again, given the cost of capital, the incretion at least short term, maybe longer term, is okay. But short term isn't quite as attractive. And delevering, frankly, is a bit crazy, more attractive, given the spreads are wider, right, between deposit rates and borrowing rates. So I'd say that the kind of some of these changes is affecting a bit how we're thinking about, was it $1.3 billion, Alissa? $1.3 billion is the plan, Tien-Tsin. So I'd say my first and foremost is all these deals that we can make returns on. Ramsey, it's Ron. It's a super, super good question. I'd say we're out ahead on the synergy and relatedness in corporate payments, and the primary reason is it's a middle market business. So whenever you go to a client that's got $200 million to $300 million in revenue, it has more needs, right? It does more things. Obviously, it's got a lot of AP, right? If it's got $200 million to $300 million in revenue, it's obviously got a lot of employees probably running around in vehicles. And so you'll see us selling fleet cards, for example, to our corporate payment clients. And fuel runs 10% to 12% of all the spend volume among our middle market corporate payment clients, which I guess wouldn't be shocking. So in that area, I would say, for sure, there will be a broad package of services that will all be sold into the same client.\n As you move into the SMB thing, I think we're going to move organizationally towards a more integrated model like you're saying because the tech, I think, frankly, is ahead of our org. And so we're looking at starting to consolidate the vehicle-related purchases. So if you're sitting in a car and you buy fuel or you recharge on EV or you pay for a toll, when you go into a parking spot, whatever, all of those, even 92% of our lodging clients drive a company vehicle, the tree-cutting truck to the actual hotel.\n So we're in the business mostly of vehicles, company vehicles, running around and us helping make the payments. And so it's a way more super-related thing than what we've talked about before as though they're discrete things. And so you'll see us start to move organizationally more to looking at that set of solutions as vehicle-related payments and then the corporate payments, again, as a thing for the middle market. Yes. Sure. So again, at the midpoint, it'd be 10% overall. So fleet, kind of mid-single but weaker first half, stronger second half. Lodging in Brazil, mid-teens, maybe a smidge below 15%, a smidge above. And corporate payments, even with the channel in it, I'm going to give a number probably 20%, maybe north of 20%, and obviously, way north of 20% if you kick out the channel. So that's the mix that rounds to 10%. \n And again, you guys have heard this before, we're super thoughtful on the design. When we saw the super micro segment weaken, we just literally reallocated. We just said, okay, I want, in terms of marketing and sales investment, more into the middle market. Darrin brought up earlier that certainly not as many macro kind of risk and basically just kind of tread water a little bit until we see more about how this micro and SMB segment plays out this year. So we're kind of derisking the plan a bit, I tell you. And what we printed for Q3 and Q4, correct? Sheriq, it's Ron. Our default is always just delevering, right? We plan to generate $1.3 billion of free cash flow in our models, assuming that we just reduce debt as we run through the year. And then to the extent that we take money to do a buyback in Q2, we'll update the guidance to reflect that different use of capital. Jeff, I'm not positive I'm picking up the question. Can you just rephrase it for me? Okay. Yes, there's clearly a competitive angle. I think historically, stand-alone AP automation software companies sold AP automation software. Knock-knock, \"I've got software that simplifies your processes, automates approvals, digitizes stuff, so you don't lose it. Hey, that's what we do.\" And then knock-knock, a bank said, \"Hi, I can help you actually execute electronic payments for you or cross-border payments.\"\n And so the idea we've been at a long time is, well, let's do both, which we've connected them already, obviously. So hey, knock-knock, \"We can help you make the process work better in your company and save you time and reduce risk, and we will pay all the different ways. Every modality, we'll execute at all. You don't need to call your bank or FX specialist or your printing company to print out paper checks. We'll do the whole thing.\" So we think that it's a huge advantage to have that package to provide more value to clients. \n It seemingly, early on, generates more leads because historically, people have been interested in both sides of that thing. We're not the biggest. We've got to be one of the biggest nonbank full AP payers already. So I think it is a pretty big advantage for us going forward. Yes. That's another super good question. So first off, it's obviously a long time out. So the first thing I'd say is, on the defensive side, so on the commercial fleet side, the opportunity is the size of our whole business, right? If you went 40 years into the future and we've got, what, a $1.5 billion revenue global fleet business, the hope is, if we replace the business 50 years to today, everything was EV, we'd have a $1.5 billion business plus however we'd grow between now and then.\n But for us, I think the bigger opportunity that's nearer in is this consumer lighter vehicle thing that we're going to get to through the EV carmakers and through the new gas station operators that are called charge point operators. So the big part of our strategy that we're spending money on is going offensive and chasing 2 new segments that aren't any part of our business today that we think are going to show up sooner because the vehicles work better, right, the light vehicles. I mean, again, it's just a function of adoption. That's massive obviously, right? It's every vehicle that's not a commercial fleet, you're into there in terms of the TAM. So it's a massive, massive business. \n And I think I said repeatedly, our strategy in the thing is to be the network guy. Our company is built on proprietary networks that have unique data that we pick up and then the volume that we have that creates better economics. And our idea is the same, we're going to put together EV acceptance networks where we collect data that's interesting to clients, like what kind of chargers are there, is the charger open now if I drive there. And we think that providing that in some simple way is going to be super interesting. And we've got 5 or 10 already big EV carmakers using our software and our network to try to reduce charge anxiety, right, of new buyers. So it's massive. The question is just when, how long, right, before either side, either the commercial side or the consumer side, gets big. Yes, Pete, we can hear you. You got it, pal. So on the first part of the question, hey, what are we doing for selling in 2023, the answer is yes, there'll be some different things. So the first thing we've done, which we're about 90 days into, is we're repointing our digital machine and algorithm to larger accounts. So the guy that runs our digital sales business tweaked the models effectively to point at what I would call larger and more creditworthy accounts. So you'll see that. For sure, our sales size of new accounts will go up starting here in Q1 versus Q4. So that's point 1. We'll modify the targeting of our digital engine. \n And then number two is I've moved dollars. We've reallocated dollars to the corporate payments business. So I just said, okay, I'm not going to grow sales investment or sales as much in a space that has potentially more macro risk. We're going to earmark at least here in 2023 into the middle market that we have. There's more stability, if you will, in the macro. So those are really the 2 things we're doing selling-wise. \n And again, it's pretty small, it's a pile of bad debt, this micro super-duper new thing, but it's not big per se, right, against the total business, right, the total revenue. So that's that point. On the second one, there's not much. I'd say it's pretty quiet. Also, the other people that play the game have a lot of long-term contracts, both here and in Europe, so there's really nothing on the radar, I'd say, significant that we're looking at in 2023. Yes. How would you get to the reacceleration? Yes. Let me make sure, Nik, you're clear that we pull this trigger. Like, we're super conscious that the health of these super-duper small accounts was deteriorating. So we said, okay, let's stop selling to them, so stop, and then repoint to the bank. And then second, because their delinquency was up, it creates more involuntary attrition, so a great volume softness, too. So basically, both of those things happen, right? We're not going to keep this picket open. We're tightening terms if you look shaky. And so we did it to make sure that a small, little, tiny part of our business didn't turn into a bigger problem. So we went right with our eyes wide open doing this thing. \n And so the answer is we've been, for 90 days, repointing the thing to bigger fuel accounts and then moving money to the mid-market. So we're happy. There's nothing wrong. We're not worried about the thing. Again, our plan is to have more in the second half. I think if it's 5%, it will be [ 2% and 7% ] or something, right, first half, second half. But I want you to hear it, we made the decisions to do both of these things for cautionary reasons and not get run over later. Yes, 15% to 20%. Yes. So really, a couple of comments, I think, on the airline growth. So one of it is just continued recovery, right? Airline was super down so I think there's still some \"long-tail\" COVID recovery and still, sitting here today, we still don't have Asia back. There's still more to come as the Asia volume picks back up. But I think the new things that we've done there, we bought a company a year ago, that's really working. \n Like I mentioned, we won a couple of accounts that we had when we put this app in to speed, de-stress people, right, to their hotels instead of queuing up at the line. Well, now we've added, sold the first contract, which you'll see in the forward numbers, basically rebooking simultaneously with the lodging. So your plane gets canceled here in Atlanta tonight. First, you got to find a place to sleep and then you got to figure out how to go. Well, let's say you're on Air Canada and it doesn't have any flights or any flights available, our tech basically looks and books you on other airlines. \n Literally, as you're walking off the plane, you're getting a hotel and getting rebooked. So the customer sat that the airlines are getting from having less unhappy people when they get off a plane, I think this is going to become table stakes. So if a couple of airlines sees a couple that are picking this thing from us early, that this thing, we could literally run the table on this. So this is an example of bringing kind of some tech to kind of an old-fashioned problem, and it's working. Yes. I mean, other than the micro thing, I think the answer is it's representing, obviously, in every business, a larger and larger piece. For example, lodging which we just talked about, I think it's up now about 15% of the sales in that line of business. It was probably 5% 2 or 3 years ago. It's taking a way bigger chunk of the marketing leads. We used to do old-fashioned trade shows for middle markets and things like that. So I'd say that not only are digital sales that we close on compounding a good rate, but I think the lead sources from digital are also way up. Again, a lot of this is the world, right? We're just chasing along with the world, making sure that we're in the right places. 60%? 60-40? I mean, your question is a good one, Trevor, in terms of the growth thing, having markets that are pacing, interest rate moves differently, right? Like, Brazil got out super early. And then I guess we, the U.S., got out. And now Europe is chasing. So having different timing and differential in the rates obviously creates FX volatility. So that obviously is helpful running here into the beginning of '23.\n But all of these is worthy, right? To get to an aggregate number, we're giving you, hey, look, we're looking, a year from today, 20% revenue growth organic plus, obviously, the print would be way higher because we're adding this deal. Clearly, most everything, Trevor, has to be working. I'm telling you that the channel, which is a pretty small piece, less than 10% probably, is going backwards. So everything else has got to be somewhere in the low to mid-20s to get the entire thing to be 20%. So I don't want to sound too cocky on it, but it's like all working. We're just selling a lot. Retention is super great in those sets of businesses. Obviously, spend is growing in the middle market, right, as smaller companies fall, so obviously bigger companies, particularly like in trucking and other areas, are picking it up. \n So I think the message to you guys is, our product line is better and more complete, I just think that this business has kind of really coming into its own now for us. And it's big finally, right? It's going to surpass $1 billion. And I don't know what it was, but not a $1 billion a few years ago. So it's become a sizable thing now for the company. Yes. So that one is really still a work in process because the core business is middle market. I'd say this is an acorn, but it's a pretty small part. And so when we took a swing and miss at the cross-sell, I did, we did, not a super smart thing. We've really said, okay, how do we get the product to be right for the scene and how do we get the distribution to be right for the scene. So what we've concluded is we are not going to chase super-duper small accounts that don't have much AP that are at the very bottom. \n And so we're really kind of retooling the product and distribution to be upmarket a bit, so still below middle market but kind of off of the floor. And particularly, given what we're seeing and hearing in the marketplace, that seems like the right call to have not rushed into like super micro kind of AP accounts. So we'll report more. [ I'd say it doesn't matter how ] it is a priority since we did the swing and the miss on the cross-sell, but we are continuing to work it."

            "content": "Thanks, Ron. First, the financial details. As mentioned, we posted 10% growth in revenue in the quarter driven by 7% organic growth or $57 million, which I'll delve into in a moment. The remaining percentages came from $20 million of macro tailwinds and $4 million from acquisitions made over the past year. Organic revenue growth was negatively affected by the impact of one-off items not expected to repeat from the fourth quarter of 2021, including breakage, backlogged card orders, accounting true-ups in the normal course and acquisition accruals. We expect 2023 organic revenue growth to meet our double-digit targets.\n Corporate payments average revenue growth was 20% driven by continued strong new sales across both direct and cross-border. Specifically, our direct corporate payments business grew 27% and continues to demonstrate very robust growth. Cross-border was up 24%, another very good quarter as new sales remained strong, activity levels were robust across nearly all geographies and we completed the full tech integration of AFEX into our cross-border platforms. Lodging continued to perform well, up 14%. \n While we've largely lapped the airline COVID recovery benefit, the airline business was still up 38% in the quarter. The suite of services we've bought into this business substantially enlarges the TAM and durability of our lodging growth profile over the medium term. Fuel was up organically 2%, with growth in international fuel largely offset by softness in our U.S. micro SMB customer segment. And by micro, we mean companies with less than 5 vehicles, so the smallest of the small. The economic cost of higher fuel prices, inflation and, in the case of micro SMB trucking, lower spot rates, have negatively affected their ability to manage expenses, including their fuel bills, which has resulted in higher bad debt. \n We have also seen some negative mix shift among that micro trucking segment as higher-margin independent trucking volume is moving to lower-margin volume as those drivers move to the larger contract carriers. This micro segment generated more than 75% of our U.S. fuel bad debt losses in both the fourth quarter and full year 2022, fully feeling the brunt of these economic headwinds. Given the higher loss rates of the micro client segment that we are experiencing, we have significantly tightened credit approval standards and have purposefully targeted a narrow way in order to get ahead of any further stress in this micro segment. The result was a drag in organic fuel growth in the quarter. \n We are taking a balanced approach to new customer demand gen activities, prioritizing customer segments and industries that are healthier to drive fuel growth in 2023, all while limiting our bad debt exposure. We will continue to feel the residual effect of tighter credit and higher losses in that micro segment in the first half of 2023 but would expect to clear this overhang and return to normalized fuel growth rates in the back half of the year. This will likely cause 2023 fuel organic growth to be at the low end of our normal range. \n Tolls was up 6% compared with last year as the impact of strong new sales was masked by almost $5 million of nonrecurring revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. Toll sales were strong in the current quarter, recovering from softer sales midyear and helping offset some of the prior year onetime benefit impact. We expect tolls to return to its low to mid-teens growth rate in 2023. \n We've made great progress building out the Beyond Toll network and now have over 5,400 Beyond Toll locations, including 2,200 fueling stations, 2,300 parking lots, 750 drive-throughs and 150 carwashes that accept our tag. As an additional service to our customers, we are a reseller of insurance from other companies to our more than 6 million tag holders in Brazil, for whom we have negotiated preferential pricing. This insurance offering is growing quite fast. We sold more than 58,000 insurance policies in the quarter. We also signed up Santander as a toll distribution partner, which is the fifth largest bank in the country. All in all, we're very bullish on the outlook for our Brazil business.\n Gift organic growth in Q4 was down 11% over prior year Q4 as the card orders that pulled forward in the last 2 quarters and in Q4 prior year did not repeat. Due to the lumpy nature of card orders between quarters, it is best to look at full year gift organic growth, which was 11%, as the newer online card sales programs and that the B2B program have improved the growth of that business. \n Looking further down the income statement, operating expenses of $514 million represented an increase over prior Q4, primarily due to recent acquisitions, higher bad debt and volume-related increases. We did recognize $5 million in expense associated with reductions to staffing levels and the termination of office space leases as we adjusted our expense base for the current challenging environment. We will continue to manage our expenses with a very close eye on our outlook. Bad debt expense was $41 million or 9 basis points, consistent with the third quarter 2022 level. I've already talked about what we're doing to manage this, but suffice it to say, we're very focused on it.\n Moving below the line, interest expense was $74 million for the quarter, up 168% over the prior Q4 and $165 million for the full year, up 45%. These increases were driven by higher reference rates on our floating rate debt as well as incremental borrowings for share repurchases and acquisitions. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.2% versus 25.6% last year and lower than our guidance. The primary driver was the impact of a pandemic-related tax benefit election in Brazil realized for 2022 in the quarter. \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with over $1.4 billion in unrestricted cash and approximately $600 million available on our revolver. There was $5.7 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, and we had $1.3 billion borrowed on our securitization facility. As a reminder, earlier in the year, we upsized and extended our credit facility by approximately $500 million and extended the maturity through June 2027 at quite attractive rates. As of December 30, our leverage ratio was 2.8x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. \n Our capital allocation was once again balanced in 2022. In the quarter, we repurchased roughly 600,000 shares at an average price of $188 per share. In total, we've repurchased about 6.2 million shares during 2022 for $1.4 billion. Our guidance for share count for 2023 is 5 million shares lower than what we guided to a year ago. In total, we've bought back 11.7 million shares over the last 2 years. We still have over $1.2 billion authorized for future repurchases. In 2022, we spent $217 million on acquisitions and minority investments, excluding Global Reach on January 1, 2023, solidifying our positions in EV, corporate payments and lodging. \n Now let me share some thoughts on our Q1 outlook and our full year assumptions. Looking ahead, we're expecting Q1 2023 revenue to be between $875 million and $890 million and adjusted net income per share to be between $3.55 and $3.75. This is largely due to revenue seasonality for certain businesses, such as fuel, lodging and tolls tend to have lighter first quarters due to weather and holidays. As such, the first quarter tends to be the lowest in terms of both revenue and profit for our company. \n We have a bit of a preview for the first few weeks of the year, and we are tracking to the guidance we are providing. Of note, for the full year 2023, we anticipate managing bad debt flat to the 2022 levels, expecting it will be higher in the first half of the year and then improve into the second half. We expect 2023 net interest expense to be between $312 million and $332 million based on the forward curve as of February 1, 2023, which implies reference rates will peak sometime during the third quarter of 2023. \n As we disclosed in the earnings release and you can see on Slides 21 and 22 of our supplement, we entered into a series of interest rate swap agreement to fixed rates on approximately $1.5 billion of our floating rate debt. These swaps will provide some relief on our 2023 rate and help limit the downside risk from further rising interest rates. The inverted forward rate curve enabled us to reduce 2023 interest expense by locking in lower future rates over a 3-year period. With these new swaps, along with our previous outstanding swaps, we now have fixed interest rates on a total of $2 billion of our variable rate debt for most of 2023. \n Last week, we also entered into a euro cross-currency swap to benefit from the lower euro interest rates with an implied interest savings of 1.96% on $500 million of notional debt. With these various swaps, we have now managed interest rate and FX risk on $2.5 billion or 47% of our debt, excluding the securitization. We believe these actions will help mitigate the risk associated with continued increasing interest rates in 2023. We estimate these swaps to reduce interest expense by approximately $35 million in 2023. \n And finally, our tax rate in 2023 is expected to be slightly higher, between 26% and 27%, as the continued benefit from the Brazil tax holiday is more than offset by higher tax rates in the U.K. as the U.K. statutory tax rate increases from 19% to 25% in April of 2023. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement.\n As I complete my prepared remarks, I would like to extend our gratitude to our more than 10,000 employees around the world who helped us deliver such a strong finish to a great year and who will be the driving force to even greater heights throughout '23. Thank you for your interest in our company. \n And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. It did. And so we saw a decent amount in our toll business as well as a little bit in our fuel business. And I would just add, this is all normal course of business stuff. It just seemed to be a collection. Yes. I mean, I would expect that short of the macro adjustments we make always for organic revenue growth, which neutralizes those items, that we wouldn't expect anything meaningful other than as we perhaps called out in the same quarter prior year, so I would encourage you to look back at those notes. But I mean, I think other than as we've spoken to the micro SMB customer segment in our fuel business, I think that's going to be the only item to speak of. Yes. Sheriq, it's Alissa. It's a good question. On share count, I'll first say, in our guidance, we never include the impact of potential buybacks because we see it similar to our capital allocation decisions, like acquisition or divestiture. We're going to hold those decisions until they make sense. And so we do not build that into guidance. And then I guess, in terms of the share count as we run in, the number you see that we presented in our assumptions is consistent with what we expect for the rest of the year. And fairly aligned with where you saw us come out of Q3 and what you can now see in the Q4 number. Yes. So Nik, it's Alissa. It's a good question. To make sure I got all your question, I think you're asking what is kind of same-store sales look and how are we outlooking? Oh, reacceleration. So yes, so for same-store sales, I would say we always say that same-store sales sort of a massive easy comp is usually in the minus 1% to plus 1% range. And I would say that we did see it soften just a little bit more than that in the fourth quarter to minus 2%. But as we look into reacceleration, it really is just retweaking the engine as we head into '23, repointing that digital engine to higher credit quality customers and then just refocusing the entire sales engine across the board to target those, I'll just call it, healthier customer bases in segments."

[Operator Instructions]  Please note this event is being recorded. I'd like to turn the conference to Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nJames Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Alissa Vickery, our Interim CFO. Following  the prepared comments, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then that you can get in line for questions.\n Please note, our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com. Now throughout this call, we will be covering organic revenue growth. As a reminder, this metric neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads.\n It also includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed during the 2 years being compared. We will also be covering non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than that at other companies. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website.\n I also need to remind everybody that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have of today. All statements about our outlook, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them.\n We undertake no obligation to update any of these statements. These expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. Now with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? \nRonald F. Clarke: Jim, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q3 2022 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects. First, I'll provide my take on Q3 results. Second, I'll provide updated full year 2022 guidance. Third, provide just a brief preview of 2023, along with some of the factors that will affect our performance.\n And then lastly, I'll catch you up on a few recent developments. Okay. Let me turn to our Q3 results, which were quite good and ahead of our expectations. We reported revenue of $893 million, that's up 18%,  and cash EPS of $4.24, that's up 21%. Our EBITDA for the quarter exceeded $450 million. Organic revenue growth, quite good, coming in at 13%. That was led by our corporate payments business at 21% and our lodging business at 28%.\n Trends in the quarter quite are good also. Same-store sales finished plus 2%, retention remaining steady at 92%. And overall sales performance, just terrific, up 24% for the quarter. We onboarded almost 60,000 new clients during Q3. So the fundamentals of the business remain very solid, obviously, selling a lot and retaining a lot.\n Look, additionally, I want to point out that we're continuing to strengthen the setup, the positioning of the company, which obviously improves our growth prospects going forward, added some important EV assets and further refined our plan to go on offense. We added some pretty important AP automation software to front end our corporate payments solution set that really rounds out for us that AP solution set. And we continue to expand our fuel footprint in Brazil, driving transaction growth there.\n I think we're expecting an exit rate of about $10 million annual add-on fueling transaction. So good progress. Okay. Let me shift gears and turn to our updated full year 2022 guidance along with the assumptions behind it. So we're revising full year 2022 revenue guidance up to $3.410 billion at the midpoint. This includes absorbing about $8 million of macro headwind in the second half versus our August guide. \n We're maintaining full year 2022 cash EPS guidance of $15.95 at the midpoint, same number we gave in August. This does include a bit of a flip-flop. We pulled some revenue forward through gift orders into Q3 that we had outlooked in Q4. We're also absorbing about $0.04 to $0.05 of dilution from the new Plugsurfing and Accrualify acquisitions. We're also incurring about $30 million of incremental bad debt and interest expense way above our August guide as the Fed has accelerated their interest rate increases.\n So if we achieve this $3.410 billion and $15.95 updated '22 guidance, that would represent 20% revenue growth and 21% earnings growth for the full year versus 2021. Okay. Importantly, next up, I'm going to share a brief preview of our early look into 2023. So like most companies, we're expecting the '23 setup to be quite challenging. We do run the business, plan the business on a macro neutral basis, really so that we can operate through any kind of cycle, good or bad. Then we do overlay our spending and capital allocation decisions based on the environment we're seeing.\n So for '23, we're expecting organic revenue growth overall of about 10% which is our target. That's based on our preliminary '23 budget submissions. Inside of that, probably no surprise, global fleet outlooking mid- to high single digits. Our lodging and Brazil businesses mid-teens and our corporate payment business for next year, high teens. And by the way, closing in on almost $1 billion of overall revenue next year, so getting quite significant.\n We'll bake in clearly less OpEx expense growth next year with a goal of delivering 200 to 300 basis points of margin improvement. We're hopeful we can reach a '23 cash EPS with a [ $17 ] handle but that's ultimately going to turn on; one, the level of sales investment we make and then the corresponding bad debt that comes with that. Two, interest rates where they peak and if and when they start down. Three, FX rates, a particular eye on the pound, does it recover? \n And then lastly, recession, do we get one. And if we do, what would the depth and duration be? So look, on the recession front, in particular, we wouldn't describe FLEETCOR's recession proof but pretty recession resilient. Some of the reasons that we should be pretty recession resilient are: first, our solutions are essential, generally not discretionary. Demand for our services runs higher in inflationary or cost conscious times, think fuel this year and the demand that we see.\n And lastly, our businesses are really diverse geographically, by client size from SMB to enterprise, lots of verticals we serve, obviously, lots of product or spending categories. We're by no means immune to some client segments, certain client segments being impacted by recession, for example, construction. And for sure, we'll reel in restrict credit in the event of a downturn and that, for sure, pressures revenue.\n So look, we plan to have a much clearer picture of 2023 when we speak again in 90 days, and we'll offer up our formal '23 guidance then? Okay. Let me transition to my last subject, which is to catch you up on a few recent developments. And let me begin with the FTC case. So the court held a 2-day hearing on the FTC matter that was on October 20 and 21. Importantly, the judge concluded that she would not enter the proposed FTC order and rather encouraged the parties to mediate to negotiate, so that we've agreed to engage with the FTC and see what we can work out. We do think that the face-to-face court hearing was really quite helpful.\n It gave us a chance to summarize the various disclosure and process enhancements that we have voluntarily made really over the last 4 or 5 years, all of them aimed at enhancing our customer experience. So some of the enhancements we called out were eliminating certain digital add claims and the language around that. We ceased selling add-on features via negative option and instead packaged up various features in the 3 packages and sell those affirmatively upfront.\n We designed and implemented much bigger, bolder Ts and Cs, including a [indiscernible] like fee box that's front and center. And lastly, we collected express or what we call affirmative consent from 96% of our fuel card client base to the specific terms of their card program. We've also proposed some new incremental enhancements going forward. That would include crediting client payments on the day we receive them versus the day they're posted along with some other items that comply with the CFPB consumer payment standards. Obviously, we're B2B, but are willing to do this.\n We've talked about combining our invoicing and reporting materials into a single consolidated package to make it easier for clients to review. And we said repeatedly, I think, throughout this FTC case that we're trying to cooperate trying to be transparent. We simply emphasize to the court that we need to know exactly what the practices are that we're being asked to implement. And if we can understand them, we'll implement, we'll comply with them.\n We're also saying again today that we don't believe that the disclosure enhancements that we've already made which we can see nor the additional ones that we're contemplating will have a material impact on the company's go-forward financial performance.\n Okay. Let me turn to our situation in Russia. We've made the decision to explore selling the Russia business. We've retained a local investment bank. We have formally launched the sales process, it is underway. The business does generate meaningful free cash flow. So that can potentially support acquisition financing, along with annual dividends. And we think that, that should provide a reasonable floor on the valuation.\n Additionally, we completed all of the isolation or separation steps necessary to carve the business away from FLEETCOR. This provides assurance that we can maintain compliance with the sanctions. And we do plan to move into this isolation or passive ownership phase beginning in early December. And obviously, we will keep you updated on the sale process.\n So lastly, on the acquisition and capital allocation front, we did complete 3 capability acquisitions since we spoke last. So corporate payments add-on called Accrualify on August 1; an important EV deal in Europe, Plugsurfing on September 1, and we closed literally yesterday an international workforce lodging deal called Roomex. And finally, we expect to complete the cross-border deal called Global Reach, which is a bolt-on around the end of the year. So as you can see, we focused really on capability acquisitions in this environment, choosing to strengthen, again, the positioning and setup of the company over the midterm.\n We do hope that M&A valuations reset a bit next year, higher interest rates will obviously take hold. And just maybe we can get back to larger accretive transactions. Additionally, we did repurchase $500 million of FLT in Q3 at what we think are quite attractive prices. So look, in closing today, again, very good Q3 results. Earnings grew 21%, maintaining our full year '22 cash EPS guidance at $15.95 despite a bit weakening macro that we're absorbing. This would represent a $0.70 higher number than the initial EPS guidance that we provided in February.\n We do expect '23 to be a challenging year, but see our overall organic growth rate in and around 10% our target. And again, our earnings turning mostly on the interest rate and FX environment. The FTC case, finally winding down. Again, we do not expect a material impact going forward. We have decided to explore the sale of our Russia business, again, underway and delighted with these handful of capability acquisitions this quarter.\n Lastly, many thanks to Alissa here for stepping in to the CFO role on an interim basis. So now over to you, Alissa. \nAlissa Vickery: Thanks, Ron. I'm happy to be here on my first earnings call as CFO, albeit on an interim basis. I look forward to meeting many of you on the conference circuit in the fourth quarter. But now let's look at some more detail on the quarter. As Ron mentioned, we posted 18% growth in revenue, driven by 13% organic growth or $96 million, which I'll delve into in a moment.\n The remaining growth was 4% or $27 million from macro tailwinds and 2% or $14 million from acquisitions made over the past year. Impacting our results were fuel prices of $4.46 per gallon for the quarter, higher than prior year of $3.15 which contributed $26 million of additional revenues versus prior year and lower than our $4.64 guidance assumption from August. Fuel spread revenue was also quite positive by about $21 million compared to the prior year as falling fuel prices during the quarter caused spreads to widen. Offsetting these tailwinds was a $21 million negative impact of lower foreign exchange rates primarily resulting from unfavorable movement in the British pound. \n Now moving to organic growth. Corporate payments was up 21%, driven by continuing strong new sales across both direct and cross-border. Specifically, our direct corporate payments business, or nonpartner business grew 24% and continues to demonstrate very robust growth, especially for AP, which grew 44%. Cross-border was up 30%, another very good quarter as new sales remained strong and activity levels were again robust across nearly all geographies.\n Our channel partner business is just under 10% of the corporate payments category and declined 13% in the quarter as our focus is on growing our direct businesses. Fuel grew organically 5% as we did see some volume softness in our U.S. SMB businesses. However, our new sales growth was 13%, and we continue to see a normalized level of flat, same-store sales contributing to the performance. Overall transaction volumes remain positive and consistent with last quarter, although we continue to see slight moderation in new sales activity.\n Tolls was up 12% organically compared with last year as the business continues to perform. New sales are solid, driven by our expanded product utility and differentiated value proposition. As a reminder, our toll solution can be used to pay for multiple spend categories, such as parking and drive through retail, and we are now generating meaningful revenue from our Beyond Toll use cases.\n Lodging continued to show strength in Q3, up 28%. All 3 business lines: Workforce, Airlines and Insurance each had double-digit organic growth. With Airlines, again, leading the way at 55%. Growth was driven by a combination of higher year-over-year volume in Workforce and Airlines and a favorable rate environment across all 3 businesses. Gift had another good quarter, up 9% as customer card orders continue to be pulled forward from Q4.\n We estimate that approximately $6 million of revenue was pulled into Q3 due to early ordering in advance of the holiday season. In addition to the $10 million to $12 million we estimated was pulled forward into the second quarter. Looking further down the income statement, operating expenses of $504 million represented a 21% increase over $417 million in Q3 of the prior year due to increases tied to higher volumes across our businesses, incremental bad debt, stock compensation and new sales generation activities.\n Increases were also driven by the inclusion of the ALE and Plugsurfing acquisitions in addition to higher incentives and commissions as a result of strong new sales in certain of our businesses. Bad debt expense was $37 million or 8 basis points which was about $10 million higher than last quarter and more in line with prepandemic bad debt levels. In the third quarter of 2021, bad debt was $11 million or  3 basis points. This increase was driven primarily by higher loss severity as a result of higher fuel prices in the second quarter as well as increases in application volume and application fraud.\n Bad debt levels remain elevated as a result of strong sales to new customers who tend to have a higher loss rate than the existing book, higher fuel prices and the changing macroeconomic landscape, which puts pressure on our smaller customers. Interest expense increased 56% year-over-year, driven by higher rates on our floating rate debt with average LIBOR or SOFR in the current quarter of 2.2% compared to 0.09% in the same period prior year.\n As Ron noted, we'll provide guidance for 2023 in February when we report our full year earnings. I did want to make one comment on how to think about net interest expense all in for 2023. We currently estimate that our 2023 net interest expense is likely to be closer to double the 2022 level. This assumes that benchmark index rates peak next year between 4.5% and 5% and remain in that range for most of the year.\n While all of our debt instruments are floating rate, we do have $500 million of hedges that will be in place for almost all of 2023 at 2.56%. Also, we have over $1 billion in cash balances globally on which we earn interest. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.8% versus 24.1% last year, which is more of a normalized tax rate for the business.\n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with over $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash and approximately $600 million available on our revolver. There was $5.7 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, and we had $1.5 billion borrowed in our securitization facility. As of September 30, our leverage ratio was 2.95x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. \n In the quarter, we upsized and extended our securitization facility by $100 million to $1.7 billion and extended the maturity by 1 year to August 2025. There were a number of minor changes to the agreement, which will be detailed in our 10-Q next week. We repurchased roughly 2.2 million shares at an average price of [ $2.24 ] per share for a total of $500 million during Q3. This includes the roughly 900,000 shares repurchased before our earnings call in August. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 5.6 million shares for $1.3 billion. The Board approved another $1 billion in repurchases under our program on October 25 and extended the program through February 2024.\n With this upsizing, we now have approximately $1.355 billion  available for future repurchases. As Ron has covered our full year guidance update, let me now share some thoughts on our guidance assumptions. We are assuming fuel prices of $4.25 in Q4. Market spreads favorable to the fourth quarter of 2021, total interest expense of $157 million to $167 million for 2022, which assumes average reference rates of 3.75% in Q4. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement. Thank you for your interest. And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. \nDarrin Peller: Even looking on like a 2-year basis, the Fleet segment looks like it's high single digits or about 9%, 10% growth when just stacking it. It definitely looks like it's trending back to a normal rate or even better than a normal rate versus what I think you guys would have expected. So can you touch on that for a minute in terms of where we are in your view versus any type of recovery. And then obviously, again, going into a more uncertain macro environment, they're resilient to that business because it does look like it's gotten to a point where it's doing the right thing from a growth rate standpoint.\n And then just quickly, the add-ons, the follow-ons and the cross-sells that you've been really able to implement, how has that been going, Ron? And if you could just touch on that too. \nRonald F. Clarke: Darrin, thanks. So on the first one, I think we're still kind of in the 5% to 8% kind of target range based on what we elect to invest. Some of the overperformance recently is literally the COVID recovery kind of [ climb ] back from the [ debts ] there in 2020. So I think we're probably mostly unchanged because we've got a lot of the businesses to feed and investments to make that we're kind of happy in that mid- to high single digits. So that's our target.\n On the add-ons, I'd still say still early days. We're still struggling with where in the base, right? We've got a couple of hundred thousand clients we should target. So I think I mentioned initially we were thinking, hey, we'll go to where the bulk is down market and then realize most of the spend is in the larger accounts there, which we get after different distribution.\n So I'd say we're still testing some different ways to do that but have the goal of the company to turn the fuel card business, as I said, into our corporate payments business. So work in process. \nDarrin Peller: Yes. No, that's helpful. And just one quick follow-up, if you don't mind, is on the -- your preliminary outlook for next year. When you talk about the different assumptions, I guess, first of all, the reported -- the revenue growth target you talked, I think you said 10% organic. Is that -- that's organic, I'm assuming? Is that reported or constant currency? I think it's -- and then also, when we think of the $17, just the assumptions on fuel and macro that go into that, again, it seems like the underlying core assumptions are sustainable and seem like they've really gotten to a point that's been strong. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. So on the first one, I'd say, we're kind of halfway through, Darrin, the '23 budget cycle. So we've worked on revenue, obviously, harder than the expense and the profit side. So as I said, it's a mix of the different business lines, fuel, lodging, Brazil and corporate payments have different growth rates to kind of weight themselves to 10%. That is an organic number, although the print at this point looks pretty similar because we have some pro forma revenue kind of rolling forward, right, from '22 to '23 offset by what we think could be some macro headwinds, particularly FX.\n So at this point, year-to-date, not a big difference between organic and print. And then on the bottom, again, I think the thing we can control is really the operating margin. So we're doing a lot of work on metering the OpEx so that we can grow kind of EBITDA margins, 200 or 300 bps next year. So call it, I don't know, we're coming on, I think, around 52-ish this year that we try to get that up a couple of points.\n And then the wild card is really the below the line after today's Fed call, I'm not sure how encouraged or not any of us should be. But wherever that number flies to and then descends and then obviously, the FX, particularly the pound. So that's really the wait and see. So we're just trying to give a rough super early days view, obviously, hopefully, all us will know a bunch more in 90 days. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: I wanted to first ask about Russia. And maybe if you wouldn't mind updating us on the size of that business, so we kind of contemplate what it might mean to take it out of numbers. And also just -- I'm pretty sure the answer here is it's not contemplated in that preliminary read of next year, but the idea would be if you came to an agreement there to sell the business that we would then need to sort of get that out of our models next year? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Ramsey, it's Ron. So yes, both good questions. So on the first one, it obviously depends on the FX, the kind of ballpark gets $100 million-ish, little bit more in revenue at kind of a 75% EBITDA margin, again, kind of where the FX is today. And yes, we haven't done anything in terms of taking it out although, of course, we've looked at models where we sell it for X and we use that cash to buy back, which really manages obviously the dilution as we look into next year. So we'll certainly keep you guys apprised. We're kind of live out shopping the thing now. So we'll keep you posted. \nAlissa Vickery: And I'll just add. This is Alissa. The specifics around Russia have been included in our 10-Q disclosures previously as well in terms of sizing. \nRamsey El-Assal: Great. Great. One quick follow-up for me. On the FTC matter, I guess, first, is there any sense of timing in terms of when this might be resolved? Is this the type of thing now where there's a relatively protracted negotiation? Or will it be resolved sort of in short order to the degree that you can tell?\n And then, Ron, you seem pretty confident there's no P&L impact here. Is there any best or worst case type of outcomes? Or is it really like no matter how the cookie crumbles here you guys are going to come out of it okay? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. On the first one, we're clearly on some kind of glide path, right, the things in the sense so a guess would be a couple of months -- 2, 3 months, depending on how the [ chitchat ] goes and when the court gets back involved if they do. So that would be my guess.\n On the impact, yes, there's nothing either in their order, which the judge said no to or really anything we're contemplating because it's disclosure based, again, Ramsey, right? It's not, hey, we can't charge something or we can't sign up a customer or whatever. And so the good news is, we've done a bunch of things and had a chance to see. And obviously, we're reporting those changes are embedded right in the results we're putting out.\n So again, there's nothing we can see that would have any material go-forward impact. So probably like you and others on the call, we mostly just want to get on the other side. We've repeatedly said just be specific, tell us what it is that makes everyone happy and we're happy to do it. And so we've done a lot of that. \n And again, it's had little to no impact. I mean when you can sign up 96% of a couple of hundred thousand customers to say they want to continue affirmatively with your program, and you've given them the biggest Ts and Cs in boxes that you have, it makes me feel pretty confident that we've been straight ahead with people. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: I guess a question for you, Ron, just on the valuations for M&A. I mean it seems like there's been a pretty marked decline in fintech valuations. I'm just curious if you're seeing anything pop into your wheelhouse, how we should balance that relative to share repurchases? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, Sanjay. I think to your point, there has been some -- a bit of a reset in the last few months. And you could see by what we've announced in this quarter that -- when we started the process, we focused on these capability things because no matter what the price is they're about capabilities, and they're not large amounts of absolute money. We do have a couple of, what I'll call, more traditional kind of FLEETCOR in the wheelhouse deals that seem to be in ranges that we like that we can transact at. \n And then second, I think, let's see how the thing plays out. As you know, people move their valuation aspirations with time. And so to the extent that people wait and stuff doesn't trade, we think there could be even a further reset next year because right some people are getting squeezed these days. So we're optimistic that things will get better, and we can go back to targeting some larger deals. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Just a follow-up. Alissa, you mentioned the fuel price softness -- sorry, the fuel softness, volume softness. And I'm just curious, if we just dig underneath that, is there something going on there? Do you think it's macro driven? Or what's driving that? And then just a clarification on the interest expense. So we should target around $300 million of net interest expense. Just want to make sure I got that number right. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Sanjay, it's Ron. Why don't I take the first one and then let Alissa take the second one. So no, I'd say the fuel kind of volume and transactions, I think we reported, I think, 4% volume growth, transaction growth for the quarter. I would say it's pocketed. There's a couple of spots like SMB Trucking that are a bit softer than normal, although most of that's offset by enterprise, the big trucking firms.\n I think the biggest thing, Sanjay, is in some of the research we deal with kind of local SMB accounts is the higher price had a smidge of elasticity, kind of moved them back a little bit like, hey, we'll shrink the radius of where we do a plumbing call. We won't go 30 miles out of the city now, we'll only go 10 miles and stuff. And so I do think when the prices were at those peaks, whatever, 3, 4, 5 months ago, that, that also dialed it back a bit.\n But I'd say we're in the smidgy level. It's really nothing significant and it's really nothing across the board. Do you want to take on interest? \nAlissa Vickery: So Sanjay, it's Alissa. So on the interest side, I think you're asking about going into '23. So everybody in the world seems to know that Fed Funds target rates have just skyrocketed. We'll close out the year somewhere around 3.75%. As a reminder, we all started around 0. And then going into 2023, targeting somewhere around 4.5% to 5% for the year. And so we're really out looking at interest expense probably around $300 million plus. So maybe I would take our number and multiply it by 2 and you're probably in the ballpark. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, that's the net number, too, Sanjay, right? There's kind of gross interest expense, and then we've got a bunch of cash at high rates. So to Alissa's point, the gross numbers significantly larger, probably comes down 20% or 25% with the cash that we have offsetting it. But look, it is a total swag route. We're sitting here like you guys trying to guess what the next 14 months are going to be. And we don't know. So we just said, hey, we'll take what we're hearing. We'll kind of run the math that way, and will be a lot higher when we talk again. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. \nAndrew Jeffrey: I appreciate you taking the time to answer my question this afternoon. Ron, some pretty encouraging commentary on margin next year. Can you talk a little bit about how much of that is being driven by cloud migration and digital sales initiatives versus maybe being a little bit more selective in terms of the customers you sign up in the current macro environment? And then if we get a recovery, would we expect, say, in '24, would we expect the margin to sort of come back down a little bit as you lean in to new customer growth a bit more? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. That's a really good question, Andrew. So I'd say that the target that we like to see in the company is 55%. Again, I think we'll pencil around 52% this year. But that thing moves around based on things we buy, right, that run lower margins or weirdo stuff like COVID that crushes revenue quickly and stuff. But I'd say our running internal targets closer to 55%. \n In terms of next year, I think the 2 things you picked up. One is, we knew this was going to be a half a year. I mean, we're going to, I think, be about $0.70 higher than we told in February. I don't know if anyone's applauding, but I consider that good news to do better than we said. And so because we saw that, we kind of opened the spicket. We let people work to your point on some additional projects. We tested some additional things. We staffed up in areas we spend, I'd say, money that we could afford to kind of make the targets that we run the company on.\n So when I see the world tightening, the answer is, we'll be a little bit more approval, a little bit more selective to use your word. And I think the big thing is really around our view of the economy and the credit environment, particularly around the digital side, like you said, because that's where the sales growth, if you will, versus the credit risk are supercorrelated. \n So my guess is we'll kind of enter the thing a bit cautious, kind of cut a little bit of the tail at the bottom. I would initially maybe not try to grow that thing in the low to mid-20%, but maybe 3 to 5 points lower and see how it goes. So it would be just a little bit of a guide on kind of overall OpEx and a little bit of caution around the micro selling and related credit risk. \nAndrew Jeffrey: And in lodging, this is a business that you've been adamant, is awesome, and you've definitely been right in terms of the growth. What do you think that looks like as we lap some tougher compares. What's the normalized growth rate do you think for that lodging business? \nRonald F. Clarke: I think it's high teens to 20%. To your point, we have some favorable comps. We've got a segment in there for airlines, which are obviously in the ditch. So some of it is that. But we're just -- all parts of that business are kind of going great. We're selling a lot in all 3 of them. We bought a new software front end for that airline business and airlines are looking to get added in-house work and stuff.\n So we have the best network, the best rates to offer the different clients that we have. And so between the scale and the selling machine that we have there and the product, they're pretty specialized offering. So there's not lots of other players that can offer really what we do both the convenience and the pricing. So I'd say it's in the high teens to 20% on a normalized basis. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Sheriq Sumar with Evercore ISI. \nSheriq Sumar: I have a question on the cross-selling opportunities. I mean it's been a quarter -- it's been like a few quarters where you have talked about growing it a bit slow on that front just not to upset the customers and the process. But, a, what's the update on that process or on the cross-selling opportunities? And is there a potential for you to ramp up the cross-selling efforts going into 2023? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I think I kind of covered, Sheriq, this comment a bit before, but I'd say it's still a work in process. I think it's my summary that we went headlong into the thing targeting the smaller clients that we have because we have so many of them. And as we get into the thing, we got clear that corporate payments turns on spend, not on client count and that about 5,000 of our clients have about half of all the spend, all the purchasing.\n So we've gone back and targeted those. We have some of our blue-suited salespeople going into our biggest dual card accounts now and selling corporate payments, but we're still trying to figure out, is there a scene, is there a different place inside of our fuel card client base where we can bring corporate payments offerings. So I think a lot of this is like anything that's new. We're learning. We're trying to figure out what the sweet spot is among the super big base and what the product is that fits that sweet spot. So we haven't given up, still work in process. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Pete Christiansen with Citi. \nPeter Christiansen: Nice updates there, Ron. I've 2 questions. One, I wanted to go back to the 12% organic growth that you're seeing in the tolls business. Just wondering, if you could tease that out a little bit, the base tolls business versus some of the Beyond Tolls initiatives that you put forth, including the tag fueling stuff. Wondering if you can give us a sense of how is that contributing to segment growth at this point? And then I have a follow-up. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, Pete, it's good to hear from me. So that one, I think, for Sheriq's question a minute ago was one that's working, I think we're at about 20% now of the revenue there and what we call Beyond Toll, parking, fuel. We've also gotten some super early traction on insurance right, where this vehicle mobility company with millions of customers and so offering insurance that centers around the vehicle and stuff has been a pretty good uptake.\n And so it's going well. The fuel number, which I said is exiting, we think around [ $10 million ] annualized exactly as we thought is kind of correlated to the number of sites. So as we add additional sites that basically can read the tag conveniently low and the old [ transgrow ] because more people use the thing. So we built a plan to continue that, take it up by another 25% or 30% next year.\n So look, the goal would be kind of over the next 2 or 3 years that, that stuff is in the 40% kind of range on top of the core business. And we continue to add -- I mean if there was -- it reminds me of coke here in the U.S. if there was another way to sell a toll tag in Brazil, we know it's like we sell it. In stores, we sell with hangs, things in stores. We sell it at toll booths. We sell it through car makers. We sell it through insurance guys. We sell literally every way that you can get a toll tag to market, we're doing -- selling way over 1 million new ones per year. And so it's a business that despite the competitive set up changing a lot is still performing great for us. Super happy with it. \nPeter Christiansen: Yes, that certainly sounds exciting. I'd like to pivot to fuel card sales a little bit here. I mean, obviously, when we had fuel prices starting to peak up earlier in the year, I'm sure that was helpful in driving new sales, maybe giving you some -- a good degree of inbound activity. Now gas prices come down, diesel is still holding up pretty strong. What's your sense for how fuel prices today are still driving fuel card sales. Is there a tailwind still there? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. No, that's a really good question. They're super related to your point, if you think about, particularly on the digital side, just raw demand, Google counting how many people key in fuel card. You hit it on the head back in the spring or early summer at the peak, that thing was up a lot, right, that inbound demand. But remember, we still sell, I don't know, 40%, 45% of the business nondigitally and some amount -- a decent amount of our digital is us targeting accounts.\n So I'd say it's down some from the peak although the peak reside than we've seen before at an [ edgy path ]. The only thing I'd said back is even at today's current price over the last, call it, whatever, 5 or 7 years, this is still at a super high level. So I'd say, yes, down a bit from the peak, but still -- is still pretty robust. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Jeff Cantwell with Wells Fargo Securities. \nJeffrey Cantwell: And just wanted to follow up on some of the questions that are coming your way. One of them was, can you talk to us a little bit about some of the early underlying assumptions for fuel in 2023. And the way I wanted to frame the question is, if we're all looking at Exhibit 2 in your press release, which is fuel transactions, fuel revenue per transaction.\n Do you have any sense of what the growth rates there would look like for next year in order to get you to mid- to high single-digit revenue growth in fuel. \n And then along the same lines, this is obviously a very dynamic macro environment that interest rate environment. The goalpost is clearly moving all the time. So my second question is, can you talk about what you think is a range, right, your confidence? And whether there's a wider range in that potential outlook for next year versus prior years? And like do you kind of feel that the upside, downside to the mid-high single digit is the same as in past years or maybe it's wider this year. I'd just love to hear your thoughts there. \nAlissa Vickery: All right. Jeff, it's Alissa. So in terms of fuel price assumptions going into next year, we basically left next year consistent with the current period. So we've assumed fuel prices in the range of $4.37 or so with a little bit of downside on the spreads. In terms of your question on rev per trans, I think our intent is generally to always have a nice balance between volume and rate to the extent that there's incremental products being offered. And so now I would say that we would continue to expect that to be a balanced approach. \nRonald F. Clarke: Jeff, this is Ron. Let me just jump on what Alissa said, obviously, mix continues to help us right. We've overrotated to SMB. So we get sequential rate happy just from the mix because we get more rate on smaller accounts than big.\n But on the macro question, I'd say, who knows. I'd say it seems you guys are sitting on the planet with me, it's crazy kind of volatile, not only the things for us like fuel prices, but clearly, FX volatility is super high this year. I don't even want to mention interest rate volatility.\n And so the question is, in 90 days when we get to kind of locking down, finalizing our plan, will the forward view be any clearer, will there be messaging that, that thing is going to stabilize some. And so that's my answer to you to the extent that the big macro things seem like the volatility is slowing, we'll probably use kind of some traditional range. And to the extent that those macro things have a bigger bait around them, then yes, we probably would have something wider to let you know how those things affect us.\n But I said a million times, like we run the company here forever. And we're going to run the company to generate growing revenue and growing certainly EBITDA profits faster and the below the line stuff will come and go. No one's clapping that I can hear that the macro is at our back, and we have $0.70 more, $100 million -- $150 million more in revenue. No one's clapping, understand the other way. So we just -- our game is we just power through it. \n And look, it can't go up forever. If interest rates go up, the cost goes up to $300 million -- and actually it was going to $500 million in '24, maybe they're going to add a $250 million. And so as long as we can keep compounding the top and the EBITDA line, [ 10 and 13 ] we're going to deliver mid- to high teens EPS over the forecast period. So I'd say we just don't see any of these variables continuing to rise sequentially year-over-year. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. \nMihir Bhatia: Want to second the -- thanks for the updates on the FTC Russia and also the early look on 2023, very helpful. And maybe I did want to start on interest expense just for 2023. I apologize to go back to this, but I just want to make sure we have it right. The $300 million to $320-ish million that you've talked about. Does that include Russia? I think that if I recall correctly, there's a fairly high interest rate there, which you're getting and high cash balance, which helps that. So since it's a net number, does that include the Russia benefit, I guess? \nAlissa Vickery: Mihir, it's Alissa. So, yes, it would include any benefit that we're getting off of the deposits that are in Russia certainly on the income side. We don't really have any expense -- interest expense in that region. So it's really... \nRonald F. Clarke: It's payments, Mihir, again. This number, I mean it's a rounding error in the business... \nAlissa Vickery: We do see rates going down in Russia. So hopefully, it's not too big for a loss. \nMihir Bhatia: Right. And then the other question I wanted to ask was just in terms of lodging, I just wanted to understand a little bit more about the Roomex acquisition in terms of just expanding your workforce lodging business into Europe. Is that -- how much of the business was in Europe anyway? And is this like more of a beachhead where you grow from here? Or just trying to understand a little bit more about that. \nRonald F. Clarke: That's a good question. Thanks for that. So the Roomex business, first of all, is really a copycat of our U.S., what we call workforce. If you think about a lot of the blue collar people to travel for work. That's kind of what that Roomex thing is. So we were delighted to identify someone that does kind of the same thing.\n So it's really a U.K. business today. It's got a little bit, I can't remember, 5% maybe of its business in Germany. So the majority of it is in the U.K., which is our second largest market, which was interesting to us. And so yes, the idea there is, hey, they've got assets that sit in the U.K., they've got a lodging network that's attractive. They have sales, they have ops, they have tech that runs there.\n And we have a ton of clients, as you can imagine, like tons of clients and actually a fair number of kind of midsized  and enterprise clients there. So the idea is, hey, we know this business super well. It's in a market that we've got a good position so we can accelerate it and it's a good business on its own. It's got a good group of people. \n So it's really just like our fuel card business or other businesses. We're a global player. We have a business that looks exactly like a business we have, and it's in another country that we can understand then we go there. We liked the price back to someone's question earlier about M&A valuations, I think was a reasonable price for both sides, which is why the trade works. So yes, it will certainly accelerate and it kind of sets us up to make a business with bigger TAM that we can understand. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. \nRobert Napoli: Nice job on quarter. I appreciate the outlook for next year. Just I was hoping to get maybe a little bit more color on -- I appreciate the segment margins that you started giving us. But just with margin expansion next year, where are you most confident in margin expansion next year and then maybe over the long term? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Bob, it's good to hear your voice and that you're up and at 'em here, so good to hear from you. We don't really plan the margin expansion really by lines of business. The discretionary monies that are big in our company are sales and IT. And so that's how we think about it. For us to boost EBITDA margins 200 basis points will just kind of flatten out a little bit, not grow as fast some of the sales investment and IT.\n And people may say, \"Oh, how is that going to work? Well, when you make a pretty big investment incrementally like we did this year, you pick up the productivity really in the forward years, right, because you've hired new people or you've got new leads in the pipeline. And so some of the investments -- incremental investments we made in '22 will kind of roll in, we'll pour into '23. So we've got a decent game plan of OpEx that will service the business we have and meet the growth targets. And again, because we spent a bit more this year, that's kind of helpful to us for next year. \nRobert Napoli: Great. And just like a big picture question. Which part of your business are you most excited about over the next 3 to 5 years, that's going to become a much bigger piece of your business, if you would? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, Matt, like you, I know it's your favorite. I mean, it's hard not to like what we call our corporate payments business just because of the enormity. The market we -- if you guys -- you may get a kick out of the story, but I moved a guy that ran -- who still runs our international fleet business to run our old business.\n So he's here, and I'm talking to them the other night, so we get on the corporate payments, cheese he says, I never understood like what a mess the U.S. is, all this paper and trying to pay from. And so like I think as we live here, we don't even think about it, that it's just the opportunity there to make that just a gigantic business. It's -- in our prelims it's closing in on $1 billion next year, and we spent -- no one knows this better than you a couple of years getting all the puzzle pieces together so that we've got kind of a full suite of stuff.\n And so I just think that the potential is so big and the competition, even though you and others keep talking about -- [ friggin ] fintechs, I tell you the whole market is banks and Amex, and we're winning. That's where 90% of our business comes from. And so we -- we just like the chances to bring what we have at great sales again in Q3, record sales. And so that's the business that will be dramatically bigger in the next few years. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. \nKenneth Suchoski: I just had a clarification question on Russia. Does the $17 EPS figure include the EPS contribution from Russia. And I just -- can you talk a little bit about how you're able to actually access the proceeds from a sale of that Russia business. Just want to make sure that we have that right. \nRonald F. Clarke: Ken, it's Ron. Yes, on the first one. We haven't sold a business, so it's still part of our planning, although again, the idea that we have would be to take the cash from the sale and obviously, the retained earnings that we have sitting there. And if our stock stays at this price, so obviously buy a lot of it, which will compress the dilution.\n In terms of the proceeds, it's how we're going to set it up with a buyer. The buyer is going to have to basically be able to pay us outside of there. So it's one of the kind of the conditions of the buyers that we're looking at. So we do have a way basically depending on who the buyer is for them to be able to pay us. \nKenneth Suchoski: Okay. Great. That's really helpful, Ron. And then I appreciate all the continued disclosure on profitability by segment. I just had a follow-up question to Bob's question. I mean it looks like the corporate payments business has a 43% EBITDA margin. Is there an opportunity to bring that segment margin up closer to the corporate average over the long term? Or do you have to continue invest in that business to drive that high teens revenue growth? \nRonald F. Clarke: That's another super good question. So kind of a 2-part question. The first one is really scale, right, trying to make that business in some of the pieces dramatically bigger. So like all of our businesses, it's got a lot of fixed cost, call it, 40% to 50% of the cost structure of that business is fixed. So clearly, the incremental margins are better.\n And then it's really just the trade for growth, like we -- it's not a hard math for you guys, if you want to grow something at 20% versus 10% or 8%, you have to spend more money, right, to grow it faster. And so that's really the second part of it is, given the TAM, given the size of the opportunity, we'll probably continue to overinvest and run, that EBITDA margin is a bit lower than the line average. But again, it's because we're setting it up to grow faster.\n It's not a reason -- just there's nothing structurally. In other words, if you said to me, that thing gets to $1.5 billion or $2 billion, and I want to take the growth rate down on the line average, there's nothing structurally that would stop us from having that business look an awful lot like the rest of our line average businesses. \nOperator: Our next question will come from John Davis with Raymond James. \nJohn Davis: Ron, I just wanted a little -- talk a little bit about bad debt expense and have you tightened the credit box at all? I know we've just kind of normalized, but given what most feel is some sort of macro softness coming at some point, have you contemplated that, especially when you talk about kind of mid- to high single-digit fuel growth next year? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Good question, John. Yes, is the short answer. So I think we hope we reported this, but I think we have to, call it, [ 25, 25, 35, 35 ] is kind of a guesstimate at the full year credit loss number. And so when we saw the thing the forwards, the roll rates get a bit worse, we did tighten the new account selling. So we have 2 kinds of credit; one is, hey, who are we going to take in. We used to take in 10 people, 10 companies, now we're going to take in 8, so we're going to cut the tail off. \n And then the second one is really credit lines, right for customers that we have, right? If we're willing to give you more credit to buy more things, we can get more revenue. So that's the one that we're looking at pulling back selectively kind of in certain areas. So we've done it on new. We haven't done it yet on existing and partly because we have much better information, right? The underwriting is much better on our existing customers because we have all that payment history on them.\n So that's a key thing for us to watch is really the trade. Remember, probably about half of all of our credit losses, whatever 25, 25, 35, 35 as up to whatever, $120 million, $130 million, half of that, John, is basically tied to new business. right, which is a way high number versus the base. So that's the place that we always start. \nJohn Davis: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow up on the margin commentary going into next year. As I think about fuel prices probably being flat to down a little bit higher, at least for the full year, bad debt expense, I'm penciling out that kind of OpEx is going to be kind of flat to down year-over-year to get to kind of 200 to 300 basis points of margin expansion? Just -- I know you said you spent a lot kind of given the outperformance this year on kind of the better COVID recovery. But I just want to kind of make sure that, that pencils and that you can kind of hold the line on OpEx in order to get back to kind of what you call it normalized profitability kind of in the mid-50s on an EBITDA margin basis. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, I want to make sure people clear. It's super early days. We're doing what we call the envelope work of framing what an envelope is. So we're far from done. But I think the biggest difference to what you said is that the sales investment and the nature of the sales investment has a huge impact on the bad debt on a forward basis. So the easiest way for us to improve profitability in 2023 would slow or cut the tail, certainly in the digital micro accounts and keep all that bad debt out of our P&L.\n So that's the most logical place. But yes, it's not far off what you're saying that the exit rate of our OpEx will obviously grow probably low single digits. And then what you said, it depends obviously were fuel prices. But remember, that also ties, it's correlated to bad debt. right? So one of the reasons our bad debt is higher again is our fuel price was higher here in 2022.\n If the fuel price is lower, by definition, the bad debt will be lower. So look, lots of these variables move together. And my messaging is just to tell everybody that we're going to run the business kind of macro constant and then open our eyes to what the macro is and make OpEx and capital allocation pivots based on what we see. And what we're seeing now is we're probably going to slow the OpEx. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Trevor Williams from Jefferies. \nTrevor Williams: I was hoping you guys could unpack the 4Q guidance a bit and some of the moving pieces because it implies revenues down more than $20 million Q3 to Q4. Typical seasonality for you guys is up $20 million plus in normal years, at least. I guess fuel prices are lower sequentially. You've got the pull forward in gift, some of the softness in U.S. SMB and Fleet, but anything else moving pieces-wise you'd call out organically for why you aren't seeing the same normal Q3 to Q4 step out? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I'll jump on that in to listen. I think you named kind of most of them. I'm sure it's -- whatever you're saying, kind of plus or minus $10 million on whatever, $900 million. So it's not a material kind of number. But those are it. It's kind of a flip flopping this year versus last. Back last year, there was some huge late gift orders because retailers are out of stock from being careful.\n And so that number was a pretty big whopper number, if I remember, in Q4 last year. And this year, they said, \"hey, we getting ready sooner\" and so put tons of orders in earlier. And then what you said, we're running at, I don't know, $4.30-or-something fuel price, which has ticked down, obviously, from Q2 to Q3 and then into Q4, which takes them off the talk. But then again, it helps expenses.\n As I said earlier, both borrowings and bad debt. So the biggest thing is just the normal seasonality. What you said if we look at the last, whatever years you cleaned up, pro forma acquisitions or stuff, 2 or 3 of our business is soft in a fair amount, which is less workdays in the fourth quarter, both here and abroad. And so it's just -- it's really just that, that Q4 and Q1 are just less workdays or softer. And Q2 and Q3 are higher. And so there's not -- there's really nothing like super-duper going on, like as we model the thing to embed the guidance here, I would say there's nothing else that sticks out. \nAlissa Vickery: It's Alissa. I'll just add on to that a little bit. We talked about it earlier in the call that interest expense really is significantly worse than where -- I think we all projected even from the Fed's perspective back in July when we were getting our previous guidance. And so that is a big headwind going into the fourth quarter. \nRonald F. Clarke: I mean just for you guys, like I don't how you see this, but hey, we're kind of saying put in the second half, the revenue for second half is a bit higher than we said 90 days ago, and I guess the profits are the same. I said before, our macro was off by $8 million, the runway interest expenses, whatever, $20 million higher. So underneath the hood, we've been able to do some things to make the thing work.\n So the trend and the performance, again, separate from the macro, my message would be a pretty good kind of as good or better than we thought 90 days ago. So we're not seeing any kind of blinking red lights yet. And like all the questions on this call, the profitability a lot will turn on where those macro things land in glidepath next year.\n But I just do want to remind people that like to own stock for more than a week that what comes up, does come down and things don't keep going up for multiple years in a row. And so don't forget, the [ figure ] went up this year, right, in 2022, fuel prices went up, interest rates are going to be -- started obviously lower. And so these things will move again. I just don't think we've ever seen volatility like this, honestly. The amount of movement in some of these factors in the time frame that they've moved. That's what seems strange to us. \nTrevor Williams: Yes. Understood. And then just as a follow-up on corporate payments. Just thinking about the macro sensitivity there. If we go back to 2020, perfect storm of the stuff that worked against you. But I think some of the cyclical exposure there had been a bit of a surprise.\n Now today, you've got AFEX, Global Reach is going to close shortly. So you'll have more FX hedging and cross-border exposure than you did 2 years ago. I know you're saying high teens is a target for next year. But kind of with that pro forma revenue mix, any view just on how that segment should hold up in a recession kind of where you'd be most vulnerable, the pieces of revenue you think should be most durable? Any help there would be great. \nRonald F. Clarke: Another good question. I'd say it will hold up well. And the reason is COVID is -- was a bizarre macro thing, right, keeping people at home. And so it picked off hard companies, cruise ships companies that made a living working, so we had some punishing set of clients. The great news about the corporate payments business is the majority of the payments are locked.\n I think rents in IT services companies mostly can't get out of the AP that's in front of them, even if their own situation softens some. And then, b, you heard again today, there's inflation, which rolled into obviously, company spend. And so I'd say of all the businesses, that went ought to hold up well because the spend is pretty fixed and will likely go up. And then on the cross-border side, I think you hit it, FX volatility, a little bit like high fuel prices creates greater interest in FX management. \n And so  to the extent that different countries have differential plans on interest rates, which triggers FX volatility, that should be helpful to that business, which we're seeing now. So all in all, I'd say, we like the chances for the business next year. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Andrew Polkowitz with JPMorgan. \nAndrew Polkowitz: Just one, getting back to the M&A side. I know you mentioned that you feel increasingly good about your positioning of the company broadly and obviously, Global Reach further and the FX business, Roomex and Levarti on the lodging side. I was curious which areas are most interesting for you guys right now looking for incremental M&A next year? \nRonald F. Clarke: Andrew, it's Ron. That's a good question. I would say that we've done a lot of the positioning work literally last year and this year. If you look at the beyond strategies of building out what segments we can play in like our Corpay One business for SMB and corporate payments or the lodging thing being international or the front end of our mid-market corporate payments business with a process AP automation tools. So I think we really assembled like a lot of products and a lot of capability so that those TAMs are bigger, and that's the sales and revenue we can chase are bigger.\n I think we're kind of ready to pivot back to more of the wheelhouse scale base, let's buy stuff, we can run better sets of businesses. I'm not saying that we won't do more if there's probably some more stuff around EV that we're snipping that's still in that kind of capability thing. We want to be super good there, already there. But that would be the thing. Any 1 of the 2 or 3 main businesses, corporate pay and lodging for sure, where we could get wheelhouse deals that are larger and accretive would be the #1 preference. \nAndrew Polkowitz: Got it. That's helpful. And one quick follow-up. You actually just mentioned the EV. I was going to ask on -- you mentioned your -- all your methods of toll distribution before and reaching consumers. So I wanted to ask if you could draw some parallel to your consumer side ambitions in the EV space and what you could share with us there? I know it's early still. \nRonald F. Clarke: No, it's a good follow-up. It's one of the things, one of the models that we know well that caused us -- allowed us -- allowed me to pull the trigger on an EV business that it was consumer-centric. And what we realize there's no credit risk. It's really a network play, building a super duper EV network it's advantage it sounded a lot like the toll. So I think the biggest translation is partners could help.\n So if you think about the consumer business in Brazil, yes, there's a lot of direct capability, having hundreds of people stand at toll booths or in malls or kiosks and stuff. But the partner model that our Brazil guys have built, every Nissan car with a toll tag when you come in at 2 of the largest banks, reselling our stuff at a 40 million accounts that model of OEMs that make EV cars aren't going to be EV cars unless the existing or new EV manufacturers make them, and same with CPOs, there's not going to be any cars that people can't recharge them.\n And so those 2 partners, the light went on for us, \"Oh my gosh, we can build a consumer business kind of B2B2C by working through these partners and they're going to embrace us. So that's kind of the thinking and that's the feedback we've had from talking to those various groups. So it allows us to basically getting in our gun sites, a new extension for our company without doing some were Super Bowl ad, right, to try to get to consumers. So that's the thing that we like about it. \nAndrew Polkowitz: Got it. I know [indiscernible] Super Bowl ad. So I'll leave it there and congrats on the result. \nOperator: Our next question will come from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. \nJames Faucette: Thanks a lot for all the color and perspective. Just a couple of quick follow-up questions from me. You guys have been really active in buying back your own shares, obviously. But at the same time, you have started to pick up the acquisition activity as valuations have come down. How should we be thinking about like capital allocation priorities and where you're seeing opportunities? And should we -- that kind of offer continuation of the current mix? Or what are your expectations there right now? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, James, it's Ron. The answer is it depends, right? Our capital allocation priorities, I think, are unchanged. We start with deals because they position the company and most of the ones we do create accretion. So that's been obviously number one. But it depends really on our stock price. Obviously, the stock price were buyers with a better company to buy than people shop and be companies for higher multiples.\n And so if our price is at these levels, I think we're probably leading to buying more stock back mostly because of what I said that we've gotten so many of the positioning or extension, the strategic deals, if you will, kind of behind us. We kind of have the set of things we need to run the company. So at today's stock price, I'd say, we're probably more buyers of our stock than something else. At higher stock prices probably, the pendulum swings back a bit the other way. \nJames Faucette: I appreciate that. And then just a quick follow-up on kind of the fraud and debt issues. How much of that is just purely function of fuel prices. And as those come down, that self-resolves? Or are you seeing anything different in the current cycles than you have previously that could indicate it could be kind of an ongoing issue even if fuel prices do come down next year? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. That's a super good point. It's most of it, right? So higher fuel prices, right, create more total spend. So the loss event is higher, right, 100 gallons at $5 instead of 100 gallons of $3. And then second it attracts more fraud, right? You get targeted more by criminals, again, when the price is higher. \n So really, the question is, if that normalizes, those 2 things should improve. And then it really swings over to just the economic health, right, of clients and prospects for us. Do they remain healthy and able to repay and stuff? And so that's the open question, I think. We're not seeing a lot of that. If we look at our distributions, the higher quality accounts are repaying, the roll rate problems like always are in the more credit challenged group. So it should reset if fuel prices stay at this level or smidge down, both fraud and overall loss levels will decline. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as the conference.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ronald F. Clarke",
            "content": "Jim, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q3 2022 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects. First, I'll provide my take on Q3 results. Second, I'll provide updated full year 2022 guidance. Third, provide just a brief preview of 2023, along with some of the factors that will affect our performance.\n And then lastly, I'll catch you up on a few recent developments. Okay. Let me turn to our Q3 results, which were quite good and ahead of our expectations. We reported revenue of $893 million, that's up 18%,  and cash EPS of $4.24, that's up 21%. Our EBITDA for the quarter exceeded $450 million. Organic revenue growth, quite good, coming in at 13%. That was led by our corporate payments business at 21% and our lodging business at 28%.\n Trends in the quarter quite are good also. Same-store sales finished plus 2%, retention remaining steady at 92%. And overall sales performance, just terrific, up 24% for the quarter. We onboarded almost 60,000 new clients during Q3. So the fundamentals of the business remain very solid, obviously, selling a lot and retaining a lot.\n Look, additionally, I want to point out that we're continuing to strengthen the setup, the positioning of the company, which obviously improves our growth prospects going forward, added some important EV assets and further refined our plan to go on offense. We added some pretty important AP automation software to front end our corporate payments solution set that really rounds out for us that AP solution set. And we continue to expand our fuel footprint in Brazil, driving transaction growth there.\n I think we're expecting an exit rate of about $10 million annual add-on fueling transaction. So good progress. Okay. Let me shift gears and turn to our updated full year 2022 guidance along with the assumptions behind it. So we're revising full year 2022 revenue guidance up to $3.410 billion at the midpoint. This includes absorbing about $8 million of macro headwind in the second half versus our August guide. \n We're maintaining full year 2022 cash EPS guidance of $15.95 at the midpoint, same number we gave in August. This does include a bit of a flip-flop. We pulled some revenue forward through gift orders into Q3 that we had outlooked in Q4. We're also absorbing about $0.04 to $0.05 of dilution from the new Plugsurfing and Accrualify acquisitions. We're also incurring about $30 million of incremental bad debt and interest expense way above our August guide as the Fed has accelerated their interest rate increases.\n So if we achieve this $3.410 billion and $15.95 updated '22 guidance, that would represent 20% revenue growth and 21% earnings growth for the full year versus 2021. Okay. Importantly, next up, I'm going to share a brief preview of our early look into 2023. So like most companies, we're expecting the '23 setup to be quite challenging. We do run the business, plan the business on a macro neutral basis, really so that we can operate through any kind of cycle, good or bad. Then we do overlay our spending and capital allocation decisions based on the environment we're seeing.\n So for '23, we're expecting organic revenue growth overall of about 10% which is our target. That's based on our preliminary '23 budget submissions. Inside of that, probably no surprise, global fleet outlooking mid- to high single digits. Our lodging and Brazil businesses mid-teens and our corporate payment business for next year, high teens. And by the way, closing in on almost $1 billion of overall revenue next year, so getting quite significant.\n We'll bake in clearly less OpEx expense growth next year with a goal of delivering 200 to 300 basis points of margin improvement. We're hopeful we can reach a '23 cash EPS with a [ $17 ] handle but that's ultimately going to turn on; one, the level of sales investment we make and then the corresponding bad debt that comes with that. Two, interest rates where they peak and if and when they start down. Three, FX rates, a particular eye on the pound, does it recover? \n And then lastly, recession, do we get one. And if we do, what would the depth and duration be? So look, on the recession front, in particular, we wouldn't describe FLEETCOR's recession proof but pretty recession resilient. Some of the reasons that we should be pretty recession resilient are: first, our solutions are essential, generally not discretionary. Demand for our services runs higher in inflationary or cost conscious times, think fuel this year and the demand that we see.\n And lastly, our businesses are really diverse geographically, by client size from SMB to enterprise, lots of verticals we serve, obviously, lots of product or spending categories. We're by no means immune to some client segments, certain client segments being impacted by recession, for example, construction. And for sure, we'll reel in restrict credit in the event of a downturn and that, for sure, pressures revenue.\n So look, we plan to have a much clearer picture of 2023 when we speak again in 90 days, and we'll offer up our formal '23 guidance then? Okay. Let me transition to my last subject, which is to catch you up on a few recent developments. And let me begin with the FTC case. So the court held a 2-day hearing on the FTC matter that was on October 20 and 21. Importantly, the judge concluded that she would not enter the proposed FTC order and rather encouraged the parties to mediate to negotiate, so that we've agreed to engage with the FTC and see what we can work out. We do think that the face-to-face court hearing was really quite helpful.\n It gave us a chance to summarize the various disclosure and process enhancements that we have voluntarily made really over the last 4 or 5 years, all of them aimed at enhancing our customer experience. So some of the enhancements we called out were eliminating certain digital add claims and the language around that. We ceased selling add-on features via negative option and instead packaged up various features in the 3 packages and sell those affirmatively upfront.\n We designed and implemented much bigger, bolder Ts and Cs, including a [indiscernible] like fee box that's front and center. And lastly, we collected express or what we call affirmative consent from 96% of our fuel card client base to the specific terms of their card program. We've also proposed some new incremental enhancements going forward. That would include crediting client payments on the day we receive them versus the day they're posted along with some other items that comply with the CFPB consumer payment standards. Obviously, we're B2B, but are willing to do this.\n We've talked about combining our invoicing and reporting materials into a single consolidated package to make it easier for clients to review. And we said repeatedly, I think, throughout this FTC case that we're trying to cooperate trying to be transparent. We simply emphasize to the court that we need to know exactly what the practices are that we're being asked to implement. And if we can understand them, we'll implement, we'll comply with them.\n We're also saying again today that we don't believe that the disclosure enhancements that we've already made which we can see nor the additional ones that we're contemplating will have a material impact on the company's go-forward financial performance.\n Okay. Let me turn to our situation in Russia. We've made the decision to explore selling the Russia business. We've retained a local investment bank. We have formally launched the sales process, it is underway. The business does generate meaningful free cash flow. So that can potentially support acquisition financing, along with annual dividends. And we think that, that should provide a reasonable floor on the valuation.\n Additionally, we completed all of the isolation or separation steps necessary to carve the business away from FLEETCOR. This provides assurance that we can maintain compliance with the sanctions. And we do plan to move into this isolation or passive ownership phase beginning in early December. And obviously, we will keep you updated on the sale process.\n So lastly, on the acquisition and capital allocation front, we did complete 3 capability acquisitions since we spoke last. So corporate payments add-on called Accrualify on August 1; an important EV deal in Europe, Plugsurfing on September 1, and we closed literally yesterday an international workforce lodging deal called Roomex. And finally, we expect to complete the cross-border deal called Global Reach, which is a bolt-on around the end of the year. So as you can see, we focused really on capability acquisitions in this environment, choosing to strengthen, again, the positioning and setup of the company over the midterm.\n We do hope that M&A valuations reset a bit next year, higher interest rates will obviously take hold. And just maybe we can get back to larger accretive transactions. Additionally, we did repurchase $500 million of FLT in Q3 at what we think are quite attractive prices. So look, in closing today, again, very good Q3 results. Earnings grew 21%, maintaining our full year '22 cash EPS guidance at $15.95 despite a bit weakening macro that we're absorbing. This would represent a $0.70 higher number than the initial EPS guidance that we provided in February.\n We do expect '23 to be a challenging year, but see our overall organic growth rate in and around 10% our target. And again, our earnings turning mostly on the interest rate and FX environment. The FTC case, finally winding down. Again, we do not expect a material impact going forward. We have decided to explore the sale of our Russia business, again, underway and delighted with these handful of capability acquisitions this quarter.\n Lastly, many thanks to Alissa here for stepping in to the CFO role on an interim basis. So now over to you, Alissa. Darrin, thanks. So on the first one, I think we're still kind of in the 5% to 8% kind of target range based on what we elect to invest. Some of the overperformance recently is literally the COVID recovery kind of [ climb ] back from the [ debts ] there in 2020. So I think we're probably mostly unchanged because we've got a lot of the businesses to feed and investments to make that we're kind of happy in that mid- to high single digits. So that's our target.\n On the add-ons, I'd still say still early days. We're still struggling with where in the base, right? We've got a couple of hundred thousand clients we should target. So I think I mentioned initially we were thinking, hey, we'll go to where the bulk is down market and then realize most of the spend is in the larger accounts there, which we get after different distribution.\n So I'd say we're still testing some different ways to do that but have the goal of the company to turn the fuel card business, as I said, into our corporate payments business. So work in process. Yes. So on the first one, I'd say, we're kind of halfway through, Darrin, the '23 budget cycle. So we've worked on revenue, obviously, harder than the expense and the profit side. So as I said, it's a mix of the different business lines, fuel, lodging, Brazil and corporate payments have different growth rates to kind of weight themselves to 10%. That is an organic number, although the print at this point looks pretty similar because we have some pro forma revenue kind of rolling forward, right, from '22 to '23 offset by what we think could be some macro headwinds, particularly FX.\n So at this point, year-to-date, not a big difference between organic and print. And then on the bottom, again, I think the thing we can control is really the operating margin. So we're doing a lot of work on metering the OpEx so that we can grow kind of EBITDA margins, 200 or 300 bps next year. So call it, I don't know, we're coming on, I think, around 52-ish this year that we try to get that up a couple of points.\n And then the wild card is really the below the line after today's Fed call, I'm not sure how encouraged or not any of us should be. But wherever that number flies to and then descends and then obviously, the FX, particularly the pound. So that's really the wait and see. So we're just trying to give a rough super early days view, obviously, hopefully, all us will know a bunch more in 90 days. Yes. Ramsey, it's Ron. So yes, both good questions. So on the first one, it obviously depends on the FX, the kind of ballpark gets $100 million-ish, little bit more in revenue at kind of a 75% EBITDA margin, again, kind of where the FX is today. And yes, we haven't done anything in terms of taking it out although, of course, we've looked at models where we sell it for X and we use that cash to buy back, which really manages obviously the dilution as we look into next year. So we'll certainly keep you guys apprised. We're kind of live out shopping the thing now. So we'll keep you posted. Yes. On the first one, we're clearly on some kind of glide path, right, the things in the sense so a guess would be a couple of months -- 2, 3 months, depending on how the [ chitchat ] goes and when the court gets back involved if they do. So that would be my guess.\n On the impact, yes, there's nothing either in their order, which the judge said no to or really anything we're contemplating because it's disclosure based, again, Ramsey, right? It's not, hey, we can't charge something or we can't sign up a customer or whatever. And so the good news is, we've done a bunch of things and had a chance to see. And obviously, we're reporting those changes are embedded right in the results we're putting out.\n So again, there's nothing we can see that would have any material go-forward impact. So probably like you and others on the call, we mostly just want to get on the other side. We've repeatedly said just be specific, tell us what it is that makes everyone happy and we're happy to do it. And so we've done a lot of that. \n And again, it's had little to no impact. I mean when you can sign up 96% of a couple of hundred thousand customers to say they want to continue affirmatively with your program, and you've given them the biggest Ts and Cs in boxes that you have, it makes me feel pretty confident that we've been straight ahead with people. Yes, Sanjay. I think to your point, there has been some -- a bit of a reset in the last few months. And you could see by what we've announced in this quarter that -- when we started the process, we focused on these capability things because no matter what the price is they're about capabilities, and they're not large amounts of absolute money. We do have a couple of, what I'll call, more traditional kind of FLEETCOR in the wheelhouse deals that seem to be in ranges that we like that we can transact at. \n And then second, I think, let's see how the thing plays out. As you know, people move their valuation aspirations with time. And so to the extent that people wait and stuff doesn't trade, we think there could be even a further reset next year because right some people are getting squeezed these days. So we're optimistic that things will get better, and we can go back to targeting some larger deals. Yes. Sanjay, it's Ron. Why don't I take the first one and then let Alissa take the second one. So no, I'd say the fuel kind of volume and transactions, I think we reported, I think, 4% volume growth, transaction growth for the quarter. I would say it's pocketed. There's a couple of spots like SMB Trucking that are a bit softer than normal, although most of that's offset by enterprise, the big trucking firms.\n I think the biggest thing, Sanjay, is in some of the research we deal with kind of local SMB accounts is the higher price had a smidge of elasticity, kind of moved them back a little bit like, hey, we'll shrink the radius of where we do a plumbing call. We won't go 30 miles out of the city now, we'll only go 10 miles and stuff. And so I do think when the prices were at those peaks, whatever, 3, 4, 5 months ago, that, that also dialed it back a bit.\n But I'd say we're in the smidgy level. It's really nothing significant and it's really nothing across the board. Do you want to take on interest? Yes, that's the net number, too, Sanjay, right? There's kind of gross interest expense, and then we've got a bunch of cash at high rates. So to Alissa's point, the gross numbers significantly larger, probably comes down 20% or 25% with the cash that we have offsetting it. But look, it is a total swag route. We're sitting here like you guys trying to guess what the next 14 months are going to be. And we don't know. So we just said, hey, we'll take what we're hearing. We'll kind of run the math that way, and will be a lot higher when we talk again. Yes. That's a really good question, Andrew. So I'd say that the target that we like to see in the company is 55%. Again, I think we'll pencil around 52% this year. But that thing moves around based on things we buy, right, that run lower margins or weirdo stuff like COVID that crushes revenue quickly and stuff. But I'd say our running internal targets closer to 55%. \n In terms of next year, I think the 2 things you picked up. One is, we knew this was going to be a half a year. I mean, we're going to, I think, be about $0.70 higher than we told in February. I don't know if anyone's applauding, but I consider that good news to do better than we said. And so because we saw that, we kind of opened the spicket. We let people work to your point on some additional projects. We tested some additional things. We staffed up in areas we spend, I'd say, money that we could afford to kind of make the targets that we run the company on.\n So when I see the world tightening, the answer is, we'll be a little bit more approval, a little bit more selective to use your word. And I think the big thing is really around our view of the economy and the credit environment, particularly around the digital side, like you said, because that's where the sales growth, if you will, versus the credit risk are supercorrelated. \n So my guess is we'll kind of enter the thing a bit cautious, kind of cut a little bit of the tail at the bottom. I would initially maybe not try to grow that thing in the low to mid-20%, but maybe 3 to 5 points lower and see how it goes. So it would be just a little bit of a guide on kind of overall OpEx and a little bit of caution around the micro selling and related credit risk. I think it's high teens to 20%. To your point, we have some favorable comps. We've got a segment in there for airlines, which are obviously in the ditch. So some of it is that. But we're just -- all parts of that business are kind of going great. We're selling a lot in all 3 of them. We bought a new software front end for that airline business and airlines are looking to get added in-house work and stuff.\n So we have the best network, the best rates to offer the different clients that we have. And so between the scale and the selling machine that we have there and the product, they're pretty specialized offering. So there's not lots of other players that can offer really what we do both the convenience and the pricing. So I'd say it's in the high teens to 20% on a normalized basis. Yes. I think I kind of covered, Sheriq, this comment a bit before, but I'd say it's still a work in process. I think it's my summary that we went headlong into the thing targeting the smaller clients that we have because we have so many of them. And as we get into the thing, we got clear that corporate payments turns on spend, not on client count and that about 5,000 of our clients have about half of all the spend, all the purchasing.\n So we've gone back and targeted those. We have some of our blue-suited salespeople going into our biggest dual card accounts now and selling corporate payments, but we're still trying to figure out, is there a scene, is there a different place inside of our fuel card client base where we can bring corporate payments offerings. So I think a lot of this is like anything that's new. We're learning. We're trying to figure out what the sweet spot is among the super big base and what the product is that fits that sweet spot. So we haven't given up, still work in process. Yes, Pete, it's good to hear from me. So that one, I think, for Sheriq's question a minute ago was one that's working, I think we're at about 20% now of the revenue there and what we call Beyond Toll, parking, fuel. We've also gotten some super early traction on insurance right, where this vehicle mobility company with millions of customers and so offering insurance that centers around the vehicle and stuff has been a pretty good uptake.\n And so it's going well. The fuel number, which I said is exiting, we think around [ $10 million ] annualized exactly as we thought is kind of correlated to the number of sites. So as we add additional sites that basically can read the tag conveniently low and the old [ transgrow ] because more people use the thing. So we built a plan to continue that, take it up by another 25% or 30% next year.\n So look, the goal would be kind of over the next 2 or 3 years that, that stuff is in the 40% kind of range on top of the core business. And we continue to add -- I mean if there was -- it reminds me of coke here in the U.S. if there was another way to sell a toll tag in Brazil, we know it's like we sell it. In stores, we sell with hangs, things in stores. We sell it at toll booths. We sell it through car makers. We sell it through insurance guys. We sell literally every way that you can get a toll tag to market, we're doing -- selling way over 1 million new ones per year. And so it's a business that despite the competitive set up changing a lot is still performing great for us. Super happy with it. Yes. No, that's a really good question. They're super related to your point, if you think about, particularly on the digital side, just raw demand, Google counting how many people key in fuel card. You hit it on the head back in the spring or early summer at the peak, that thing was up a lot, right, that inbound demand. But remember, we still sell, I don't know, 40%, 45% of the business nondigitally and some amount -- a decent amount of our digital is us targeting accounts.\n So I'd say it's down some from the peak although the peak reside than we've seen before at an [ edgy path ]. The only thing I'd said back is even at today's current price over the last, call it, whatever, 5 or 7 years, this is still at a super high level. So I'd say, yes, down a bit from the peak, but still -- is still pretty robust. Jeff, this is Ron. Let me just jump on what Alissa said, obviously, mix continues to help us right. We've overrotated to SMB. So we get sequential rate happy just from the mix because we get more rate on smaller accounts than big.\n But on the macro question, I'd say, who knows. I'd say it seems you guys are sitting on the planet with me, it's crazy kind of volatile, not only the things for us like fuel prices, but clearly, FX volatility is super high this year. I don't even want to mention interest rate volatility.\n And so the question is, in 90 days when we get to kind of locking down, finalizing our plan, will the forward view be any clearer, will there be messaging that, that thing is going to stabilize some. And so that's my answer to you to the extent that the big macro things seem like the volatility is slowing, we'll probably use kind of some traditional range. And to the extent that those macro things have a bigger bait around them, then yes, we probably would have something wider to let you know how those things affect us.\n But I said a million times, like we run the company here forever. And we're going to run the company to generate growing revenue and growing certainly EBITDA profits faster and the below the line stuff will come and go. No one's clapping that I can hear that the macro is at our back, and we have $0.70 more, $100 million -- $150 million more in revenue. No one's clapping, understand the other way. So we just -- our game is we just power through it. \n And look, it can't go up forever. If interest rates go up, the cost goes up to $300 million -- and actually it was going to $500 million in '24, maybe they're going to add a $250 million. And so as long as we can keep compounding the top and the EBITDA line, [ 10 and 13 ] we're going to deliver mid- to high teens EPS over the forecast period. So I'd say we just don't see any of these variables continuing to rise sequentially year-over-year. It's payments, Mihir, again. This number, I mean it's a rounding error in the business... That's a good question. Thanks for that. So the Roomex business, first of all, is really a copycat of our U.S., what we call workforce. If you think about a lot of the blue collar people to travel for work. That's kind of what that Roomex thing is. So we were delighted to identify someone that does kind of the same thing.\n So it's really a U.K. business today. It's got a little bit, I can't remember, 5% maybe of its business in Germany. So the majority of it is in the U.K., which is our second largest market, which was interesting to us. And so yes, the idea there is, hey, they've got assets that sit in the U.K., they've got a lodging network that's attractive. They have sales, they have ops, they have tech that runs there.\n And we have a ton of clients, as you can imagine, like tons of clients and actually a fair number of kind of midsized  and enterprise clients there. So the idea is, hey, we know this business super well. It's in a market that we've got a good position so we can accelerate it and it's a good business on its own. It's got a good group of people. \n So it's really just like our fuel card business or other businesses. We're a global player. We have a business that looks exactly like a business we have, and it's in another country that we can understand then we go there. We liked the price back to someone's question earlier about M&A valuations, I think was a reasonable price for both sides, which is why the trade works. So yes, it will certainly accelerate and it kind of sets us up to make a business with bigger TAM that we can understand. Yes. Bob, it's good to hear your voice and that you're up and at 'em here, so good to hear from you. We don't really plan the margin expansion really by lines of business. The discretionary monies that are big in our company are sales and IT. And so that's how we think about it. For us to boost EBITDA margins 200 basis points will just kind of flatten out a little bit, not grow as fast some of the sales investment and IT.\n And people may say, \"Oh, how is that going to work? Well, when you make a pretty big investment incrementally like we did this year, you pick up the productivity really in the forward years, right, because you've hired new people or you've got new leads in the pipeline. And so some of the investments -- incremental investments we made in '22 will kind of roll in, we'll pour into '23. So we've got a decent game plan of OpEx that will service the business we have and meet the growth targets. And again, because we spent a bit more this year, that's kind of helpful to us for next year. Yes, Matt, like you, I know it's your favorite. I mean, it's hard not to like what we call our corporate payments business just because of the enormity. The market we -- if you guys -- you may get a kick out of the story, but I moved a guy that ran -- who still runs our international fleet business to run our old business.\n So he's here, and I'm talking to them the other night, so we get on the corporate payments, cheese he says, I never understood like what a mess the U.S. is, all this paper and trying to pay from. And so like I think as we live here, we don't even think about it, that it's just the opportunity there to make that just a gigantic business. It's -- in our prelims it's closing in on $1 billion next year, and we spent -- no one knows this better than you a couple of years getting all the puzzle pieces together so that we've got kind of a full suite of stuff.\n And so I just think that the potential is so big and the competition, even though you and others keep talking about -- [ friggin ] fintechs, I tell you the whole market is banks and Amex, and we're winning. That's where 90% of our business comes from. And so we -- we just like the chances to bring what we have at great sales again in Q3, record sales. And so that's the business that will be dramatically bigger in the next few years. Ken, it's Ron. Yes, on the first one. We haven't sold a business, so it's still part of our planning, although again, the idea that we have would be to take the cash from the sale and obviously, the retained earnings that we have sitting there. And if our stock stays at this price, so obviously buy a lot of it, which will compress the dilution.\n In terms of the proceeds, it's how we're going to set it up with a buyer. The buyer is going to have to basically be able to pay us outside of there. So it's one of the kind of the conditions of the buyers that we're looking at. So we do have a way basically depending on who the buyer is for them to be able to pay us. That's another super good question. So kind of a 2-part question. The first one is really scale, right, trying to make that business in some of the pieces dramatically bigger. So like all of our businesses, it's got a lot of fixed cost, call it, 40% to 50% of the cost structure of that business is fixed. So clearly, the incremental margins are better.\n And then it's really just the trade for growth, like we -- it's not a hard math for you guys, if you want to grow something at 20% versus 10% or 8%, you have to spend more money, right, to grow it faster. And so that's really the second part of it is, given the TAM, given the size of the opportunity, we'll probably continue to overinvest and run, that EBITDA margin is a bit lower than the line average. But again, it's because we're setting it up to grow faster.\n It's not a reason -- just there's nothing structurally. In other words, if you said to me, that thing gets to $1.5 billion or $2 billion, and I want to take the growth rate down on the line average, there's nothing structurally that would stop us from having that business look an awful lot like the rest of our line average businesses. Yes. Good question, John. Yes, is the short answer. So I think we hope we reported this, but I think we have to, call it, [ 25, 25, 35, 35 ] is kind of a guesstimate at the full year credit loss number. And so when we saw the thing the forwards, the roll rates get a bit worse, we did tighten the new account selling. So we have 2 kinds of credit; one is, hey, who are we going to take in. We used to take in 10 people, 10 companies, now we're going to take in 8, so we're going to cut the tail off. \n And then the second one is really credit lines, right for customers that we have, right? If we're willing to give you more credit to buy more things, we can get more revenue. So that's the one that we're looking at pulling back selectively kind of in certain areas. So we've done it on new. We haven't done it yet on existing and partly because we have much better information, right? The underwriting is much better on our existing customers because we have all that payment history on them.\n So that's a key thing for us to watch is really the trade. Remember, probably about half of all of our credit losses, whatever 25, 25, 35, 35 as up to whatever, $120 million, $130 million, half of that, John, is basically tied to new business. right, which is a way high number versus the base. So that's the place that we always start. Yes. Again, I want to make sure people clear. It's super early days. We're doing what we call the envelope work of framing what an envelope is. So we're far from done. But I think the biggest difference to what you said is that the sales investment and the nature of the sales investment has a huge impact on the bad debt on a forward basis. So the easiest way for us to improve profitability in 2023 would slow or cut the tail, certainly in the digital micro accounts and keep all that bad debt out of our P&L.\n So that's the most logical place. But yes, it's not far off what you're saying that the exit rate of our OpEx will obviously grow probably low single digits. And then what you said, it depends obviously were fuel prices. But remember, that also ties, it's correlated to bad debt. right? So one of the reasons our bad debt is higher again is our fuel price was higher here in 2022.\n If the fuel price is lower, by definition, the bad debt will be lower. So look, lots of these variables move together. And my messaging is just to tell everybody that we're going to run the business kind of macro constant and then open our eyes to what the macro is and make OpEx and capital allocation pivots based on what we see. And what we're seeing now is we're probably going to slow the OpEx. Yes. I'll jump on that in to listen. I think you named kind of most of them. I'm sure it's -- whatever you're saying, kind of plus or minus $10 million on whatever, $900 million. So it's not a material kind of number. But those are it. It's kind of a flip flopping this year versus last. Back last year, there was some huge late gift orders because retailers are out of stock from being careful.\n And so that number was a pretty big whopper number, if I remember, in Q4 last year. And this year, they said, \"hey, we getting ready sooner\" and so put tons of orders in earlier. And then what you said, we're running at, I don't know, $4.30-or-something fuel price, which has ticked down, obviously, from Q2 to Q3 and then into Q4, which takes them off the talk. But then again, it helps expenses.\n As I said earlier, both borrowings and bad debt. So the biggest thing is just the normal seasonality. What you said if we look at the last, whatever years you cleaned up, pro forma acquisitions or stuff, 2 or 3 of our business is soft in a fair amount, which is less workdays in the fourth quarter, both here and abroad. And so it's just -- it's really just that, that Q4 and Q1 are just less workdays or softer. And Q2 and Q3 are higher. And so there's not -- there's really nothing like super-duper going on, like as we model the thing to embed the guidance here, I would say there's nothing else that sticks out. I mean just for you guys, like I don't how you see this, but hey, we're kind of saying put in the second half, the revenue for second half is a bit higher than we said 90 days ago, and I guess the profits are the same. I said before, our macro was off by $8 million, the runway interest expenses, whatever, $20 million higher. So underneath the hood, we've been able to do some things to make the thing work.\n So the trend and the performance, again, separate from the macro, my message would be a pretty good kind of as good or better than we thought 90 days ago. So we're not seeing any kind of blinking red lights yet. And like all the questions on this call, the profitability a lot will turn on where those macro things land in glidepath next year.\n But I just do want to remind people that like to own stock for more than a week that what comes up, does come down and things don't keep going up for multiple years in a row. And so don't forget, the [ figure ] went up this year, right, in 2022, fuel prices went up, interest rates are going to be -- started obviously lower. And so these things will move again. I just don't think we've ever seen volatility like this, honestly. The amount of movement in some of these factors in the time frame that they've moved. That's what seems strange to us. Another good question. I'd say it will hold up well. And the reason is COVID is -- was a bizarre macro thing, right, keeping people at home. And so it picked off hard companies, cruise ships companies that made a living working, so we had some punishing set of clients. The great news about the corporate payments business is the majority of the payments are locked.\n I think rents in IT services companies mostly can't get out of the AP that's in front of them, even if their own situation softens some. And then, b, you heard again today, there's inflation, which rolled into obviously, company spend. And so I'd say of all the businesses, that went ought to hold up well because the spend is pretty fixed and will likely go up. And then on the cross-border side, I think you hit it, FX volatility, a little bit like high fuel prices creates greater interest in FX management. \n And so  to the extent that different countries have differential plans on interest rates, which triggers FX volatility, that should be helpful to that business, which we're seeing now. So all in all, I'd say, we like the chances for the business next year. Andrew, it's Ron. That's a good question. I would say that we've done a lot of the positioning work literally last year and this year. If you look at the beyond strategies of building out what segments we can play in like our Corpay One business for SMB and corporate payments or the lodging thing being international or the front end of our mid-market corporate payments business with a process AP automation tools. So I think we really assembled like a lot of products and a lot of capability so that those TAMs are bigger, and that's the sales and revenue we can chase are bigger.\n I think we're kind of ready to pivot back to more of the wheelhouse scale base, let's buy stuff, we can run better sets of businesses. I'm not saying that we won't do more if there's probably some more stuff around EV that we're snipping that's still in that kind of capability thing. We want to be super good there, already there. But that would be the thing. Any 1 of the 2 or 3 main businesses, corporate pay and lodging for sure, where we could get wheelhouse deals that are larger and accretive would be the #1 preference. No, it's a good follow-up. It's one of the things, one of the models that we know well that caused us -- allowed us -- allowed me to pull the trigger on an EV business that it was consumer-centric. And what we realize there's no credit risk. It's really a network play, building a super duper EV network it's advantage it sounded a lot like the toll. So I think the biggest translation is partners could help.\n So if you think about the consumer business in Brazil, yes, there's a lot of direct capability, having hundreds of people stand at toll booths or in malls or kiosks and stuff. But the partner model that our Brazil guys have built, every Nissan car with a toll tag when you come in at 2 of the largest banks, reselling our stuff at a 40 million accounts that model of OEMs that make EV cars aren't going to be EV cars unless the existing or new EV manufacturers make them, and same with CPOs, there's not going to be any cars that people can't recharge them.\n And so those 2 partners, the light went on for us, \"Oh my gosh, we can build a consumer business kind of B2B2C by working through these partners and they're going to embrace us. So that's kind of the thinking and that's the feedback we've had from talking to those various groups. So it allows us to basically getting in our gun sites, a new extension for our company without doing some were Super Bowl ad, right, to try to get to consumers. So that's the thing that we like about it. Yes, James, it's Ron. The answer is it depends, right? Our capital allocation priorities, I think, are unchanged. We start with deals because they position the company and most of the ones we do create accretion. So that's been obviously number one. But it depends really on our stock price. Obviously, the stock price were buyers with a better company to buy than people shop and be companies for higher multiples.\n And so if our price is at these levels, I think we're probably leading to buying more stock back mostly because of what I said that we've gotten so many of the positioning or extension, the strategic deals, if you will, kind of behind us. We kind of have the set of things we need to run the company. So at today's stock price, I'd say, we're probably more buyers of our stock than something else. At higher stock prices probably, the pendulum swings back a bit the other way. Yes. That's a super good point. It's most of it, right? So higher fuel prices, right, create more total spend. So the loss event is higher, right, 100 gallons at $5 instead of 100 gallons of $3. And then second it attracts more fraud, right? You get targeted more by criminals, again, when the price is higher. \n So really, the question is, if that normalizes, those 2 things should improve. And then it really swings over to just the economic health, right, of clients and prospects for us. Do they remain healthy and able to repay and stuff? And so that's the open question, I think. We're not seeing a lot of that. If we look at our distributions, the higher quality accounts are repaying, the roll rate problems like always are in the more credit challenged group. So it should reset if fuel prices stay at this level or smidge down, both fraud and overall loss levels will decline."

            "name": "Alissa Vickery",
            "content": "Thanks, Ron. I'm happy to be here on my first earnings call as CFO, albeit on an interim basis. I look forward to meeting many of you on the conference circuit in the fourth quarter. But now let's look at some more detail on the quarter. As Ron mentioned, we posted 18% growth in revenue, driven by 13% organic growth or $96 million, which I'll delve into in a moment.\n The remaining growth was 4% or $27 million from macro tailwinds and 2% or $14 million from acquisitions made over the past year. Impacting our results were fuel prices of $4.46 per gallon for the quarter, higher than prior year of $3.15 which contributed $26 million of additional revenues versus prior year and lower than our $4.64 guidance assumption from August. Fuel spread revenue was also quite positive by about $21 million compared to the prior year as falling fuel prices during the quarter caused spreads to widen. Offsetting these tailwinds was a $21 million negative impact of lower foreign exchange rates primarily resulting from unfavorable movement in the British pound. \n Now moving to organic growth. Corporate payments was up 21%, driven by continuing strong new sales across both direct and cross-border. Specifically, our direct corporate payments business, or nonpartner business grew 24% and continues to demonstrate very robust growth, especially for AP, which grew 44%. Cross-border was up 30%, another very good quarter as new sales remained strong and activity levels were again robust across nearly all geographies.\n Our channel partner business is just under 10% of the corporate payments category and declined 13% in the quarter as our focus is on growing our direct businesses. Fuel grew organically 5% as we did see some volume softness in our U.S. SMB businesses. However, our new sales growth was 13%, and we continue to see a normalized level of flat, same-store sales contributing to the performance. Overall transaction volumes remain positive and consistent with last quarter, although we continue to see slight moderation in new sales activity.\n Tolls was up 12% organically compared with last year as the business continues to perform. New sales are solid, driven by our expanded product utility and differentiated value proposition. As a reminder, our toll solution can be used to pay for multiple spend categories, such as parking and drive through retail, and we are now generating meaningful revenue from our Beyond Toll use cases.\n Lodging continued to show strength in Q3, up 28%. All 3 business lines: Workforce, Airlines and Insurance each had double-digit organic growth. With Airlines, again, leading the way at 55%. Growth was driven by a combination of higher year-over-year volume in Workforce and Airlines and a favorable rate environment across all 3 businesses. Gift had another good quarter, up 9% as customer card orders continue to be pulled forward from Q4.\n We estimate that approximately $6 million of revenue was pulled into Q3 due to early ordering in advance of the holiday season. In addition to the $10 million to $12 million we estimated was pulled forward into the second quarter. Looking further down the income statement, operating expenses of $504 million represented a 21% increase over $417 million in Q3 of the prior year due to increases tied to higher volumes across our businesses, incremental bad debt, stock compensation and new sales generation activities.\n Increases were also driven by the inclusion of the ALE and Plugsurfing acquisitions in addition to higher incentives and commissions as a result of strong new sales in certain of our businesses. Bad debt expense was $37 million or 8 basis points which was about $10 million higher than last quarter and more in line with prepandemic bad debt levels. In the third quarter of 2021, bad debt was $11 million or  3 basis points. This increase was driven primarily by higher loss severity as a result of higher fuel prices in the second quarter as well as increases in application volume and application fraud.\n Bad debt levels remain elevated as a result of strong sales to new customers who tend to have a higher loss rate than the existing book, higher fuel prices and the changing macroeconomic landscape, which puts pressure on our smaller customers. Interest expense increased 56% year-over-year, driven by higher rates on our floating rate debt with average LIBOR or SOFR in the current quarter of 2.2% compared to 0.09% in the same period prior year.\n As Ron noted, we'll provide guidance for 2023 in February when we report our full year earnings. I did want to make one comment on how to think about net interest expense all in for 2023. We currently estimate that our 2023 net interest expense is likely to be closer to double the 2022 level. This assumes that benchmark index rates peak next year between 4.5% and 5% and remain in that range for most of the year.\n While all of our debt instruments are floating rate, we do have $500 million of hedges that will be in place for almost all of 2023 at 2.56%. Also, we have over $1 billion in cash balances globally on which we earn interest. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.8% versus 24.1% last year, which is more of a normalized tax rate for the business.\n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with over $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash and approximately $600 million available on our revolver. There was $5.7 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, and we had $1.5 billion borrowed in our securitization facility. As of September 30, our leverage ratio was 2.95x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. \n In the quarter, we upsized and extended our securitization facility by $100 million to $1.7 billion and extended the maturity by 1 year to August 2025. There were a number of minor changes to the agreement, which will be detailed in our 10-Q next week. We repurchased roughly 2.2 million shares at an average price of [ $2.24 ] per share for a total of $500 million during Q3. This includes the roughly 900,000 shares repurchased before our earnings call in August. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 5.6 million shares for $1.3 billion. The Board approved another $1 billion in repurchases under our program on October 25 and extended the program through February 2024.\n With this upsizing, we now have approximately $1.355 billion  available for future repurchases. As Ron has covered our full year guidance update, let me now share some thoughts on our guidance assumptions. We are assuming fuel prices of $4.25 in Q4. Market spreads favorable to the fourth quarter of 2021, total interest expense of $157 million to $167 million for 2022, which assumes average reference rates of 3.75% in Q4. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement. Thank you for your interest. And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. And I'll just add. This is Alissa. The specifics around Russia have been included in our 10-Q disclosures previously as well in terms of sizing. So Sanjay, it's Alissa. So on the interest side, I think you're asking about going into '23. So everybody in the world seems to know that Fed Funds target rates have just skyrocketed. We'll close out the year somewhere around 3.75%. As a reminder, we all started around 0. And then going into 2023, targeting somewhere around 4.5% to 5% for the year. And so we're really out looking at interest expense probably around $300 million plus. So maybe I would take our number and multiply it by 2 and you're probably in the ballpark. All right. Jeff, it's Alissa. So in terms of fuel price assumptions going into next year, we basically left next year consistent with the current period. So we've assumed fuel prices in the range of $4.37 or so with a little bit of downside on the spreads. In terms of your question on rev per trans, I think our intent is generally to always have a nice balance between volume and rate to the extent that there's incremental products being offered. And so now I would say that we would continue to expect that to be a balanced approach. Mihir, it's Alissa. So, yes, it would include any benefit that we're getting off of the deposits that are in Russia certainly on the income side. We don't really have any expense -- interest expense in that region. So it's really... We do see rates going down in Russia. So hopefully, it's not too big for a loss. It's Alissa. I'll just add on to that a little bit. We talked about it earlier in the call that interest expense really is significantly worse than where -- I think we all projected even from the Fed's perspective back in July when we were getting our previous guidance. And so that is a big headwind going into the fourth quarter."

[Operator Instructions]\n At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Paul Seamon, Vice President, Financial and Strategy for some introductory comments. Please go ahead. \nPaul Seamon: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Paymentus' Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Dushyant Sharma, our Founder and CEO; and Matt Parson, our CFO. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take questions.\n Our press release was issued after the close of market today and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast. The webcast replay of this call and the supplemental slides accompanying this presentation will be available on our company's website under the Investor Relations link at ir.paymentus.com.\n Statements made on this webcast include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements use words such as will, believe, expect, anticipate and similar phrases that denote future expectation or intent regarding our financial results and guidance. The impact of continued economic uncertainty and inflation, our market opportunities, business strategy, implementation timing, product enhancements, impacts from acquisitions and other matters. These forward-looking statements speak as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them.\n These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements, including the risks and uncertainties set forth under the captions, special note regarding forward-looking statements, and risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which we filed with the SEC on March 3rd, 2022. Our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, which we expect to file with the SEC in early August 2022 and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. We encourage you to review these detailed safe harbor and risk factor disclosures.\n In addition, during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, specifically contribution profit, adjusted gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful in measuring our performance and liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results.\n We encourage you to review additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release issued today and the supplemental slides for this webcast, each available on the Investor Relations page of our website and in our filings with the SEC.\n With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dushyant Sharma, our Founder and CEO. \nDushyant Sharma: Thanks, Paul. We believe the business performed well in the second quarter, with momentum in both sales and revenues. The revenue increased $26.5 million or 28.3% to $120 million. Contribution profit in the quarter grew 30.2% to $48.7 million, driven by a 39.4% increase in transactions. Our sales engine continue to be strong with signings of more than 60 deals again this quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to over 125. This number of signings is more than 50% higher versus the same period last year.\n Notwithstanding the challenging economic environment, including inflationary pressures and the session, these results illustrate why we believe our business is resilient. In spite of the current headwinds, we are seeing around client-based implementation delays and inflation, which we will talk more about later in these prepared remarks. We remain excited about our fundamental business operations and long-term prospects.\n We continue to drive implementations forward and had a number of client implementation success stories in the quarter. One example is the implementation of one of the largest utilities in the country. This client serves a very large footprint across the country and selected us to handle the complexity of the nationwide implementation. We also completed the migration of a large municipality with JPMorgan support. A third client we implemented in the quarter was a top 20 credit union with over $10 billion in assets.\n As we continue to move up market, this is our third financial services client with over $10 billion in assets launched on our banking IPN platform. As you know, the pricing model for banking bill payments is not affected by interchange. Also in the quarter, we received the Pacesetter Awards for 2022 from a large enterprise software company utilities user group, recognizing Paymentus for its leadership in billing and payment innovation. We are proud of this award and believe it exemplifies the strength of our billing and payments product and innovation.\n We also completed integration with one of the leading providers of electronic health care records in the quarter along with adding advanced payment functionality for the health care vertical to our product. Although we believe we had a solid financial performance this quarter, the difficult economic climate is not without impact on us. Implementation and onboarding is one of the primary areas we are seeing impacted by these difficult economic times.\n A few of our larger deployments, which were originally slated to go live in Q2 and the back half of 2022 have been stressed out due to lack of client IT resource availability. Due primarily to these client-based slowdowns, we are changing our full year 2022 guidance. However, I'd like to make it clear that in better economic climate with normal implementation time lines, it specifically relate to these clients, I believe we would be meeting or beating existing guidance for 2022.\n If you take a long-term view of the business as we do, these delays are not particularly significant, especially considering that the anticipated financial benefits from these clients are merely delayed to future quarters, not lost. Matt will cover the details as he discusses our financial results and revised guidance. Matt? \nMatt Parson: Thanks, Dushyant. As a reminder, today's discussion includes non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the tables in our press release and supplemental slides for a reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n In the second quarter, we processed 89.5 million transactions, which is a 39.4% increase over the same period last year. Transaction volume was driven by Biller Direct with tailwinds from IPN, Payveris and B2B transactions. The transaction growth led to a revenue increase of 28.3% in the quarter, which resulted in revenue of a $120 million. Contribution profit was $48.7 million, representing a 30.1% increase over Q2 last year.\n Consistent with the last several quarters, contribution profit grew a little faster than revenue, primarily due to an increased mix of transactions without interchange, specifically IPN transactions and B2B transactions. Contribution profit per transaction was $0.54, which was consistent with the past 2 quarters and our expectations. As we said multiple times in the past, fluctuations in areas outside our control like average payments or payment mix can impact contribution profit on a quarter-to-quarter basis.\n Historically, we have seen these things even out on a full year basis. However, given the ongoing economic uncertainty, we will continue to monitor these things very closely in the back half of the year. Adjusted gross profit increased $8.6 million or 28.6% in the quarter to $38.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $5 million for the second quarter, which represents a 10.3% adjusted EBITDA margin, which was a little softer than we expected primarily due to wage inflation.\n Operating expenses rose $13.2 million to $38.1 million for Q2 of 2022 from the same period last year. Overall, the increase in operating expenses from last year was driven by investments in staffing as well as additional operating expenses associated with Payveris and Finovera, the amortization of identified intangible assets from the acquisitions and stock-based compensation.\n Specifically R&D expense increased $2.3 million from the second quarter in 2021 to $10.2 million. Sales and marketing increased $8.3 million, driven by the Payveris acquisition, continued expansion of the sales team, adding partnerships to capture our sizable market opportunity and an increase in stock-based compensation.\n We experienced an increase in G&A expense of $2.6 million via our acquisition, multifold increases in the cost of corporate insurance and ongoing investment in public company infrastructure. Our GAAP net loss was $2.5 million and EPS for Q2 was negative $0.02. Non-GAAP net loss was $400,000 and non-GAAP EPS was 0 for the quarter.\n As of June 30, 2022, we had a $158.3 million of cash and cash equivalents for our balance sheet. Cash decreased primarily due to the timing of certain customer payments as well as increased operating expenses due to the acquisitions. At quarter end, we had approximately 122.6 million shares of common stock outstanding.\n Now turning to our 2022 full year outlook. Coming into Q2, we were comfortable with the guidance we gave. As Dushyant mentioned earlier, elongated implementation of onboarding times and this economic environment has created slower-than-expected net revenue recognition for the second half of 2022 of approximately $6 million to $8 million. But this revenue is not lost. It's just shifted into future quarters with the contract terms and TCV remaining the same.\n The inflationary environment has also compressed our contribution profit by a couple of million dollars. We were able to recapture some of the inflationary impact with price adjustments, some of which is already in process, but it takes a bit of time to recognize the impact.\n Based on these factors, we're changing our 2022 revenue outlook to the range of $485 million to $492 million. We're also changing our contribution profit guidance to be between $200 million and $204 million for the year, which is approximately 26% to 29% growth. We broadened the range due to the economic uncertainty, specifically the uncertain timing on implementation and potential for ongoing inflation.\n Just to provide some context on the stretched out implementation, in our Q3 call last year, we told you about a large new client win that would add 400 basis points to our then revenue run rate. It was our expectation that this client would go live in Q3 of this year. However, that client has now rescheduled to go live to 2023. We also have one other large implementation that has done the same. To be clear, we aren't expecting any loss of revenue associated with these clients. It's simply starting later than was originally anticipated, and we expect to start recognizing this revenue in 2023.\n We expect these delays to have a bigger impact on Q3, combined with the fact that Q3 is a lower contribution margin quarter seasonally. As a result, we anticipate little to no sequential contribution profit growth over Q2. Our adjusted EBITDA outlook is now in the range of $25 million to $29 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13% to 14%. We are seeing ongoing wage pressure in our current workforce due to the levels of inflation, which is also putting some short-term pressure on our EBITDA margins.\n In addition, after seeing the current sales momentum, we expect to make additional investments in our sales and marketing efforts. Our current guidance reflects some assumptions around continued inflation and potential for increasing wage pressure, further expected delays in implementations could also impact our ability to meet our guidance. To be clear about our guidance, we widened our range to provide a better view on the spectrum of scenarios given the increased economic uncertainty. We expect to finish the year in the ranges we've laid out.\n Finally, as we said last quarter, we would anticipate our full year effective tax rate to be around 30%. However, due to the amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisition, the closer we are to breakeven on pretax book income, the more variation we could see on our tax rate. In addition, the permanent tax benefit from stock-based compensation continues to impact the rate.\n I'll now turn the call back over to Dushyant for some closing comments. \nDushyant Sharma: Thanks, Matt. Before taking questions, I'd like to spend a little bit more time talking about the economy.\n In the quarter we experienced solid growth in the same-store sales. For example, in utilities, we saw close to 10% growth compared to second quarter of 2021. We believe the business can weather unusual level of inflation though, contribution profit growth would have been a little bit better without it. We have and will continue to manage through this environment by closely working with our clients as our contracts provide some flexibility to make changes over the medium term when the average transaction increases at the rate we have recently seen.\n We plan to maintain our responsible growth philosophy by keeping a balance between investing for future growth while continuing to look for ways to increase profitability in the near term. The vast majority of our expenses outside of interchange are people related. So we have the flexibility to add or pause hiring based on market conditions or the opportunities. And look, we have been in business for a long time, and the bottom line is, I don't like to lower guidance.\n But for client delays of this magnitude where the TCV, the total contract value, is over $100 million, any quarter they end up going live in is a good quarter, whether that is in 2022 or 2023. That's why it is not a big concern of ours, especially since these delays are related to the economic climate we are in. Therefore we believe our fundamental business is strong, sales momentum continues, water, insurance and tax bills continue to get paid, and we remain excited about the remainder of the year and the future.\n With that, I'd like to thank our over 1,000 employees for their commitment to serve our clients. And I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Andrew Bauch with SMBC. \nAndrew Bauch: Just trying to square the commentary you made about the large client that decided to push it into first quarter '23. I mean part of it was the way I think about it is that in an environment where your customers are trying to maximize the amount of receipt of collections from consumers that may be facing financial difficulty. I could see a need for your solution in this time, more than others. But any additional color would be helpful. \nDushyant Sharma: Andrew, first of all, good question. Actually, that's a great point. And frankly, as you can see from our signings in the bookings, if that trend continues to be strong. What's happening is it is when the operational aspect of implementation comes into play due to this post-pandemic inflationary environment, what we're observing is that clients are having difficulty finding IT resources. In fact, this remains a #1 topic.\n I was talking to our Head of Sales and he mentioned to me that almost every client please and with, they're talking about and thinking about how are they going to get it implemented and so on. So we are able to overcome a lot of those challenges because of the ease of implementation on our side. It takes because of the highly configurability nature -- configurable nature of our platform. But then it comes down to still you require some testing, some support, and that's where the declines are unfortunately struggling.\n And this, again, the point about the size of the customer we talked about and the total contract value in aggregate we mentioned. When you have a client -- group of clients of that size, you're always going to be open if they say hey, we're going to be delayed by a couple of quarters because our contracts allow us to recognize the entire value from the contract over the period the term, which starts on the day they go live. It's not when they start implementing. So from that perspective, that's what is really going on.\n Matt, do you want to add any? \nMatt Parson: Yes. I'd just say very good question. And the last part Dushyant was talking about the key point, which is it's really at least in what we've seen at this point limited to very large clients for the most part. Because your point is valid and we're still seeing small and medium-sized clients and some large ones too. Dushyant pointed out in the prepared remarks that are going live, it's just certain large organizations, I think, struggle more than others. \nAndrew Bauch: And then just a comment on the 125 deals closed year-to-date, I mean, I think that would be indicative that the sales pipeline is still relatively sound. And could you give us additional insight on to what kind of clients those kind of make up? Is the traditional verticals that you guys have been strong in? Are you experiencing is more in the B2B side? And maybe a sense of the sizing of those potential deals? \nDushyant Sharma: Actually, the new signings tend to be a lot more diverse than historically our historical vertical. So we have customers in real estate, we have customers in commercial enterprises. Government entities tend to be a big factor as well now. And then obviously, our bread and butter implementations of the verticals. So it is more diverse than -- and obviously, some B2B as well there. \nMatt Parson: And then size wise, I think it was the second part of your question. It spans the spectrum honestly. I mean we're still being seeing a lot of success in the SMB space and then also still having great success at the very large and as we've said multiple times, we're continuing to focus on both of them. And we've got teams internally that are focused on both the SMB space as well as large enterprise space. And so the success we've seen so far this year on the signing side really spanning the spectrum of small to large. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of John Davis with Raymond James. \nJohn Davis: I just want to start talking a little bit about inflation and what kind of lag, obviously, when you're -- some of your costs and interchange in basis points, do you have to give 30, 60, 90 days' notice to raise price on a per transaction basis? Just trying to understand, I think when we talked in the IPO, the thought was that inflation would be relatively flat minus some timing differences as far as the impact on your P&L. So just curious kind of what that timing delay looks like for your ability to raise price to offset inflation. \nDushyant Sharma: We are actually very surgical in how we are approaching our clients because these are long-term relationship, long-term partnerships, we view our clients and our partners and many of these clients have been with us for a long period of time. So from that perspective, we are always looking at -- contractually, we have -- at the time you talked about, the 60, 90 days is pretty much the top end of the time it takes us to make the changes from a contractual standpoint, but we are being very surgical as to how we talk to our clients about it.\n And what we are seeing is clients are very empathetic and very understanding because they're dealing with this, not just with us, but the whole economy is right now dealing with this. So we generally have a better traction than typical that would be the case. But your assumption is correct that we do have ability to make changes, and it does take 60, 90 days. \nJohn Davis: And then I just want to touch on profitability. Obviously, some near-term headwinds from the push out and then kind of wage inflation. I wanted just on, maybe for a minute, talk a little bit about longer-term profitability. If you go back pre-IPO, this is a mid-20s EBITDA margin business. And maybe just talk about the ramp back to that, how you think about profitability over the kind of the medium to long term. \nDushyant Sharma: I think that's our -- that remains our goal, and I'll let Matt jump in as well, but that remains our goal. And what we are seeing is, right now, the tremendous momentum in the market. So we're trying to take a look at, can we lean in even more from a sales and marketing perspective to go in more aggressive to continue to accelerate the growth here. So we'll continue to look at that. But our long-term perspective is in coming years is to be in that EBITDA margin profile.\n Matt, do you want to add anything. \nMatt Parson: Yes. I don't -- I wouldn't say there's been any change in kind of our mantra around how we think about growth and profitability and ultimately, what we want to achieve on that front. We obviously are a little bit under where we'd like to be for this year, given the things we talked about in the prepared remarks. But our overall kind of philosophy and medium- and long-term view in mantra is still the same as it was. And there continues to be leverage in the business.\n I think it's -- to Dushyant's point, continual reevaluation of the management team of the trade-off between growth and profitability and making sure that we're not constraining future growth simply because of an extra -- the cost of an extra point, couple points of profitability. So -- but I think just to sum it up, nothing has changed in kind of our medium- to long-term view or mantra world fundamentally in the business. I mean the business is still strong as evidenced by the signings. And so we're still executing accordingly. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jeff Cantwell with Wells Fargo. \nJeffrey Cantwell: I wanted to circle back on the pushback and the timing that you're talking about in the 2023 because I can already hear the follow-up question that we'll be answering for the next few months until we speak again, which is was this an isolated incident?\n And I guess I'd have to kind of phrase it that way because the question would then be, why would there not be others. And so we have to try to work our way through that. So I was curious if you can give us a little more detail on and just get a little comfort around what you're discussing as far as pushing back revenue in 2023. \nDushyant Sharma: Thank you, Jeff. Look, first of all, I think -- first of all, very, very good question, very reasonable question and very understandable. And let me just talk about from the -- from 2 perspectives. One is the economic climate itself you're dealing with. The overall the sentiment is the clients are just taking a little bit longer than they usually do to get live on our platform. I mean historically speaking, we are implementation machine actually.\n I mean we do a great job. We get customers live. And that is in our platform, our capabilities are better today at getting customers live than they have ever been. And the reason for that is the investments we have been making over the years. The challenge is that the readiness of the client to just whatever little support, which is a fractional support relative to the other efforts, which are required to get them launched. That fractional support is required by clients getting their technology team engaged. There are some IT resources to just QA that test the platform and so on.\n And because of the environment we are in, it is stretching a little bit. But I want to tie it back to the guidance and this year, if all of that aside is a couple of declines we're talking about, they would have actually maintained their time line. We would be perfectly fine with our guide, as I shared earlier. So it's an interesting scenario meaning that couple of clients made an impact, which we were counting on for this year. But other delays, some of them were actually -- we were already factoring in. \nMatt Parson: Yes. I think Dushyant is an right and I'll just add, of course, that our planning modeling as we go through it, we don't assume best case scenario for client go live. We, of course, look at history and assume some amount of buffer on when they would go live typically, depending on the size of the client and various things as you would expect. I think the challenge with these 2 in particular were they were very large that we referenced on the call.\n The 2 we referred on the call was very large and kind of hit at the same time. And so I think as we look into the rest of the year, we've -- in our guidance, we've assumed appropriate, again or what we think is appropriate levels of buffer and delay. And these are 2 of the biggest ones that were kind of slated for the back half of the year. So yes, I think we -- as I said on the call, we fully expect that we'll land within the revised range.\n But actually, to Andrew's point earlier on that question earlier, I just do want to say Jeff to you and others that the demand for the product remains very strong because it is -- the markets we are in are actually the right conditions for a platform like ours. However, once the business executives make the decision to get it launched, they still need a support from their IT partners and other priorities which might be going on. And some of them are right now stretched just because of the climate we are in. \nJeffrey Cantwell: And if I can ask one follow-up. On the financial outlook for this year, I'd like to ask this question, but I guess it depends on how to level set expectations for going forward. What would be the factors in your own minds right now that would drive revenue, for example, to the lower end of the range? And what would be the factors that would drive it to the upper end of the range? I just want to make sure we're all clear on that. Same with contribution profit. I'm just trying to get a feel of what you think are the swing factors in your guidance as it stands right now. \nDushyant Sharma: I think there are 2 or 3 and all of them we have talked about, I mean client go-lives. If they all go live as we are planning to and if they -- and some of the inflationary environment that we are operating in and if our assumptions hold true in terms of being able to make adjustments and which we have been making. Then I think we'll be at the top end and if they don't then we'll be closer to the bottom line. \nMatt Parson: Yes, I agree that. I think that's the 2 main factors as we kind of think about the ranges, timing of go lives, implementation go lives and our continued ability to improve the pricing profile in certain situations based on what we're seeing with inflation. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Dave Koning with Baird. \nDavid Koning: And maybe I can ask a numbers question. Just if -- I think you said that you expected these clients have delayed to be about 4% of this year, and they were going to come out in Q3. Does that mean that they collectively are about 8% of total revenue? And I guess the corollary to that is if your wound rates are still the same, does that mean next year will be an outsized good growth year, just you'll get the full impact of this plus just the normal wins coming on? \nMatt Parson: Yes. Thanks, Dave. So on the first question, it was 400 basis points on our then revenue growth rate, i.e., Q3 of last year. So just to make sure the multiplier is the right number but your concept is correct. The other client was not quite as large, but it was in that same ballpark. And it was 400 basis points on then revenue growth rate at that point last year.\n So I think that also raises another good point, which is we -- because of the other momentum we've seen in the business, if you sort of do the math on what our previous guide was versus what this guide is when you take the numbers that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've also -- there's also been some good things that have happened that have helped offset some of these negatives during the year as well. It's not just a one-way kind of move. There's definitely been some other positives that have helped offset the negatives.\n On next year, I think we'll see. We'll give our next year guidance when the time is appropriate. I think as we said, they are pushing in 2023 and the revenue is not lost. So to your point, we do expect them to come live and start getting that revenue in '23. It would have -- from a raw dollar perspective, it would have already been in the number anyway, had it gone live later this year. So it's not necessarily new revenue into 2023. But to your point, on a percentage basis, it has an impact there.\n So we will -- like I said, we'll give our 2023 guidance at the times appropriate, but I think the way you're thinking about it is in the right direction. \nDavid Koning: And then the second one, I think this was very, very clear, but I think inflation, basically, you're saying has 2 impacts. One is just wages to the expenses. But 2 is inflation has a network fee impact that hurts the contribution profit, right, because you pay a higher volume to pay network fees. Those are the 2 main things, right? \nDushyant Sharma: That's correct. That's correct. And as we shared earlier, one of which the -- our contracts already allow us to talk to our clients and discuss and partner with our clients to solve for that, which, as Matt mentioned, we are already in the process in some cases already. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] There are no additional questions at this time. I will pass it back to the management team for closing remarks. \nDushyant Sharma: Thank you so much. Really appreciate your time. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter, and have a great summer. \nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Dushyant Sharma",
            "content": "Thanks, Paul. We believe the business performed well in the second quarter, with momentum in both sales and revenues. The revenue increased $26.5 million or 28.3% to $120 million. Contribution profit in the quarter grew 30.2% to $48.7 million, driven by a 39.4% increase in transactions. Our sales engine continue to be strong with signings of more than 60 deals again this quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to over 125. This number of signings is more than 50% higher versus the same period last year.\n Notwithstanding the challenging economic environment, including inflationary pressures and the session, these results illustrate why we believe our business is resilient. In spite of the current headwinds, we are seeing around client-based implementation delays and inflation, which we will talk more about later in these prepared remarks. We remain excited about our fundamental business operations and long-term prospects.\n We continue to drive implementations forward and had a number of client implementation success stories in the quarter. One example is the implementation of one of the largest utilities in the country. This client serves a very large footprint across the country and selected us to handle the complexity of the nationwide implementation. We also completed the migration of a large municipality with JPMorgan support. A third client we implemented in the quarter was a top 20 credit union with over $10 billion in assets.\n As we continue to move up market, this is our third financial services client with over $10 billion in assets launched on our banking IPN platform. As you know, the pricing model for banking bill payments is not affected by interchange. Also in the quarter, we received the Pacesetter Awards for 2022 from a large enterprise software company utilities user group, recognizing Paymentus for its leadership in billing and payment innovation. We are proud of this award and believe it exemplifies the strength of our billing and payments product and innovation.\n We also completed integration with one of the leading providers of electronic health care records in the quarter along with adding advanced payment functionality for the health care vertical to our product. Although we believe we had a solid financial performance this quarter, the difficult economic climate is not without impact on us. Implementation and onboarding is one of the primary areas we are seeing impacted by these difficult economic times.\n A few of our larger deployments, which were originally slated to go live in Q2 and the back half of 2022 have been stressed out due to lack of client IT resource availability. Due primarily to these client-based slowdowns, we are changing our full year 2022 guidance. However, I'd like to make it clear that in better economic climate with normal implementation time lines, it specifically relate to these clients, I believe we would be meeting or beating existing guidance for 2022.\n If you take a long-term view of the business as we do, these delays are not particularly significant, especially considering that the anticipated financial benefits from these clients are merely delayed to future quarters, not lost. Matt will cover the details as he discusses our financial results and revised guidance. Matt? Thanks, Matt. Before taking questions, I'd like to spend a little bit more time talking about the economy.\n In the quarter we experienced solid growth in the same-store sales. For example, in utilities, we saw close to 10% growth compared to second quarter of 2021. We believe the business can weather unusual level of inflation though, contribution profit growth would have been a little bit better without it. We have and will continue to manage through this environment by closely working with our clients as our contracts provide some flexibility to make changes over the medium term when the average transaction increases at the rate we have recently seen.\n We plan to maintain our responsible growth philosophy by keeping a balance between investing for future growth while continuing to look for ways to increase profitability in the near term. The vast majority of our expenses outside of interchange are people related. So we have the flexibility to add or pause hiring based on market conditions or the opportunities. And look, we have been in business for a long time, and the bottom line is, I don't like to lower guidance.\n But for client delays of this magnitude where the TCV, the total contract value, is over $100 million, any quarter they end up going live in is a good quarter, whether that is in 2022 or 2023. That's why it is not a big concern of ours, especially since these delays are related to the economic climate we are in. Therefore we believe our fundamental business is strong, sales momentum continues, water, insurance and tax bills continue to get paid, and we remain excited about the remainder of the year and the future.\n With that, I'd like to thank our over 1,000 employees for their commitment to serve our clients. And I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Andrew, first of all, good question. Actually, that's a great point. And frankly, as you can see from our signings in the bookings, if that trend continues to be strong. What's happening is it is when the operational aspect of implementation comes into play due to this post-pandemic inflationary environment, what we're observing is that clients are having difficulty finding IT resources. In fact, this remains a #1 topic.\n I was talking to our Head of Sales and he mentioned to me that almost every client please and with, they're talking about and thinking about how are they going to get it implemented and so on. So we are able to overcome a lot of those challenges because of the ease of implementation on our side. It takes because of the highly configurability nature -- configurable nature of our platform. But then it comes down to still you require some testing, some support, and that's where the declines are unfortunately struggling.\n And this, again, the point about the size of the customer we talked about and the total contract value in aggregate we mentioned. When you have a client -- group of clients of that size, you're always going to be open if they say hey, we're going to be delayed by a couple of quarters because our contracts allow us to recognize the entire value from the contract over the period the term, which starts on the day they go live. It's not when they start implementing. So from that perspective, that's what is really going on.\n Matt, do you want to add any? Actually, the new signings tend to be a lot more diverse than historically our historical vertical. So we have customers in real estate, we have customers in commercial enterprises. Government entities tend to be a big factor as well now. And then obviously, our bread and butter implementations of the verticals. So it is more diverse than -- and obviously, some B2B as well there. We are actually very surgical in how we are approaching our clients because these are long-term relationship, long-term partnerships, we view our clients and our partners and many of these clients have been with us for a long period of time. So from that perspective, we are always looking at -- contractually, we have -- at the time you talked about, the 60, 90 days is pretty much the top end of the time it takes us to make the changes from a contractual standpoint, but we are being very surgical as to how we talk to our clients about it.\n And what we are seeing is clients are very empathetic and very understanding because they're dealing with this, not just with us, but the whole economy is right now dealing with this. So we generally have a better traction than typical that would be the case. But your assumption is correct that we do have ability to make changes, and it does take 60, 90 days. I think that's our -- that remains our goal, and I'll let Matt jump in as well, but that remains our goal. And what we are seeing is, right now, the tremendous momentum in the market. So we're trying to take a look at, can we lean in even more from a sales and marketing perspective to go in more aggressive to continue to accelerate the growth here. So we'll continue to look at that. But our long-term perspective is in coming years is to be in that EBITDA margin profile.\n Matt, do you want to add anything. Thank you, Jeff. Look, first of all, I think -- first of all, very, very good question, very reasonable question and very understandable. And let me just talk about from the -- from 2 perspectives. One is the economic climate itself you're dealing with. The overall the sentiment is the clients are just taking a little bit longer than they usually do to get live on our platform. I mean historically speaking, we are implementation machine actually.\n I mean we do a great job. We get customers live. And that is in our platform, our capabilities are better today at getting customers live than they have ever been. And the reason for that is the investments we have been making over the years. The challenge is that the readiness of the client to just whatever little support, which is a fractional support relative to the other efforts, which are required to get them launched. That fractional support is required by clients getting their technology team engaged. There are some IT resources to just QA that test the platform and so on.\n And because of the environment we are in, it is stretching a little bit. But I want to tie it back to the guidance and this year, if all of that aside is a couple of declines we're talking about, they would have actually maintained their time line. We would be perfectly fine with our guide, as I shared earlier. So it's an interesting scenario meaning that couple of clients made an impact, which we were counting on for this year. But other delays, some of them were actually -- we were already factoring in. I think there are 2 or 3 and all of them we have talked about, I mean client go-lives. If they all go live as we are planning to and if they -- and some of the inflationary environment that we are operating in and if our assumptions hold true in terms of being able to make adjustments and which we have been making. Then I think we'll be at the top end and if they don't then we'll be closer to the bottom line. That's correct. That's correct. And as we shared earlier, one of which the -- our contracts already allow us to talk to our clients and discuss and partner with our clients to solve for that, which, as Matt mentioned, we are already in the process in some cases already. Thank you so much. Really appreciate your time. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter, and have a great summer."

            "name": "Matt Parson",
            "content": "Thanks, Dushyant. As a reminder, today's discussion includes non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the tables in our press release and supplemental slides for a reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n In the second quarter, we processed 89.5 million transactions, which is a 39.4% increase over the same period last year. Transaction volume was driven by Biller Direct with tailwinds from IPN, Payveris and B2B transactions. The transaction growth led to a revenue increase of 28.3% in the quarter, which resulted in revenue of a $120 million. Contribution profit was $48.7 million, representing a 30.1% increase over Q2 last year.\n Consistent with the last several quarters, contribution profit grew a little faster than revenue, primarily due to an increased mix of transactions without interchange, specifically IPN transactions and B2B transactions. Contribution profit per transaction was $0.54, which was consistent with the past 2 quarters and our expectations. As we said multiple times in the past, fluctuations in areas outside our control like average payments or payment mix can impact contribution profit on a quarter-to-quarter basis.\n Historically, we have seen these things even out on a full year basis. However, given the ongoing economic uncertainty, we will continue to monitor these things very closely in the back half of the year. Adjusted gross profit increased $8.6 million or 28.6% in the quarter to $38.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $5 million for the second quarter, which represents a 10.3% adjusted EBITDA margin, which was a little softer than we expected primarily due to wage inflation.\n Operating expenses rose $13.2 million to $38.1 million for Q2 of 2022 from the same period last year. Overall, the increase in operating expenses from last year was driven by investments in staffing as well as additional operating expenses associated with Payveris and Finovera, the amortization of identified intangible assets from the acquisitions and stock-based compensation.\n Specifically R&D expense increased $2.3 million from the second quarter in 2021 to $10.2 million. Sales and marketing increased $8.3 million, driven by the Payveris acquisition, continued expansion of the sales team, adding partnerships to capture our sizable market opportunity and an increase in stock-based compensation.\n We experienced an increase in G&A expense of $2.6 million via our acquisition, multifold increases in the cost of corporate insurance and ongoing investment in public company infrastructure. Our GAAP net loss was $2.5 million and EPS for Q2 was negative $0.02. Non-GAAP net loss was $400,000 and non-GAAP EPS was 0 for the quarter.\n As of June 30, 2022, we had a $158.3 million of cash and cash equivalents for our balance sheet. Cash decreased primarily due to the timing of certain customer payments as well as increased operating expenses due to the acquisitions. At quarter end, we had approximately 122.6 million shares of common stock outstanding.\n Now turning to our 2022 full year outlook. Coming into Q2, we were comfortable with the guidance we gave. As Dushyant mentioned earlier, elongated implementation of onboarding times and this economic environment has created slower-than-expected net revenue recognition for the second half of 2022 of approximately $6 million to $8 million. But this revenue is not lost. It's just shifted into future quarters with the contract terms and TCV remaining the same.\n The inflationary environment has also compressed our contribution profit by a couple of million dollars. We were able to recapture some of the inflationary impact with price adjustments, some of which is already in process, but it takes a bit of time to recognize the impact.\n Based on these factors, we're changing our 2022 revenue outlook to the range of $485 million to $492 million. We're also changing our contribution profit guidance to be between $200 million and $204 million for the year, which is approximately 26% to 29% growth. We broadened the range due to the economic uncertainty, specifically the uncertain timing on implementation and potential for ongoing inflation.\n Just to provide some context on the stretched out implementation, in our Q3 call last year, we told you about a large new client win that would add 400 basis points to our then revenue run rate. It was our expectation that this client would go live in Q3 of this year. However, that client has now rescheduled to go live to 2023. We also have one other large implementation that has done the same. To be clear, we aren't expecting any loss of revenue associated with these clients. It's simply starting later than was originally anticipated, and we expect to start recognizing this revenue in 2023.\n We expect these delays to have a bigger impact on Q3, combined with the fact that Q3 is a lower contribution margin quarter seasonally. As a result, we anticipate little to no sequential contribution profit growth over Q2. Our adjusted EBITDA outlook is now in the range of $25 million to $29 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13% to 14%. We are seeing ongoing wage pressure in our current workforce due to the levels of inflation, which is also putting some short-term pressure on our EBITDA margins.\n In addition, after seeing the current sales momentum, we expect to make additional investments in our sales and marketing efforts. Our current guidance reflects some assumptions around continued inflation and potential for increasing wage pressure, further expected delays in implementations could also impact our ability to meet our guidance. To be clear about our guidance, we widened our range to provide a better view on the spectrum of scenarios given the increased economic uncertainty. We expect to finish the year in the ranges we've laid out.\n Finally, as we said last quarter, we would anticipate our full year effective tax rate to be around 30%. However, due to the amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisition, the closer we are to breakeven on pretax book income, the more variation we could see on our tax rate. In addition, the permanent tax benefit from stock-based compensation continues to impact the rate.\n I'll now turn the call back over to Dushyant for some closing comments. Yes. I'd just say very good question. And the last part Dushyant was talking about the key point, which is it's really at least in what we've seen at this point limited to very large clients for the most part. Because your point is valid and we're still seeing small and medium-sized clients and some large ones too. Dushyant pointed out in the prepared remarks that are going live, it's just certain large organizations, I think, struggle more than others. And then size wise, I think it was the second part of your question. It spans the spectrum honestly. I mean we're still being seeing a lot of success in the SMB space and then also still having great success at the very large and as we've said multiple times, we're continuing to focus on both of them. And we've got teams internally that are focused on both the SMB space as well as large enterprise space. And so the success we've seen so far this year on the signing side really spanning the spectrum of small to large. Yes. I don't -- I wouldn't say there's been any change in kind of our mantra around how we think about growth and profitability and ultimately, what we want to achieve on that front. We obviously are a little bit under where we'd like to be for this year, given the things we talked about in the prepared remarks. But our overall kind of philosophy and medium- and long-term view in mantra is still the same as it was. And there continues to be leverage in the business.\n I think it's -- to Dushyant's point, continual reevaluation of the management team of the trade-off between growth and profitability and making sure that we're not constraining future growth simply because of an extra -- the cost of an extra point, couple points of profitability. So -- but I think just to sum it up, nothing has changed in kind of our medium- to long-term view or mantra world fundamentally in the business. I mean the business is still strong as evidenced by the signings. And so we're still executing accordingly. Yes. I think Dushyant is an right and I'll just add, of course, that our planning modeling as we go through it, we don't assume best case scenario for client go live. We, of course, look at history and assume some amount of buffer on when they would go live typically, depending on the size of the client and various things as you would expect. I think the challenge with these 2 in particular were they were very large that we referenced on the call.\n The 2 we referred on the call was very large and kind of hit at the same time. And so I think as we look into the rest of the year, we've -- in our guidance, we've assumed appropriate, again or what we think is appropriate levels of buffer and delay. And these are 2 of the biggest ones that were kind of slated for the back half of the year. So yes, I think we -- as I said on the call, we fully expect that we'll land within the revised range.\n But actually, to Andrew's point earlier on that question earlier, I just do want to say Jeff to you and others that the demand for the product remains very strong because it is -- the markets we are in are actually the right conditions for a platform like ours. However, once the business executives make the decision to get it launched, they still need a support from their IT partners and other priorities which might be going on. And some of them are right now stretched just because of the climate we are in. Yes, I agree that. I think that's the 2 main factors as we kind of think about the ranges, timing of go lives, implementation go lives and our continued ability to improve the pricing profile in certain situations based on what we're seeing with inflation. Yes. Thanks, Dave. So on the first question, it was 400 basis points on our then revenue growth rate, i.e., Q3 of last year. So just to make sure the multiplier is the right number but your concept is correct. The other client was not quite as large, but it was in that same ballpark. And it was 400 basis points on then revenue growth rate at that point last year.\n So I think that also raises another good point, which is we -- because of the other momentum we've seen in the business, if you sort of do the math on what our previous guide was versus what this guide is when you take the numbers that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've also -- there's also been some good things that have happened that have helped offset some of these negatives during the year as well. It's not just a one-way kind of move. There's definitely been some other positives that have helped offset the negatives.\n On next year, I think we'll see. We'll give our next year guidance when the time is appropriate. I think as we said, they are pushing in 2023 and the revenue is not lost. So to your point, we do expect them to come live and start getting that revenue in '23. It would have -- from a raw dollar perspective, it would have already been in the number anyway, had it gone live later this year. So it's not necessarily new revenue into 2023. But to your point, on a percentage basis, it has an impact there.\n So we will -- like I said, we'll give our 2023 guidance at the times appropriate, but I think the way you're thinking about it is in the right direction."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to your speaker today, Mr. Ron Clarke. Please go ahead. \nJames Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Charles Freund, our CFO. Following the prepared comments, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then that you can get in line for questions. Please note, our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com.\n Throughout this call, we will be covering organic revenue growth. As a reminder, this metric neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes of foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads. It also includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed during the 2 years being compared.\n We will also be covering non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than in other companies.\n Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website.\n I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our outlook, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We undertake no obligation to update any of these statements.\n These expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of these risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov.\n Now with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? \nRonald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q1 2022 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects: so first, give you my take on Q1; second, lay out our updated rest of year 2022 guidance; third, and I'll give you a brief update on our Russia business; and then lastly, I'll share some new things, some good things happening in the company.\n Okay. Let me make the turn to our Q1 results. Terrific. Really, really great performance. We reported revenue of $789 million, up 30%, and cash EPS of $365 million, up 29%.\n Revenue came in very strong, about $40 million above our Q1 midpoint guide, with only $12 million of that beat macro-related. So a lot of very good fundamental overperformance in the quarter.\n Organic growth overall, 15% for Q1, and each of our 4 major lines of business, all growing organically double-digits. Trends in Q1, excellent. Sales, up 39% versus last year. We added about 50,000 new clients to the fold, sold in Q1, and over 50% of all of our new global fuel card clients came to us digitally. So a terrific sales quarter.\n A steady revenue retention of 93% and healthy same-store sales for the quarter at plus 7%. So Q1, really one of the best quarterly performances that I can recall.\n All right. Let me shift to our updated rest of year 2022 guidance. So first off, we're expecting a bit of a mixed macro rest of year. So on the positive side, our clients are healthier, spending more, which we can see in the volumes. Fuel prices are at record levels. And the Brazil currency has rebounded some since the start of the year.\n On the not-so-good side, we're outlooking higher interest expense, really depending on the pace of the rate hikes and likely higher bad debt expense. The real wildcard, we think, for rest of year is the Brazil FX, as it's continued to be quite volatile year-to-date.\n Fortunately, we're enjoying pretty strong fundamentals exiting Q1. We've got healthy volumes. We've got record sales. We've got steady retention, so all the things that set up well for us for the rest of year.\n So with that, we're revising our 2022 full year guidance today up as follows. So revenue to $3.360 billion at the midpoint. That's up $140 million. And cash EPS of $15.60. That's up $0.35 from our initial guide. So a much stronger full year 2022 outlook today than we had 90 days ago.\n Assuming we achieve today's guidance, it would imply full year '22 revenue growth of 19% and full year '22 cash EPS growth of 18%. So that would be back-to-back years post-COVID, 2021 and 2022, in which FLEETCOR would compound earnings by 18%.\n I do want to remind everyone, we are outlooking still meaningful sequential improvement in the guide as we run through the year, with our Q4 revenue expected to be up about $90 million versus our Q1 print.\n Okay. Let me shift gears and give you just a brief update on our Russia business. So I'll start by reminding you that Russia represents a very small part of the company, about 3% of revenue. So on a 2022 annualized basis, Russia will contribute about $85 million in revenue and approximately $0.77 in cash EPS.\n The Russia business is really a pure fleet card business. It runs very stand-alone. And we employ about 600 local employees. As you can imagine, we've been quite busy since the start of the conflict. We've been taking actions to derisk the business. We've been complying with the ever-evolving sanctions. And we've continued to weigh the various options that we have.\n We're certainly being super cautious to take care of the well-being of our employees. So look, we'll continue to keep you updated as the situation evolves.\n Okay. So last up today, I would like to run through some good things that are happening in the company. So first, some new wins. So we've got a fair number of notable new wins and client renewals in the quarter. So just a couple of examples. Speedway, one of our largest North America retail partners, recently extended their relationship with us, delighted with that.\n Amazon awarded us their middle-mile trucking fleet, which has grown like a weed. We won the Eclipx fleet leasing business contract in Australia, a pretty big piece of business for us in the region.\n Second, cross-sell, we really like the cross-sell opportunity in front of us. We're still exploring selling our Corporate Payment products into our fuel card base. And we're progressing selling our add-ons to our toll customers. You've heard us talk about selling fueling. We're also testing now selling insurance and even lodging. We did reach 1.7 million add-on fueling transactions in the quarter to our total customer base, so progressing quite well.\n Third, EV, we're going on offense. We've talked previously about building capabilities to serve our fleet use case and protect the customers we have and the revenue we have. We've now identified a couple of new customer segments that we can repurpose, we think, our EV assets, like our network too, and generate incremental revenue beyond the fleet business. So potentially here, some incremental revenue upside to the energy transition.\n And lastly, we had our off-site, growth off-site meeting, last month and set the internal goal of selling 1 billion of new business annually within the forecast period. So pretty excited to aspire to $1 billion in new business. We've concluded we have the product set now and the TAM to do it, and we think we've built the marketing, credit and digital underlying capabilities to do it. So super excited about chasing a bigger number.\n So look, taken together, new wins, cross-sell opportunities, EV on offense and selling more, pretty exciting for us.\n So look, in conclusion, today, just a few final thoughts. So one, our Q1 results were terrific, clearly better than we had expected. Our rest of year or full year 2022 performance, expected to be much better than we envisioned 90 days ago, and lots of good things, new things happening in the company. So all in all, we're in a pretty good place. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter. Chuck? \nCharles Freund: Yes. Thanks, Ron. So before digging into the financial results, I would like to make sure that you were all aware of the new investor deck we posted on our website a few weeks ago. In there, we tried to simplify how we talk about the company.\n At its core, FLEETCOR provides a set of corporate payment solutions to help businesses reduce spend. Now we do it in 2 ways, one, by enabling and controlling what's purchased. We call this expense management, and it comes in a few flavors, like fuel, tolls and lodging.\n Or two, by enabling controls after the purchase, but before the payments have been made. We call this AP payments, where we provide the options businesses have to make their payments, such as online bill pay, full AP outsourcing, virtual cards and cross-border. So when you think of it this way, the company really does only 2 things, expense management and AP payments in a couple different ways.\n So with that context, let's look at some more detail on the quarter. As Ron mentioned, we posted an impressive 30% growth quarter, including 15% organic growth, which I'll get into in more detail in a moment. About 10% or $58 million of the growth was due to acquisitions we made last year, and about 3% or $21 million came from macro tailwinds.\n Speaking of macro, fuel prices were $3.88 per gallon for the quarter, higher than our $3.40 guidance assumption based on January levels. Higher fuel prices contributed about $22 million of additional revenues versus prior year.\n Now we exited the quarter with fuel prices at around $4.50 per gallon.  We do think this will moderate some over the balance of the year. Fuel spreads in the quarter had a positive impact of about $5 million. And we had a $6 million negative impact due to lower foreign exchange rates as unfavorable movements in European currencies, which affect our cross-border and fuel business, more than offset the strength of the Brazilian reals that helps our toll revenue.\n Now moving to organic growth, starting with AP payments. Our corporate payables were up 23%, and that was led by full AP outsourcing, which was up over 50% yet again driven by continuing strong new sales. Cross-border was up 17%, and that's normalized for the AFEX acquisition. The cross-border team had a great quarter as new sales remained strong and activity recovered in Australia.\n And moving on to our expense management solutions. Fuel was up organically, 14%, as new sales growth of 25% and higher same-store sales of 3% to 4% continued to drive the performance. I may sound like a broken record on this, but we continue to see fantastic results from our digital marketing and customer acquisition efforts across this business.\n Tolls were up 18% compared with last year as the business just continues to perform. New sales are solid and retention initiatives are showing to be quite effective as we highlight the differentiated value proposition we offer versus our competitors.\n Lodging continued to perform well too, up 22%. Our workforce lodging business has improved with higher new sales and better volumes. Airlines again outperformed, with organic growth over 65%. In the quarter, we did announce the purchase of Levarti, an airline software platform company. The deal is immaterial to our financials, but we believe the software, combined with our lodging solution, will drive more sales in the airline vertical.\n Now looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses of $472 million represented a 38% increase over prior year primarily due to the addition of the AFEX and ALE operations, increases tied to higher volumes across our businesses, incremental bad debt, stock compensation and new sales generation activities and investments to drive future growth.\n Bad debt expense was $25.5 million or 6 basis points as bad debt levels have returned to more historical levels as customer spend increases with higher fuel prices and as a result of much stronger new sales, which tend to have a higher loss rate.\n The EBITDA margin in the quarter was 50% as higher stock comp and bad debt expenses negatively impacted the margin. This was largely expected as the company took actions to stimulate growth coming out of the COVID environment. We still expect our full year EBITDA margin to be in line with our original expectations of 52% as margins expand throughout the year, along with revenue growth and the increased benefit of synergy realization from acquisitions.\n Interest expense decreased 23% year-over-year driven by the effect of a $1 billion fixed rate swap that matured in January and the benefit of higher interest income earned on customer deposits and cash balances in certain foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% versus 22% last year, with the increase driven primarily by less excess tax benefit on stock option exercises and higher interest income on foreign deposits, which are taxed at a higher rate.\n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with over $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash. And we had $969 million available on our revolver. There was $4.9 billion outstanding on our credit facilities. And we had $1.4 billion borrowed in our securitization facility.\n As of March 31, our leverage ratio was 2.72x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.\n In the quarter, we upsized our securitization facility to $1.6 billion in order to accommodate higher receivables balances due to higher fuel prices. We intend to maximize the use of the facility given that it is the lowest cost of capital funding instrument that we have.\n We repurchased roughly 1.8 million shares, 1.1 million of which were completed under our 10b5 plan that we had in place in January, and which were included in our original guidance. We still have $1.23 billion authorized for repurchase. And we believe we have ample liquidity to pursue any near-term M&A opportunities and continue to buy back shares when it makes sense.\n Ron has covered our full year guidance updates. So now, let me share some thoughts on our Q2 outlook and our assumptions.\n For Q2, we're expecting revenue to be between $805 million and $825 million and adjusted net income per share to be between $3.80 and $3.90, which, at the midpoint, is approximately $0.70 or 22% higher than what we reported in Q2 of 2021.\n Regarding our guidance assumptions, we are using $3.90 as our fuel price assumption for the rest of the year. This reflects fuel prices of $4.25, $3.85 and $3.65 for the next 3 quarters, respectively. Clearly, we don't expect fuel prices to remain at the current elevated levels, so we're using this forward curve as the basis of our forecast.\n Our interest expense guidance of $105 million to $115 million is based off of a LIBOR average of 154 basis points for April through December. Our original assumption had LIBOR of 54 basis points for that same period. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement.\n I would note that our rest of year guidance expectations do still include revenue and adjusted earnings per share from our fuel business in Russia, which are $67 million and $0.63, respectively, for the remainder of the year.\n Moving away from the results and outlook, I would like to thank our circa 10,000 employees around the world who helped us deliver a fantastic start to 2022 and who will be the driving force as we continue to grow our company. Thank you for your interest in FLEETCOR.\n And now, operator, we'll open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: It's nice to speak to you guys, and the results look really great here. I'll ask maybe, I think, Ron, you talked about the guidance change, and it looks like it's well above the beat, both macro and fundamentally as well. So is there a way to maybe break that up for us just to better understand what the $140 million, whatever the revision is, for the full year, how much of that is macro, fuel, et cetera, versus underlying performance being better? \nRonald F. Clarke: Hey, Tien-Tsin, good to hear your voice, too. So simplistically, the $140 million would be $40 million in Q1, $100 million rest of year and called out: 1/3, real performance; 2/3, macro health. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Got it. And then from a new sales perspective, I think you said up 39%. I know you've always stressed to us the importance of driving new sales. How about for the rest of the year? Have you sort of upgraded your thinking on sales productivity and targets? I heard the billion comment earlier, but just thinking about the next 2 to 3 quarters, have you changed your thinking [ on that basis ]? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, really good question. So yes, particularly on the fuel, fleet side. And the thing that's interesting is that you think the higher fuel prices obviously help us from a revenue perspective, right, in terms of MDR, but they actually help in sales. So literally, there was a period the digital guys came down and we had said that, I think it was in March, the volumes, the search volumes were running about 2x kind of our normalized level of kind of inbound. So our sales in that business were super good in Q1, and we had taken up the forecast rest of year.\n So again, I said it repeatedly, it's the single best indicator, [ tension ] for the business, right? If we can grow compound sales somewhere in the 20s, right, when we're trying to compound revenue double-digit, obviously, that improves, right? If we get to that number and don't have COVID again, obviously, the revenue will accelerate. \nOperator: Your next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. \nJeffrey Goldstein: This is Jeff Goldstein on for James. You were talking about, in your prepared remarks, about possibly seeing revenue upside to energy transition given repurposing some of your EV assets. Can you just expand on that a little and talk about what needs to go right for you to actually see that revenue upside from the ongoing transition? \nRonald F. Clarke: Hey, Jeff, it's Ron. So I don't want to give too much away, but I would say there was an a-ha moment where we were taking stock of the assets that we're building, particularly the ability to capture, right, the EV data and then the network, the public network, getting acceptance, and the ability to settle there.\n And up until very recently, our whole focus has been, hey, serving basically our card fleet customers or prospective fleet customers with this. And all of a sudden, 2 or 3 other interesting customer segments liked what we have. And so that's the headline. They're non-fleet kinds of customers that need help in EV. And so the assets that we built for one purpose, we think, are pretty transferable to the other.\n And then, b, we've actually got a pretty interesting target sitting in our M&A pipeline that would be supportive of that, that would accelerate our move there. So the real headline is we've just opened our eyes to how to basically serve a greater set of people in the ecosystem and hopefully generate incremental revenue. \nJeffrey Goldstein: Got it. That's helpful. And then I wanted to ask about the competitive landscape within Corporate Payments. How are you thinking about competition and investment in that space just given the range of new competitors increasingly attacking that opportunity set? Just anything in particular to call out there. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean the headline on that one is it's just so nascent. I know that you guys have some theme of, hey, the disruptor theory and there's lots of new people doing lots of new things, which is true. But I try to remind people, Jeff, that's us. We're the new guys that have less than 1% of that TAM. And it's fundamentally the banks that have most of what we call the Corporate Payments business.\n So it is a -- it's a massive set of payables basically to get digitized, and it's held adversely with the banks. And so it's, I think, it's a food frenzy really for all of us that are bringing something new, and I'm hopeful the other guys that are new can get something, too. But the real competition for us is the -- are the current people, the current providers. So it's super wide open for us. \nOperator: Your next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: I know, Ron, you mentioned there's a number of ways Russia can go.  What's the likelihood we see a meaningful negative hit from that region, whether it's related to sort of discontinuing operations or other macro-specific factors in the country? \nRonald F. Clarke: Hey, Sanjay, it's Ron. I would say really uncertain, right, how that ball is going to bounce. We're doing lots of things, as you can imagine, exploring everything, right, selling it, transferring it, doing all kinds of things. So ballpark, I think we're carrying circa around $300 million on our books. So to the extent that the thing were shuttered and there was now complete loss, that's kind of ballparking what the number is.\n So look, I don't know where it's going to go. We've obviously got some ideas of how we're running the thing differently and cutting ties obviously with the business a bit back here to the mother ship. And so it's really more of a wait and see. We're going to obviously continue to explore whether there's buyers that are interested in the business and honestly, just see how the conflict steps along here. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Great. And I can't help but not ask the M&A question, just because valuations have come in so significantly. I mean how do you feel about the backdrop now? And what's really interesting in terms of areas you would want to add to? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I think it's mixed, is what I would say. Obviously, we're always working a pipeline, no different today. We've got 3 or 4 things. And I would say, as I run through those, some of them are later-stage. Some of the sellers haven't moved a lot. We point out, [ hey, you watching ] like even today some of the comp groups.\n And so I would say some people are just, I think, kind of staying put, maybe going to wait to see if things come back. And then I would say, [ there's ] a couple of newer things that we've negotiated, let's say, in the last couple of months. We've been able to agree to prices that we like, that work for us. So I would say, it's interesting, but it's kind of mixed. Not everybody has reset, but I think some people have. \nOperator: Your next question is from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask just a general question about Corporate Payments. It came in a lot higher than our number and I think The Street number as well. What kind of outperformed in the quarter even versus your own expectations? What do you see in that business as just really working right now? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Hey, Ramsey, it's Ron. I would say everything in there worked. The sales were good. We did get a bit of recovery in the base in that business. We talked about some of the clients getting healthier. And for sure, I don't know if we called it out before, but we have a bit of a, what we call, a multi-card business in there that's not only purchasing, but it does pick up some travel. So like others, we got some decent amount of add-back.\n The full AP thing is warring, was still 50%-plus up in the quarter. And despite eating a giant cross-border business, not that long ago, the cross-border business was also better than we thought. Mostly Australia, so that business originates really in 4 markets for us, but one of which is Australia. And it was, when I say in the ditch, I mean, it was super in the ditch in '21.\n So it's really, I would say, some fair amount of underlying health in Australia cross-border, in the multi-card business and then really just, again, super-duper sales. So kind of all working there. \nRamsey El-Assal: All working. Okay. And I wanted to ask you too about your comment on the EV strategy and sort of going on the offensive there. This is a bit of a nuance, but I think it's important. Is this sort of in response to what you're seeing in the marketplace in terms of fleet starting to shift in this direction?\n Or is this more you're seizing an opportunity because you see well the opportunity to kind of shape the market and create a customer and drive revenue in a new way in a market that looks like it's about to sort of evolve in the right direction? Is it kind of reactive or the opposite, is kind of -- is the question? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I think it's b, it's the opportunity side. Look, it's still super-duper early days, as you guys know. I think it's just one of those a-ha things, where you look at everything we've been doing for a couple of years. We've made a bunch of investments. We've reworked our system so that they can combine EV and combustion. And we've worked on network-building and contracts and all those kind of stuff.\n So we're doing all this stuff, right, in preparation of serving our clients. And then kind of out of the woodwork, a couple of non-fleet customers kind of poke their heads up and go, \"Hey, we need help on this stuff.\" We're like, wait a minute here, why are we just trying to make a good fleet transition, why don't we take advantage of the new needs that are being created given we have these new assets and stuff?\n So I think it was, honestly, like shame on me, shame on us. It was a bit of a-ha moment. But as I mentioned, we've also got a deal once we had that idea a few months ago. We've found someone that's been chasing that a bit, too. And so it's a super-duper way of hedging however this goes, right?\n If it goes slow, which is my bet, hey, so go slow. If it goes faster, we could have something that actually goes up. In the event that our other thing ticks down, which, again, we don't think much early days, but instead of people calling in, hey, look, it's sad times for fleet. Or maybe they go, holy moly, they're going to hold on to most or all of their fleet business and they're going to be beneficiaries of something new because of what they built. So maybe people are like, wow, are you saying it could be literally a net positive?\n Yes. That's what I'm trying say today is. And we're obviously going to provide way more info here when it's appropriate of who those customers are and what we're going to do and why it can be upside. But I'm telling you, we're super excited about it. \nRamsey El-Assal: That's great. So still quite early days, but you're laying the groundwork for whichever way it goes. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. And we're hearing from the people. I mean the other thing I want to make out is this isn't just Ron Clarke's brain turning alone in the night. There's actual prospective customers out there talking to us and taking on some of these things. So it's real, which is the other thing I want to make sure you hear. \nOperator: Your next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of Truist Securities. \nGus Gal\u00e1: It's Gus stepping on for Andrew. Just as we look at the cycle and you're kind of starting to see rising bad debt expense, is that safe to assume you reflect some late fees and overdue balances? And you commented that, that kind of happens with the higher new sales. Are you seeing the bad debt expense go up because of the existing client base as well? Just parsing that out would be very helpful. \nCharles Freund: Yes. This is Charles. So yes, bad debt came in higher, and part of that is due to fuel prices, right? So you have higher fuel prices equal higher customer balances. If they default, that's unfortunate.\n And then, yes, new sales tend to default at a much higher rate, right? So once we underwrite someone, if they stick with us for a couple of years, they tend to be okay. The first year though, we do see higher losses. So record sales last year and continued record sales in Q1 of this year are driving some of that.\n We do think as fuel prices will normalize throughout the course of the year, that bad debt will also normalize a bit down. But for this quarter, at $25.5 million, it came in a little hot. \nGus Gal\u00e1: Okay. Helpful. And following up, I want to ask about the efforts to drive sales force productivity and where we are in terms of the glide path of driving cross-sell Corpay into fuel. \nRonald F. Clarke: What was the first part? I missed the first part of the question. Can you just repeat the question again? I missed the first part of it. \nGus Gal\u00e1: Yes, sorry. I just wanted to ask you guys to talk a little bit about sales force productivity and kind of where we are in the glide path of driving cross-sell Corpay into fleet. \nRonald F. Clarke: Got it. So let me take the first part first, which is just sales productivity. It's numbers 1, 2 and 3 on my list and our list, right? The more we can sell from an absolute perspective and the more efficiently we can sell it obviously leads to profitable sales, profitable business. So it's a huge focus.\n I would say the 2 things that really help our aging, right, of our people-based assets, so as we have people in seats and people in territories long, they get more productive. So we've made huge strides with increasing the headcount in the last couple of years. So now, we're getting some benefit basically from that aging of the people side.\n And then on the digital side, it's a bit of a breeder reactor, right? The bigger the business gets, the smarter we get of how to match and who to put at in front of and how to bid and everything else. And so that business keeps getting better basically. We keep getting more effective at it because we keep getting smarter. As well, as you know, the Googles and stuff, index people that have successful things. So to the extent that we get better our organic portion or free portion, the digital selling gets higher.\n And so all of that, other than the inflation of people bidding more, is super positive. So not only are we in record production-of-sales land, we're also in a super attractive cost of sales as well.\n On the second part of the question, the Corpay cross-sell, I think I mentioned it in the last 90 days, we kind of paused selling the Corpay payable solution until we put the platform in. So what we started out doing, when we put the first couple thousand accounts, is we went to a Ron Clarke fuel card guy and said, \"Hey, we're giving you a new way to pay us, pay your bill to us. And here it is. Oh, you like it. And oh, by the way, you can pay some other bills.\"\n And we found out it was maybe a bit too much, hey, you're moving my cheese and now I pay the bills, now you're pitching me something else. And so we decided basically to do the first thing, put the platform in, make sure people are comfortable being able to pay us on this new platform, and then go back, which we plan to do in this quarter, in Q2. So I'm hoping to have a better update for you in terms of demand and stuff when we speak next time. \nOperator: Your next question is from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. \nMihir Bhatia: And maybe I'll just start with on the fuel -- in the fuel card and fleet business. Can you talk a little bit about just April trends? Obviously, there's been some chatter around freight recession and things like that. But what are you seeing in terms of freight miles driven? Are those holding up nicely? Any commentary about just what April looked like? \nCharles Freund: Yes. This is Charles. So in our over-the-road business, which would deal with big trucking, like you mentioned, we see a little bit of softness in that business. When I say a little bit of, in single -- low single digits. But it's -- what we hear is related to both driver shortages as well as now, the supply chain issues, some truck and/or trailer shortages. So yes, a little bit of softness there, but nothing material. \nMihir Bhatia: Got it. Okay. And then just in terms of -- I wanted to go back to your comments just about the guidance increasing. And I think if I followed it right, the fundamental improvement in the guide is, other than the first quarter beat, obviously, and excluding the macro and fuel, is like, what, [ $20 million, $25 million ].\n Are there particular segments that are driving that increase in terms of your expectations that maybe just growing -- grew faster than you had expected? Or do you think that they are going to be growing faster than you did at the start of the year? \nCharles Freund: Okay. Sure. So obviously, the benefit from the fuel pricing side, so most of the macro, you would see there. And also, in terms of the comeback in terms of COVID, we've seen a lot of that in the lodging space, which we expect will continue as pent-up demand for travel will help our airline lodging business. So we have a lot of sequential improvement expected in that business in particular. \nMihir Bhatia: Okay. And then just my last question. Just in terms of -- you mentioned sales force productivity or the inquiries increasing because of higher fuel prices. But just can you talk a little bit about just how you're managing the credit side of that, right?\n I mean some of the folks probably are coming to you just because of the stretch, they might have used up their other existing line on their other card or whatever method they use to pay, just looking to increase their available to borrow. So just can you talk about how you're managing the credit side of that? \nCharles Freund: Yes. So we are taking a look at policies and such. Generally, we'll underwrite to a full amount. And then as prices go up, folks will come and ask for increases in what we underwrite them. When we're underwriting someone new, we're looking at an amount, and if we can't cover all their volume, we do lose a bit of share of wallet in that regard.\n So we do watch it closely. It is an area where you can quite quickly monitor spending levels and such. So we get a good sense when someone comes on, are they good, are they performing, their fuel volumes tend to be pretty stable. And so as long as they're with us for a while, we'll feel more comfortable to kind of ride the prices up with them. But for new clients, it's pretty strict straight off the bat. There's an amount, if I can cover what you've got, great; if I can't, then we will have to share the wallet stuff in the early days. \nRonald F. Clarke: Hey, it's Ron. Let me just add on one other trick that works in the fuel card business, which is we change the payment cycle. So to your point, if we're getting a lot of digital stuff and it's not screening out as well, our approval rates aren't as good, one of the things we can do is effectively, like in trucking, move it to daily, daily, or in a local business, move it to weekly, weekly, net-5.\n So because of the turn in that kind of business and the usage and stuff, we do have a fair number of clients that are [ unsure of ] payment terms. So obviously, that's a way to Chuck's point, to still basically bring on customers but basically minimize, if you will, to limit the losses that we could incur. \nCharles Freund: In certain segments, where we don't feel comfortable, we'll push in the prepaid. \nOperator: Your next question is from Jeff Cantwell of Wells Fargo. \nJeffrey Cantwell: Maybe could you dig in somewhere in the cross-sell, meaning you were sort of talking about this earlier, but where are those opportunities developing, why are they developing? And maybe could you segment those out [ where I can ] dimensionalize them?\n [ I think I feel like a ] goal would be to have some sort of framework for thinking about how cross-sell revenue fits into our model. So I just want to see if we can think about cross-sell appropriately as it certainly seems like a nice opportunity for you. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, I'm not sure, this is Ron, by the way, I catch the thing that you're saying, hey, how do we as a company think about and measure the cross-sell opportunity. I think we kind of run through it that we go area by area. So in fuel cards, our idea is Corporate Payments, so we sell companion cards in there. We're selling bill pay in there. In our toll business, I mentioned before, we're selling fueling. I mentioned we sold -- generated 1.7 million transactions in the quarter. We're now starting to sell insurance.\n In our lodging business, obviously, we've added cards that allow the same client that buys lodging to buy air or other kinds of travel. It's not lodging. And so in every -- virtually in every business we have, because we've gotten bigger and we have more products now, we're taking those related products back to the group that we have. And I guess, we could report out, Jim, if it's interesting, kind of what those sales or revenues add up to, where people are interested.\n But I would say we're making pretty good progress on most of them. I did say we paused the Corpay payables one to get people on the platform first. But look, we have 800,000 customers now spending hundreds of millions with us, so obviously -- hundreds of billions. So we got plenty of opportunity to sell products back. \nJeffrey Cantwell: Okay. That's great color. And then might I ask if you could do the same for your new wins, how many new card wins did you see you had this quarter? And could you provide any color on what you think is driving them?\n I guess if you think back to the last year, the year before, does anything stand out about now, about why you're winning versus previously? Just curious if you could give us some color. And I guess, the follow-up would be, are they sizable? Any sort of dimensions to that would be great as well. \nCharles Freund: Yes. This is Charles. So I think you're on the new client wins. I think Ron mentioned we had 50,000 in the quarter, new clients. A lot of them tend to be small, digitally acquired, a lot of them in our fuel base. When we get to the Corporate Payments arena, we do sell more in the mid-market, so as they are larger clients and such. So it does really depend on the business that you're in. In Brazil, we sell, lots of consumers, tags and such. So it depends.\n We are still in the main, selling individual products to a prospect. We're not really bundling yet. And that's one of the big opportunities, that Ron was mentioning it before, as around the platform.\n So as we build out the platform, and it has multiple products in it, once we sell it in, then people can then turn on that additional functionality. But we haven't been doing that as of late. So a lot of the new wins that you're seeing is really a function of just better sales performance and a lot coming through digital channels. \nJeffrey Cantwell: Okay. And congrats on the results. \nOperator: Your next question is from Pete Christiansen of Citi. \nPeter Christiansen: I wanted to ask, Ron, you called out some really nice wins in the fuel card space here, some large deals. Just wondering if you could provide some color on how you're seeing RFP activity these days, maybe looking out the next quarter or so, looking for large deals. Are you seeing healthy activity in that area? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I don't think it's anything, Pete, out of the ordinary. I would say, in the larger accounts, which we call out because we had 50,000 new accounts, that -- [ with our Board to take the rest of the call ] to run through those names. I would say that enterprise and partners, they run on cycles, they're under contract with us or someone else, and they come up.\n And so no, no super change, I think, in that rate. I do think there's some kind of newish or different kinds of stuff, like that Amazon thing that I mentioned, so there's some different kinds of players a bit, the same a little bit on the EV side. So that would be the one difference. I think some of the new business that's out there is just a little bit different in terms of the type of business it is. \nPeter Christiansen: Interesting. And then I was just curious how you're thinking about utilizing some of the macro upside that you've been enjoying. Obviously, you're getting a lot more inbound activity with higher fuel prices, just in general. But in terms of dedicating more spend, variable spend to digital marketing, things like that, versus perhaps letting some of that flow to the bottom line, just wondering if your calculus has changed there, if you're thinking about anything differently at this juncture. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, that's a good question. So I would say not a lot. So a couple of reasons. One is we already fed the army here a bit, if you will. I think we said at the beginning that we gave -- because we could get a profit target this year, more expense growth than normal, particularly in sales and IT, so one, I think our initial guide [ and other guides still a ] decent amount in it.\n Two is I don't love the uncertainty of 2/3 of the upside being the planet. The planet can shift around and refactor on us some. And so I don't like to spend money that I can 100% count on, so that would be number two. But with that, I would say you hit the one area.\n If there was one area where we would and do plan to spend a bit more, it would be in digital selling. And the reason is, you can. Unlike some of the other things that take way longer to build, right, and prepare and to get into the market, the head digital guy can walk down to my office and say, \"Look, we're getting twice the things. Do you want to spend another $2 million, $3 million this month?\" So because it's sales, which is great for the future, and because you can do it quickly, that would be the one area, Pete, that we would step on the gas. \nOperator: Your next question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. \nDavid Togut: I have 2. First up, Ron, when looking at the 19% growth in Corporate Payments, could you talk through what were the strongest growth verticals in the quarter? And then based on the new business signings that you saw, what would you expect to be kind of the highest growth verticals within Corporate Payments going forward?\n And then the second question, looking at the 18% revenue growth in the tolls business, is it possible to break down the growth contribution of that 18% between toll tags and transaction growth? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. So let me -- anyway, good to hear from you, David. So let me take the first thing. So when you refer to verticals, I don't know if you're referring to the customer verticals or the products, but let me try to answer both. So on the kind of product line side, what we call the full AP or full outsourcing, is obviously going, right, great. It's grown over 50%. So obviously, well above the line average. And the good news, which you implied, is it also represented half of our sales, so a much larger part of our new sales than it does of our revenue, obviously, which is why it's growing faster.\n And then on the customer side, I would say we're just going gangbusters in the construction vertical. That vertical has come back. It's super healthy, at least here in the United States. We've got a  super great position in terms of partners, the accounting and ERP partners. We've got a great merchant network. And so the sales and the interest from that channel is just at record levels for us.  Doesn't mean we're not selling in other places too, but that one's going great. Do you, Chuck, want to take the -- David's second question? \nCharles Freund: Yes. I think if you were to look at even in our exhibits to the financials, you'll see the 18% growth in tolls, 5% tag growth, and then our revenue per tag is up 12. And so part of that is pricing adjustments we make. Some of that is inflation in the country, which we can pass on to the cardholders. And a little bit of it is some of the MDR that we're getting from some of these non-toll-related purchases, like parking or fast food or fuel.\n It's still a fairly small piece. But as we build out, particularly the fuel network, we expect it to be much more in the next couple of years. \nRonald F. Clarke: But David, hey, I know you've been excited with this one. So I'll share a little bit of the forward view. So I called out 1.7 million transactions. So the guy that runs that business has a bet with me, that it will be 10 million-plus for the year.\n And so the thing has gone from, hey, it's an idea here, let's see how we go, to really exiting, [ even really, they're growing like weed ] during this year and exiting at some kind of crazy level. And we plan to double again next year the accepting sites. We have the same 6 million vehicles or tag holders. So it's a little too early to say mission accomplished, but that thing is really working now. \nOperator: Your next question is from George Mihalos of Cowen. \nGeorgios Mihalos: Let me add my congrats on the quarter. I guess first question, Charles, if we just look at the updated guidance, you're taking revenues up 5% higher than where they were previously. The adjusted net income, that's going up about 2 points, so there's a bit of a differential.\n Can you just kind of bridge that gap for us? I assume one of them had -- or part of that is going to be interest expense, but maybe what else is maybe weighing down some of the growth in the adjusted net income relative to the better revenue outlook? \nCharles Freund: Yes, so you hit the nail in the head. Definitely, interest expense will be going up. The other one is our tax rate. So in the first half of this year, we are still getting some benefit from stock option exercises of some very low-priced stock options that are actually expiring in Q2. So we don't see that we'll get that benefit in the second half. And so that, of course, changed the flow-through. \nRonald F. Clarke: And George, it's Ron. Let me just add to that. It's all below the line, so the $100 million of kind of upside from our initial guide, right, rest of year, hey, why isn't it flowing through. At the EBITDA line, our rest of year will be up a couple of points from our Q1 print. So we will get operating leverage down there. It's all the 2 things Chuck just said. I mean it's a [ whopper ] forecast we have on interest expense. I mean who knows.\n But we put in, I think chuck has it in the back up there, some obviously massive increase as we run through the year in interest expense, and then a tax rate, again, that's high, I mean, on $1.3 billion or $1.4 billion of cash, PBT, every point or 2 is big. And so we're losing it in just in those 2 things. But I want to make sure with people here, that the operating leverage line, that thing is flowing through. It's going to be way better than Q1. \nGeorgios Mihalos: Okay. That's great. That's exactly what I was getting at. So I really appreciate that color. And then... \nRonald F. Clarke: [ And if you can work on even the ] interest rates down, that would help us, too. \nGeorgios Mihalos: Fair point. That might be a bit tough to do. Just to close out that point, how many rate increases are you factoring in now to this increased interest expense guidance? Congrats on the quarter. \nCharles Freund: Yes. So we gave kind of a forward curve on fuel prices. Let me give you the forward curve that we're using for the interest expense. We're looking at LIBOR equivalent of 83 bps in Q2, 159 bps in Q3 and 221 bps in Q4. \nOperator: Your next question is from Trevor Williams of Jefferies. \nTrevor Williams: And I had another question on the guide as well and more just on the macro assumptions you have underpinning and particularly in fuel. Just in terms of underlying volumes, are you guys assuming the rest of the year follows kind of normal pre-COVID seasonal trends? And then is there any notable callouts just on what you're assuming? Any differences between the U.S. and Europe and then the U.K. within Europe, in particular? \nCharles Freund: I would say, in terms of volumes, we've seen more of a recovery in Europe because they were more in the ditch, and we've seen a bit of a bounce back also in Australia with fuel volumes. But going forward, we don't have a lot of COVID-related recovery, so it would follow kind of normal seasonality.\n And the fuel prices assumptions as we outlined them, they really don't change anything in terms of our volume. It will change demand for the product, as Ron mentioned, digitally. But our customers have to drive for work or they have to make the deliveries, they have to make the service calls, et cetera, et cetera. So the pricing doesn't really matter. But yes, volumes should fall kind of in a normal seasonal course. \nTrevor Williams: Okay. Perfect. And then on capital allocation, it looks like the updated full year guide isn't embedding anything additional on buybacks. Just, Ron, any update just in terms of how you're thinking about capital allocation priorities between buybacks, I mean, the debt paydown potentially with where rates are going, M&A? Any help there just on your framework for how you're thinking about it. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. You got it. So no is the answer to the first question. We provide guidance basically with a 100% delevering assumption because unless we do something, that is what we do. It's the default. So that's what's in the forward guide.\n I would say really unchanged. Our first course is always M&A. If we have assets that we can dramatically improve or add meaningful capabilities, that's our first and highest use of capital. But looking at the FLT stock price today, you can imagine that my interest in buying FLT stock is high. So clearly, I don't know if Chuck has put it out there, we've got $1 billion-something in our current facilities generating, whatever, a few hundred million more a quarter.\n So we've got, obviously, a lot of liquidity to spend. So my guess is both will happen. There will be some transactions we'll try to get done. At these prices, we are buyers of our stock. And so it's likely, if we're sitting here 9 months from today, they will have done some of both of those things. \nOperator: And your next question is from Ken Suchoski of Autonomous Research. \nKenneth Suchoski: I wanted to ask about the lodging segment because I don't think we've touched on it yet, and there were some decent growth there. There's a lot of noise trying to track the recovery relative to pre-COVID levels, just given the acquisitions over the last few years. But I was wondering how -- if things fully normalize to pre-COVID levels, where would that lodging business be in terms of revenue and/or room nights? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Hey, Ken, it's Ron. It's a good question. So you're right, whatever it is, the 60% print is happiness everywhere, right? It's a deal getting into the insurance vertical. It's the recovery of our airline segment there, right, as airline travel and flights have come back. And it's also our core workforce space. Our clients have gotten healthier and done more driving kinds of travel. So all 3 happy things are happening in the base.\n I would say that that's, again, a high-teens business for us. If you said, \"Hey, you get through this and you get to kind of some normal baseline or normal comp, the market potential is enormous in all 3 of those.\"\n Obviously, the airline business is global. We just bought a little software company that we think is going to be incredibly helpful to some of those global airline sales. So the prospects we look way harder now in taking the core workforce product and launching it in Europe. We finally have an idea of how to do that to increase the TAM. So the prospects for that thing are great. It's the lowest as [ MMC ] in the company, which means we sell new business more efficiently there than any other line of business in the company. The margins in the business are super-duper good. So we love the business. \nKenneth Suchoski: Great. That's really helpful. And maybe just as my follow-up question. There's a lot of competitors on the AP automation side of the business. Your full AP business continues to grow really quickly. Can you just talk about what you're seeing on the RFP side? Are they getting more crowded? Or are we still early days of that adoption curve? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I think it's mostly b. You're right. There's more people and more products. But as you laid out, the game is distribution. And the game is networks. Just to remind everybody, the products don't work if you can't monetize, if the cards don't monetize. Otherwise, you're relegated to a software fee.\n And so we just love -- I've said this a million times, is we -- maybe we don't have the world's greatest, but we got a pretty good product. And we have a couple of things that the new guys, right, don't, which is kind of proven, aged, distribution, that can create pressure on the marketplace. And we've got a 10-year-old merchant network, right, that accepts these purchasing and virtual cards.\n And so we're able to actually process and create economics. So we still -- I still feel like we've got a big advantage in the offer, but mostly, what you said, that it's just kind of -- it's just white space. It's just lots of companies are on kind of an old, just join a kind of clunky model. And what we and other people have is certainly way better than what they're doing. And so that group will win some share. But as I mentioned, we're selling a lot. So we're winning share.\n So again, I hope I can make this point, but we want to be in the disruptor. We're kind of the new guy, still taking the business from kind of the old method, so we want to join these other people, basically that you guys see as disrupting, and put us in the bucket of trying to go get that business. So that's our view of it. \nOperator: No more questions. Please continue. \nRonald F. Clarke: Thanks for joining us today. Let us know if you need anything else. So have a nice evening. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call, and thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Charles Freund",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Ron. So before digging into the financial results, I would like to make sure that you were all aware of the new investor deck we posted on our website a few weeks ago. In there, we tried to simplify how we talk about the company.\n At its core, FLEETCOR provides a set of corporate payment solutions to help businesses reduce spend. Now we do it in 2 ways, one, by enabling and controlling what's purchased. We call this expense management, and it comes in a few flavors, like fuel, tolls and lodging.\n Or two, by enabling controls after the purchase, but before the payments have been made. We call this AP payments, where we provide the options businesses have to make their payments, such as online bill pay, full AP outsourcing, virtual cards and cross-border. So when you think of it this way, the company really does only 2 things, expense management and AP payments in a couple different ways.\n So with that context, let's look at some more detail on the quarter. As Ron mentioned, we posted an impressive 30% growth quarter, including 15% organic growth, which I'll get into in more detail in a moment. About 10% or $58 million of the growth was due to acquisitions we made last year, and about 3% or $21 million came from macro tailwinds.\n Speaking of macro, fuel prices were $3.88 per gallon for the quarter, higher than our $3.40 guidance assumption based on January levels. Higher fuel prices contributed about $22 million of additional revenues versus prior year.\n Now we exited the quarter with fuel prices at around $4.50 per gallon.  We do think this will moderate some over the balance of the year. Fuel spreads in the quarter had a positive impact of about $5 million. And we had a $6 million negative impact due to lower foreign exchange rates as unfavorable movements in European currencies, which affect our cross-border and fuel business, more than offset the strength of the Brazilian reals that helps our toll revenue.\n Now moving to organic growth, starting with AP payments. Our corporate payables were up 23%, and that was led by full AP outsourcing, which was up over 50% yet again driven by continuing strong new sales. Cross-border was up 17%, and that's normalized for the AFEX acquisition. The cross-border team had a great quarter as new sales remained strong and activity recovered in Australia.\n And moving on to our expense management solutions. Fuel was up organically, 14%, as new sales growth of 25% and higher same-store sales of 3% to 4% continued to drive the performance. I may sound like a broken record on this, but we continue to see fantastic results from our digital marketing and customer acquisition efforts across this business.\n Tolls were up 18% compared with last year as the business just continues to perform. New sales are solid and retention initiatives are showing to be quite effective as we highlight the differentiated value proposition we offer versus our competitors.\n Lodging continued to perform well too, up 22%. Our workforce lodging business has improved with higher new sales and better volumes. Airlines again outperformed, with organic growth over 65%. In the quarter, we did announce the purchase of Levarti, an airline software platform company. The deal is immaterial to our financials, but we believe the software, combined with our lodging solution, will drive more sales in the airline vertical.\n Now looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses of $472 million represented a 38% increase over prior year primarily due to the addition of the AFEX and ALE operations, increases tied to higher volumes across our businesses, incremental bad debt, stock compensation and new sales generation activities and investments to drive future growth.\n Bad debt expense was $25.5 million or 6 basis points as bad debt levels have returned to more historical levels as customer spend increases with higher fuel prices and as a result of much stronger new sales, which tend to have a higher loss rate.\n The EBITDA margin in the quarter was 50% as higher stock comp and bad debt expenses negatively impacted the margin. This was largely expected as the company took actions to stimulate growth coming out of the COVID environment. We still expect our full year EBITDA margin to be in line with our original expectations of 52% as margins expand throughout the year, along with revenue growth and the increased benefit of synergy realization from acquisitions.\n Interest expense decreased 23% year-over-year driven by the effect of a $1 billion fixed rate swap that matured in January and the benefit of higher interest income earned on customer deposits and cash balances in certain foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% versus 22% last year, with the increase driven primarily by less excess tax benefit on stock option exercises and higher interest income on foreign deposits, which are taxed at a higher rate.\n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with over $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash. And we had $969 million available on our revolver. There was $4.9 billion outstanding on our credit facilities. And we had $1.4 billion borrowed in our securitization facility.\n As of March 31, our leverage ratio was 2.72x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.\n In the quarter, we upsized our securitization facility to $1.6 billion in order to accommodate higher receivables balances due to higher fuel prices. We intend to maximize the use of the facility given that it is the lowest cost of capital funding instrument that we have.\n We repurchased roughly 1.8 million shares, 1.1 million of which were completed under our 10b5 plan that we had in place in January, and which were included in our original guidance. We still have $1.23 billion authorized for repurchase. And we believe we have ample liquidity to pursue any near-term M&A opportunities and continue to buy back shares when it makes sense.\n Ron has covered our full year guidance updates. So now, let me share some thoughts on our Q2 outlook and our assumptions.\n For Q2, we're expecting revenue to be between $805 million and $825 million and adjusted net income per share to be between $3.80 and $3.90, which, at the midpoint, is approximately $0.70 or 22% higher than what we reported in Q2 of 2021.\n Regarding our guidance assumptions, we are using $3.90 as our fuel price assumption for the rest of the year. This reflects fuel prices of $4.25, $3.85 and $3.65 for the next 3 quarters, respectively. Clearly, we don't expect fuel prices to remain at the current elevated levels, so we're using this forward curve as the basis of our forecast.\n Our interest expense guidance of $105 million to $115 million is based off of a LIBOR average of 154 basis points for April through December. Our original assumption had LIBOR of 54 basis points for that same period. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement.\n I would note that our rest of year guidance expectations do still include revenue and adjusted earnings per share from our fuel business in Russia, which are $67 million and $0.63, respectively, for the remainder of the year.\n Moving away from the results and outlook, I would like to thank our circa 10,000 employees around the world who helped us deliver a fantastic start to 2022 and who will be the driving force as we continue to grow our company. Thank you for your interest in FLEETCOR.\n And now, operator, we'll open the line for questions. Yes. This is Charles. So yes, bad debt came in higher, and part of that is due to fuel prices, right? So you have higher fuel prices equal higher customer balances. If they default, that's unfortunate.\n And then, yes, new sales tend to default at a much higher rate, right? So once we underwrite someone, if they stick with us for a couple of years, they tend to be okay. The first year though, we do see higher losses. So record sales last year and continued record sales in Q1 of this year are driving some of that.\n We do think as fuel prices will normalize throughout the course of the year, that bad debt will also normalize a bit down. But for this quarter, at $25.5 million, it came in a little hot. \nGus Gala\u0301: Okay. Helpful. And following up, I want to ask about the efforts to drive sales force productivity and where we are in terms of the glide path of driving cross-sell Corpay into fuel. Yes. This is Charles. So in our over-the-road business, which would deal with big trucking, like you mentioned, we see a little bit of softness in that business. When I say a little bit of, in single -- low single digits. But it's -- what we hear is related to both driver shortages as well as now, the supply chain issues, some truck and/or trailer shortages. So yes, a little bit of softness there, but nothing material. Okay. Sure. So obviously, the benefit from the fuel pricing side, so most of the macro, you would see there. And also, in terms of the comeback in terms of COVID, we've seen a lot of that in the lodging space, which we expect will continue as pent-up demand for travel will help our airline lodging business. So we have a lot of sequential improvement expected in that business in particular. Yes. So we are taking a look at policies and such. Generally, we'll underwrite to a full amount. And then as prices go up, folks will come and ask for increases in what we underwrite them. When we're underwriting someone new, we're looking at an amount, and if we can't cover all their volume, we do lose a bit of share of wallet in that regard.\n So we do watch it closely. It is an area where you can quite quickly monitor spending levels and such. So we get a good sense when someone comes on, are they good, are they performing, their fuel volumes tend to be pretty stable. And so as long as they're with us for a while, we'll feel more comfortable to kind of ride the prices up with them. But for new clients, it's pretty strict straight off the bat. There's an amount, if I can cover what you've got, great; if I can't, then we will have to share the wallet stuff in the early days. In certain segments, where we don't feel comfortable, we'll push in the prepaid. Yes. This is Charles. So I think you're on the new client wins. I think Ron mentioned we had 50,000 in the quarter, new clients. A lot of them tend to be small, digitally acquired, a lot of them in our fuel base. When we get to the Corporate Payments arena, we do sell more in the mid-market, so as they are larger clients and such. So it does really depend on the business that you're in. In Brazil, we sell, lots of consumers, tags and such. So it depends.\n We are still in the main, selling individual products to a prospect. We're not really bundling yet. And that's one of the big opportunities, that Ron was mentioning it before, as around the platform.\n So as we build out the platform, and it has multiple products in it, once we sell it in, then people can then turn on that additional functionality. But we haven't been doing that as of late. So a lot of the new wins that you're seeing is really a function of just better sales performance and a lot coming through digital channels. Yes. I think if you were to look at even in our exhibits to the financials, you'll see the 18% growth in tolls, 5% tag growth, and then our revenue per tag is up 12. And so part of that is pricing adjustments we make. Some of that is inflation in the country, which we can pass on to the cardholders. And a little bit of it is some of the MDR that we're getting from some of these non-toll-related purchases, like parking or fast food or fuel.\n It's still a fairly small piece. But as we build out, particularly the fuel network, we expect it to be much more in the next couple of years. Yes, so you hit the nail in the head. Definitely, interest expense will be going up. The other one is our tax rate. So in the first half of this year, we are still getting some benefit from stock option exercises of some very low-priced stock options that are actually expiring in Q2. So we don't see that we'll get that benefit in the second half. And so that, of course, changed the flow-through. Yes. So we gave kind of a forward curve on fuel prices. Let me give you the forward curve that we're using for the interest expense. We're looking at LIBOR equivalent of 83 bps in Q2, 159 bps in Q3 and 221 bps in Q4. I would say, in terms of volumes, we've seen more of a recovery in Europe because they were more in the ditch, and we've seen a bit of a bounce back also in Australia with fuel volumes. But going forward, we don't have a lot of COVID-related recovery, so it would follow kind of normal seasonality.\n And the fuel prices assumptions as we outlined them, they really don't change anything in terms of our volume. It will change demand for the product, as Ron mentioned, digitally. But our customers have to drive for work or they have to make the deliveries, they have to make the service calls, et cetera, et cetera. So the pricing doesn't really matter. But yes, volumes should fall kind of in a normal seasonal course."

            "name": "Ronald F. Clarke",
            "content": "Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q1 2022 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects: so first, give you my take on Q1; second, lay out our updated rest of year 2022 guidance; third, and I'll give you a brief update on our Russia business; and then lastly, I'll share some new things, some good things happening in the company.\n Okay. Let me make the turn to our Q1 results. Terrific. Really, really great performance. We reported revenue of $789 million, up 30%, and cash EPS of $365 million, up 29%.\n Revenue came in very strong, about $40 million above our Q1 midpoint guide, with only $12 million of that beat macro-related. So a lot of very good fundamental overperformance in the quarter.\n Organic growth overall, 15% for Q1, and each of our 4 major lines of business, all growing organically double-digits. Trends in Q1, excellent. Sales, up 39% versus last year. We added about 50,000 new clients to the fold, sold in Q1, and over 50% of all of our new global fuel card clients came to us digitally. So a terrific sales quarter.\n A steady revenue retention of 93% and healthy same-store sales for the quarter at plus 7%. So Q1, really one of the best quarterly performances that I can recall.\n All right. Let me shift to our updated rest of year 2022 guidance. So first off, we're expecting a bit of a mixed macro rest of year. So on the positive side, our clients are healthier, spending more, which we can see in the volumes. Fuel prices are at record levels. And the Brazil currency has rebounded some since the start of the year.\n On the not-so-good side, we're outlooking higher interest expense, really depending on the pace of the rate hikes and likely higher bad debt expense. The real wildcard, we think, for rest of year is the Brazil FX, as it's continued to be quite volatile year-to-date.\n Fortunately, we're enjoying pretty strong fundamentals exiting Q1. We've got healthy volumes. We've got record sales. We've got steady retention, so all the things that set up well for us for the rest of year.\n So with that, we're revising our 2022 full year guidance today up as follows. So revenue to $3.360 billion at the midpoint. That's up $140 million. And cash EPS of $15.60. That's up $0.35 from our initial guide. So a much stronger full year 2022 outlook today than we had 90 days ago.\n Assuming we achieve today's guidance, it would imply full year '22 revenue growth of 19% and full year '22 cash EPS growth of 18%. So that would be back-to-back years post-COVID, 2021 and 2022, in which FLEETCOR would compound earnings by 18%.\n I do want to remind everyone, we are outlooking still meaningful sequential improvement in the guide as we run through the year, with our Q4 revenue expected to be up about $90 million versus our Q1 print.\n Okay. Let me shift gears and give you just a brief update on our Russia business. So I'll start by reminding you that Russia represents a very small part of the company, about 3% of revenue. So on a 2022 annualized basis, Russia will contribute about $85 million in revenue and approximately $0.77 in cash EPS.\n The Russia business is really a pure fleet card business. It runs very stand-alone. And we employ about 600 local employees. As you can imagine, we've been quite busy since the start of the conflict. We've been taking actions to derisk the business. We've been complying with the ever-evolving sanctions. And we've continued to weigh the various options that we have.\n We're certainly being super cautious to take care of the well-being of our employees. So look, we'll continue to keep you updated as the situation evolves.\n Okay. So last up today, I would like to run through some good things that are happening in the company. So first, some new wins. So we've got a fair number of notable new wins and client renewals in the quarter. So just a couple of examples. Speedway, one of our largest North America retail partners, recently extended their relationship with us, delighted with that.\n Amazon awarded us their middle-mile trucking fleet, which has grown like a weed. We won the Eclipx fleet leasing business contract in Australia, a pretty big piece of business for us in the region.\n Second, cross-sell, we really like the cross-sell opportunity in front of us. We're still exploring selling our Corporate Payment products into our fuel card base. And we're progressing selling our add-ons to our toll customers. You've heard us talk about selling fueling. We're also testing now selling insurance and even lodging. We did reach 1.7 million add-on fueling transactions in the quarter to our total customer base, so progressing quite well.\n Third, EV, we're going on offense. We've talked previously about building capabilities to serve our fleet use case and protect the customers we have and the revenue we have. We've now identified a couple of new customer segments that we can repurpose, we think, our EV assets, like our network too, and generate incremental revenue beyond the fleet business. So potentially here, some incremental revenue upside to the energy transition.\n And lastly, we had our off-site, growth off-site meeting, last month and set the internal goal of selling 1 billion of new business annually within the forecast period. So pretty excited to aspire to $1 billion in new business. We've concluded we have the product set now and the TAM to do it, and we think we've built the marketing, credit and digital underlying capabilities to do it. So super excited about chasing a bigger number.\n So look, taken together, new wins, cross-sell opportunities, EV on offense and selling more, pretty exciting for us.\n So look, in conclusion, today, just a few final thoughts. So one, our Q1 results were terrific, clearly better than we had expected. Our rest of year or full year 2022 performance, expected to be much better than we envisioned 90 days ago, and lots of good things, new things happening in the company. So all in all, we're in a pretty good place. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter. Chuck? Hey, Tien-Tsin, good to hear your voice, too. So simplistically, the $140 million would be $40 million in Q1, $100 million rest of year and called out: 1/3, real performance; 2/3, macro health. Yes, really good question. So yes, particularly on the fuel, fleet side. And the thing that's interesting is that you think the higher fuel prices obviously help us from a revenue perspective, right, in terms of MDR, but they actually help in sales. So literally, there was a period the digital guys came down and we had said that, I think it was in March, the volumes, the search volumes were running about 2x kind of our normalized level of kind of inbound. So our sales in that business were super good in Q1, and we had taken up the forecast rest of year.\n So again, I said it repeatedly, it's the single best indicator, [ tension ] for the business, right? If we can grow compound sales somewhere in the 20s, right, when we're trying to compound revenue double-digit, obviously, that improves, right? If we get to that number and don't have COVID again, obviously, the revenue will accelerate. Hey, Jeff, it's Ron. So I don't want to give too much away, but I would say there was an a-ha moment where we were taking stock of the assets that we're building, particularly the ability to capture, right, the EV data and then the network, the public network, getting acceptance, and the ability to settle there.\n And up until very recently, our whole focus has been, hey, serving basically our card fleet customers or prospective fleet customers with this. And all of a sudden, 2 or 3 other interesting customer segments liked what we have. And so that's the headline. They're non-fleet kinds of customers that need help in EV. And so the assets that we built for one purpose, we think, are pretty transferable to the other.\n And then, b, we've actually got a pretty interesting target sitting in our M&A pipeline that would be supportive of that, that would accelerate our move there. So the real headline is we've just opened our eyes to how to basically serve a greater set of people in the ecosystem and hopefully generate incremental revenue. Yes. I mean the headline on that one is it's just so nascent. I know that you guys have some theme of, hey, the disruptor theory and there's lots of new people doing lots of new things, which is true. But I try to remind people, Jeff, that's us. We're the new guys that have less than 1% of that TAM. And it's fundamentally the banks that have most of what we call the Corporate Payments business.\n So it is a -- it's a massive set of payables basically to get digitized, and it's held adversely with the banks. And so it's, I think, it's a food frenzy really for all of us that are bringing something new, and I'm hopeful the other guys that are new can get something, too. But the real competition for us is the -- are the current people, the current providers. So it's super wide open for us. Hey, Sanjay, it's Ron. I would say really uncertain, right, how that ball is going to bounce. We're doing lots of things, as you can imagine, exploring everything, right, selling it, transferring it, doing all kinds of things. So ballpark, I think we're carrying circa around $300 million on our books. So to the extent that the thing were shuttered and there was now complete loss, that's kind of ballparking what the number is.\n So look, I don't know where it's going to go. We've obviously got some ideas of how we're running the thing differently and cutting ties obviously with the business a bit back here to the mother ship. And so it's really more of a wait and see. We're going to obviously continue to explore whether there's buyers that are interested in the business and honestly, just see how the conflict steps along here. Yes. I think it's mixed, is what I would say. Obviously, we're always working a pipeline, no different today. We've got 3 or 4 things. And I would say, as I run through those, some of them are later-stage. Some of the sellers haven't moved a lot. We point out, [ hey, you watching ] like even today some of the comp groups.\n And so I would say some people are just, I think, kind of staying put, maybe going to wait to see if things come back. And then I would say, [ there's ] a couple of newer things that we've negotiated, let's say, in the last couple of months. We've been able to agree to prices that we like, that work for us. So I would say, it's interesting, but it's kind of mixed. Not everybody has reset, but I think some people have. Yes. Hey, Ramsey, it's Ron. I would say everything in there worked. The sales were good. We did get a bit of recovery in the base in that business. We talked about some of the clients getting healthier. And for sure, I don't know if we called it out before, but we have a bit of a, what we call, a multi-card business in there that's not only purchasing, but it does pick up some travel. So like others, we got some decent amount of add-back.\n The full AP thing is warring, was still 50%-plus up in the quarter. And despite eating a giant cross-border business, not that long ago, the cross-border business was also better than we thought. Mostly Australia, so that business originates really in 4 markets for us, but one of which is Australia. And it was, when I say in the ditch, I mean, it was super in the ditch in '21.\n So it's really, I would say, some fair amount of underlying health in Australia cross-border, in the multi-card business and then really just, again, super-duper sales. So kind of all working there. Yes. I think it's b, it's the opportunity side. Look, it's still super-duper early days, as you guys know. I think it's just one of those a-ha things, where you look at everything we've been doing for a couple of years. We've made a bunch of investments. We've reworked our system so that they can combine EV and combustion. And we've worked on network-building and contracts and all those kind of stuff.\n So we're doing all this stuff, right, in preparation of serving our clients. And then kind of out of the woodwork, a couple of non-fleet customers kind of poke their heads up and go, \"Hey, we need help on this stuff.\" We're like, wait a minute here, why are we just trying to make a good fleet transition, why don't we take advantage of the new needs that are being created given we have these new assets and stuff?\n So I think it was, honestly, like shame on me, shame on us. It was a bit of a-ha moment. But as I mentioned, we've also got a deal once we had that idea a few months ago. We've found someone that's been chasing that a bit, too. And so it's a super-duper way of hedging however this goes, right?\n If it goes slow, which is my bet, hey, so go slow. If it goes faster, we could have something that actually goes up. In the event that our other thing ticks down, which, again, we don't think much early days, but instead of people calling in, hey, look, it's sad times for fleet. Or maybe they go, holy moly, they're going to hold on to most or all of their fleet business and they're going to be beneficiaries of something new because of what they built. So maybe people are like, wow, are you saying it could be literally a net positive?\n Yes. That's what I'm trying say today is. And we're obviously going to provide way more info here when it's appropriate of who those customers are and what we're going to do and why it can be upside. But I'm telling you, we're super excited about it. Yes. And we're hearing from the people. I mean the other thing I want to make out is this isn't just Ron Clarke's brain turning alone in the night. There's actual prospective customers out there talking to us and taking on some of these things. So it's real, which is the other thing I want to make sure you hear. What was the first part? I missed the first part of the question. Can you just repeat the question again? I missed the first part of it. \nGus Gala\u0301: Yes, sorry. I just wanted to ask you guys to talk a little bit about sales force productivity and kind of where we are in the glide path of driving cross-sell Corpay into fleet. Got it. So let me take the first part first, which is just sales productivity. It's numbers 1, 2 and 3 on my list and our list, right? The more we can sell from an absolute perspective and the more efficiently we can sell it obviously leads to profitable sales, profitable business. So it's a huge focus.\n I would say the 2 things that really help our aging, right, of our people-based assets, so as we have people in seats and people in territories long, they get more productive. So we've made huge strides with increasing the headcount in the last couple of years. So now, we're getting some benefit basically from that aging of the people side.\n And then on the digital side, it's a bit of a breeder reactor, right? The bigger the business gets, the smarter we get of how to match and who to put at in front of and how to bid and everything else. And so that business keeps getting better basically. We keep getting more effective at it because we keep getting smarter. As well, as you know, the Googles and stuff, index people that have successful things. So to the extent that we get better our organic portion or free portion, the digital selling gets higher.\n And so all of that, other than the inflation of people bidding more, is super positive. So not only are we in record production-of-sales land, we're also in a super attractive cost of sales as well.\n On the second part of the question, the Corpay cross-sell, I think I mentioned it in the last 90 days, we kind of paused selling the Corpay payable solution until we put the platform in. So what we started out doing, when we put the first couple thousand accounts, is we went to a Ron Clarke fuel card guy and said, \"Hey, we're giving you a new way to pay us, pay your bill to us. And here it is. Oh, you like it. And oh, by the way, you can pay some other bills.\"\n And we found out it was maybe a bit too much, hey, you're moving my cheese and now I pay the bills, now you're pitching me something else. And so we decided basically to do the first thing, put the platform in, make sure people are comfortable being able to pay us on this new platform, and then go back, which we plan to do in this quarter, in Q2. So I'm hoping to have a better update for you in terms of demand and stuff when we speak next time. Hey, it's Ron. Let me just add on one other trick that works in the fuel card business, which is we change the payment cycle. So to your point, if we're getting a lot of digital stuff and it's not screening out as well, our approval rates aren't as good, one of the things we can do is effectively, like in trucking, move it to daily, daily, or in a local business, move it to weekly, weekly, net-5.\n So because of the turn in that kind of business and the usage and stuff, we do have a fair number of clients that are [ unsure of ] payment terms. So obviously, that's a way to Chuck's point, to still basically bring on customers but basically minimize, if you will, to limit the losses that we could incur. Yes, I'm not sure, this is Ron, by the way, I catch the thing that you're saying, hey, how do we as a company think about and measure the cross-sell opportunity. I think we kind of run through it that we go area by area. So in fuel cards, our idea is Corporate Payments, so we sell companion cards in there. We're selling bill pay in there. In our toll business, I mentioned before, we're selling fueling. I mentioned we sold -- generated 1.7 million transactions in the quarter. We're now starting to sell insurance.\n In our lodging business, obviously, we've added cards that allow the same client that buys lodging to buy air or other kinds of travel. It's not lodging. And so in every -- virtually in every business we have, because we've gotten bigger and we have more products now, we're taking those related products back to the group that we have. And I guess, we could report out, Jim, if it's interesting, kind of what those sales or revenues add up to, where people are interested.\n But I would say we're making pretty good progress on most of them. I did say we paused the Corpay payables one to get people on the platform first. But look, we have 800,000 customers now spending hundreds of millions with us, so obviously -- hundreds of billions. So we got plenty of opportunity to sell products back. Yes. I don't think it's anything, Pete, out of the ordinary. I would say, in the larger accounts, which we call out because we had 50,000 new accounts, that -- [ with our Board to take the rest of the call ] to run through those names. I would say that enterprise and partners, they run on cycles, they're under contract with us or someone else, and they come up.\n And so no, no super change, I think, in that rate. I do think there's some kind of newish or different kinds of stuff, like that Amazon thing that I mentioned, so there's some different kinds of players a bit, the same a little bit on the EV side. So that would be the one difference. I think some of the new business that's out there is just a little bit different in terms of the type of business it is. Yes, that's a good question. So I would say not a lot. So a couple of reasons. One is we already fed the army here a bit, if you will. I think we said at the beginning that we gave -- because we could get a profit target this year, more expense growth than normal, particularly in sales and IT, so one, I think our initial guide [ and other guides still a ] decent amount in it.\n Two is I don't love the uncertainty of 2/3 of the upside being the planet. The planet can shift around and refactor on us some. And so I don't like to spend money that I can 100% count on, so that would be number two. But with that, I would say you hit the one area.\n If there was one area where we would and do plan to spend a bit more, it would be in digital selling. And the reason is, you can. Unlike some of the other things that take way longer to build, right, and prepare and to get into the market, the head digital guy can walk down to my office and say, \"Look, we're getting twice the things. Do you want to spend another $2 million, $3 million this month?\" So because it's sales, which is great for the future, and because you can do it quickly, that would be the one area, Pete, that we would step on the gas. Yes. So let me -- anyway, good to hear from you, David. So let me take the first thing. So when you refer to verticals, I don't know if you're referring to the customer verticals or the products, but let me try to answer both. So on the kind of product line side, what we call the full AP or full outsourcing, is obviously going, right, great. It's grown over 50%. So obviously, well above the line average. And the good news, which you implied, is it also represented half of our sales, so a much larger part of our new sales than it does of our revenue, obviously, which is why it's growing faster.\n And then on the customer side, I would say we're just going gangbusters in the construction vertical. That vertical has come back. It's super healthy, at least here in the United States. We've got a  super great position in terms of partners, the accounting and ERP partners. We've got a great merchant network. And so the sales and the interest from that channel is just at record levels for us.  Doesn't mean we're not selling in other places too, but that one's going great. Do you, Chuck, want to take the -- David's second question? But David, hey, I know you've been excited with this one. So I'll share a little bit of the forward view. So I called out 1.7 million transactions. So the guy that runs that business has a bet with me, that it will be 10 million-plus for the year.\n And so the thing has gone from, hey, it's an idea here, let's see how we go, to really exiting, [ even really, they're growing like weed ] during this year and exiting at some kind of crazy level. And we plan to double again next year the accepting sites. We have the same 6 million vehicles or tag holders. So it's a little too early to say mission accomplished, but that thing is really working now. And George, it's Ron. Let me just add to that. It's all below the line, so the $100 million of kind of upside from our initial guide, right, rest of year, hey, why isn't it flowing through. At the EBITDA line, our rest of year will be up a couple of points from our Q1 print. So we will get operating leverage down there. It's all the 2 things Chuck just said. I mean it's a [ whopper ] forecast we have on interest expense. I mean who knows.\n But we put in, I think chuck has it in the back up there, some obviously massive increase as we run through the year in interest expense, and then a tax rate, again, that's high, I mean, on $1.3 billion or $1.4 billion of cash, PBT, every point or 2 is big. And so we're losing it in just in those 2 things. But I want to make sure with people here, that the operating leverage line, that thing is flowing through. It's going to be way better than Q1. [ And if you can work on even the ] interest rates down, that would help us, too. Yes. You got it. So no is the answer to the first question. We provide guidance basically with a 100% delevering assumption because unless we do something, that is what we do. It's the default. So that's what's in the forward guide.\n I would say really unchanged. Our first course is always M&A. If we have assets that we can dramatically improve or add meaningful capabilities, that's our first and highest use of capital. But looking at the FLT stock price today, you can imagine that my interest in buying FLT stock is high. So clearly, I don't know if Chuck has put it out there, we've got $1 billion-something in our current facilities generating, whatever, a few hundred million more a quarter.\n So we've got, obviously, a lot of liquidity to spend. So my guess is both will happen. There will be some transactions we'll try to get done. At these prices, we are buyers of our stock. And so it's likely, if we're sitting here 9 months from today, they will have done some of both of those things. Yes. Hey, Ken, it's Ron. It's a good question. So you're right, whatever it is, the 60% print is happiness everywhere, right? It's a deal getting into the insurance vertical. It's the recovery of our airline segment there, right, as airline travel and flights have come back. And it's also our core workforce space. Our clients have gotten healthier and done more driving kinds of travel. So all 3 happy things are happening in the base.\n I would say that that's, again, a high-teens business for us. If you said, \"Hey, you get through this and you get to kind of some normal baseline or normal comp, the market potential is enormous in all 3 of those.\"\n Obviously, the airline business is global. We just bought a little software company that we think is going to be incredibly helpful to some of those global airline sales. So the prospects we look way harder now in taking the core workforce product and launching it in Europe. We finally have an idea of how to do that to increase the TAM. So the prospects for that thing are great. It's the lowest as [ MMC ] in the company, which means we sell new business more efficiently there than any other line of business in the company. The margins in the business are super-duper good. So we love the business. Yes. I think it's mostly b. You're right. There's more people and more products. But as you laid out, the game is distribution. And the game is networks. Just to remind everybody, the products don't work if you can't monetize, if the cards don't monetize. Otherwise, you're relegated to a software fee.\n And so we just love -- I've said this a million times, is we -- maybe we don't have the world's greatest, but we got a pretty good product. And we have a couple of things that the new guys, right, don't, which is kind of proven, aged, distribution, that can create pressure on the marketplace. And we've got a 10-year-old merchant network, right, that accepts these purchasing and virtual cards.\n And so we're able to actually process and create economics. So we still -- I still feel like we've got a big advantage in the offer, but mostly, what you said, that it's just kind of -- it's just white space. It's just lots of companies are on kind of an old, just join a kind of clunky model. And what we and other people have is certainly way better than what they're doing. And so that group will win some share. But as I mentioned, we're selling a lot. So we're winning share.\n So again, I hope I can make this point, but we want to be in the disruptor. We're kind of the new guy, still taking the business from kind of the old method, so we want to join these other people, basically that you guys see as disrupting, and put us in the bucket of trying to go get that business. So that's our view of it. Thanks for joining us today. Let us know if you need anything else. So have a nice evening."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Jim Eglseder, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nJames Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Panther, our CFO. [Operator Instructions]\n Please note our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section on our website at fleetcor.com. Now throughout this call, we will be covering organic revenue growth. As a reminder, this metric neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads. It also includes pro forma results for acquisitions and divestitures or scope changes closed during the 2 years being compared.\n We will also be covering non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than at other companies. Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website.\n I also need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our outlook, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We undertake no obligation to update any of these statements.\n Now the expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. So with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? \nRonald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q4 2023 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects: first, provide my take on both Q4 and full year 2023 results; second, I'll share our 2024 priorities and guidance; third, give you a bit of an update on the status of our strategic review; and then lastly, highlight a few pretty exciting new products that we've recently launched.\n Okay. Let me begin with our Q4 results, which, frankly, were a bit mixed. We reported revenue of $937 million, up 6%; cash EPS of $4.44, up 10%; and  EBITDA of approximately $500 million, up 11%. Q4 revenue did finish a bit weaker than we outlooked 90 days ago, but fortunately, our earnings flow-through was quite a bit better than expected. That was helped mainly by credit losses finishing at about half the level of last year.\n The revenue weakness in the quarter showed up in a few areas. First, gift cards. So we had some delays in gift card shipments that have been pushed here into Q1. In Lodging, we had a pretty soft distressed passenger vertical in the quarter, mostly because airline cancellations were at a record low level. North America fleet late fees, pretty light.\n That, again, is a continuation of exiting a lot of micro accounts that we started about a year ago when we tightened credit terms. Again, fortunately, the late fee reduction was essentially washed away by the improvement in credit losses. And then last year is our Corporate Payments or payables business with a channel partner business finishing even softer than we had outlooked. Fortunately there, we think it's bottomed out.\n So these kind of weak spots, soft spots were either timing-related, weather-related or have kind of reached the end, have kind of bottomed out as we head into our 2024 guide. So hopefully, not surprising us again. The organic revenue growth in Q4, 7% overall, again, impacted by the soft spots I just called out. The Vehicle Payments organic revenue growth, 5% for the quarter. Corporate Payments revenue growth of 15%, but 20% if you exclude the partner channel.\n Trends in Q4, also a bit mixed. Retention, quite good, improved slightly to 92%. Sales grew 12% overall with a terrific performance in Corporate Payments. Sales there up over 40%. And what we call same-store sales finished 3% down. Again, we saw the weakness in the workforce lodging, in the airline lodging business and a bit in the U.K.\n Okay. Let me make the turn to our full year 2023 results, which reached record levels. 2023 revenue of $3.8 billion, up 10%; EBITDA of approximately $2 billion, up 13%; and cash EPS of $16.92, up 5%. Trends for full year 2023, quite good. Sales for the full year, up 20% overall. And again, inside of that, Corporate Payment sales up about 50%. We did sell 100,000 new B2B clients in 2023. In terms of organic revenue growth, full year, 10%, so that makes 3 consecutive years of 10% plus organic revenue growth. And again, retention stable at 92%.\n Additionally, we did advance a number of important strategic initiatives in the year, progressed EV and our understanding of the relative economics of EV versus ICE. So promising results there. We did clean up our Russia and FTC issues. We did introduce this transformation idea for our Fleet business, envisioning it really as a broader Vehicle Payments-related business. We did close a couple of important acquisitions, one in cross-border, which we fully have integrated, and one in parking, really to jump-start our consumer vehicle payments initiative. So look, all in all, a pretty successful year.\n Okay. Let me make the transition to our 2024 guidance and start out by outlining our major objectives for the year. So a few things. First, as always, to deliver financial performance that's consistent with our midterm objectives. Second, we hope to deepen our position in Corporate Payments through some new acquisitions in that space. Third, we hope to build out our Vehicle Payments business with proof of successful cross-selling and accelerate revenue growth throughout the year. And then lastly, to succeed with some new product launches and confirm market acceptance for them.\n So on to our 2024 financial guide. So revenue at the midpoint of $4,080 million. that's up 9% on a print basis or 11% excluding Russia. EBITDA of $2.2 billion. that's up 11% or 14% excluding Russia. And finally, cash EPS at the midpoint of $19.40, up 15% print and up 18% excluding Russia. So let me just say that again, planning '24 profits, cash EPS growth of 18% this year, excluding Russia.\n We are expecting good earnings flow through to EPS. One, revenue will grow faster throughout the year than expense, so that operating leverage will help, and we do expect to have fewer shares, better FX and a slightly lower tax rate. In terms of revenue and organic growth, we're obviously helped by our Q4 exit rate in the sales from last year growing here into 2024. We are expecting higher sales levels here in 2024, which will add to revenue.\n And then we do have a number of cross-sell initiatives planned into our client base this year. So in the Fleet business, selling business cards, EV, parking, breakdown services back into the fleet clients. And in Brazil, the toll business, selling insurance, parking, fuel back into the toll base. Tom in a bit will provide some more specifics on the 2024 guide and how it rolls out across the year. We also plan to mark the next chapter of the company with the rebranding of FLEETCOR to Corpay, and that's scheduled for March.\n Okay. Let me make the turn to our strategic review. So just as a reminder, we did initiate a formal strategic review of our portfolio last spring and initially focused on the question of whether separating our Fleet business from our Corporate Payments business could unlock value for shareholders. We have run a pretty rigorous process over the last 11 months with a lot of help, particularly from Goldman Sachs. We fielded numerous inbounds, looked at lots of alternatives and explored some combinations with dance partners.\n I got to say the review process was quite helpful for us in exploring some -- really some new structures for the company and spotlighted the value creation potential of transitioning really our Fleet business into a broader Vehicle Payments business that will serve both businesses and consumers. So that's a super high priority for us. So look, we're announcing really the conclusion today of the review process. At least for the time being, we determined that keeping our Fleet business and Corporate Payments together is the best way forward. Obviously, we remain open to reconsidering various options to unlock value down the road, but right now, squarely focused on repositioning the Vehicle Payments business.\n Okay. My last subject upfront here is on new products. We've released 4 new products into the marketplace this year, each with really terrific potential. So first, what we call our Corpay One business card, fuel card and virtual card in one. That's targeted to fuel-based businesses, where the solution includes a business card for the owner, fuel cards for the field drivers and even replaces paper checks with virtual cards. That's all in one account and all in one UI, so pretty exciting.\n Second, product we call the Comdata Connect Card. It's targeted to small trucking companies. So it connects the Comdata truck stop fuel discounts and reporting to the companies, the trucking company's, existing business credit card. So trucking firms here would really get the best of both worlds. They continue to get the credit and rewards from their existing business card, but combine that with the fuel discounts and reporting of a truck stop card. Look, this also helps us in terms of the credit challenge with small trucking companies, so hopefully, we can bring on lots of small trucking firms without the credit risk.\n Third up is a product that we call Corpay Complete. It's our newest Corporate Payments product targeted to midsized businesses. And again, this is really a platform build. So we've combined what we call walk around solutions, business cards and fuel cards, really with the central kind of AP automation solution, again, packaged all in one platform, all in one mobile app. So really, we think kind of the modern way really for businesses to manage their all-around business expenses and spend less.\n And lastly, in Lodging, we have a new product called CLC Choice. So it's really a workforce lodging solution for employers who want really a more friendly and flexible employee travel solution with the idea being more choice for travelers. So in this case, travelers could choose virtually any hotel, any room type and even keep rewards points from their favorite hotel brand. So we think the Choice solution will complement really our current control solution and widen the market opportunity there.\n So look, we're super excited about these new products have been in the kitchen for quite a while and hopeful that this new set of products will accelerate revenue 1% to 2% over time. Okay. So look, in conclusion, today, 2023, really a record year, record revenue, record earnings, Organic revenue growth for the full year up 10%. Sales, super good, up 20%. Stable retention at 92%.\n Made some good moves to position the company better for the midterm. EV progress and our new go-forward Vehicle Payment strategy. 2024 we're planning profits or cash EPS up 18% excluding Russia, and that's on really an assumption of flat interest expense, launching a set of new products that we have high hopes for. And then beginning really the next chapter for the company as we move to rebrand the company to Corpay in March.\n So with that, let me turn the call back over to Tom to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Tom? \nThomas Panther: Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Here are some additional details related to the quarter and the full year. Organic revenue growth was 7%, the same as the fourth quarter of last year. Revenue growth was slightly below our expectations due to pockets of softness, mostly in U.S. Vehicle Payments and Lodging, while our Corporate Payments and international businesses continue to perform well.\n The revenue weakness was mostly offset by strong expense discipline, continued improvements in bad debt expense and a lower tax rate, which delivered $4.44 per share in cash EPS, within our guidance and up 10% versus last year. Looking at the full year, organic revenue grew 10% and  EBITDA increased 13%, which are both in line with our midterm targets. We also absorbed nearly $200 million of incremental interest expense during the year due to the rate hikes and still posted cash EPS growth of 5%. Normalizing for the higher interest expense, adjusted earnings would have grown 16% for the full year 2023.\n Now turning to our segment performance and the underlying drivers of our revenue growth. Corporate Payments revenue was up 15% during the quarter and increased 19% for the full year. For the quarter, our direct business grew 19% and was again led by growth in full AP. Our full suite of high-quality payment solutions continues to sell extremely well, with sales up 27% this quarter, as we sign up customers who are looking to modernize their AP operations. I'd note that the drag from lower partner channel volumes accelerated in the quarter, with channel revenue declining 31%.\n Excluding the partner channel, revenue grew 20% and spend volumes increased 27% in the quarter, so quite strong on a core basis. We believe the partner channel volumes have bottomed, and volumes and revenue are expected to be flat in 2024. Cross-border revenue was up 21%, sales grew 51%, and  recurring client transaction activity was robust. We've now fully lapped all the revenue synergies from the GRG acquisition in January 2023.\n More importantly, our best-in-class technology, service and products allow us to have market-leading retention and client acquisition, which you can see in our results. We continue to make significant investments in this business through increased sales and marketing resources as well as new product capabilities.  Over the last few years, we have transformed this business into becoming the largest nonbank provider of B2B FX payment solutions in the world.\n Turning to Vehicle Payments. Recall this is the new segment that we introduced on our last earnings call. It reflects the combination of our Fleet and Brazil businesses, along with our new consumer vehicle initiative. Consistent with our goal of creating a simpler company, we have now put all vehicle-related payment solutions in one segment that operates across North America, Brazil and Europe, offering a full suite of vehicle-related solutions to both businesses and consumers.\n You'll note that we have defined the new segment's KPI as transactions. But given the different products that comprise the segment, we've provided transaction counts by product type, such as fleet, tags and parking. We've also realigned our executive team to support this new segment, with Armando Netto serving as the Group President of North America and Brazil, and Alan King as the Group President over International Fuel, EV and Parking.\n Vehicle Payments organic revenue increased 5% during the quarter, with particular strength in Brazil and international fuel markets. In the U.K., more than 30% of all new sales involve a nonfuel product. namely EV or vehicle maintenance. Our EV strategy in the U.K. is clearly winning as our 3-in-1 product, fuel, on-road charging and at-home charging, all in one app has more than doubled from a year ago. The results speak for themselves with both EV cards and EV revenue continuing to increase.\n In addition, we're having great success selling our at-home charging solution with a 30% attachment rate to all new sales. Our charging network also continues to expand, and we now offer charging at over 600,000 charge points in Europe. And by the end of March, we will have coverage of nearly 80% of the rapid chargers in the U.K., including Tesla, which we signed in the fourth quarter.\n In Brazil, we ended the year with nearly 6,000 extended network locations, including 2,500 gas stations, 2,900 parking locations, 750 drive-through restaurants and 270 condos. Total tags were up 7% year-over-year to nearly 7 million and approximately 37% of customer spend was from our Beyond Toll network. Sales of insurance policies are up fourfold when we launched in Q4 '22 to nearly $200,000 in Q4 '23, so from 0 to $200,000 per quarter in 5 quarters and now total over 1 million policies.\n Our success in Brazil is a tangible proof point of our broader vehicle payments vision to leverage an anchor product used by a large customer base and to then add additional services via a mobile app driving incremental revenue growth. We are leveraging our strong success in the U.K. to launch our consumer vehicles payment solution in the market. We have begun selling the parking network that we acquired in the third quarter via PayByPhone to our business customers and are building the integrations to be able to offer to the over 2 million PayByPhone consumer users in the U.K. access to our proprietary fuel, EV, insurance, toll and maintenance networks.\n In the U.S., softness in small fleet and the impact from our shift away from micro clients continue to affect our sales and revenue results. Our digital and field sales efforts are improving as we continue to see growth in applications, approvals and starts. As we mentioned last quarter, the shift to higher credit quality clients also impacted late fees, which were down 38% from Q4 '22. While the decline in late fees is a drag on our revenue growth, it has resulted in a similar decline in bad debt expense, so essentially a wash.\n Lodging revenue was flat Q4 2022, and for the year, the business grew 12%. This quarter was affected by continued softness in our existing workforce customers, which appears to have now stabilized. Certain verticals within the business like airline and insurance can have quarterly revenue growth fluctuations driven by weather and natural disasters. Recall in Q4 of last year, there were significant weather events and airline cancellations, which benefited the airline and the insurance verticals.\n By comparison, there were no major weather events in Q4 of this year. And in fact, according to the Department of Transportation, 2023 flight cancellations were the lowest in a decade, and in the fourth quarter, cancellations were down approximately 90% from Q4 '22. We're experiencing similar results related to insurance claims, which were down approximately 20% in the quarter. Despite the recent soft quarters, we are confident that this business can return to low double-digit growth over the coming quarters.\n We recently launched new product capabilities that will extend our customer experience and drive new sales. Additionally, we're excited to welcome Joff Romoff as the new Group President of Lodging, replacing the retiring Ron Rogers. Joff has extensive hospitality and lodging experience that will be a strong asset to the business. In summary, we're proud of the performance we delivered in 2023. It clearly demonstrates the growth of our diversified business and the strength of our business model that generated over  $1.25 billion of free cash flow.\n Now looking down the income statement. Q4 operating expenses of $513 million were flat versus Q4 of last year. Expenses from acquisitions, higher transaction and sales activities and investments to drive future growth were offset by lower bad debt expense and the sale of our Russia business. Bad debt expense declined $19 million or nearly 50% from last year to $22 million or 3 basis points of spend. Most of the decline was in vehicle payments, which was down $17 million year-over-year as we realize the benefit from our lower exposure to U.S. micro clients.\n EBITDA margin in the quarter was 54.2%, a 220 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of last year. This positive operating leverage is driven by solid revenue growth, lower bad debt expense, disciplined expense management and synergies realized from recent acquisitions. Interest expense this quarter increased $18 million year-over-year, and the impact of higher interest rates resulted in an approximate $0.27 drag on Q4 adjusted EPS, partially offset by lower debt balances year-over-year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.3% versus 24.2% last year. The lower rate related to specific tax planning items.\n Now turning to the balance sheet. We are entering 2024 with the balance sheet in excellent shape. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in unrestricted cash, up $300 million from 90 days ago, and we had over $800 million available on our revolver. We have $5.4 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, and we had $1.4 billion borrowed under our securitization facility. As of year-end, our leverage ratio was 2.4x trailing 12 months EBITDA, which is at the lower end of our target range.\n In January, we upsized our term loan A and revolver A credit facilities by $600 million with no rate concessions and no change in the maturity. This added capital will provide incremental capacity and flexibility for both deals and share buybacks in 2024, which I'll elaborate on in a few minutes. Our capital allocation in 2023 was once again balanced as we deployed $1.6 billion. In the quarter, we repurchased roughly 600,000 shares at an average price of $254 per share or $143 million. For the year, we repurchased 2.6 million shares for $690 million.\n We spent $545 million on acquisitions during the year, improving our position in EV, the consumer vehicle payment space and cross-border. We used the remaining excess cash flows for debt amortization and reducing our revolver balance.  As I previously mentioned, our 2024 capital allocation plan is supported by our significant cash and liquidity position. We have $1.4 billion in unrestricted cash and increased our capacity on our revolver by $600 million, and we expect to generate $1.4 billion in free cash flow during 2024. Our first priority remains M&A, and the M&A pipeline is robust. We'll look to acquire businesses that deepen our position in our 3 core operating segments. \n We are also allocating capital for share buybacks during 2024. In January, the Board increased our repurchase authorization by $1 billion. We now have over $1.6 billion authorized for share repurchases. We expect to repurchase $800 million of shares throughout the year. We plan to purchase these shares through the open market and will establish a 10b5-1 plan later this month. Any residual cash flows from earnings will be used to reduce our revolver or build our cash position. Generating so much cash is a high-class problem, and we plan to leverage this strength to systematically support our EPS growth through M&A and buybacks in 2024.\n Now let me share some thoughts on our 2024 full year and Q1 outlook. From an economic perspective,  we are not assuming a recession nor a meaningful economic improvement in overall business activity. Our forecast for the year is based on the consensus economic outlook in our markets, which generally calls for modest economic growth and lower interest rates in the second half of the year. We expect fuel prices to be a headwind in the first quarter, and for the full year, we're anticipating U.S. fuel prices to average $3.65 per gallon, which is a blend of diesel and unleaded. In 2024, we expect cash EPS to grow between 14% and 16%, which is inclusive of the planned buybacks I mentioned previously.\n Revenue growth is projected to be between 8% and 10%, and EBITDA is expected to increase 10% to 12% with margin expanding to approximately 54%. Keep in mind these growth rates are inclusive of our Russia business through mid-August of last year. Excluding Russia, cash EPS is growing 17% to 19%, revenue is up 10% to 12%, and EBITDA is increasing 13% to 15%, all slightly above our midterm growth targets. We've provided these details in our earnings supplement on Page 20.\n Net interest expense is projected to be between $340 million and $370 million, which includes the replacement of a $500 million interest rate swap that matured in December. Roughly 80% of our credit facility is now fixed utilizing swaps, and the blended swap rate is 4.1%. Also recall that our securitization is a variable rate facility. And finally, our tax rate is expected to be between 25% and 26%.\n From a segment perspective, we expect the following organic revenue growth rates: Vehicle Payments in the mid-single digits; Corporate Payments approximately 20%; Lodging Payments in the high single digits. Related to the quarters, we expect revenue growth in the first half of the year to be below our full year average due to the continued pockets of softness, a tough comp that includes Russia as well as a challenging operating environment, including lower fuel prices.\n We expect revenue growth to accelerate in the back half of the year as the economic outlook becomes clear, we lap the divestiture of Russia and we realize the benefits of our growth initiatives and new sales. For the first quarter, we're expecting revenue to grow between 3% and 5% and cash EPS to increase between 6% and 8%, which also reflects higher interest rates. Normalizing for Russia, revenue and cash EPS growth at the midpoint would be 7% and 13%, respectively. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement.\n Before completing my prepared remarks, I would like to extend our gratitude to our more than 10,000 employees around the world who helped us deliver such a great year and who will be the driving force to even greater heights throughout 2024.\n Thank you for your interest in our company. And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Peter Christiansen with Citi. \nPeter Christiansen: Two questions for you, Ron. Just curious, you performed pretty well on the credit loss side. How are you thinking about, at least tactically, about extending credit in 2024 versus last year, particularly after improving the mix of your midsized -- mid-market clients? \nRonald F. Clarke: Pete, good question. I'd say, looser. So the model that we've used has gotten a bit better over the last 12 months. And I think I called out credit losses coming in literally about half of the prior year. So I'd say we're going to kind of open this ticket carefully.\n And then second, again, that we're pointing to larger prospects with generally a better credit. So I guess we have the full year plan just a smidge lower than full year '23, but it should help on the revenue side. \nPeter Christiansen: That's helpful. And then, Ron, I guess now exiting the strategic review, how should we think about at least your acquisition -- M&A priorities going forward? Any particular areas, horizontal, vertical? Just want to get your fresh sense on FLEETCOR, soon to be Corpay's, M&A priorities going forward? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Another good question. Glad to be back at kind of the basic, buying companies. So the primary focus, Pete, is on Corporate Payments. So we've got a pipeline of a couple of interesting things in that space. And then the one other area that we're kind of on is this consumer capability, this idea again of getting a big block of consumers that we could market all of our networks to. So I would say those would be the two short-term things to look for. \nOperator: The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask about some of the Q4 headwinds that you called out and just maybe ask you to give us a little more color on what was going on and the degree to which you're confident that they'll represent sort of transient headwinds rather than more permanent sort of impacts. I know you implied that as we get deeper into '24 that you could see some improvement, but I'm just curious if you could give us a little more color on what sort of happened in the quarter. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, in a nutshell, Ramsey, I call it, the story of the quarter was same-store sales. So I called out it was minus 3%, and if you went back to our prior transcripts, Q4 '22 would have been plus 2%. So in that 12-month period, basically went from plus 2% to minus 3%. So obviously, that's 5 points of organic growth. So that's the whole story. Retention was good, sales were good, expense controls, credit below the line. Everything effectively in Q4 through my lenses was kind of in line sans that one call out.\n And so I tried to kind of go through it. They obviously were surprising to me since I looked through the guide pretty carefully. Really, it's just 2 or 3 pockets that are not new. If you go back and look at what we communicated in '23, we would have talked about lodging having some softness in the base, the partner channel and payables having some softness, the pivot from micro accounts, which shed a bunch of late fees, unfortunately, credit losses. And so, basically, I'd say those 3 things that I called out were just heavier, weightier on the downside, say, we're looking at kind of 1% to 2% minus same store and it came in at 3%.\n And so  that's really the story of the quarter. And so the good news, if there is any, is in all 3 of those cases, it deals like, in the data showing even through January, it looks like we've hit the bottom. So the thought process that we have is that we climb out of the same-store sales, almost to reverse pattern. So minus 3, minus 2, basically getting that thing back to positive because that book of business basically flatlined into '24. So that's basically the perspective on it. So it's really no new things. It's things that we have seen that basically were a bit heavier in the quarter than we outlooked. \nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. A follow-up for me. I was wondering if you could kind of comment on the closure of the strategic alternatives process and just kind of revisit what -- kind of a postmortem, in a sense. Why was it so difficult to find the strategic alternatives to execute on? Was it lack of attractive partners? Was it a valuation hang up? Was it rates? Where was the friction in the process that kind of prevented you guys from executing on that sort of monetization strategy? \nRonald F. Clarke: Look, it's a super complicated question, right, which is why we spent 11 months on it, so [indiscernible] too quick with an answer here. But look, the main thing against just a straight SpinCo, I think we said, was uncertainty of the trading range of RemainCo wasn't so much. We got a great Corporate Payments business. It was really what's the multiple on RemainCo.\n So I think that caused us to pivot into this dance partner to -- if we were going to separate things, to do something that would have scale and synergies. And so the short answer to that is we engaged with 3 or 4 different partners, and it's a combination of either the synergies didn't pan out to be as good as we thought or we couldn't agree relative valuation, or in one case, maybe social issues around it.\n So these kinds of combinations, as you guys know, are always quite difficult. But I did say it seriously. We've learned a lot. We looked at a lot of structures. We've met a bunch of people. And so we will continue to look. The focus now is back on buying things in our lane and obviously rebuilding this vehicle business some, but we are open a different day to relooking at it again. So kind of closed for now, but not forever. \nOperator: The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: I was just thinking on the new product side that you're going -- that you laid out here to enhance growth. I think you mentioned around 1 to 2 points over time. How quickly do you think that can convert into -- in your sales? Do you have the sales engine humming already? Just curious where you are with that. \nRonald F. Clarke: So I mean the headline of why I call this out is, over the last 2 or 3 years, we've done a fair amount of what I term capability acquisitions. And really behind the scenes, those have been some tech capability acquisitions, right? The Corpay One, we bought an AP platform, a software platform called Accrualify. It's a front end. We bought a European workforce business with a brand-new platform.\n And so the tech that we got allowed us to spin up kind of some, I call them internally, kind of next-gen products that I described at the top. And so we're out selling them now, we've got a pretty robust sales plan for them. So I would say the convert would be next year. The key thing for us to report this year to you is sales of those products. And then obviously, next year, as those roll into revenue, basically, we'd expect the acceleration. So the key is what's the reception? Does the market like these 3 or 4 things that we'll put in front of them? \nTien-Tsin Huang: Got it. Got it. And then just my follow-up, maybe for you, again, Ron, just thinking about visibility into revenue growth in '24 versus prior years. It feels like there's a little bit more reliance on new products and initiatives. I know cross-sell is something you've always done. Macro is always what it is, but how would you consider the visibility this year versus recent years? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, that's another super good question. It sounds like most things, some things stay the same and some things are different. So the most important thing for us, as you know, is sales, which is why I call out the growth rate. And I think I called out for the full year last year 20%. That's our target again for 2024, obviously, off of a bigger base.\n So the first thing is we've had success selling and expect the same year in '24. Two is the retention is getting a bit better. And as we flush those micro accounts last year, structurally, that should help retention. So you take those two things, those underpin, as you know, the basic right -- new business versus losses is the key to a recurring business.\n So the wildcard, the bet here has been the softness thing, which, again, entered the year in the plus column and then ended the year in the minus column, so that thing turning or getting tension back to flat, I think, is the most important in the acceleration. But then on top of that, we've got some super new pricing ideas around the technology as the new dynamic pricing, for example, where we could price rooms and lodging different for someone walking into a hotel than someone who prebooks 3 weeks ago instead of a platform that didn't let us differentiate.\n We've got a few new partners that we've signed that we haven't announced that will come on. And then to your point, we've got a big plan around cross-sell, adding a buck for vehicle insurance every time people park if they want it to basically allay the fear of something happening to their car when they park. So it's a pretty balanced -- I'd say it's not super different than the past, but I would say that the new products and some of the cross-sell should be a little more supportive than historically. \nOperator: The next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. \nDarrin Peller: Ron, maybe just go back to -- it's a bit of a follow-up to Tien-Tsin's question just now, but when we think of the vehicle segment and the aspirations for being mid-single -- I'm sorry, double-digit, low double-digit, growth from what we're now guiding to a mid-single-digit year, maybe just talk a little bit about the initiatives that you feel are going to really drive that strength?\n And it does look like you're having a lot of success, obviously, now with whether it's EV or obviously in Brazil. So I'm assuming it's a combination of all those factors, but any more color on that? And just a quick follow-up, but also the fourth quarter, I know you had some headwinds on certain variables, like you mentioned on the call, credit and -- it just seems like you would have a better growth in '24 than fourth quarter just as some of those abate, but yet you're guiding a similar rate of growth for vehicles. So just a little more color on that. \nRonald F. Clarke: Say the last part, Darrin, guiding to what in '24? \nDarrin Peller: Yes, per vehicle segment, mid-single-digit growth. I would have thought it'd be a little bit better comparing it to a fourth quarter which I know has some headwinds in it. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. So let me take that last part and then back my way back to the beginning of your question. So yes, if you looked inside our quarterly roll, that thing would go from kind of low mid-single digit up to 10%. So the internal plan we have is exactly what you said to the vehicle organic growth rate to accelerate.\n So the two drivers of that beyond the normal things of retention, which should get better again structurally because we kicked out the micro accounts, and obviously, sales being good is the new products that I just talked about, right, some extensions in both the core fuel card business and in the trucking business, and to your point, the EV thing working.\n But the second one is this consumer, it's just all incremental. So to the extent that we can take 2 million people in the U.K. and another couple of million people, which we'll talk about soon, in Brazil, and add on 3 or 4 services that we already have, it's just every dollar there is incremental and pretty profitable.\n So those are really the two drivers. The base, same-store sales, retention and new sales, which we have a good handle on, and then the couple of new things and the new products and the consumers. So we're bullish on it. Obviously, we had a pivot in this vehicle thing and then a bit distracted working on this restructuring, but I think where we're headed now is super clear. \nThomas Panther: And Darrin, one thing I'd add before Ron gets to your other question about longer-term vehicle. Keep in mind the first half of last year had the elevated late fees from the SMB micro clients that we still have on the platform. So we all start lapping that until you get into late Q2, so that creates a little bit of a grow-over challenge when you look at it on an annual basis. \nRonald F. Clarke: And it's one of the reasons, Darrin, someone sent me some text of, hey, the revenue looks a little light. And we've effectively taken $20 million, $30 million of late fee revenue out and $20 million to $30 million of credit losses out. It's been basically kind of a one-for-one swap, which people out there may not like, but I like. I like the ratability of having lower credit losses. And so to Tom's point, that portfolio shift kind of moved both revenue and expense. \nDarrin Peller: That really -- that's helpful. I don't know if there's time for a quick follow-up. Just very quickly on Corpay. I just want to understand a little bit more on the channel business bottoming out here. And  maybe you can explain a little more of what the dynamic is and the underlying drivers, if it's around a channel -- one of the partners, if that's finished or its virtual card adoption or anything else, guys? \nRonald F. Clarke: Let me take that one. Another good question. So if you think about what we call a channel business, it's some third-party U.S. customers where we provide virtual card processing. And the basic trend, which started 2 years ago, is those partners effectively moving from an exclusive relationship with us to nonexclusive.\n So I, Ron, I used to use you for 100% of my processing Someone told me it was a good idea to have 2 providers. So over time, I'm going to kind of give you half the business or I'm going to try to haircut your rate. So effectively, over the last 2 years, Darrin, we've gone from having call it, 15 really important partners that we were exclusive with to having 15 partners we're nonexclusive with.\n So the good news on this one is we have the contracts now for '24 that have us flat with '23. So our print for that business, which moved its way down during the course of '23, were out looking effectively flat revenue in that business across into '24. So instead of every quarter saying oh, the Corporate Payments business was great, but hey, the channel business was crummy, hopefully, you'll hear me say that in '24. The answer will be it will be flat. \nOperator: The next question comes from Nate Svensson with Deutsche Bank. \nChristopher Svensson: So Darrin actually leads right into what I wanted to ask on Corporate Payments. Very -- first off, very nice to hear about the outlook for 20% growth in 2024. I wanted to ask, because in the past, you've talked about sort of a stickiness and resilience that you see with regards to suppliers continuing to accept virtual card payments despite the challenging macro, so maybe can you give us an update on how that sort of resilience has trended since we last spoke 3 months ago? Anything changing with the decision process with your suppliers? Or any update there would be great. \nRonald F. Clarke: Nate, it's Ron. I'd say not much change. So I think we said it before that acceptance or nonacceptance of a virtual card turns really more on the profile of merchants. Merchants that have obviously higher margins, for example, are more accepting, or merchants more in need of cash flow because they're paid sooner. So I'd say there's really nothing super new. Kind of the opt-out rate, if you will, has been pretty steady. And again, who takes the card is really a function of kind of who the merchant is. So nothing new. \nThomas Panther: And, Nate, we've actually seen card penetration levels tick up a little bit. So at the end of the day, it kind of comes down to the amount of spend that's on a card, and that's moved up as you look at it over a quarterly trend. \nChristopher Svensson: That's great to hear about the penetration levels. And so I know there's been a lot of talk about new products throughout the call. One I kind of wanted to dig deeper on was the new Corpay Complete products. I know there was a press release that came out at the end of January. So maybe you can talk about the go-to-market motion there, where you're seeing the sort of synergy potentials between the full AP offering, cross-border, et cetera, within that Corpay Complete? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. That's another good question. I mean, simplistically, Nate, we used to do knock, knock on a midsized company, hi, CFO, and hey, we've got some great expense management products here. And mostly, the pitch was kind of menu-based or a la carte. Hey, it looks like you got some drivers, we've got fuel cards. Looks like you need a better control business card, given some of the expenses that are coming in, or one that's got automated expense reimbursement.\n So historically, that's how we presented things. And so the idea was to be able to have kind of a [ RAP ], a rebate or look at the spend of the whole company. So knock, knock, hi CFO. You've got walk around spend, you've got AP spend. I could combine all of that and give you 100 basis points back, $0.5 million a month back and make your life easier. How does that sound?\n So we finally have a platform where all those things, the walk around stuff and the AP automation stuff is literally brought together, call it, in terms of one report, one credit underwriting system and stuff. And so that's the idea that we could present now to a company, effectively a package deal, if you will, instead of an a la carte deal. So we just literally been underway, call it, just what you said, call it, a month or so with the first set of leaves in it.\n But clearly, it's going to be the future. My hope is even if we sell someone a la carte the first day that they're on the railroad, it's easier to go back. They've learned how to use the UI. They know us, we have an account, we credit -- underwritten them and stuff. And so we think it certainly lends to better add-on sales over time. \nOperator: The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Sorry, I hopped on a little bit late. I apologize if you've answered these questions, but just on the macro assumptions that you guys are using for the year, what kind of macro are you guys assuming sort of the beginning and ending of the year? \nThomas Panther: Sure, Sanjay. It's Tom. So thinking big picture macro, let's start there, and then we can talk a little bit in terms of a more detailed macro as it relates to -- specific to our company. But big picture macro, we're expecting an economic outlook to stay relatively consistent, completely in line with the broad economic guide.\n When you look at our 3 major markets of Brazil, U.S. and U.K. we expect in all of those markets to see a relatively stable, maybe slightly improving economy as rate cuts in those various markets occur, but we're not expecting any kind of recession, and certainly, we're not expecting a GDP kind of gangbuster-type year.\n With respect to the more narrow macro that affects FLEETCOR, kind of think about it in terms of a couple of categories. First, fuel. Fuel price, average fuel price, diesel and unleaded combined, of $3.65. That's a little below where we are today. If you just kind of look at where we are through 2024, we're probably closer to a blended rate of around $3.40.\n So that's one of the call outs that we had in terms of the Q1 growth challenge. But we're not prognosticators of oil and the pull-through to fuel. We just look at EIA and other providers of those things. That was the consensus view of how the year would play out. I think as demand increases from a seasonal perspective, you would see that increase.\n Spreads, generally consistent with last year. That's really hard to predict. It's more based on volatility of fuel price, not just absolute. So that's kind of in base gas, but we look at historical trends and done some modeling, so we expect spreads to be relatively consistent. FX, a little bit of a tailwind. If the dollar and rate cuts continue -- the projection is correct and the dollar doesn't strengthen -- it had a little bit of strengthening over the last week or so, but longer term, we expect the dollar to be a little weaker, and so that will help the FX side of our business.\n And we think overall, that will be a slight tailwind to us. Rates, generally kind of neutral to better. We have modeled out the rate curve based on the latest rate curve out there. So we think rates will be a little bit better. Certainly interest expense lapping the headwind from this year in terms of the grow over from '22 will be a significant benefit to us.\n And then I guess, finally, taxes, we think will be generally consistent with the full year tax rate in 2023. So overall, we characterized the macro as kind of neutral to -- from a macro perspective, big macro perspective, and kind of a slight benefit to us with respect to things that affect us directly. \nRonald F. Clarke: Sanjay, it's Ron. I got to jump in because I'm clearly the optimist here, playing off of Tom. But I'd say it's all -- it's sunshiny days, right, living through 2023 with a $200 million interest expense boat anchor and sitting here at the beginning of the year with half [ eFX ] and declining interest rates. It feels super great to get earnings print back to 15% or 18% that we can print instead of whatever we printed last year. So I would say that it's setting up at this moment to be super positive for us. Super happy with it. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Just a follow-up. Ron, you mentioned sort of the cross-sell initiatives in your prepared remarks. How much of that can happen over 2024? Is there anything baked in? And then when can we actually get the contribution in a significant way? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean it's happening in different places. I think you -- we've called out before, it's probably 20% of the Brazil sales now in the company are taking add-on products there and selling them back to the core base. We're underway with that, as I said, with the parking app because we've got millions of consumers. We're back -- reselling something back into the base of Corporate Payments, back into the fuel card base.\n So it's clearly in our sales plan. I'd say it's a probably relatively significant number as we get through the year in terms of what we're expecting there. So it's been a core part of the idea of we've got, as you know, 800,000 business clients, and some number of them are pretty big. And so having more things to offer them has always been part of the idea. So I think it's meaningful this year. \nOperator: The next question comes from Sheriq Sumar with Evercore ISI. \nSheriq Sumar: I was looking at Slide 37, and I can see that the Corporate Payments take rate has increased in 2023. So just wanted to get some context as to what's the pricing power over here, and can we expect the same trajectory? I think that's the function of the adjustments that you have done by the segments. So just to get some insights on that. \nThomas Panther: Sheriq, give me your page number again. You said 27? \nSheriq Sumar: 37. \nThomas Panther: 37. Okay, sorry. Yes, so a lot of that has to just do with the channel mix. So as Ron mentioned earlier, in terms of the way -- the amount of take rate we have on channel versus the direct business, as we saw the channel volume fluctuate in the quarter, that's what's causing the fluctuation in the take rate related to Corporate Payments. \nSheriq Sumar: Got it. And my follow-up is on the margins. We see that the margins have been grinding higher across all the segments, and especially within the Vehicle Payments and Corporate Payments. So just to get a sense as to what could be the biggest driver in margins in 2024, like which segment do you expect to be a meaningful contributor? \nThomas Panther: Yes. I don't think it's kind of disproportionate one way or another. Just kind of round it out, just to summarize, for the year, we were at 53%. We were exiting around 54%, and we guided for the full year 2024 to be at 54%, and probably exiting a little bit higher than that, as you would expect. And so it's not really one -- one, there's not a lot of change there. You're talking about, give or take, 100, 150 basis points.\n And secondly, I think it's more of the structure of the business that's driving the margin, not necessarily something that we're doing necessarily inside the business to modify the existing business model and the structure. So just as we grow at the levels at which each of the businesses are growing from a revenue and sales perspective and the amount of fixed cost, you're just going to get this natural operating leverage benefit from margin where you'll see that rotate up. So at the same time, we also want to continue to invest. \n I guess, fair point. Yes, credit is coming down a little bit, '23 to '24, that would also help the margin. But the other thing just from the standpoint of just investment, we continue to make significant investments in the company, particularly around sales and marketing. And so we are mindful in terms of the amount of spend that we're putting back into the company to make sure that the sales engine can continue to generate the  kind of growth levels that we've historically generated. \nOperator: The next question comes from Cris Kennedy with William Blair. \nCristopher Kennedy: I know you give the sample of the U.K. for unit economics of your EV business, but can you just talk broadly about that, how that's evolved over time and your confidence going forward in that? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Cris, it's Ron. So look, I preface it with it's still early days, I guess. We've been running this analysis for, what, 8 quarters or something and have 300 or 400 accounts in it. So look, we know a fair amount. We have real customers that are paying real bills and paying us more. I'd say to you that conceptually the reason that I think we can get paid the same or more, just to me simplistically, is there's just more purchase.\n So in the fuel business, let's say, in the U.K., there's 9,000 gas stations. We have 1 million drivers there. So someday, when every guy or gal has an EV, there's going to be 1 million incremental charge points. There's way more than 9,000 public charging points. And so the ability, again, to help a company make the transition from some old fashioned gas stations to some public charging to the million at home, bring that all together and keep it simple, is useful. In the scope of what they pay for charging and fuel, our fees are peanuts.\n And so it feels to me like we know what we're doing. And more importantly, we have products that they like. I think it doubled, Tom, year-over-year. And so I feel better about we've got the right solution, clients like it and clients are paying for it, and the math shows you they're paying more now than the old fashioned thing. So I'd say stop ringing the frigging fire alarms. It would be my comment to people. Hey, there's a lot of time in front of us, but I would not be super afraid, sitting here today. \nOperator: The next question is from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. \nTrevor Williams: I wanted to ask on Lodging. Any more detail you can give on some of the different components within the segment? It sounds like most of the incremental weakness was on the airline side. But any more color on the other pieces? Workforce, managed services, insurance, just how those did especially relative to Q3 would be helpful. \nThomas Panther: Sure. Trevor, it's Tom. So the Lodging business, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, it did experience softness. Where our biggest surprise was for the quarter was really more on the airline and the insurance piece. We actually saw the workforce piece come in about where we had anticipated, and a lot of the expected growth that we had forecast in the fourth quarter was from what we've seen historically, with the level of flight cancelations related to our distressed product, where you typically would see a seasonal uptick. There's lots of people in the air with holidays and things like that. And that just didn't come to fruition.\n Similarly on the insurance side, we saw the decline in the overall insurance. So the decline quarter-over-quarter in lodging was really more directed towards those 2 businesses where those types of episodic-type things that occur in the fourth quarter just didn't materialize.  Workforce, we continue to see a little bit of softness there, but as Ron had indicated, we feel like that has [ topped ] out and expect that to move forward based on new sales and the introductions of the new products. \nTrevor Williams: Okay. No, that's helpful. And then just to put a finer point on the assumptions for the macro neutral or the organic guide. In terms of cadence, is the expectation that growth will accelerate progressively over the course of the year? So like you were saying with vehicle where Q1 low point, 4Q exit rate for '24 should be the high point of organic growth for the year? Or anything else to call out? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, Trevor.  Let me try to take that and then Tom can add to it. So I mean, conceptually, the main reason is the same-store sales. So if you think about math, right, of how to get to 10%, right, we lose business, right, 8%. We make sales and then we have the same-store sales. And so the bet that we have, which we're seeing in the trends, is if the same store that was plus 2 4 quarters ago and was minus 3 this past quarter will head back to flat.\n And if that does, obviously, in that example, it lifts the organic thing by 3 points. So that's A. B, we think the retention, again, will likely tick up because of this micro flush. When you have more bigger accounts, you structurally just have better retention. And then third, our core repayments business is growing faster, and it has higher retention rates than our fuel card business.\n So those two things, as we model it, will help the back half. And then hopefully, the set of new products and the cross-sell stuff, which we're pouring out now, that will start to build, those add-ons will start to build in the back half. So that's what makes up the curve as we run through the year. \nOperator: The next question is from David Koning with Baird. \nDavid Koning: Just a couple of things. I guess, on the corporate line, you called out the yield mix improvement. But corporate volumes were down about 15% sequentially. It must have been low-yielding volumes that fell off. But what is the mix? What was the fall off in volumes from? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. It's just that channel thing that I said before. I mean, that literally was the point of our same-store sales reduction. We would have been 2% if that business was flat. So again, it's just a big partner that gives us lots of volume and no money goes, dates around and goes non-exclusive. And so, hey, we lose a little bit of revenue, and we lose a lot of volume.\n But the take rate goes up because obviously, that's a lot of low-margin business that we weren't getting. And we also know that excluding channel, the spend level was north of 25%. So it's really a channel story that's driving both the volume and the take rate noise that you may be seeing.\n But again, just to -- you said put a finer point on the thing, I want to make sure people have heard that we have the business to now contracted, right, for '24. So that helps us relay to you guys that we hit the bottom there, because when I look at what's effectively contracted, inside of the minimums we have, we're kind of done with that dating around. There's no more dating. If you date 1 or 2 people, you can't have any more than that. That's where it is. So that -- if there's any good news, that's the good news here. \nThomas Panther: It's kind of belts and suspenders. It was also some minimums as well. So that we also got some protection that while we're under contract, we also have some commitments from a minimum perspective, too. \nDavid Koning: Got you. And just a quick follow-up. Bad debt expense, you called it out, I mean, lowest -- $22 million, lowest in 8 quarters or so. Is your 2024 guidance for that to remain low? And if so, is anything related to reversals? Like is it unsustainably low in 2024 or just normal? \nThomas Panther: Yes, I mean I'd say it's fairly normal. Obviously, it's going to fluctuate from a dollar perspective as the business grows. We think of it more in terms of basis points of spend or percentage of revenue because as the business grows, you'd expect the bad debt dollar amount to grow, but not necessarily that rate to necessarily grow.\n So I think we'll continue to see good performance in 2024. We have -- plus the micro client that Ron said, we've tuned some of our models. We've gotten to a point where I think we've learned a lot over the last, call it, 6 quarters, and I think we'll be in a position where we can be a bit more opportunistic in terms of how we manage credit. \nRonald F. Clarke: And again, just add the point is it helps the flow-through into earnings, right, although it looks like revenue is light when you take those late fees out because you're taking out the credit loss expense, basically, you have a decent flow-through down to EPS. So that's one of the reasons that the profit flow-through remain pretty good. \nOperator: The next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. \nMichael Infante: It's Mike Infante on for James. Just one quick one for me. On the buyback, anything that we should be mindful of just in terms of cadence there? Do you think it will be fairly evenly distributed based on seasonal free cash flow generation? Or will it be weighted to any particular quarter? \nThomas Panther: Yes. Michael, it's Tom. I think we're going to be mindful in terms of market conditions, and we like where the stock price is. As I mentioned, we're flush with liquidity, both on the balance sheet and then when we upsized the revolver, we have another $600 million of liquidity. Obviously, we want to use some of that liquidity for M&A.\n But you add it all up, we have probably up to $2.5 billion, $3 billion worth of cash that we want to put to work, and we want to put it to work as quickly as possible. So I think the timing is just going to be predicated on the market, the amount of the floating stock and those types of things. But I think we will be looking to be in the market over the course of this quarter, and then we'll see how market conditions are as the year plays out. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session as well as the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ronald F. Clarke",
            "content": "Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q4 2023 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects: first, provide my take on both Q4 and full year 2023 results; second, I'll share our 2024 priorities and guidance; third, give you a bit of an update on the status of our strategic review; and then lastly, highlight a few pretty exciting new products that we've recently launched.\n Okay. Let me begin with our Q4 results, which, frankly, were a bit mixed. We reported revenue of $937 million, up 6%; cash EPS of $4.44, up 10%; and  EBITDA of approximately $500 million, up 11%. Q4 revenue did finish a bit weaker than we outlooked 90 days ago, but fortunately, our earnings flow-through was quite a bit better than expected. That was helped mainly by credit losses finishing at about half the level of last year.\n The revenue weakness in the quarter showed up in a few areas. First, gift cards. So we had some delays in gift card shipments that have been pushed here into Q1. In Lodging, we had a pretty soft distressed passenger vertical in the quarter, mostly because airline cancellations were at a record low level. North America fleet late fees, pretty light.\n That, again, is a continuation of exiting a lot of micro accounts that we started about a year ago when we tightened credit terms. Again, fortunately, the late fee reduction was essentially washed away by the improvement in credit losses. And then last year is our Corporate Payments or payables business with a channel partner business finishing even softer than we had outlooked. Fortunately there, we think it's bottomed out.\n So these kind of weak spots, soft spots were either timing-related, weather-related or have kind of reached the end, have kind of bottomed out as we head into our 2024 guide. So hopefully, not surprising us again. The organic revenue growth in Q4, 7% overall, again, impacted by the soft spots I just called out. The Vehicle Payments organic revenue growth, 5% for the quarter. Corporate Payments revenue growth of 15%, but 20% if you exclude the partner channel.\n Trends in Q4, also a bit mixed. Retention, quite good, improved slightly to 92%. Sales grew 12% overall with a terrific performance in Corporate Payments. Sales there up over 40%. And what we call same-store sales finished 3% down. Again, we saw the weakness in the workforce lodging, in the airline lodging business and a bit in the U.K.\n Okay. Let me make the turn to our full year 2023 results, which reached record levels. 2023 revenue of $3.8 billion, up 10%; EBITDA of approximately $2 billion, up 13%; and cash EPS of $16.92, up 5%. Trends for full year 2023, quite good. Sales for the full year, up 20% overall. And again, inside of that, Corporate Payment sales up about 50%. We did sell 100,000 new B2B clients in 2023. In terms of organic revenue growth, full year, 10%, so that makes 3 consecutive years of 10% plus organic revenue growth. And again, retention stable at 92%.\n Additionally, we did advance a number of important strategic initiatives in the year, progressed EV and our understanding of the relative economics of EV versus ICE. So promising results there. We did clean up our Russia and FTC issues. We did introduce this transformation idea for our Fleet business, envisioning it really as a broader Vehicle Payments-related business. We did close a couple of important acquisitions, one in cross-border, which we fully have integrated, and one in parking, really to jump-start our consumer vehicle payments initiative. So look, all in all, a pretty successful year.\n Okay. Let me make the transition to our 2024 guidance and start out by outlining our major objectives for the year. So a few things. First, as always, to deliver financial performance that's consistent with our midterm objectives. Second, we hope to deepen our position in Corporate Payments through some new acquisitions in that space. Third, we hope to build out our Vehicle Payments business with proof of successful cross-selling and accelerate revenue growth throughout the year. And then lastly, to succeed with some new product launches and confirm market acceptance for them.\n So on to our 2024 financial guide. So revenue at the midpoint of $4,080 million. that's up 9% on a print basis or 11% excluding Russia. EBITDA of $2.2 billion. that's up 11% or 14% excluding Russia. And finally, cash EPS at the midpoint of $19.40, up 15% print and up 18% excluding Russia. So let me just say that again, planning '24 profits, cash EPS growth of 18% this year, excluding Russia.\n We are expecting good earnings flow through to EPS. One, revenue will grow faster throughout the year than expense, so that operating leverage will help, and we do expect to have fewer shares, better FX and a slightly lower tax rate. In terms of revenue and organic growth, we're obviously helped by our Q4 exit rate in the sales from last year growing here into 2024. We are expecting higher sales levels here in 2024, which will add to revenue.\n And then we do have a number of cross-sell initiatives planned into our client base this year. So in the Fleet business, selling business cards, EV, parking, breakdown services back into the fleet clients. And in Brazil, the toll business, selling insurance, parking, fuel back into the toll base. Tom in a bit will provide some more specifics on the 2024 guide and how it rolls out across the year. We also plan to mark the next chapter of the company with the rebranding of FLEETCOR to Corpay, and that's scheduled for March.\n Okay. Let me make the turn to our strategic review. So just as a reminder, we did initiate a formal strategic review of our portfolio last spring and initially focused on the question of whether separating our Fleet business from our Corporate Payments business could unlock value for shareholders. We have run a pretty rigorous process over the last 11 months with a lot of help, particularly from Goldman Sachs. We fielded numerous inbounds, looked at lots of alternatives and explored some combinations with dance partners.\n I got to say the review process was quite helpful for us in exploring some -- really some new structures for the company and spotlighted the value creation potential of transitioning really our Fleet business into a broader Vehicle Payments business that will serve both businesses and consumers. So that's a super high priority for us. So look, we're announcing really the conclusion today of the review process. At least for the time being, we determined that keeping our Fleet business and Corporate Payments together is the best way forward. Obviously, we remain open to reconsidering various options to unlock value down the road, but right now, squarely focused on repositioning the Vehicle Payments business.\n Okay. My last subject upfront here is on new products. We've released 4 new products into the marketplace this year, each with really terrific potential. So first, what we call our Corpay One business card, fuel card and virtual card in one. That's targeted to fuel-based businesses, where the solution includes a business card for the owner, fuel cards for the field drivers and even replaces paper checks with virtual cards. That's all in one account and all in one UI, so pretty exciting.\n Second, product we call the Comdata Connect Card. It's targeted to small trucking companies. So it connects the Comdata truck stop fuel discounts and reporting to the companies, the trucking company's, existing business credit card. So trucking firms here would really get the best of both worlds. They continue to get the credit and rewards from their existing business card, but combine that with the fuel discounts and reporting of a truck stop card. Look, this also helps us in terms of the credit challenge with small trucking companies, so hopefully, we can bring on lots of small trucking firms without the credit risk.\n Third up is a product that we call Corpay Complete. It's our newest Corporate Payments product targeted to midsized businesses. And again, this is really a platform build. So we've combined what we call walk around solutions, business cards and fuel cards, really with the central kind of AP automation solution, again, packaged all in one platform, all in one mobile app. So really, we think kind of the modern way really for businesses to manage their all-around business expenses and spend less.\n And lastly, in Lodging, we have a new product called CLC Choice. So it's really a workforce lodging solution for employers who want really a more friendly and flexible employee travel solution with the idea being more choice for travelers. So in this case, travelers could choose virtually any hotel, any room type and even keep rewards points from their favorite hotel brand. So we think the Choice solution will complement really our current control solution and widen the market opportunity there.\n So look, we're super excited about these new products have been in the kitchen for quite a while and hopeful that this new set of products will accelerate revenue 1% to 2% over time. Okay. So look, in conclusion, today, 2023, really a record year, record revenue, record earnings, Organic revenue growth for the full year up 10%. Sales, super good, up 20%. Stable retention at 92%.\n Made some good moves to position the company better for the midterm. EV progress and our new go-forward Vehicle Payment strategy. 2024 we're planning profits or cash EPS up 18% excluding Russia, and that's on really an assumption of flat interest expense, launching a set of new products that we have high hopes for. And then beginning really the next chapter for the company as we move to rebrand the company to Corpay in March.\n So with that, let me turn the call back over to Tom to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Tom? Pete, good question. I'd say, looser. So the model that we've used has gotten a bit better over the last 12 months. And I think I called out credit losses coming in literally about half of the prior year. So I'd say we're going to kind of open this ticket carefully.\n And then second, again, that we're pointing to larger prospects with generally a better credit. So I guess we have the full year plan just a smidge lower than full year '23, but it should help on the revenue side. Yes. Another good question. Glad to be back at kind of the basic, buying companies. So the primary focus, Pete, is on Corporate Payments. So we've got a pipeline of a couple of interesting things in that space. And then the one other area that we're kind of on is this consumer capability, this idea again of getting a big block of consumers that we could market all of our networks to. So I would say those would be the two short-term things to look for. Yes. I mean, in a nutshell, Ramsey, I call it, the story of the quarter was same-store sales. So I called out it was minus 3%, and if you went back to our prior transcripts, Q4 '22 would have been plus 2%. So in that 12-month period, basically went from plus 2% to minus 3%. So obviously, that's 5 points of organic growth. So that's the whole story. Retention was good, sales were good, expense controls, credit below the line. Everything effectively in Q4 through my lenses was kind of in line sans that one call out.\n And so I tried to kind of go through it. They obviously were surprising to me since I looked through the guide pretty carefully. Really, it's just 2 or 3 pockets that are not new. If you go back and look at what we communicated in '23, we would have talked about lodging having some softness in the base, the partner channel and payables having some softness, the pivot from micro accounts, which shed a bunch of late fees, unfortunately, credit losses. And so, basically, I'd say those 3 things that I called out were just heavier, weightier on the downside, say, we're looking at kind of 1% to 2% minus same store and it came in at 3%.\n And so  that's really the story of the quarter. And so the good news, if there is any, is in all 3 of those cases, it deals like, in the data showing even through January, it looks like we've hit the bottom. So the thought process that we have is that we climb out of the same-store sales, almost to reverse pattern. So minus 3, minus 2, basically getting that thing back to positive because that book of business basically flatlined into '24. So that's basically the perspective on it. So it's really no new things. It's things that we have seen that basically were a bit heavier in the quarter than we outlooked. Look, it's a super complicated question, right, which is why we spent 11 months on it, so [indiscernible] too quick with an answer here. But look, the main thing against just a straight SpinCo, I think we said, was uncertainty of the trading range of RemainCo wasn't so much. We got a great Corporate Payments business. It was really what's the multiple on RemainCo.\n So I think that caused us to pivot into this dance partner to -- if we were going to separate things, to do something that would have scale and synergies. And so the short answer to that is we engaged with 3 or 4 different partners, and it's a combination of either the synergies didn't pan out to be as good as we thought or we couldn't agree relative valuation, or in one case, maybe social issues around it.\n So these kinds of combinations, as you guys know, are always quite difficult. But I did say it seriously. We've learned a lot. We looked at a lot of structures. We've met a bunch of people. And so we will continue to look. The focus now is back on buying things in our lane and obviously rebuilding this vehicle business some, but we are open a different day to relooking at it again. So kind of closed for now, but not forever. So I mean the headline of why I call this out is, over the last 2 or 3 years, we've done a fair amount of what I term capability acquisitions. And really behind the scenes, those have been some tech capability acquisitions, right? The Corpay One, we bought an AP platform, a software platform called Accrualify. It's a front end. We bought a European workforce business with a brand-new platform.\n And so the tech that we got allowed us to spin up kind of some, I call them internally, kind of next-gen products that I described at the top. And so we're out selling them now, we've got a pretty robust sales plan for them. So I would say the convert would be next year. The key thing for us to report this year to you is sales of those products. And then obviously, next year, as those roll into revenue, basically, we'd expect the acceleration. So the key is what's the reception? Does the market like these 3 or 4 things that we'll put in front of them? Yes, that's another super good question. It sounds like most things, some things stay the same and some things are different. So the most important thing for us, as you know, is sales, which is why I call out the growth rate. And I think I called out for the full year last year 20%. That's our target again for 2024, obviously, off of a bigger base.\n So the first thing is we've had success selling and expect the same year in '24. Two is the retention is getting a bit better. And as we flush those micro accounts last year, structurally, that should help retention. So you take those two things, those underpin, as you know, the basic right -- new business versus losses is the key to a recurring business.\n So the wildcard, the bet here has been the softness thing, which, again, entered the year in the plus column and then ended the year in the minus column, so that thing turning or getting tension back to flat, I think, is the most important in the acceleration. But then on top of that, we've got some super new pricing ideas around the technology as the new dynamic pricing, for example, where we could price rooms and lodging different for someone walking into a hotel than someone who prebooks 3 weeks ago instead of a platform that didn't let us differentiate.\n We've got a few new partners that we've signed that we haven't announced that will come on. And then to your point, we've got a big plan around cross-sell, adding a buck for vehicle insurance every time people park if they want it to basically allay the fear of something happening to their car when they park. So it's a pretty balanced -- I'd say it's not super different than the past, but I would say that the new products and some of the cross-sell should be a little more supportive than historically. Say the last part, Darrin, guiding to what in '24? Yes. So let me take that last part and then back my way back to the beginning of your question. So yes, if you looked inside our quarterly roll, that thing would go from kind of low mid-single digit up to 10%. So the internal plan we have is exactly what you said to the vehicle organic growth rate to accelerate.\n So the two drivers of that beyond the normal things of retention, which should get better again structurally because we kicked out the micro accounts, and obviously, sales being good is the new products that I just talked about, right, some extensions in both the core fuel card business and in the trucking business, and to your point, the EV thing working.\n But the second one is this consumer, it's just all incremental. So to the extent that we can take 2 million people in the U.K. and another couple of million people, which we'll talk about soon, in Brazil, and add on 3 or 4 services that we already have, it's just every dollar there is incremental and pretty profitable.\n So those are really the two drivers. The base, same-store sales, retention and new sales, which we have a good handle on, and then the couple of new things and the new products and the consumers. So we're bullish on it. Obviously, we had a pivot in this vehicle thing and then a bit distracted working on this restructuring, but I think where we're headed now is super clear. And it's one of the reasons, Darrin, someone sent me some text of, hey, the revenue looks a little light. And we've effectively taken $20 million, $30 million of late fee revenue out and $20 million to $30 million of credit losses out. It's been basically kind of a one-for-one swap, which people out there may not like, but I like. I like the ratability of having lower credit losses. And so to Tom's point, that portfolio shift kind of moved both revenue and expense. Let me take that one. Another good question. So if you think about what we call a channel business, it's some third-party U.S. customers where we provide virtual card processing. And the basic trend, which started 2 years ago, is those partners effectively moving from an exclusive relationship with us to nonexclusive.\n So I, Ron, I used to use you for 100% of my processing Someone told me it was a good idea to have 2 providers. So over time, I'm going to kind of give you half the business or I'm going to try to haircut your rate. So effectively, over the last 2 years, Darrin, we've gone from having call it, 15 really important partners that we were exclusive with to having 15 partners we're nonexclusive with.\n So the good news on this one is we have the contracts now for '24 that have us flat with '23. So our print for that business, which moved its way down during the course of '23, were out looking effectively flat revenue in that business across into '24. So instead of every quarter saying oh, the Corporate Payments business was great, but hey, the channel business was crummy, hopefully, you'll hear me say that in '24. The answer will be it will be flat. Nate, it's Ron. I'd say not much change. So I think we said it before that acceptance or nonacceptance of a virtual card turns really more on the profile of merchants. Merchants that have obviously higher margins, for example, are more accepting, or merchants more in need of cash flow because they're paid sooner. So I'd say there's really nothing super new. Kind of the opt-out rate, if you will, has been pretty steady. And again, who takes the card is really a function of kind of who the merchant is. So nothing new. Yes. That's another good question. I mean, simplistically, Nate, we used to do knock, knock on a midsized company, hi, CFO, and hey, we've got some great expense management products here. And mostly, the pitch was kind of menu-based or a la carte. Hey, it looks like you got some drivers, we've got fuel cards. Looks like you need a better control business card, given some of the expenses that are coming in, or one that's got automated expense reimbursement.\n So historically, that's how we presented things. And so the idea was to be able to have kind of a [ RAP ], a rebate or look at the spend of the whole company. So knock, knock, hi CFO. You've got walk around spend, you've got AP spend. I could combine all of that and give you 100 basis points back, $0.5 million a month back and make your life easier. How does that sound?\n So we finally have a platform where all those things, the walk around stuff and the AP automation stuff is literally brought together, call it, in terms of one report, one credit underwriting system and stuff. And so that's the idea that we could present now to a company, effectively a package deal, if you will, instead of an a la carte deal. So we just literally been underway, call it, just what you said, call it, a month or so with the first set of leaves in it.\n But clearly, it's going to be the future. My hope is even if we sell someone a la carte the first day that they're on the railroad, it's easier to go back. They've learned how to use the UI. They know us, we have an account, we credit -- underwritten them and stuff. And so we think it certainly lends to better add-on sales over time. Sanjay, it's Ron. I got to jump in because I'm clearly the optimist here, playing off of Tom. But I'd say it's all -- it's sunshiny days, right, living through 2023 with a $200 million interest expense boat anchor and sitting here at the beginning of the year with half [ eFX ] and declining interest rates. It feels super great to get earnings print back to 15% or 18% that we can print instead of whatever we printed last year. So I would say that it's setting up at this moment to be super positive for us. Super happy with it. Yes. I mean it's happening in different places. I think you -- we've called out before, it's probably 20% of the Brazil sales now in the company are taking add-on products there and selling them back to the core base. We're underway with that, as I said, with the parking app because we've got millions of consumers. We're back -- reselling something back into the base of Corporate Payments, back into the fuel card base.\n So it's clearly in our sales plan. I'd say it's a probably relatively significant number as we get through the year in terms of what we're expecting there. So it's been a core part of the idea of we've got, as you know, 800,000 business clients, and some number of them are pretty big. And so having more things to offer them has always been part of the idea. So I think it's meaningful this year. Yes. Cris, it's Ron. So look, I preface it with it's still early days, I guess. We've been running this analysis for, what, 8 quarters or something and have 300 or 400 accounts in it. So look, we know a fair amount. We have real customers that are paying real bills and paying us more. I'd say to you that conceptually the reason that I think we can get paid the same or more, just to me simplistically, is there's just more purchase.\n So in the fuel business, let's say, in the U.K., there's 9,000 gas stations. We have 1 million drivers there. So someday, when every guy or gal has an EV, there's going to be 1 million incremental charge points. There's way more than 9,000 public charging points. And so the ability, again, to help a company make the transition from some old fashioned gas stations to some public charging to the million at home, bring that all together and keep it simple, is useful. In the scope of what they pay for charging and fuel, our fees are peanuts.\n And so it feels to me like we know what we're doing. And more importantly, we have products that they like. I think it doubled, Tom, year-over-year. And so I feel better about we've got the right solution, clients like it and clients are paying for it, and the math shows you they're paying more now than the old fashioned thing. So I'd say stop ringing the frigging fire alarms. It would be my comment to people. Hey, there's a lot of time in front of us, but I would not be super afraid, sitting here today. Yes, Trevor.  Let me try to take that and then Tom can add to it. So I mean, conceptually, the main reason is the same-store sales. So if you think about math, right, of how to get to 10%, right, we lose business, right, 8%. We make sales and then we have the same-store sales. And so the bet that we have, which we're seeing in the trends, is if the same store that was plus 2 4 quarters ago and was minus 3 this past quarter will head back to flat.\n And if that does, obviously, in that example, it lifts the organic thing by 3 points. So that's A. B, we think the retention, again, will likely tick up because of this micro flush. When you have more bigger accounts, you structurally just have better retention. And then third, our core repayments business is growing faster, and it has higher retention rates than our fuel card business.\n So those two things, as we model it, will help the back half. And then hopefully, the set of new products and the cross-sell stuff, which we're pouring out now, that will start to build, those add-ons will start to build in the back half. So that's what makes up the curve as we run through the year. Yes. It's just that channel thing that I said before. I mean, that literally was the point of our same-store sales reduction. We would have been 2% if that business was flat. So again, it's just a big partner that gives us lots of volume and no money goes, dates around and goes non-exclusive. And so, hey, we lose a little bit of revenue, and we lose a lot of volume.\n But the take rate goes up because obviously, that's a lot of low-margin business that we weren't getting. And we also know that excluding channel, the spend level was north of 25%. So it's really a channel story that's driving both the volume and the take rate noise that you may be seeing.\n But again, just to -- you said put a finer point on the thing, I want to make sure people have heard that we have the business to now contracted, right, for '24. So that helps us relay to you guys that we hit the bottom there, because when I look at what's effectively contracted, inside of the minimums we have, we're kind of done with that dating around. There's no more dating. If you date 1 or 2 people, you can't have any more than that. That's where it is. So that -- if there's any good news, that's the good news here. And again, just add the point is it helps the flow-through into earnings, right, although it looks like revenue is light when you take those late fees out because you're taking out the credit loss expense, basically, you have a decent flow-through down to EPS. So that's one of the reasons that the profit flow-through remain pretty good."

            "name": "Thomas Panther",
            "content": "Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Here are some additional details related to the quarter and the full year. Organic revenue growth was 7%, the same as the fourth quarter of last year. Revenue growth was slightly below our expectations due to pockets of softness, mostly in U.S. Vehicle Payments and Lodging, while our Corporate Payments and international businesses continue to perform well.\n The revenue weakness was mostly offset by strong expense discipline, continued improvements in bad debt expense and a lower tax rate, which delivered $4.44 per share in cash EPS, within our guidance and up 10% versus last year. Looking at the full year, organic revenue grew 10% and  EBITDA increased 13%, which are both in line with our midterm targets. We also absorbed nearly $200 million of incremental interest expense during the year due to the rate hikes and still posted cash EPS growth of 5%. Normalizing for the higher interest expense, adjusted earnings would have grown 16% for the full year 2023.\n Now turning to our segment performance and the underlying drivers of our revenue growth. Corporate Payments revenue was up 15% during the quarter and increased 19% for the full year. For the quarter, our direct business grew 19% and was again led by growth in full AP. Our full suite of high-quality payment solutions continues to sell extremely well, with sales up 27% this quarter, as we sign up customers who are looking to modernize their AP operations. I'd note that the drag from lower partner channel volumes accelerated in the quarter, with channel revenue declining 31%.\n Excluding the partner channel, revenue grew 20% and spend volumes increased 27% in the quarter, so quite strong on a core basis. We believe the partner channel volumes have bottomed, and volumes and revenue are expected to be flat in 2024. Cross-border revenue was up 21%, sales grew 51%, and  recurring client transaction activity was robust. We've now fully lapped all the revenue synergies from the GRG acquisition in January 2023.\n More importantly, our best-in-class technology, service and products allow us to have market-leading retention and client acquisition, which you can see in our results. We continue to make significant investments in this business through increased sales and marketing resources as well as new product capabilities.  Over the last few years, we have transformed this business into becoming the largest nonbank provider of B2B FX payment solutions in the world.\n Turning to Vehicle Payments. Recall this is the new segment that we introduced on our last earnings call. It reflects the combination of our Fleet and Brazil businesses, along with our new consumer vehicle initiative. Consistent with our goal of creating a simpler company, we have now put all vehicle-related payment solutions in one segment that operates across North America, Brazil and Europe, offering a full suite of vehicle-related solutions to both businesses and consumers.\n You'll note that we have defined the new segment's KPI as transactions. But given the different products that comprise the segment, we've provided transaction counts by product type, such as fleet, tags and parking. We've also realigned our executive team to support this new segment, with Armando Netto serving as the Group President of North America and Brazil, and Alan King as the Group President over International Fuel, EV and Parking.\n Vehicle Payments organic revenue increased 5% during the quarter, with particular strength in Brazil and international fuel markets. In the U.K., more than 30% of all new sales involve a nonfuel product. namely EV or vehicle maintenance. Our EV strategy in the U.K. is clearly winning as our 3-in-1 product, fuel, on-road charging and at-home charging, all in one app has more than doubled from a year ago. The results speak for themselves with both EV cards and EV revenue continuing to increase.\n In addition, we're having great success selling our at-home charging solution with a 30% attachment rate to all new sales. Our charging network also continues to expand, and we now offer charging at over 600,000 charge points in Europe. And by the end of March, we will have coverage of nearly 80% of the rapid chargers in the U.K., including Tesla, which we signed in the fourth quarter.\n In Brazil, we ended the year with nearly 6,000 extended network locations, including 2,500 gas stations, 2,900 parking locations, 750 drive-through restaurants and 270 condos. Total tags were up 7% year-over-year to nearly 7 million and approximately 37% of customer spend was from our Beyond Toll network. Sales of insurance policies are up fourfold when we launched in Q4 '22 to nearly $200,000 in Q4 '23, so from 0 to $200,000 per quarter in 5 quarters and now total over 1 million policies.\n Our success in Brazil is a tangible proof point of our broader vehicle payments vision to leverage an anchor product used by a large customer base and to then add additional services via a mobile app driving incremental revenue growth. We are leveraging our strong success in the U.K. to launch our consumer vehicles payment solution in the market. We have begun selling the parking network that we acquired in the third quarter via PayByPhone to our business customers and are building the integrations to be able to offer to the over 2 million PayByPhone consumer users in the U.K. access to our proprietary fuel, EV, insurance, toll and maintenance networks.\n In the U.S., softness in small fleet and the impact from our shift away from micro clients continue to affect our sales and revenue results. Our digital and field sales efforts are improving as we continue to see growth in applications, approvals and starts. As we mentioned last quarter, the shift to higher credit quality clients also impacted late fees, which were down 38% from Q4 '22. While the decline in late fees is a drag on our revenue growth, it has resulted in a similar decline in bad debt expense, so essentially a wash.\n Lodging revenue was flat Q4 2022, and for the year, the business grew 12%. This quarter was affected by continued softness in our existing workforce customers, which appears to have now stabilized. Certain verticals within the business like airline and insurance can have quarterly revenue growth fluctuations driven by weather and natural disasters. Recall in Q4 of last year, there were significant weather events and airline cancellations, which benefited the airline and the insurance verticals.\n By comparison, there were no major weather events in Q4 of this year. And in fact, according to the Department of Transportation, 2023 flight cancellations were the lowest in a decade, and in the fourth quarter, cancellations were down approximately 90% from Q4 '22. We're experiencing similar results related to insurance claims, which were down approximately 20% in the quarter. Despite the recent soft quarters, we are confident that this business can return to low double-digit growth over the coming quarters.\n We recently launched new product capabilities that will extend our customer experience and drive new sales. Additionally, we're excited to welcome Joff Romoff as the new Group President of Lodging, replacing the retiring Ron Rogers. Joff has extensive hospitality and lodging experience that will be a strong asset to the business. In summary, we're proud of the performance we delivered in 2023. It clearly demonstrates the growth of our diversified business and the strength of our business model that generated over  $1.25 billion of free cash flow.\n Now looking down the income statement. Q4 operating expenses of $513 million were flat versus Q4 of last year. Expenses from acquisitions, higher transaction and sales activities and investments to drive future growth were offset by lower bad debt expense and the sale of our Russia business. Bad debt expense declined $19 million or nearly 50% from last year to $22 million or 3 basis points of spend. Most of the decline was in vehicle payments, which was down $17 million year-over-year as we realize the benefit from our lower exposure to U.S. micro clients.\n EBITDA margin in the quarter was 54.2%, a 220 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of last year. This positive operating leverage is driven by solid revenue growth, lower bad debt expense, disciplined expense management and synergies realized from recent acquisitions. Interest expense this quarter increased $18 million year-over-year, and the impact of higher interest rates resulted in an approximate $0.27 drag on Q4 adjusted EPS, partially offset by lower debt balances year-over-year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.3% versus 24.2% last year. The lower rate related to specific tax planning items.\n Now turning to the balance sheet. We are entering 2024 with the balance sheet in excellent shape. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in unrestricted cash, up $300 million from 90 days ago, and we had over $800 million available on our revolver. We have $5.4 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, and we had $1.4 billion borrowed under our securitization facility. As of year-end, our leverage ratio was 2.4x trailing 12 months EBITDA, which is at the lower end of our target range.\n In January, we upsized our term loan A and revolver A credit facilities by $600 million with no rate concessions and no change in the maturity. This added capital will provide incremental capacity and flexibility for both deals and share buybacks in 2024, which I'll elaborate on in a few minutes. Our capital allocation in 2023 was once again balanced as we deployed $1.6 billion. In the quarter, we repurchased roughly 600,000 shares at an average price of $254 per share or $143 million. For the year, we repurchased 2.6 million shares for $690 million.\n We spent $545 million on acquisitions during the year, improving our position in EV, the consumer vehicle payment space and cross-border. We used the remaining excess cash flows for debt amortization and reducing our revolver balance.  As I previously mentioned, our 2024 capital allocation plan is supported by our significant cash and liquidity position. We have $1.4 billion in unrestricted cash and increased our capacity on our revolver by $600 million, and we expect to generate $1.4 billion in free cash flow during 2024. Our first priority remains M&A, and the M&A pipeline is robust. We'll look to acquire businesses that deepen our position in our 3 core operating segments. \n We are also allocating capital for share buybacks during 2024. In January, the Board increased our repurchase authorization by $1 billion. We now have over $1.6 billion authorized for share repurchases. We expect to repurchase $800 million of shares throughout the year. We plan to purchase these shares through the open market and will establish a 10b5-1 plan later this month. Any residual cash flows from earnings will be used to reduce our revolver or build our cash position. Generating so much cash is a high-class problem, and we plan to leverage this strength to systematically support our EPS growth through M&A and buybacks in 2024.\n Now let me share some thoughts on our 2024 full year and Q1 outlook. From an economic perspective,  we are not assuming a recession nor a meaningful economic improvement in overall business activity. Our forecast for the year is based on the consensus economic outlook in our markets, which generally calls for modest economic growth and lower interest rates in the second half of the year. We expect fuel prices to be a headwind in the first quarter, and for the full year, we're anticipating U.S. fuel prices to average $3.65 per gallon, which is a blend of diesel and unleaded. In 2024, we expect cash EPS to grow between 14% and 16%, which is inclusive of the planned buybacks I mentioned previously.\n Revenue growth is projected to be between 8% and 10%, and EBITDA is expected to increase 10% to 12% with margin expanding to approximately 54%. Keep in mind these growth rates are inclusive of our Russia business through mid-August of last year. Excluding Russia, cash EPS is growing 17% to 19%, revenue is up 10% to 12%, and EBITDA is increasing 13% to 15%, all slightly above our midterm growth targets. We've provided these details in our earnings supplement on Page 20.\n Net interest expense is projected to be between $340 million and $370 million, which includes the replacement of a $500 million interest rate swap that matured in December. Roughly 80% of our credit facility is now fixed utilizing swaps, and the blended swap rate is 4.1%. Also recall that our securitization is a variable rate facility. And finally, our tax rate is expected to be between 25% and 26%.\n From a segment perspective, we expect the following organic revenue growth rates: Vehicle Payments in the mid-single digits; Corporate Payments approximately 20%; Lodging Payments in the high single digits. Related to the quarters, we expect revenue growth in the first half of the year to be below our full year average due to the continued pockets of softness, a tough comp that includes Russia as well as a challenging operating environment, including lower fuel prices.\n We expect revenue growth to accelerate in the back half of the year as the economic outlook becomes clear, we lap the divestiture of Russia and we realize the benefits of our growth initiatives and new sales. For the first quarter, we're expecting revenue to grow between 3% and 5% and cash EPS to increase between 6% and 8%, which also reflects higher interest rates. Normalizing for Russia, revenue and cash EPS growth at the midpoint would be 7% and 13%, respectively. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement.\n Before completing my prepared remarks, I would like to extend our gratitude to our more than 10,000 employees around the world who helped us deliver such a great year and who will be the driving force to even greater heights throughout 2024.\n Thank you for your interest in our company. And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. And Darrin, one thing I'd add before Ron gets to your other question about longer-term vehicle. Keep in mind the first half of last year had the elevated late fees from the SMB micro clients that we still have on the platform. So we all start lapping that until you get into late Q2, so that creates a little bit of a grow-over challenge when you look at it on an annual basis. And, Nate, we've actually seen card penetration levels tick up a little bit. So at the end of the day, it kind of comes down to the amount of spend that's on a card, and that's moved up as you look at it over a quarterly trend. Sure, Sanjay. It's Tom. So thinking big picture macro, let's start there, and then we can talk a little bit in terms of a more detailed macro as it relates to -- specific to our company. But big picture macro, we're expecting an economic outlook to stay relatively consistent, completely in line with the broad economic guide.\n When you look at our 3 major markets of Brazil, U.S. and U.K. we expect in all of those markets to see a relatively stable, maybe slightly improving economy as rate cuts in those various markets occur, but we're not expecting any kind of recession, and certainly, we're not expecting a GDP kind of gangbuster-type year.\n With respect to the more narrow macro that affects FLEETCOR, kind of think about it in terms of a couple of categories. First, fuel. Fuel price, average fuel price, diesel and unleaded combined, of $3.65. That's a little below where we are today. If you just kind of look at where we are through 2024, we're probably closer to a blended rate of around $3.40.\n So that's one of the call outs that we had in terms of the Q1 growth challenge. But we're not prognosticators of oil and the pull-through to fuel. We just look at EIA and other providers of those things. That was the consensus view of how the year would play out. I think as demand increases from a seasonal perspective, you would see that increase.\n Spreads, generally consistent with last year. That's really hard to predict. It's more based on volatility of fuel price, not just absolute. So that's kind of in base gas, but we look at historical trends and done some modeling, so we expect spreads to be relatively consistent. FX, a little bit of a tailwind. If the dollar and rate cuts continue -- the projection is correct and the dollar doesn't strengthen -- it had a little bit of strengthening over the last week or so, but longer term, we expect the dollar to be a little weaker, and so that will help the FX side of our business.\n And we think overall, that will be a slight tailwind to us. Rates, generally kind of neutral to better. We have modeled out the rate curve based on the latest rate curve out there. So we think rates will be a little bit better. Certainly interest expense lapping the headwind from this year in terms of the grow over from '22 will be a significant benefit to us.\n And then I guess, finally, taxes, we think will be generally consistent with the full year tax rate in 2023. So overall, we characterized the macro as kind of neutral to -- from a macro perspective, big macro perspective, and kind of a slight benefit to us with respect to things that affect us directly. Sheriq, give me your page number again. You said 27? 37. Okay, sorry. Yes, so a lot of that has to just do with the channel mix. So as Ron mentioned earlier, in terms of the way -- the amount of take rate we have on channel versus the direct business, as we saw the channel volume fluctuate in the quarter, that's what's causing the fluctuation in the take rate related to Corporate Payments. Yes. I don't think it's kind of disproportionate one way or another. Just kind of round it out, just to summarize, for the year, we were at 53%. We were exiting around 54%, and we guided for the full year 2024 to be at 54%, and probably exiting a little bit higher than that, as you would expect. And so it's not really one -- one, there's not a lot of change there. You're talking about, give or take, 100, 150 basis points.\n And secondly, I think it's more of the structure of the business that's driving the margin, not necessarily something that we're doing necessarily inside the business to modify the existing business model and the structure. So just as we grow at the levels at which each of the businesses are growing from a revenue and sales perspective and the amount of fixed cost, you're just going to get this natural operating leverage benefit from margin where you'll see that rotate up. So at the same time, we also want to continue to invest. \n I guess, fair point. Yes, credit is coming down a little bit, '23 to '24, that would also help the margin. But the other thing just from the standpoint of just investment, we continue to make significant investments in the company, particularly around sales and marketing. And so we are mindful in terms of the amount of spend that we're putting back into the company to make sure that the sales engine can continue to generate the  kind of growth levels that we've historically generated. Sure. Trevor, it's Tom. So the Lodging business, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, it did experience softness. Where our biggest surprise was for the quarter was really more on the airline and the insurance piece. We actually saw the workforce piece come in about where we had anticipated, and a lot of the expected growth that we had forecast in the fourth quarter was from what we've seen historically, with the level of flight cancelations related to our distressed product, where you typically would see a seasonal uptick. There's lots of people in the air with holidays and things like that. And that just didn't come to fruition.\n Similarly on the insurance side, we saw the decline in the overall insurance. So the decline quarter-over-quarter in lodging was really more directed towards those 2 businesses where those types of episodic-type things that occur in the fourth quarter just didn't materialize.  Workforce, we continue to see a little bit of softness there, but as Ron had indicated, we feel like that has [ topped ] out and expect that to move forward based on new sales and the introductions of the new products. It's kind of belts and suspenders. It was also some minimums as well. So that we also got some protection that while we're under contract, we also have some commitments from a minimum perspective, too. Yes, I mean I'd say it's fairly normal. Obviously, it's going to fluctuate from a dollar perspective as the business grows. We think of it more in terms of basis points of spend or percentage of revenue because as the business grows, you'd expect the bad debt dollar amount to grow, but not necessarily that rate to necessarily grow.\n So I think we'll continue to see good performance in 2024. We have -- plus the micro client that Ron said, we've tuned some of our models. We've gotten to a point where I think we've learned a lot over the last, call it, 6 quarters, and I think we'll be in a position where we can be a bit more opportunistic in terms of how we manage credit. Yes. Michael, it's Tom. I think we're going to be mindful in terms of market conditions, and we like where the stock price is. As I mentioned, we're flush with liquidity, both on the balance sheet and then when we upsized the revolver, we have another $600 million of liquidity. Obviously, we want to use some of that liquidity for M&A.\n But you add it all up, we have probably up to $2.5 billion, $3 billion worth of cash that we want to put to work, and we want to put it to work as quickly as possible. So I think the timing is just going to be predicated on the market, the amount of the floating stock and those types of things. But I think we will be looking to be in the market over the course of this quarter, and then we'll see how market conditions are as the year plays out."

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Wednesday, November 8, 2023. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Eglseder, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nJames Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Panther, our CFO. Following the prepared comments, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. \n Please note, our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section on our website at fleetcor.com. Throughout this call, we will be covering organic revenue growth. Now as a reminder, this metric neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads. And it also includes pro forma results for acquisitions and divestitures or scope changes closed during the 2 years being compared. \n We will also be covering non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than at other companies. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website. I need to remind everyone that part of today's discussion may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our outlook, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. \n They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We undertake no obligation to update any of these statements. The expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. \n So now with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? \nRonald F. Clarke: Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today. Upfront here, I plan to cover 3 subjects: first, our financials, our Q3 results, our Q4 guidance and a brief 2024 preview. Second, I'll provide an update on our strategic review and where we're coming out. And then lastly, I'll introduce our fleet transformation plan, which is aimed at accelerating the revenue growth of that business. Okay. \n Let me begin with our Q3 results, which were generally in line with our expectations. We reported revenue of $971 million, up 9%, and cash EPS of $4.49, up 6% versus last year. But it would have been up 16% at constant interest rates. Q3 macro, weaker than our August outlook. Our fuel spreads contracted about 25% in the quarter, and that was the result of a $0.50 fuel price point-to-point increase from the Q2 exit to the Q3 exit, which compresses fuel spreads. \n Look, despite this weaker macro, our Q3 earnings powered through. We actually finished a few cents ahead of our August guide if you exclude just the Russia and PayByPhone transactions. Overall, organic revenue growth for Q3, up 10%. Inside of that, our Corporate Payments business maintained its 20% growth rate. So super pleased there. \n Our pivot, which we started last year in North America fuel away from new super small micro accounts clearly paid dividends this quarter. Our North America fuel credit losses went in half from about $24 million last year to $12 million this year. \n Trends in the quarter are generally quite good. Continued strong demand for our products. Our new sales, up 17% versus prior year, so very good. Retention remaining stable across the enterprise at 91%. Our same-store sales did soften a bit, from flat last quarter to kind of minus 1 this quarter. We did notice pretty noticeable softening in our managed services subsegment in Lodging, which we're digging into. \n Our Q3 EBITDA reached $529 million, $529 million, an all-time record high for the company, held by EBITDA margins, which expanded to 54.5%. That's up about 200 basis points versus last year. So all in all, I'd say a pretty good Q3 performance. Okay. \n Let me make the turn to our updated Q4 guidance, which reflects a couple of changes in scope, so the Russia divestiture, which we mentioned last time, and the recent PayByPhone acquisition. We've also refreshed the Q4 macro, which is outlooking a bit weaker FX than we saw in August. \n So look, despite these adjustments and these pressures, the fundamentals, quite good such that our underlying Q4 profit guide is actually a bit stronger than our view 90 days ago. You can see on Page 14 in our earnings supplement that refreshed bridge. \n So we're updating Q4 guidance today to $968 million in revenue at the midpoint and $4.49 in cash EPS at the midpoint. So really, right on top of our Q3 print. Here again, historically, Q3 and Q4 results have been very similar. This updated Q4 guide implies a 10% organic revenue growth in the quarter and a 14% EBITDA growth. So again, the forecast, really spot on to our [ 10-13-19 ] compounding model. \n Okay. Let me transition to our preliminary view of 2024, which I characterize the setup is quite encouraging. So we're outlooking the 2024 macro environment to be neutral to maybe slightly positive. And that's simply looking at the various macro factors as they exit this year into next year. Revenue, we're outlooking, again, although early, organic revenue growth in the same 9% to 11% range. That's consistent with prior years. And then lastly, kind of the key profit drivers of the business generally setting up favorably. So we're expecting lower bad debt, flat to lower interest expense, and a stable tax rate and share count. So generally, a good setup. So look, although it's early days in our '24 planning, I'd say we generally like what we see. All right. \n Let me shift gears and provide an update on our strategic review. As a reminder, the goal of our strategic review or portfolio review is really twofold: so first, to make a simpler company; and then second, to evaluate separation options to increase shareholder value. \n On the simplification front, we've done a few things. We've sold Russia. We decided to keep our prepaid business although we are working a couple of other non-core asset sales. And we're moving to 3 primary reporting segments, all of these things to make a simpler company. On the separation front, we've concluded not to pursue a pure spin, and that's mainly looking at RemainCo derating risk. \n We've also decided not to pursue a strategic sale. Primarily, they are due to tax leakage and our estimate of dis-synergies. But we are continuing to evaluate a couple separation alternatives with [ dance ] partners that we think are potentially pretty attractive. So we do expect to conclude those discussions with the counter-parties over the next 90 days, and we'll certainly report back then. Okay. \n My last subject is to introduce our fleet transformation plan, which we believe is the single most important thing, effort to unlock shareholder value and re-rate our stock. So the objective of the fleet transformation plan is to accelerate our global Fleet business growth in the double digits, so that we have 3 big primary businesses that can all target double-digit revenue growth. We have prepared a few slides in our lengthy earnings supplement beginning on Page 22 to help walk you through how we intend to accelerate fleet growth. \n The plan really centers around 3 big ideas. So first, BAU. On the BAU front, we plan to get at performance improvement through new fleet products, which we're leasing into the market now. And these products join up with our corporate payment products to really create a differentiated offering in the marketplace. As you may recall, we're also pivoting that business from kind of small micro prospects to a bit larger seam prospects, both from repointing our digital marketing machine and adding additional field and Zoom reps targeted at this slightly larger market segment. The emphasis will be on two primary verticals. Those are field services and construction, both of which are big significant opportunities. \n Second, underpinning for the plan is EV. We believe we can capitalize on the EV transition. We're getting much more confident that our 3-in-1 commercial fleet EV-ICE solution is really is a winner and that we can maintain or maybe even increase our fleet revenues throughout the transition. So early experience in the U.K. over the last 11 quarters bears this out. Revenue per EV vehicle running higher than revenue per ICE vehicle. So again, pretty positive. \n Then lastly, is this idea of a consumer vehicle payments business versus just the B2B vehicle payments business. And so the idea is to further expand on that front and really just leverage the networks, the payment networks, the merchant relationships we have, that we built on the B2B side over the last 20 years. So the idea would be we start with anchor apps. So think toll tags in Brazil or digital parking in the U.K. that have millions of active mobile users and then offer additional vehicle payment-related solutions that utilize our payment networks. So for example, utilize our EV network or utilize our service repair network. \n We've demonstrated success in this approach in Brazil. Over 60% of our active consumer toll users now use a second or even third payment solution like parking or insurance. So we think, pretty exciting. Additionally, this consumer vehicle payments push does open up additional interesting acquisition targets. For example, PayByPhone and literally other ones as well. \n So look, we believe that we have the potential to incrementally drive the overall fleet/vehicle business into double-digit territory via these 3 ideas. So again, kind of new fleet products, combined with corporate payment products targeted to a couple of big verticals, success in the EV transition and the build-out of a big billion dollar consumer vehicle payments business, clearly well underway in Brazil, and then we hope to accelerate with this PayByPhone acquisition. \n You can actually see our forecast math, the build to $1 billion, on Page 29 of the supplement. This anticipates that this expanded consumer vehicle leg growing fast can pull a low single-digit core fleet card business into double-digit growth territory. So literally, maybe 12%. \n So look, in conclusion, today, we're forecasting 2023 pretty much where we started out in February of this year. In and around $17 of cash EPS. That's despite selling Russia and having a bit unfavorable macro. '24 outlook early, but I'd say encouraging. Still busy on some active separation, discussions with some counter-parties. We expect to conclude that in 90 days. And then lastly, this fleet transformation plan, we think, quite exciting. We believe it has the potential to reaccelerate the Fleet business and really potentially lift the entire enterprise to faster growth. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Tom to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Tom? \nThomas Panther: Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Here are some additional details related to the quarter. Let me start by acknowledging that it was an active quarter with the sales of the Russia business, the acquisition of PayByPhone and significant movements in fuel prices and FX rates. I'll address the impact from each of these factors to better compare our actual results to our previous guidance. \n First, our prior guidance included a full year of revenue and earnings from the Russia fuel business. Based on the August 15 closing date and final cash proceeds, the disposition of Russia resulted in $12 million of lower revenue and $0.06 of lower cash EPS. Secondly, the acquisition of PayByPhone on September 15 added $2 million of revenue and was $0.01 dilutive to adjusted earnings. \n Turning to the macro headwinds in the quarter. Compared to the assumptions used for our guidance in August, the total negative impact was $17 million. Average fuel prices of $3.88 were 7% higher during the quarter, resulting in a $4 million benefit. However, it's important to note the point-to-point increase in fuel price from July 1 to September 30 was around $0.50. The majority of this 15% increase occurred in August and plateaued for the remainder of the quarter. Underlying that rapid increase in the retail fuel price was an even greater increase in wholesale fuel costs, which compressed fuel spreads approximately 25%, compared to our forecast, adversely affecting revenue by $13 million. So the net impact from changes in fuel prices on revenue was a $9 million headwind. \n It's typical when fuel prices rapidly increase for spreads to compress due to wholesale fuel prices increasing faster than retail prices, which can overwhelm the fuel price increase benefit. We get asked regularly, if there's a way to track the price and spread impact. We found that OPIS or the Oil Price Information Service, which is a subscription-based provider, does a good job depicting retail and wholesale fuel prices and the resulting spread. \n Now turning to FX rates. The significant strengthening of the dollar beginning in August, when the Fed's tone became more hawkish, caused the dollar to strengthen relative to our foreign currencies, resulting in an $8 million drag on revenue. \n In summary, if we knew in early August what we know now about these factors I just discussed, our guide would have been revenue of $963 million and cash EPS of $4.33 per share compared to our reported results of $971 million and $4.49 per share. The majority of the $8 million revenue beat came from our international businesses. Our earnings out-performance is particularly impressive because the flow-through of our revenue results, combined with our strong expense management and lower bad debt expense, enabled us to power through the macro headwind and still exceed our pro forma August cash EPS guidance, when adjusting only for the impact from Russia and PayByPhone. We've included Slide 7 in our earnings supplement that walks you through these moving parts. \n Now on to more details regarding our results for the quarter, focusing on year-over-year revenue growth. Organic revenue growth was 10%, reflecting the diversification of our business and the realization of the strong sales that we've produced throughout the year. Year-over-year, lower fuel prices resulted in a $12 million reduction in revenue, and lower fuel price spreads reduced revenue by $23 million. FX rates were favorable relative to last year, translating into a $15 million benefit. So net-net, a $20 million macro headwind versus last year. Putting aside the macro noise in comparison to our prior guidance, GAAP revenue increased 9%, which reflects the business' ability to consistently deliver solid revenue growth. \n Corporate Payments revenue was up 20%, driven by 20% growth in spend. Strength in our direct business, which grew over 30%, was again led by outstanding growth in full AP. Our comprehensive menu of high-quality payment solutions continues to sell extremely well, up 28% as we sign up new customers who are looking to modernize their AP operations. We also continue to expand our proprietary merchant network and increase the amount of cardable spend. Cross-border revenue was up 19% as sales also grew 28% and recurring client transaction activity was robust. We are the largest nonbank FX provider in the world, and the name recognition we now have is a real advantage when we compete for our clients' business. More importantly, our best-in-class capabilities, service and products allow us to have market-leading retention and client acquisition, which you can see in our results. \n Turning to our Fleet business. Organic revenue increased 4%. We experienced strength in our international markets. And in the U.K., we are pleased with the continued strong sales performance of our 3-in-1 product offering, which customers find very attractive as they add EVs to their fleet. In the U.S., some softness in small fleet, in addition to the impact from our shift away from micro clients, are affecting our sales and overall results. Our shift to higher-credit quality clients also impacted late fees, which were down 21% from Q3 2022. While the decline in late fees results in a drag on our revenue growth, it has been more than offset by a decline in bad debt expense, which I'll comment on later. But it's important to point out that our decision to pivot up market has been EBITDA positive. \n Lastly, as Ron mentioned, we continue to refine our go-to-market strategy to acquire larger customers and we are excited about the rollout of additional products that we expect will drive a significant uplift in sales heading into next year and going forward. \n Before I move on, Ron addressed the PayByPhone acquisition and how it fits into our fleet transformation strategy. To give you some deal specifics, PayByPhone is the world's second largest global parking payments platform, with over 6 million monthly active users on its mobile app. Their network covers approximately 4 million parking spaces primarily in North America, the U.K. and Europe, and they process over 200 million transactions annually, totaling $900 million in spend. We paid approximately $300 million for the company and expect to realize about $50 million in revenue next year. \n Now to Brazil, where revenue grew 16% compared to last year, driven by 7% tag growth. Our tag growth enables us to further increase the proportion of revenue from our expanded network of products where we earn incremental revenue. In the quarter, approximately 35% of customer spend was from our expanded network. Fuel is a great example of how we're expanding our product network with the number of tag-enabled gas stations growing 25% and transactions up over 40%. Our extensive network enabled us to generate 20% sales growth in the quarter over the prior year with almost 30% of the sales coming from non-tag products. Our success in Brazil is a tangible proof point of our broader vehicle payment strategy, where we leverage an anchor product used by a large customer base to deliver additional products and services driving incremental revenue growth. \n Lastly, we've received some questions over the last several quarters about the potential impact of the Brazilian government deploying free-flow tolling, where the toll station reads the license plate and the individual pays the toll after the fact by going to a website. Now that these free-flow stations have been in place for a few years, our experience is that we actually sell more tags when these toll stations are installed because the tag user receives a small discount and is able to pay the toll automatically via their tag. This frictionless customer experience drives incremental demand for our product. \n Lodging revenue increased 10% against a tough prior year Q3 comp where the business had grown 28%. It's not unusual for the business to have quarterly revenue growth fluctuations driven by weather and natural disaster variability. Year-to-date, the business is up 16%. This quarter's performance was highlighted by sales success across our industry verticals. In addition to revenue per night, which increased 20%, driven primarily from channel and product mix, namely from our distressed passenger product and higher hotel commission revenue. Offsetting that to some degree was softness in our construction and transportation verticals as the weaker macroeconomic environment is impacting these sectors. We expect this softness to rebound as the economic outlook becomes clear. \n Before leaving the segments, I want to briefly comment on our expectation to move to 3 primary business segments. We're making this change in how we operate the company in the fourth quarter and reflect the new segments in our 10-K. \n Now looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses of $526 million represent a 4% increase versus Q3 of last year, driven by acquisitions, increases tied to higher transaction and sales activities, and investments to drive future growth, partially offset by lower FX rates and the sale of our Russia business. \n Bad debt expense declined 22% from last year to $29 million or 6 basis points of spend. Within that, fleet bad debt expense was down $15 million year-over-year as we realized the benefit from lower exposure to micro clients as previously discussed. EBITDA margin in the quarter was 54.5%, a 225 basis point improvement from the third quarter of last year. After normalizing for the Russia sale, we still expect our full year EBITDA margin to exit this year 200 to 250 basis points better than the prior year. This positive operating leverage is driven by solid revenue growth, lower bad debt expense, disciplined expense management and synergies realized from recent acquisitions. \n Interest expense increased $43 million year-over-year, driven by the increase in SOFR on our debt stack and higher debt balances driven by acquisitions. The impact of higher interest rates resulted in an approximate $0.44 drag on Q3 adjusted EPS. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.6% versus 26.8% last year. \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in unrestricted cash and we had $660 million available on our revolver. We have $5.6 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, and we had $1.4 billion borrowed under our securitization facility. \n As of September 30, our leverage ratio was 2.66x trailing 12-month EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. We repurchased 2 million shares in the quarter for $530 million, including the ASR we announced in conjunction with the Russia sale. And we have over $700 million authorized for share repurchases. We have ample liquidity to pursue near-term M&A opportunities, and we'll continue to buy back shares when it makes sense. \n Now turning to our guidance. Let me start by bridging the implied Q4 guidance we provided in August to reflect the acquisition and divestiture activity during the quarter and current macro environment. The sale of the Russia business would reduce revenue by $30 million, and the acquisition of PayByPhone would increase revenue by $10 million. We're now expecting a $20 million macro headwind versus what we thought back in August, driven primarily by worse FX rates, partially offset by higher fuel prices of $3.96. Making these pro forma adjustments to our prior Q4 guide lowers revenue to $968 million and adjusted earnings per share to $4.34 per share at the midpoint. We've included Slide 14 in the earnings presentation that lays out these factors. \n With that pro forma reference point established, let me comment on our Q4 outlook that includes the factors I just mentioned. We're expecting revenue to be between $953 million and $983 million, representing 10% growth versus last year at the midpoint. And we expect adjusted net income per share to be between $4.34 and $4.64 per share, which, at the midpoint, is up 11% over what we reported in Q4 2022. So similar to the third quarter, we expect to generate solid year-over-year revenue and earnings growth despite some softening economic conditions in our markets. Based on this Q4 guidance, for the full year, we now expect GAAP revenues between $3.774 billion and $3.804 billion, adjusted net income between $1.252 billion and $1.276 billion, adjusted net income per diluted share between $16.82 and $17.12 per share, and EBITDA growth of 14% and EBITDA margin of 53%. \n Thank you for your interest in FLEETCOR. And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Good results in a tough backdrop here. Ron, could you give us a little bit more color on the strategic actions you're considering in this spin-or-merge scenario with these [ dance ] partners? Maybe you can just speak to what certain permutations might be? \nRonald F. Clarke: Sure, Sanjay. So it's really mostly in around our Corporate Payments business. And so we have a couple of interesting counter-parties where we might separate something and actually have a pure play that has more scale and synergies and stuff. And so we're kind of in the final mile of working through those conversations and seeing whether there's something there. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Understood. And then sort of appreciate the preliminary organic revenue outlook for next year. I guess when we think about the different variables from a macro standpoint, whether it be the economy and then obviously FX and such, can you just give us a sense of sort of where we're at with that? Like what are you guys baking into that organic growth in terms of backdrop, the macro backdrop? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I think generally, the comment I gave is comp. So if you look at the various macro factors and the way we're exiting both fuel price spreads, FX, et cetera, I'd say that sitting here today, it feels like kind of a neutral-ish to maybe a smidge positive. And so obviously, our organic stuff puts that to the side, right, that it is between print and organic. But I'd say I did want to just provide a bit of a preview that unlike this year, Sanjay, with interest rates up, whatever, 400 basis points, that the grow over basically across some of our key profit levers looks quite good. So the setup looks way more normalized than it has in the last couple of years. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: I know you guys covered a lot here. I wanted to ask on the -- maybe for you, Ron, just on the consumer vehicle payments, the $1 billion that you're talking about '27. Do you have the assets you need today to get to that $1 billion? And do you expect the margin profile at that time to be different since this is a consumer or CDP business as you called out? \nRonald F. Clarke: It's a great question. Good to talk. We can only get into this debate, Tien-Tsin, tonight. So yes, we've got a couple, I'd say, of additional transactions that we're looking at to fill out a couple of the product lines. But this is -- I don't know how clear I was in it, but mostly an organic play where we get -- we use basically these big consumer active blocks, right, of accounts and just match it up with what we already have, right, which is the payment network and the merchants. And so the million dollar question there, Tien-Tsin, is just that velocity. So when we show 2 million people some additional related things, what's the take rate going to be? So I'd say that most of the thinking, both studying what we've done in Brazil and obviously studying this deal, the view is that it's organic.\n And the key, as you heard me talk a million times, is cost of sales. That's the key to growth and profitability. And so the good news is our view is we're not going to do tons of marketing. Hey, let's go out and spend gazillions of dollars, but rather try to light up big bases. So I'd say we like the EBITDA profile basically and getting that thing to go. So a couple more deals and mostly organic, that's the game plan. \nThomas Panther: Yes. And Tien-Tsin, we wouldn't expect it to be margin dilutive. Again, look at Brazil as our bellwether. It has attractive margins across the rest of our portfolio. So we think that's a good indicator of what the overall business can be as it expands. \nRonald F. Clarke: To add on to tension, as you know, we're always lower cost, right, than new, new accounts. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Sure. No, I like it. I mean it's exciting. I think getting into the consumer side and getting the synergies there make a lot of sense. Just curious on the cost side, as you called out, but I'm sure you're thoughtful about that. And I'm glad to hear that it's in your margin zone. Just on the -- my follow-up then, just the 3 business lines and the cleaning up the reporting segments. I know we're going to get more. But is the general idea that it's going to be Corpay, vehicle payments and, I suppose lodging? And can you give us an idea on the margin differences between the three? Because I think as we're thinking about our own sum of the parts, I know there are a lot of different views on the profitability across those three. But is there any high-level thoughts that you can share on that? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Let me start, Tien-Tsin, just on the segments, yes. So segment one will be vehicle, which will be our global Fleet business, our Brazil business and then honestly, really, this consumer, which is a big part of the Brazil thing today, so the PayByPhone and the other things would be in that. Second business, obviously, Corporate Payments and then third business, Lodging. So those would be the three lines. \nThomas Panther: Yes. And for your modeling, we're really just combining Fleet and Brazil today. And so based on how we report operating income and how you may model the business at a more detailed level, it would just be a simple summation of those two. We wouldn't anticipate any type of shift in the margin profile. It's just bringing those two together into the vehicle payments segment. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. \nDarrin Peller: I mean sticking to just the current -- the segment themselves from this past quarter, they were strong in the Corpay side. And then suddenly, you hear that's such an important part of the strategic thinking going forward. But Ron, I'd love to just hear what you see going well there. There's obviously a lot of competitive chatter going on around macro headwinds, some debating structural changes. So just talk to us a little more about your strategic plans on that segment before any real mergers or anything else. Just standalone, what's going well? What do you anticipate it to look like over the next year? \nRonald F. Clarke: Good question, Darrin. Mostly everything, right, is going well to post, I don't know how many quarters now, 20%. But quite a few from where I'm looking at going forward. And I think the sales inside of the 17% were in the mid-to-high 20s for that line of business, so that tells us that we're selling a lot. There's a lot of demand. In terms of what's working well and not well today, everything is working well with the exception of that channel business, which we've spoken of.\n So again, that thing continues to decline but will become, as you know, a much smaller part of the total, which implies again that the direct business is growing closer to 25% to 30%. So look, as I said before, we spent whatever the last couple of years assembling stuff, right, software, getting scale, getting more scale across border. And now the game is really marketing and sales. We put the brand out a while ago. We've added head count as you see in the sales growth rate. So that's the game now. It's really just to drive new sales faster and get those implemented. And unlike some other people have reported, to your point, because we're a middle market, the book is pretty stable, right? Our same-store sales look stable exiting the quarter, so we're not seeing any of that. \nThomas Panther: We haven't seen erosion on the supplier level either. We continue to see good network expansion. Cardable spend continues to gradually move up. So the interest level from the merchant side and the supplier side continues to be favorable. \nDarrin Peller: That's really helpful color. Ron, just a quick follow-up to the prepaid business decision. Just maybe just take a step back on why you decided to keep that now? And are there any other non-core assets that do make sense to sell potentially? \nRonald F. Clarke: Good follow-up. I think ultimately, Darrin, we just like the business more than some of the people that looked at it. So when you look at the tax leakage and dilution from that, I'd say that we spent a lot of time making that a better business than when we shopped it 3 years ago. And so the premium that we were looking for about what it's worth today, right, to pay the tax, I think people didn't get close enough to where we or I wanted to see the thing. So we feel good enough to hold it.\n With that said, as part of this review, we went through all the other kind of small non-core things. So we do have 2 kind of non-core things that we're kind of actively talking to buyers about. So there's a couple of hanging chads left there. But both that and the broader counter-party thing, we will have mopped up when we come back to you in 90 days. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: I have a quick follow-up on the consumer, the new consumer business. How should we think about that from kind of a geographic perspective? Is it a plan that you're kind of going to execute sort of all over the place, depending on whether helpful assets become available in key geographies? Or are you focused just on the U.S. or Europe? Or how are you looking at that? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Look, great question, Ramsey. So if you step back, our current business is really in 3 markets, 3 countries, call it, 90% of the company. Right here, Brazil and the U.K., so that would be the answer. So we're -- of the $1 billion target, we're, I don't know, $350 million or $400 million consumer payment business in Brazil today and close to 0, right, in the U.K. and the U.S. And so part of this PayByPhone idea was to get a big customer base in the U.K. and in the U.S. where we already have these networks again was the idea. So there's no plan, for Tien-Tsin's other question, for us to go fire a young man to far away places and to try to build a business where we don't have networks and management and stuff. So Brazil, U.K., U.S., in that order, is how we're thinking about it. \nRamsey El-Assal: All right. Makes a ton of sense. And one follow-up. On the Lodging segment, you called out the tough year-over-year comparison this quarter. Also mentioned some softening in a subvertical. I think it was managed services. Just trying to think through how to model that out next quarter. The comp gets easier, but did the headwinds you're seeing in that managed services sort of subvertical stick around? Or should we expect more of a bounce back on the easier comp next quarter? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Good question. And unclear, I'd say. We thought -- I think I called this out because we started to see it in Q2. So again, let me go to the top and maybe this will be helpful. So inside of our Lodging business, we serve, call it, 4 or 5 different customer subsegments. So we do things like airlines, insurance, railroads, construction, things like that. So one of those segments is kind of this project-based segment. So think like consulting firms, retail merchandising people, environmental companies. It's only, I don't know, Ramsey, 300 to 400 clients in it. But they field pretty big teams of people. They go to places and stay for a while. So maybe 10 people go to a city and stay there for 2 or 3 weeks. So that's the nature of the business.\n So literally starting in Q2 and more in Q3, say 50 out of those 300 clients just start to go like super soft. So when we call them, they would say things like, oh, hey, Walmart, who's a big client for merchandising, moved that in-house. They're not using our third-party company to go there and do merchandising in their stores. Or hey, a couple of our construction clients flipped over to using some local contractors instead of their own people. So I'd say we're just not really sure. The good news is the other segments, we don't see it. It's mostly resident kind of in this one place. So I think we've printed, what Tom, 10% organic. So that thing actually went backwards, that [ managing ] a bit, while obviously, the rest of the businesses went forward. So we're kind of outlooking, Ramsey, the thing to kind of stay softish here in Q4. And then obviously, we hope to get a better idea when we make a turn in the next year. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Peter Christiansen from Citi. \nPeter Christiansen: Ron, I'm just curious now that you're through a good portion of the strategic review, and it seems like you certainly have a team set up for the next couple of quarters. Just curious on your thoughts on the use of share repurchase, leverage levels? And then secondary to that, how are you generally thinking about the trade-off between margin and growth here? Do you see an opportunity to invest? Maybe perhaps accelerate growth a bit more? Get more behind sales? Just curious on your thoughts on those relationships. \nRonald F. Clarke: Good question, Pete. So I'd say it's been a pretty busy and active, whatever it's been, 6 or 9 months strategic review. So look, the good news in it is when you put out an ad like that, it does generate incremental activity. So we do have, as I said, not only some separation discussions still going. But we've surfaced some additional M&A targets that are kind of interesting in and around the same space as people look to the phone. So look, I think our priorities around capital and leverage are kind of the same. Our target is 3. I think we're running, I don't know, 2.5 or 2.6.  We're buyers of our stock. Obviously, at this price, if we grow 9% to 11% next year, we grow the bottom faster. That's a 10x EBITDA multiple for company compounding in the team. So we're buyers of our stock. Let's say, 3x leverage, we'll go higher. \n For a deal, we do have again a few interesting things in this consumer space that have surfaced and a couple in our core Corporate Payments base that we're chasing. So like always, I'd say, those will be the two main uses. I think we'll generate, I don't know, low $1 billion to $1.3 billion-ish. I think it's in our early look at next year, plus we've got leverage still, right, where we're sitting today. And the EBITDA will grow next year. So a handful of deals and buy our stock back would be the order. \nPeter Christiansen: And then longer-term growth versus margin, are you coming out any differently post the review or as you go through the progress -- process? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, good question. So if you look at our print for 3 quarters and even into our guide, I think we've stepped up sequentially, as we said, right? EBITDA margin, I think I quoted between 54% and 55% this quarter. And I think Tom and I look at it kind of the same number for Q4. We kind of looked at our plan for next year, similarly, which gives us a little more money because we've kind of gone past some of these capability acquisitions. So I'd say we'll ramp up the sales and marketing investments a bit but look, initially at least, to try to keep the exit of our margin kind of between 54% and 55% as kind of the target for next year. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia from Bank of America. \nMihir Bhatia: The first question I had, I just wanted to go back to the fleet product transformation, so fleet segment transformation strategy. And on point one, where you talk about the Fuel+ business card, I wanted to ask a little bit more, if you could talk a little bit more about that. How is that different than the Beyond Fuel strategy that I think you all had a couple of years ago? I'm just trying to understand what kind of growth, et cetera, you expect that strategy to drive? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. It's a good question. So let me start by saying that most of the competition for the prospects that we're trying to get are on business cards. So in the older days, there was cash and house accounts and other things. And now when we look at the customers that we want to have that we don't have, many are on business cards. And some of those are on our competitors' fuel cards as well. And so the idea is really to go to new accounts with a combined -- effectively, a business card and a fuel card in one. So -- and target that against verticals that use fuel cards that have people in the field. Think of like field services like HVAC or construction, things like that.\n And so that's the basic idea that we've now wrapped -- I don't if you guys remember, we bought a company about 2 years ago called Roger that we re-branded as Corpay One. So we've wrapped all that technology now around a business card, so that it's mobile-centric kind of automated expense capture and stuff around the business card, and then connected that to our proprietary fuel card capabilities and networks. And so what you've got is a business card that's a little more high tech than some of the bank cards, combined to a fuel card that has controls and advantaged economics, and it's bundled into kind of one package and one account.\n And so the testing on it has been super duper good, and we're literally in the market selling the products now. So the biggest difference, I'd say, is the focus. It's new accounts versus back to the base. It's in a couple of verticals. And the product has been revamped or rewrapped with kind of some modern technology. \nMihir Bhatia: Got it. And then just -- well, maybe just switching back to the Corporate Payments segment for a second. And it's a little bit of a repeat of earlier question about just what is driving that strength that you were seeing? Like I appreciate that you are a little bit more mid-market. But some of the factors like just macro slowdown or large suppliers choosing to push back or not accept virtual card payments seem like that shouldn't be as big of an issue, whether you're small or medium, whether your customers are small or medium.\n And I was just wondering, are there particular areas of strength in that Corporate Payments segment that you would call out? I'm just trying to understand a little bit about what's really driving so much strength for you guys. Or has it just been a lot of new sales? What's driving that? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I mean, I think you can see it a bit in the KPIs that it's volume. I mean it's really not rate. So in the 2 big businesses there, the payables business and the FX business, it's volume and it's what you said. I think I just quoted it that in Q3, again, I think the sales of those businesses were up 28% year-over-year over the prior, and we had a blockbuster first half. So you've got this huge implementation backlog effectively of new volume, new business that's coming on the books, which helps give us the predictability. A lot of the sales we're making in this quarter or next quarter will obviously be implemented in the spring and the summer next year.\n So it's not really complicated. We finally are off humpty-dumpty work of putting a competitive set of offerings together and have made the turn really into marketing and selling them, and they're doing a great job at it. So I think it's pretty straightforward. And then B, we're getting leverage in that business on the profit side. I think, Tom -- it's looking about $1 billion ballpark, call it $1 billion per year in revenue.\n And so the scale of the business now and compounding at 20% the incremental revenue, the flow-through margins are 75% to 80% on that stuff. So it's obviously increasing the EBITDA margin. So it's just -- it's in a good spot. It's a giant TAM, and so the game is to just keep chasing, chasing hard after it, because we finally have what we need there. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of [ Nick Pramo ] from UBS. \nUnknown Analyst: Congrats on the strong quarter. I just wanted to ask about how the sales pipeline has been trending in the Fleet business with the pivot to larger customers and how that informs the 2024 outlook for the Fleet business when paired with the new products that you plan to roll out. \nRonald F. Clarke: It's Ron. So happening, I'd say, a little slower than we'd like but happening. So again, it's -- I guess, we're about a year into the pivot. I can't remember how clear I said it, but it's worked, right? In Q3, the credit losses in that business went in half from $24 million to $12 million, and our outlook for this quarter Q4 is $25 million going to $10 million, so down $15 million. We have traded a bit of late fee revenue, right, because we don't have those small accounts that are going later or obviously going bad. So I'd say that it's in process. It's been pretty complicated to turn that digital engine to bigger accounts to make sure that they're creditworthy and that the algorithm is working. But we're seeing I think, as I mentioned, sequentially an increase in the what we call [ above-5 ] card market there.\n And then second, we started building the field and Zoom staff that will contact -- that will be outbound, if you will, on that a bit larger seam than the micros. So I'd say that we're moving some investment dollars along with pivoting the digital engine. So the plan is for it to pick up a lot. I don't have it in front of me, but I think our sales plan for that line of business here in the U.S. is up 25% next year on the back of that of, one, the digital pivot and, two, the incremental field sellers. \nThomas Panther: Yes. And I wouldn't also lose sight of the international business. It continues to sell quite well. Year-to-date, 10-plus percent levels of sales growth. So that also helps generate the overall fleet performance that you're seeing. \nUnknown Analyst: That's very helpful color, and great to see the credit loss is down substantially. For my follow-up question, I just wanted to touch on PayByPhone. I'm sorry if this was already addressed. But what's the margin profile and revenue growth profile of that business on a standalone basis? And how much opportunity do you see on the expense side to optimize there? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, there is no margin profile in that business, right? That's been a go-go growth business compounding, I don't know, 20% to 25% the last 3 years in their preliminary plan standalone into next year. Into '24, it's another 25%. It's circa, call it, $50 million next year, call it, $40 million this year, pro forma, going to $50 million, kind of earning virtually nothing. So the -- again, the big idea is what we can do with it, right, which are two things. One, we've got a ton of businesses that are already -- the employees are already using their app here in the United States and in the U.K. So we're obviously going to go to our business clients and hopefully dramatically increase the amount of B2B parking that the company has instead of \"consumer parking\" where FYI, the rate is substantially better if you're working for a business.\n And then the second one, I think, we said is we have networks they don't have, right? Beyond parking, we have EV, we have service. We have registrations and fines and compliance kinds of things. And so the idea is, obviously, to try to light up their customers who are in the app making payments where, remember, we got the information. It's Ron Clarke, he's on his iPhone, his license plate is XYZ, he's on his Mastercard. The data that we need to add an EV recharge is kind of in the account when we show up. So we expect the synergy, if you will, to take that thing into positive territory, right, as we head into 2024. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli from William Blair. \nRobert Napoli: A lot there, a lot there tonight to go through. Just Ron, the separation alternatives, merging with someone else, is that -- I mean, essentially, would that -- given the size of your business, is that essentially going to be FLEETCOR Corporate Payments acquiring somebody and then merging into a public company? Or I mean, what's -- just any thoughts around how that would -- could work, what you're thinking about there? \nRonald F. Clarke: Bob, good to hear your voice. So obviously, there's a few different flavors that we're working on depending on who the counter-party is. There's actually a pretty fascinating structure that we're looking at where we could spin out an asset of ours effectively into a private entity and have someone else combine their assets into the same private entity. We would obviously control and own some fair amount of that company. So we'd consolidate it, work on the synergies, and then basically IPO that a different day. We're looking at another scenario where we would literally put our asset into another company. So there's a few different combinations.\n And it really is just a function of how accretive, what kind of premium we think we could get by separating something and combining it which, again, makes a lot more sense to us than the \"pure spin\" where we're kind of guessing at pro forma multiple. So we've been in conversations with a few people for quite a while, and we're trying to figure out whether the thing makes sense or not. \nRobert Napoli: Interesting. Just a follow-up on Corporate Payments. The 20% organic growth is really impressive given the size. Is that something that is sustainable into next year? And is it the AP side or the cross-border FX? You've made a number of acquisitions there. What is outperforming more? Maybe relative size of the key pieces of Corporate Payments? \nRonald F. Clarke: Another good question. They're kind of 60-40 in terms of revenue, but they're both kind of compounding around the same level. And I'd say early days, without Ron pushing too hard, I'd say next year is high teens to [ 20% ] again. More to do to give you that final number. But I think -- yes, I think we believe, given the sales again that we got in the Q and the backlog that come online next year. And then we've got a couple of monetization ideas to get more card, if you will, with some of the accounts. So I think it's -- even though it's big, I think we feel good about the thing just keep getting up and going again next year. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Nate Svensson from Deutsche Bank. \nChristopher Svensson: I just wanted to double-click on organic growth within the fleet period a little bit. So if you take Russia out from all periods, it looks like organic growth was relatively flat at 3% this quarter. So can you give a little geographic detail on what drove that 3% growth? I know last quarter, you called out Mexico and Australia. So just wondering what happened this quarter, what deals grew well, which may have grown a little softer. Within that, how did the monthly trends progress as we moved through the third quarter? And then moving into the fourth quarter, should we expect that organic growth ex Russia to stay roughly flat at around 3%? \nThomas Panther: Nate, I'll take that. Again, I'd say the international markets continue to perform quite well, both Mexico, in Australia, Europe, U.K., all of them performed very well. But even within our U.S. business, we saw our enterprise segment do quite well. Even some of the over-the-road trucking was able to do some level of positive growth relative to the overall blended growth rate. So while the international markets carried most of the weight of the positive growth, we did see some pockets within the U.S. business that was also accretive to the overall. As we said, some of the small fleet business is just struggling a little bit in terms of filling the bucket back up with the sales activity as we've pivoted upmarket. \nChristopher Svensson: Got it. I appreciate that. And so I know there's been a few questions on the shift into consumer vehicle payments, but I find that pretty intriguing. So I'll ask another one here. Obviously, you've seen great success kind of building out the strategy in Brazil. But it seems to me like there's a lot of idiosyncrasies about that market that may get fairly unique compared to the U.K. or the U.S. that you called out earlier. So maybe can you talk about some of the hurdles that you might see on your path to implementing the consumer vehicle ecosystem in the U.S. and the U.K.? And how you're planning to get over those hurdles as you roll it out and what learnings you can take from the Brazil experience? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. It's another good question. I think the whole thing turns on the existing active customer file. So the big learning, I think, in Brazil, just to walk back in time, is if you recall there, the original consumer business was mostly tags initially. So hey, you go to the toll booth, you go to a store, you go online and, hey, I want a automatic toll tag, and I get one, and I stick it on my windshield and there it is. And so the big idea a couple of years ago there was to get people onto the phone, to get those same people that had a tag to be on the phone.\n And so what we learned there is once they are on the phone and checking things like their account or, hey, we put the content on like what the value of their car is because we know the car and stuff, that we found that there were 3 million of the 5 million people every month on the app on the phone doing stuff. And so that's what enabled the sales of additional things, for example, insurance, providing insurance. And so that's the hurdle. That's the million dollar question is, can you take a couple million active users that are on a phone every month in the U.K. and point them at 3 or 4 other things related to their vehicle like EV, for example, like servicing their car? Will that take like it has in Brazil? Because we have the rest of it. We have the networks.\n We obviously have tech that connects to these networks and have the host computers and the like and all kinds of G&A that's still on the top of all the stuff. So that's the focus. The game is that conversation, that marketing, that app with the consumer and their willingness to basically take things. And the secret idea I keep telling you is there's no more dated input. So rather than having 3 or 4 separate apps where I type in, I'm Ron Clarke, I have a Range Rover, here's the license plate, here's my credit card, here's my phone number and so on, it's kind of one and done. The vehicle and you and your card stuff is already in place to make the parking app go. And so it's kind of in place for the add-on apps. So I would point you to therein lies the big question to how fast we can grow this thing. \nThomas Panther: And in Brazil, that's over 60% of the customer base is using multiple products. So it's a number where we feel like we can get some really good penetration over time as a significant number of people would do just as Ron described, that use case of I wanted to use one app to service the multiple types of activities and, ultimately, payment transactions surrounding their vehicle. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Let me just give you one thing, which I found fascinating. You like this or not. But to me, it's a bit of peanut butter and jelly. Hey, you've got a phone in your hand, and you're doing parking, getting to the park here. I'm going to be here for an hour or whatever. And then you carry it away and you go on the app and you extend your time another hour. So I know exactly when you parked, when you're leaving and stuff.\n Hey, what about contents insurance for that 2 hours? How about while you're parked at the stadium watching a game or something with no deductible, we covered during that 2-hour period theft from your vehicle? So I give that one as an example of we can nest, we think, some things like super duper close. We have your registration and stuff. We could provide notifications and reminders of when that thing is up. We'll scan for fines that you have. So the power of it is really in it being super close to what the existing application is. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Trevor Williams from Jefferies. \nTrevor Williams: I wanted to go back to the thinking on organic growth in 2024, and I know it's early days, so it's a rough sketch. But the 9% to 11%, that's in line with kind of what historically you've shared for organic targets. But Ron, how are you thinking about what the right growth rate is for fleet specifically now, especially with Russia out? So at least in the near term, how you're thinking about fleet within 9% to 11%? I think historically, it had been assumed to grow 7% to 9%, if you think you can get there in 2024 ex Russia. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Trevor, good question. I'd say probably too early a set of days to give you a super good answer. I'd say that we've done more work as we started sooner around the Corporate Payments. And because that stuff sells and then installed later, there's way visibility into the forward year, right? I kind of know what the backlog is as we head home for Christmas. So I think the big question of where we come out is, how much juice from the new, new stuff? So obviously, the baseline global Fleet business has been kind of low single digits the last few quarters. We obviously have 2 kind of big upsides around this new product line and new channel.\n And then obviously, this consumer piece, for example, like selling businesses parking. So I'd say it turns on that. To me, the question is how far out and how much are we going to invest basically in trying to boost some of these incremental things to try to move that number up faster. And remember, with the vehicle combo with Brazil, you're probably already at -- between the international, Brazil and the U.S., you're probably at 7% to 8%, so call it high single digits before you take a breath. And so the real push is going to be how much new, new do we layer on top of that.\n But as you can tell from my conversation, that that's what we're on and that's what we're going to really try to push. It's the #1, 2 and 3 assignments of this company is to take that big business and reuse it and get it back to being fine and exciting and going somewhere, so that we have 3 businesses that people like instead of 2. So I want you to hear loud and clear that that's what we're on. \nTrevor Williams: Understood. And then, Tom, just a quick one for you. The Corporate Payment margins, it looks like we're up a little more than 400 basis points year-over-year. I think you alluded to potentially some synergies coming through in your prepared remarks. Anything specific to call out there? I don't know if there was some Global Reach expense synergies that came through. But that would be helpful. \nThomas Panther: Trevor, that's certainly a contributing factor in terms of the synergies that we're able to realize with Global Reach. We did a lot of heavy lifting over the spring and early summer to move on to one platform. We're able to eliminate some of the back office costs, technology costs. That was a significant contributor. And then just the positive operating leverage within the business and just look at the structural dynamics of that business and how the 20% revenue growth against a relatively stable fixed cost base are just going to generate positive operating leverage and drive margins higher. So combination of synergies and structural components would be the things that contributed to that. \nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of Kenneth Suchoski from Autonomous Research. \nKenneth Suchoski: Ron, maybe one for you. I wanted to ask about the spin-merge opportunity with a strategic partner. You've been CEO at FLEETCOR for 2-plus decades and built the business out over time. So how do you think about your day-to-day responsibilities in a scenario where there is a spin/merger? And I guess, where would your responsibilities fall under that new structure, which would be two separate entities? And then separately, are there specific assets within B2B that you would look to combine with, either by product, segment of the market or geography? Or is the play really to find overlap with another business and take out the cost? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. So that's such a mouthful, Ken. So I'd say, first off, we're not sure, right? We've been working at this, and we have a couple of attractive combinations. But I don't want to leave this call where people think, hey, it's a day to complain, and Ron is resting or something. So that would be point one. I'd say they're possible, but I don't want to handicap it beyond that. That's number one. Number two is it depends on the structures again. So one of the structures that's kind of interesting is this idea of us spinning assets into a private entity and someone else. And in that case, it would almost look to me like a FLEETCOR company where we have a minority investor, which we had that world before, so I'm busy thinking about that thing as I am today.\n If it went the other way and we were to basically RMT it into something else that was public, I'd probably sit on the board and have a plan in advance of doing that, that we were clear on kind of where the thing was going. So to your point, to take something that's super valuable, we and I have to be super convinced that it's going to go on a path that makes sense, and it's going to get results that will warrant a premium. So we are spending a lot of time on those social issues and talk about how that would go.\n But my comment to you is I think I and others would be super involved certainly early on in whatever combination we went forward with. We're not going to just spin it and close our eyes. \nKenneth Suchoski: Yes. That makes a lot of sense, Ron. And then I guess, just as my follow-up, some of the -- some of your payment peers have called out headwinds in their cross-border businesses. Specifically, they're seeing more cross-border transactions being done in U.S. dollars rather than those payments being converted to local currencies. I guess, are you guys seeing any of those trends? And I guess, how much of a risk is that for the cross-border payments business within Corporate Payments? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. That's a good follow-up. I'd say not much. I mean there's a little bit of it when FX volatility kind of right softens and kind of where the dollar was, whatever, a few weeks ago. But I'd say it's really on the margin. If you look at again what we're printing there, it's just -- it's the sheer volume growth, which is adding just more clients and more spend. And I'd say we're generally pretty stable, with maybe a smidge softness to your point, here and there. And then remember, for us, the diversity in that business, right?\n So we originate, I guess, about 80% of all the business, all the revenue outside of the United States, right, so in Canada, the U.K., Europe, Australia. And so the geographic diversity in kind of the originating currencies also have a big impact. So the -- it's a little bit of a hedge, right? One place is a little bit weaker, but then the counter-party is a little bit stronger. So I don't say we're immune, but I'd say we're not seeing much in the way of slowdown. \nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you all for participating. You may all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ronald F. Clarke",
            "content": "Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today. Upfront here, I plan to cover 3 subjects: first, our financials, our Q3 results, our Q4 guidance and a brief 2024 preview. Second, I'll provide an update on our strategic review and where we're coming out. And then lastly, I'll introduce our fleet transformation plan, which is aimed at accelerating the revenue growth of that business. Okay. \n Let me begin with our Q3 results, which were generally in line with our expectations. We reported revenue of $971 million, up 9%, and cash EPS of $4.49, up 6% versus last year. But it would have been up 16% at constant interest rates. Q3 macro, weaker than our August outlook. Our fuel spreads contracted about 25% in the quarter, and that was the result of a $0.50 fuel price point-to-point increase from the Q2 exit to the Q3 exit, which compresses fuel spreads. \n Look, despite this weaker macro, our Q3 earnings powered through. We actually finished a few cents ahead of our August guide if you exclude just the Russia and PayByPhone transactions. Overall, organic revenue growth for Q3, up 10%. Inside of that, our Corporate Payments business maintained its 20% growth rate. So super pleased there. \n Our pivot, which we started last year in North America fuel away from new super small micro accounts clearly paid dividends this quarter. Our North America fuel credit losses went in half from about $24 million last year to $12 million this year. \n Trends in the quarter are generally quite good. Continued strong demand for our products. Our new sales, up 17% versus prior year, so very good. Retention remaining stable across the enterprise at 91%. Our same-store sales did soften a bit, from flat last quarter to kind of minus 1 this quarter. We did notice pretty noticeable softening in our managed services subsegment in Lodging, which we're digging into. \n Our Q3 EBITDA reached $529 million, $529 million, an all-time record high for the company, held by EBITDA margins, which expanded to 54.5%. That's up about 200 basis points versus last year. So all in all, I'd say a pretty good Q3 performance. Okay. \n Let me make the turn to our updated Q4 guidance, which reflects a couple of changes in scope, so the Russia divestiture, which we mentioned last time, and the recent PayByPhone acquisition. We've also refreshed the Q4 macro, which is outlooking a bit weaker FX than we saw in August. \n So look, despite these adjustments and these pressures, the fundamentals, quite good such that our underlying Q4 profit guide is actually a bit stronger than our view 90 days ago. You can see on Page 14 in our earnings supplement that refreshed bridge. \n So we're updating Q4 guidance today to $968 million in revenue at the midpoint and $4.49 in cash EPS at the midpoint. So really, right on top of our Q3 print. Here again, historically, Q3 and Q4 results have been very similar. This updated Q4 guide implies a 10% organic revenue growth in the quarter and a 14% EBITDA growth. So again, the forecast, really spot on to our [ 10-13-19 ] compounding model. \n Okay. Let me transition to our preliminary view of 2024, which I characterize the setup is quite encouraging. So we're outlooking the 2024 macro environment to be neutral to maybe slightly positive. And that's simply looking at the various macro factors as they exit this year into next year. Revenue, we're outlooking, again, although early, organic revenue growth in the same 9% to 11% range. That's consistent with prior years. And then lastly, kind of the key profit drivers of the business generally setting up favorably. So we're expecting lower bad debt, flat to lower interest expense, and a stable tax rate and share count. So generally, a good setup. So look, although it's early days in our '24 planning, I'd say we generally like what we see. All right. \n Let me shift gears and provide an update on our strategic review. As a reminder, the goal of our strategic review or portfolio review is really twofold: so first, to make a simpler company; and then second, to evaluate separation options to increase shareholder value. \n On the simplification front, we've done a few things. We've sold Russia. We decided to keep our prepaid business although we are working a couple of other non-core asset sales. And we're moving to 3 primary reporting segments, all of these things to make a simpler company. On the separation front, we've concluded not to pursue a pure spin, and that's mainly looking at RemainCo derating risk. \n We've also decided not to pursue a strategic sale. Primarily, they are due to tax leakage and our estimate of dis-synergies. But we are continuing to evaluate a couple separation alternatives with [ dance ] partners that we think are potentially pretty attractive. So we do expect to conclude those discussions with the counter-parties over the next 90 days, and we'll certainly report back then. Okay. \n My last subject is to introduce our fleet transformation plan, which we believe is the single most important thing, effort to unlock shareholder value and re-rate our stock. So the objective of the fleet transformation plan is to accelerate our global Fleet business growth in the double digits, so that we have 3 big primary businesses that can all target double-digit revenue growth. We have prepared a few slides in our lengthy earnings supplement beginning on Page 22 to help walk you through how we intend to accelerate fleet growth. \n The plan really centers around 3 big ideas. So first, BAU. On the BAU front, we plan to get at performance improvement through new fleet products, which we're leasing into the market now. And these products join up with our corporate payment products to really create a differentiated offering in the marketplace. As you may recall, we're also pivoting that business from kind of small micro prospects to a bit larger seam prospects, both from repointing our digital marketing machine and adding additional field and Zoom reps targeted at this slightly larger market segment. The emphasis will be on two primary verticals. Those are field services and construction, both of which are big significant opportunities. \n Second, underpinning for the plan is EV. We believe we can capitalize on the EV transition. We're getting much more confident that our 3-in-1 commercial fleet EV-ICE solution is really is a winner and that we can maintain or maybe even increase our fleet revenues throughout the transition. So early experience in the U.K. over the last 11 quarters bears this out. Revenue per EV vehicle running higher than revenue per ICE vehicle. So again, pretty positive. \n Then lastly, is this idea of a consumer vehicle payments business versus just the B2B vehicle payments business. And so the idea is to further expand on that front and really just leverage the networks, the payment networks, the merchant relationships we have, that we built on the B2B side over the last 20 years. So the idea would be we start with anchor apps. So think toll tags in Brazil or digital parking in the U.K. that have millions of active mobile users and then offer additional vehicle payment-related solutions that utilize our payment networks. So for example, utilize our EV network or utilize our service repair network. \n We've demonstrated success in this approach in Brazil. Over 60% of our active consumer toll users now use a second or even third payment solution like parking or insurance. So we think, pretty exciting. Additionally, this consumer vehicle payments push does open up additional interesting acquisition targets. For example, PayByPhone and literally other ones as well. \n So look, we believe that we have the potential to incrementally drive the overall fleet/vehicle business into double-digit territory via these 3 ideas. So again, kind of new fleet products, combined with corporate payment products targeted to a couple of big verticals, success in the EV transition and the build-out of a big billion dollar consumer vehicle payments business, clearly well underway in Brazil, and then we hope to accelerate with this PayByPhone acquisition. \n You can actually see our forecast math, the build to $1 billion, on Page 29 of the supplement. This anticipates that this expanded consumer vehicle leg growing fast can pull a low single-digit core fleet card business into double-digit growth territory. So literally, maybe 12%. \n So look, in conclusion, today, we're forecasting 2023 pretty much where we started out in February of this year. In and around $17 of cash EPS. That's despite selling Russia and having a bit unfavorable macro. '24 outlook early, but I'd say encouraging. Still busy on some active separation, discussions with some counter-parties. We expect to conclude that in 90 days. And then lastly, this fleet transformation plan, we think, quite exciting. We believe it has the potential to reaccelerate the Fleet business and really potentially lift the entire enterprise to faster growth. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Tom to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Tom? Sure, Sanjay. So it's really mostly in around our Corporate Payments business. And so we have a couple of interesting counter-parties where we might separate something and actually have a pure play that has more scale and synergies and stuff. And so we're kind of in the final mile of working through those conversations and seeing whether there's something there. Yes. I think generally, the comment I gave is comp. So if you look at the various macro factors and the way we're exiting both fuel price spreads, FX, et cetera, I'd say that sitting here today, it feels like kind of a neutral-ish to maybe a smidge positive. And so obviously, our organic stuff puts that to the side, right, that it is between print and organic. But I'd say I did want to just provide a bit of a preview that unlike this year, Sanjay, with interest rates up, whatever, 400 basis points, that the grow over basically across some of our key profit levers looks quite good. So the setup looks way more normalized than it has in the last couple of years. It's a great question. Good to talk. We can only get into this debate, Tien-Tsin, tonight. So yes, we've got a couple, I'd say, of additional transactions that we're looking at to fill out a couple of the product lines. But this is -- I don't know how clear I was in it, but mostly an organic play where we get -- we use basically these big consumer active blocks, right, of accounts and just match it up with what we already have, right, which is the payment network and the merchants. And so the million dollar question there, Tien-Tsin, is just that velocity. So when we show 2 million people some additional related things, what's the take rate going to be? So I'd say that most of the thinking, both studying what we've done in Brazil and obviously studying this deal, the view is that it's organic.\n And the key, as you heard me talk a million times, is cost of sales. That's the key to growth and profitability. And so the good news is our view is we're not going to do tons of marketing. Hey, let's go out and spend gazillions of dollars, but rather try to light up big bases. So I'd say we like the EBITDA profile basically and getting that thing to go. So a couple more deals and mostly organic, that's the game plan. To add on to tension, as you know, we're always lower cost, right, than new, new accounts. Yes. Let me start, Tien-Tsin, just on the segments, yes. So segment one will be vehicle, which will be our global Fleet business, our Brazil business and then honestly, really, this consumer, which is a big part of the Brazil thing today, so the PayByPhone and the other things would be in that. Second business, obviously, Corporate Payments and then third business, Lodging. So those would be the three lines. Good question, Darrin. Mostly everything, right, is going well to post, I don't know how many quarters now, 20%. But quite a few from where I'm looking at going forward. And I think the sales inside of the 17% were in the mid-to-high 20s for that line of business, so that tells us that we're selling a lot. There's a lot of demand. In terms of what's working well and not well today, everything is working well with the exception of that channel business, which we've spoken of.\n So again, that thing continues to decline but will become, as you know, a much smaller part of the total, which implies again that the direct business is growing closer to 25% to 30%. So look, as I said before, we spent whatever the last couple of years assembling stuff, right, software, getting scale, getting more scale across border. And now the game is really marketing and sales. We put the brand out a while ago. We've added head count as you see in the sales growth rate. So that's the game now. It's really just to drive new sales faster and get those implemented. And unlike some other people have reported, to your point, because we're a middle market, the book is pretty stable, right? Our same-store sales look stable exiting the quarter, so we're not seeing any of that. Good follow-up. I think ultimately, Darrin, we just like the business more than some of the people that looked at it. So when you look at the tax leakage and dilution from that, I'd say that we spent a lot of time making that a better business than when we shopped it 3 years ago. And so the premium that we were looking for about what it's worth today, right, to pay the tax, I think people didn't get close enough to where we or I wanted to see the thing. So we feel good enough to hold it.\n With that said, as part of this review, we went through all the other kind of small non-core things. So we do have 2 kind of non-core things that we're kind of actively talking to buyers about. So there's a couple of hanging chads left there. But both that and the broader counter-party thing, we will have mopped up when we come back to you in 90 days. Yes. Look, great question, Ramsey. So if you step back, our current business is really in 3 markets, 3 countries, call it, 90% of the company. Right here, Brazil and the U.K., so that would be the answer. So we're -- of the $1 billion target, we're, I don't know, $350 million or $400 million consumer payment business in Brazil today and close to 0, right, in the U.K. and the U.S. And so part of this PayByPhone idea was to get a big customer base in the U.K. and in the U.S. where we already have these networks again was the idea. So there's no plan, for Tien-Tsin's other question, for us to go fire a young man to far away places and to try to build a business where we don't have networks and management and stuff. So Brazil, U.K., U.S., in that order, is how we're thinking about it. Yes. Good question. And unclear, I'd say. We thought -- I think I called this out because we started to see it in Q2. So again, let me go to the top and maybe this will be helpful. So inside of our Lodging business, we serve, call it, 4 or 5 different customer subsegments. So we do things like airlines, insurance, railroads, construction, things like that. So one of those segments is kind of this project-based segment. So think like consulting firms, retail merchandising people, environmental companies. It's only, I don't know, Ramsey, 300 to 400 clients in it. But they field pretty big teams of people. They go to places and stay for a while. So maybe 10 people go to a city and stay there for 2 or 3 weeks. So that's the nature of the business.\n So literally starting in Q2 and more in Q3, say 50 out of those 300 clients just start to go like super soft. So when we call them, they would say things like, oh, hey, Walmart, who's a big client for merchandising, moved that in-house. They're not using our third-party company to go there and do merchandising in their stores. Or hey, a couple of our construction clients flipped over to using some local contractors instead of their own people. So I'd say we're just not really sure. The good news is the other segments, we don't see it. It's mostly resident kind of in this one place. So I think we've printed, what Tom, 10% organic. So that thing actually went backwards, that [ managing ] a bit, while obviously, the rest of the businesses went forward. So we're kind of outlooking, Ramsey, the thing to kind of stay softish here in Q4. And then obviously, we hope to get a better idea when we make a turn in the next year. Good question, Pete. So I'd say it's been a pretty busy and active, whatever it's been, 6 or 9 months strategic review. So look, the good news in it is when you put out an ad like that, it does generate incremental activity. So we do have, as I said, not only some separation discussions still going. But we've surfaced some additional M&A targets that are kind of interesting in and around the same space as people look to the phone. So look, I think our priorities around capital and leverage are kind of the same. Our target is 3. I think we're running, I don't know, 2.5 or 2.6.  We're buyers of our stock. Obviously, at this price, if we grow 9% to 11% next year, we grow the bottom faster. That's a 10x EBITDA multiple for company compounding in the team. So we're buyers of our stock. Let's say, 3x leverage, we'll go higher. \n For a deal, we do have again a few interesting things in this consumer space that have surfaced and a couple in our core Corporate Payments base that we're chasing. So like always, I'd say, those will be the two main uses. I think we'll generate, I don't know, low $1 billion to $1.3 billion-ish. I think it's in our early look at next year, plus we've got leverage still, right, where we're sitting today. And the EBITDA will grow next year. So a handful of deals and buy our stock back would be the order. Yes, good question. So if you look at our print for 3 quarters and even into our guide, I think we've stepped up sequentially, as we said, right? EBITDA margin, I think I quoted between 54% and 55% this quarter. And I think Tom and I look at it kind of the same number for Q4. We kind of looked at our plan for next year, similarly, which gives us a little more money because we've kind of gone past some of these capability acquisitions. So I'd say we'll ramp up the sales and marketing investments a bit but look, initially at least, to try to keep the exit of our margin kind of between 54% and 55% as kind of the target for next year. Yes. It's a good question. So let me start by saying that most of the competition for the prospects that we're trying to get are on business cards. So in the older days, there was cash and house accounts and other things. And now when we look at the customers that we want to have that we don't have, many are on business cards. And some of those are on our competitors' fuel cards as well. And so the idea is really to go to new accounts with a combined -- effectively, a business card and a fuel card in one. So -- and target that against verticals that use fuel cards that have people in the field. Think of like field services like HVAC or construction, things like that.\n And so that's the basic idea that we've now wrapped -- I don't if you guys remember, we bought a company about 2 years ago called Roger that we re-branded as Corpay One. So we've wrapped all that technology now around a business card, so that it's mobile-centric kind of automated expense capture and stuff around the business card, and then connected that to our proprietary fuel card capabilities and networks. And so what you've got is a business card that's a little more high tech than some of the bank cards, combined to a fuel card that has controls and advantaged economics, and it's bundled into kind of one package and one account.\n And so the testing on it has been super duper good, and we're literally in the market selling the products now. So the biggest difference, I'd say, is the focus. It's new accounts versus back to the base. It's in a couple of verticals. And the product has been revamped or rewrapped with kind of some modern technology. Yes. I mean, I think you can see it a bit in the KPIs that it's volume. I mean it's really not rate. So in the 2 big businesses there, the payables business and the FX business, it's volume and it's what you said. I think I just quoted it that in Q3, again, I think the sales of those businesses were up 28% year-over-year over the prior, and we had a blockbuster first half. So you've got this huge implementation backlog effectively of new volume, new business that's coming on the books, which helps give us the predictability. A lot of the sales we're making in this quarter or next quarter will obviously be implemented in the spring and the summer next year.\n So it's not really complicated. We finally are off humpty-dumpty work of putting a competitive set of offerings together and have made the turn really into marketing and selling them, and they're doing a great job at it. So I think it's pretty straightforward. And then B, we're getting leverage in that business on the profit side. I think, Tom -- it's looking about $1 billion ballpark, call it $1 billion per year in revenue.\n And so the scale of the business now and compounding at 20% the incremental revenue, the flow-through margins are 75% to 80% on that stuff. So it's obviously increasing the EBITDA margin. So it's just -- it's in a good spot. It's a giant TAM, and so the game is to just keep chasing, chasing hard after it, because we finally have what we need there. It's Ron. So happening, I'd say, a little slower than we'd like but happening. So again, it's -- I guess, we're about a year into the pivot. I can't remember how clear I said it, but it's worked, right? In Q3, the credit losses in that business went in half from $24 million to $12 million, and our outlook for this quarter Q4 is $25 million going to $10 million, so down $15 million. We have traded a bit of late fee revenue, right, because we don't have those small accounts that are going later or obviously going bad. So I'd say that it's in process. It's been pretty complicated to turn that digital engine to bigger accounts to make sure that they're creditworthy and that the algorithm is working. But we're seeing I think, as I mentioned, sequentially an increase in the what we call [ above-5 ] card market there.\n And then second, we started building the field and Zoom staff that will contact -- that will be outbound, if you will, on that a bit larger seam than the micros. So I'd say that we're moving some investment dollars along with pivoting the digital engine. So the plan is for it to pick up a lot. I don't have it in front of me, but I think our sales plan for that line of business here in the U.S. is up 25% next year on the back of that of, one, the digital pivot and, two, the incremental field sellers. Yes, there is no margin profile in that business, right? That's been a go-go growth business compounding, I don't know, 20% to 25% the last 3 years in their preliminary plan standalone into next year. Into '24, it's another 25%. It's circa, call it, $50 million next year, call it, $40 million this year, pro forma, going to $50 million, kind of earning virtually nothing. So the -- again, the big idea is what we can do with it, right, which are two things. One, we've got a ton of businesses that are already -- the employees are already using their app here in the United States and in the U.K. So we're obviously going to go to our business clients and hopefully dramatically increase the amount of B2B parking that the company has instead of \"consumer parking\" where FYI, the rate is substantially better if you're working for a business.\n And then the second one, I think, we said is we have networks they don't have, right? Beyond parking, we have EV, we have service. We have registrations and fines and compliance kinds of things. And so the idea is, obviously, to try to light up their customers who are in the app making payments where, remember, we got the information. It's Ron Clarke, he's on his iPhone, his license plate is XYZ, he's on his Mastercard. The data that we need to add an EV recharge is kind of in the account when we show up. So we expect the synergy, if you will, to take that thing into positive territory, right, as we head into 2024. Bob, good to hear your voice. So obviously, there's a few different flavors that we're working on depending on who the counter-party is. There's actually a pretty fascinating structure that we're looking at where we could spin out an asset of ours effectively into a private entity and have someone else combine their assets into the same private entity. We would obviously control and own some fair amount of that company. So we'd consolidate it, work on the synergies, and then basically IPO that a different day. We're looking at another scenario where we would literally put our asset into another company. So there's a few different combinations.\n And it really is just a function of how accretive, what kind of premium we think we could get by separating something and combining it which, again, makes a lot more sense to us than the \"pure spin\" where we're kind of guessing at pro forma multiple. So we've been in conversations with a few people for quite a while, and we're trying to figure out whether the thing makes sense or not. Another good question. They're kind of 60-40 in terms of revenue, but they're both kind of compounding around the same level. And I'd say early days, without Ron pushing too hard, I'd say next year is high teens to [ 20% ] again. More to do to give you that final number. But I think -- yes, I think we believe, given the sales again that we got in the Q and the backlog that come online next year. And then we've got a couple of monetization ideas to get more card, if you will, with some of the accounts. So I think it's -- even though it's big, I think we feel good about the thing just keep getting up and going again next year. Yes. It's another good question. I think the whole thing turns on the existing active customer file. So the big learning, I think, in Brazil, just to walk back in time, is if you recall there, the original consumer business was mostly tags initially. So hey, you go to the toll booth, you go to a store, you go online and, hey, I want a automatic toll tag, and I get one, and I stick it on my windshield and there it is. And so the big idea a couple of years ago there was to get people onto the phone, to get those same people that had a tag to be on the phone.\n And so what we learned there is once they are on the phone and checking things like their account or, hey, we put the content on like what the value of their car is because we know the car and stuff, that we found that there were 3 million of the 5 million people every month on the app on the phone doing stuff. And so that's what enabled the sales of additional things, for example, insurance, providing insurance. And so that's the hurdle. That's the million dollar question is, can you take a couple million active users that are on a phone every month in the U.K. and point them at 3 or 4 other things related to their vehicle like EV, for example, like servicing their car? Will that take like it has in Brazil? Because we have the rest of it. We have the networks.\n We obviously have tech that connects to these networks and have the host computers and the like and all kinds of G&A that's still on the top of all the stuff. So that's the focus. The game is that conversation, that marketing, that app with the consumer and their willingness to basically take things. And the secret idea I keep telling you is there's no more dated input. So rather than having 3 or 4 separate apps where I type in, I'm Ron Clarke, I have a Range Rover, here's the license plate, here's my credit card, here's my phone number and so on, it's kind of one and done. The vehicle and you and your card stuff is already in place to make the parking app go. And so it's kind of in place for the add-on apps. So I would point you to therein lies the big question to how fast we can grow this thing. Yes. Let me just give you one thing, which I found fascinating. You like this or not. But to me, it's a bit of peanut butter and jelly. Hey, you've got a phone in your hand, and you're doing parking, getting to the park here. I'm going to be here for an hour or whatever. And then you carry it away and you go on the app and you extend your time another hour. So I know exactly when you parked, when you're leaving and stuff.\n Hey, what about contents insurance for that 2 hours? How about while you're parked at the stadium watching a game or something with no deductible, we covered during that 2-hour period theft from your vehicle? So I give that one as an example of we can nest, we think, some things like super duper close. We have your registration and stuff. We could provide notifications and reminders of when that thing is up. We'll scan for fines that you have. So the power of it is really in it being super close to what the existing application is. Yes. Trevor, good question. I'd say probably too early a set of days to give you a super good answer. I'd say that we've done more work as we started sooner around the Corporate Payments. And because that stuff sells and then installed later, there's way visibility into the forward year, right? I kind of know what the backlog is as we head home for Christmas. So I think the big question of where we come out is, how much juice from the new, new stuff? So obviously, the baseline global Fleet business has been kind of low single digits the last few quarters. We obviously have 2 kind of big upsides around this new product line and new channel.\n And then obviously, this consumer piece, for example, like selling businesses parking. So I'd say it turns on that. To me, the question is how far out and how much are we going to invest basically in trying to boost some of these incremental things to try to move that number up faster. And remember, with the vehicle combo with Brazil, you're probably already at -- between the international, Brazil and the U.S., you're probably at 7% to 8%, so call it high single digits before you take a breath. And so the real push is going to be how much new, new do we layer on top of that.\n But as you can tell from my conversation, that that's what we're on and that's what we're going to really try to push. It's the #1, 2 and 3 assignments of this company is to take that big business and reuse it and get it back to being fine and exciting and going somewhere, so that we have 3 businesses that people like instead of 2. So I want you to hear loud and clear that that's what we're on. Yes. So that's such a mouthful, Ken. So I'd say, first off, we're not sure, right? We've been working at this, and we have a couple of attractive combinations. But I don't want to leave this call where people think, hey, it's a day to complain, and Ron is resting or something. So that would be point one. I'd say they're possible, but I don't want to handicap it beyond that. That's number one. Number two is it depends on the structures again. So one of the structures that's kind of interesting is this idea of us spinning assets into a private entity and someone else. And in that case, it would almost look to me like a FLEETCOR company where we have a minority investor, which we had that world before, so I'm busy thinking about that thing as I am today.\n If it went the other way and we were to basically RMT it into something else that was public, I'd probably sit on the board and have a plan in advance of doing that, that we were clear on kind of where the thing was going. So to your point, to take something that's super valuable, we and I have to be super convinced that it's going to go on a path that makes sense, and it's going to get results that will warrant a premium. So we are spending a lot of time on those social issues and talk about how that would go.\n But my comment to you is I think I and others would be super involved certainly early on in whatever combination we went forward with. We're not going to just spin it and close our eyes. Yes. That's a good follow-up. I'd say not much. I mean there's a little bit of it when FX volatility kind of right softens and kind of where the dollar was, whatever, a few weeks ago. But I'd say it's really on the margin. If you look at again what we're printing there, it's just -- it's the sheer volume growth, which is adding just more clients and more spend. And I'd say we're generally pretty stable, with maybe a smidge softness to your point, here and there. And then remember, for us, the diversity in that business, right?\n So we originate, I guess, about 80% of all the business, all the revenue outside of the United States, right, so in Canada, the U.K., Europe, Australia. And so the geographic diversity in kind of the originating currencies also have a big impact. So the -- it's a little bit of a hedge, right? One place is a little bit weaker, but then the counter-party is a little bit stronger. So I don't say we're immune, but I'd say we're not seeing much in the way of slowdown."

            "name": "Thomas Panther",
            "content": "Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Here are some additional details related to the quarter. Let me start by acknowledging that it was an active quarter with the sales of the Russia business, the acquisition of PayByPhone and significant movements in fuel prices and FX rates. I'll address the impact from each of these factors to better compare our actual results to our previous guidance. \n First, our prior guidance included a full year of revenue and earnings from the Russia fuel business. Based on the August 15 closing date and final cash proceeds, the disposition of Russia resulted in $12 million of lower revenue and $0.06 of lower cash EPS. Secondly, the acquisition of PayByPhone on September 15 added $2 million of revenue and was $0.01 dilutive to adjusted earnings. \n Turning to the macro headwinds in the quarter. Compared to the assumptions used for our guidance in August, the total negative impact was $17 million. Average fuel prices of $3.88 were 7% higher during the quarter, resulting in a $4 million benefit. However, it's important to note the point-to-point increase in fuel price from July 1 to September 30 was around $0.50. The majority of this 15% increase occurred in August and plateaued for the remainder of the quarter. Underlying that rapid increase in the retail fuel price was an even greater increase in wholesale fuel costs, which compressed fuel spreads approximately 25%, compared to our forecast, adversely affecting revenue by $13 million. So the net impact from changes in fuel prices on revenue was a $9 million headwind. \n It's typical when fuel prices rapidly increase for spreads to compress due to wholesale fuel prices increasing faster than retail prices, which can overwhelm the fuel price increase benefit. We get asked regularly, if there's a way to track the price and spread impact. We found that OPIS or the Oil Price Information Service, which is a subscription-based provider, does a good job depicting retail and wholesale fuel prices and the resulting spread. \n Now turning to FX rates. The significant strengthening of the dollar beginning in August, when the Fed's tone became more hawkish, caused the dollar to strengthen relative to our foreign currencies, resulting in an $8 million drag on revenue. \n In summary, if we knew in early August what we know now about these factors I just discussed, our guide would have been revenue of $963 million and cash EPS of $4.33 per share compared to our reported results of $971 million and $4.49 per share. The majority of the $8 million revenue beat came from our international businesses. Our earnings out-performance is particularly impressive because the flow-through of our revenue results, combined with our strong expense management and lower bad debt expense, enabled us to power through the macro headwind and still exceed our pro forma August cash EPS guidance, when adjusting only for the impact from Russia and PayByPhone. We've included Slide 7 in our earnings supplement that walks you through these moving parts. \n Now on to more details regarding our results for the quarter, focusing on year-over-year revenue growth. Organic revenue growth was 10%, reflecting the diversification of our business and the realization of the strong sales that we've produced throughout the year. Year-over-year, lower fuel prices resulted in a $12 million reduction in revenue, and lower fuel price spreads reduced revenue by $23 million. FX rates were favorable relative to last year, translating into a $15 million benefit. So net-net, a $20 million macro headwind versus last year. Putting aside the macro noise in comparison to our prior guidance, GAAP revenue increased 9%, which reflects the business' ability to consistently deliver solid revenue growth. \n Corporate Payments revenue was up 20%, driven by 20% growth in spend. Strength in our direct business, which grew over 30%, was again led by outstanding growth in full AP. Our comprehensive menu of high-quality payment solutions continues to sell extremely well, up 28% as we sign up new customers who are looking to modernize their AP operations. We also continue to expand our proprietary merchant network and increase the amount of cardable spend. Cross-border revenue was up 19% as sales also grew 28% and recurring client transaction activity was robust. We are the largest nonbank FX provider in the world, and the name recognition we now have is a real advantage when we compete for our clients' business. More importantly, our best-in-class capabilities, service and products allow us to have market-leading retention and client acquisition, which you can see in our results. \n Turning to our Fleet business. Organic revenue increased 4%. We experienced strength in our international markets. And in the U.K., we are pleased with the continued strong sales performance of our 3-in-1 product offering, which customers find very attractive as they add EVs to their fleet. In the U.S., some softness in small fleet, in addition to the impact from our shift away from micro clients, are affecting our sales and overall results. Our shift to higher-credit quality clients also impacted late fees, which were down 21% from Q3 2022. While the decline in late fees results in a drag on our revenue growth, it has been more than offset by a decline in bad debt expense, which I'll comment on later. But it's important to point out that our decision to pivot up market has been EBITDA positive. \n Lastly, as Ron mentioned, we continue to refine our go-to-market strategy to acquire larger customers and we are excited about the rollout of additional products that we expect will drive a significant uplift in sales heading into next year and going forward. \n Before I move on, Ron addressed the PayByPhone acquisition and how it fits into our fleet transformation strategy. To give you some deal specifics, PayByPhone is the world's second largest global parking payments platform, with over 6 million monthly active users on its mobile app. Their network covers approximately 4 million parking spaces primarily in North America, the U.K. and Europe, and they process over 200 million transactions annually, totaling $900 million in spend. We paid approximately $300 million for the company and expect to realize about $50 million in revenue next year. \n Now to Brazil, where revenue grew 16% compared to last year, driven by 7% tag growth. Our tag growth enables us to further increase the proportion of revenue from our expanded network of products where we earn incremental revenue. In the quarter, approximately 35% of customer spend was from our expanded network. Fuel is a great example of how we're expanding our product network with the number of tag-enabled gas stations growing 25% and transactions up over 40%. Our extensive network enabled us to generate 20% sales growth in the quarter over the prior year with almost 30% of the sales coming from non-tag products. Our success in Brazil is a tangible proof point of our broader vehicle payment strategy, where we leverage an anchor product used by a large customer base to deliver additional products and services driving incremental revenue growth. \n Lastly, we've received some questions over the last several quarters about the potential impact of the Brazilian government deploying free-flow tolling, where the toll station reads the license plate and the individual pays the toll after the fact by going to a website. Now that these free-flow stations have been in place for a few years, our experience is that we actually sell more tags when these toll stations are installed because the tag user receives a small discount and is able to pay the toll automatically via their tag. This frictionless customer experience drives incremental demand for our product. \n Lodging revenue increased 10% against a tough prior year Q3 comp where the business had grown 28%. It's not unusual for the business to have quarterly revenue growth fluctuations driven by weather and natural disaster variability. Year-to-date, the business is up 16%. This quarter's performance was highlighted by sales success across our industry verticals. In addition to revenue per night, which increased 20%, driven primarily from channel and product mix, namely from our distressed passenger product and higher hotel commission revenue. Offsetting that to some degree was softness in our construction and transportation verticals as the weaker macroeconomic environment is impacting these sectors. We expect this softness to rebound as the economic outlook becomes clear. \n Before leaving the segments, I want to briefly comment on our expectation to move to 3 primary business segments. We're making this change in how we operate the company in the fourth quarter and reflect the new segments in our 10-K. \n Now looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses of $526 million represent a 4% increase versus Q3 of last year, driven by acquisitions, increases tied to higher transaction and sales activities, and investments to drive future growth, partially offset by lower FX rates and the sale of our Russia business. \n Bad debt expense declined 22% from last year to $29 million or 6 basis points of spend. Within that, fleet bad debt expense was down $15 million year-over-year as we realized the benefit from lower exposure to micro clients as previously discussed. EBITDA margin in the quarter was 54.5%, a 225 basis point improvement from the third quarter of last year. After normalizing for the Russia sale, we still expect our full year EBITDA margin to exit this year 200 to 250 basis points better than the prior year. This positive operating leverage is driven by solid revenue growth, lower bad debt expense, disciplined expense management and synergies realized from recent acquisitions. \n Interest expense increased $43 million year-over-year, driven by the increase in SOFR on our debt stack and higher debt balances driven by acquisitions. The impact of higher interest rates resulted in an approximate $0.44 drag on Q3 adjusted EPS. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.6% versus 26.8% last year. \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in unrestricted cash and we had $660 million available on our revolver. We have $5.6 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, and we had $1.4 billion borrowed under our securitization facility. \n As of September 30, our leverage ratio was 2.66x trailing 12-month EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. We repurchased 2 million shares in the quarter for $530 million, including the ASR we announced in conjunction with the Russia sale. And we have over $700 million authorized for share repurchases. We have ample liquidity to pursue near-term M&A opportunities, and we'll continue to buy back shares when it makes sense. \n Now turning to our guidance. Let me start by bridging the implied Q4 guidance we provided in August to reflect the acquisition and divestiture activity during the quarter and current macro environment. The sale of the Russia business would reduce revenue by $30 million, and the acquisition of PayByPhone would increase revenue by $10 million. We're now expecting a $20 million macro headwind versus what we thought back in August, driven primarily by worse FX rates, partially offset by higher fuel prices of $3.96. Making these pro forma adjustments to our prior Q4 guide lowers revenue to $968 million and adjusted earnings per share to $4.34 per share at the midpoint. We've included Slide 14 in the earnings presentation that lays out these factors. \n With that pro forma reference point established, let me comment on our Q4 outlook that includes the factors I just mentioned. We're expecting revenue to be between $953 million and $983 million, representing 10% growth versus last year at the midpoint. And we expect adjusted net income per share to be between $4.34 and $4.64 per share, which, at the midpoint, is up 11% over what we reported in Q4 2022. So similar to the third quarter, we expect to generate solid year-over-year revenue and earnings growth despite some softening economic conditions in our markets. Based on this Q4 guidance, for the full year, we now expect GAAP revenues between $3.774 billion and $3.804 billion, adjusted net income between $1.252 billion and $1.276 billion, adjusted net income per diluted share between $16.82 and $17.12 per share, and EBITDA growth of 14% and EBITDA margin of 53%. \n Thank you for your interest in FLEETCOR. And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. Yes. And Tien-Tsin, we wouldn't expect it to be margin dilutive. Again, look at Brazil as our bellwether. It has attractive margins across the rest of our portfolio. So we think that's a good indicator of what the overall business can be as it expands. Yes. And for your modeling, we're really just combining Fleet and Brazil today. And so based on how we report operating income and how you may model the business at a more detailed level, it would just be a simple summation of those two. We wouldn't anticipate any type of shift in the margin profile. It's just bringing those two together into the vehicle payments segment. We haven't seen erosion on the supplier level either. We continue to see good network expansion. Cardable spend continues to gradually move up. So the interest level from the merchant side and the supplier side continues to be favorable. Yes. And I wouldn't also lose sight of the international business. It continues to sell quite well. Year-to-date, 10-plus percent levels of sales growth. So that also helps generate the overall fleet performance that you're seeing. Nate, I'll take that. Again, I'd say the international markets continue to perform quite well, both Mexico, in Australia, Europe, U.K., all of them performed very well. But even within our U.S. business, we saw our enterprise segment do quite well. Even some of the over-the-road trucking was able to do some level of positive growth relative to the overall blended growth rate. So while the international markets carried most of the weight of the positive growth, we did see some pockets within the U.S. business that was also accretive to the overall. As we said, some of the small fleet business is just struggling a little bit in terms of filling the bucket back up with the sales activity as we've pivoted upmarket. And in Brazil, that's over 60% of the customer base is using multiple products. So it's a number where we feel like we can get some really good penetration over time as a significant number of people would do just as Ron described, that use case of I wanted to use one app to service the multiple types of activities and, ultimately, payment transactions surrounding their vehicle. Trevor, that's certainly a contributing factor in terms of the synergies that we're able to realize with Global Reach. We did a lot of heavy lifting over the spring and early summer to move on to one platform. We're able to eliminate some of the back office costs, technology costs. That was a significant contributor. And then just the positive operating leverage within the business and just look at the structural dynamics of that business and how the 20% revenue growth against a relatively stable fixed cost base are just going to generate positive operating leverage and drive margins higher. So combination of synergies and structural components would be the things that contributed to that."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded on Tuesday, August 8, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Eglseder, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nJames Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Panther, our CFO. Following their prepared remarks, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then that you can get in line for questions. Please note, our earnings release and the supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section on our website at fleetcor.com.  \n Now throughout this call, we will be covering organic revenue growth. As a reminder, this metric neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads. It also includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed during the 2 years being compared. We will also be covering non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than in other companies. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website. \n I also need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our outlook, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We undertake no obligation to update any of these statements. The expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect today. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available both on our website and at sec.gov. Now with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? \nRonald F. Clarke: Okay. Jim, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Up front here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects: first, provide my take on our Q2 results. Second, I'll share our updated 2023 guidance. Third, update you on a few key priorities that we're working and then lastly, discuss the status of our strategic review.  \n Okay. Let me begin with our Q2 results which finished better than our expectations. We reported revenue of $948 million and cash EPS of $419 million, both of those up sequentially. Our Q2 EBITDA almost touched $500 million, which is an all-time record for us. Both our print revenue  growth and organic revenue growth came in at 10% for the quarter. The reason is Q2 print revenue helped by acquisition revenue and hurt by lower fuel prices, so effectively a wash. The components of our overall 10% organic revenue growth were fleet stepping up 6% for the quarter, helped a lot there by our international markets, particularly Mexico and Australia, both of those up over 20% for the quarter. Also, our EV revenue increased 45% year-over-year.  \n Brazil grew 15% in Q2 and continued strength in our core toll line, tag volume, they're up 7%, helped by our new bank partnerships also increasing demand for our new vehicle insurance add-ons. Lodging, up 14%, led by our airline vertical, that results from a number of new airline implementations, along with the growing usage of our auto rebooking feature for distressed  passengers. And finally, corporate payments up 22%. That was led by our direct payables business. That was up over 30% in the quarter. Also our cross-border business doing great, enjoyed record levels of new sales and new accounts. \n Turning to the trends or fundamentals in the quarter, also quite good. sales grew 20% in Q2. Inside of that number, corporate payment sales up 80% versus last year which reflects strong demand for that product line. Our North America fuel sales remained pretty soft in the quarter. That reflects the pivot we made away from micro SMB accounts last fall in an effort to control bad debt. Retention good remained steady at 91%, and that's despite a set of aggressive credit policies that we changed. And same-store sales finishing flat, really a mix of pockets of both strength and weakness. Weakness, we saw in our lodging managed accounts business and strength really in the stability, improving stability in our North America trucking business.  \n So look, all in all, a bit better Q2 than we had expected, a really terrific start to the first half. Year-to-date revenues, sales and earnings all coming in ahead of plan.  \n Okay. Let me shift gears and share our outlook for rest of the year 2023. \n First off, we're calling for the second half macro to be roughly neutral to our recent [ 3 + 9 ] view, albeit with some puts and takes, specifically expecting better FX, but lower fuel prices. We're revising full year 2023 guidance, including Russia, of revenue of $3.848 billion at the midpoint and cash EPS of 17, 22 at the midpoint. This updated guide reflects the flow-through of our $8 million Q2 revenue beat and $0.07 cash EPS beat, so leaving the second half prior guide intact. And although the business is running ahead of our internal expectations for the first half, there is considerable sequential revenue growth still baked into our second half forecast. The revised second half guide implies  print revenue growth of about 12% and organic revenue growth of about 10%, pretty consistent with the first half.  \n Finally, the guide implies an attractive Q4 exit with revenue growth expected to be 14% and reach $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time. So pretty exciting. We do expect cash EPS growth of 16% in the exit as we begin to lap interest rates from last year.  \n Okay. Let me make the turn and share our progress against a few important priorities. So first, EV. We're continuing to progress our EV efforts along with our understanding of how the energy transition may in fact, affect our business. If you would look at Pages 12 through 14 in our earnings supplement. So on the economics front, EV vehicles, at least among our commercial mixed fleet clients continues to be very favorable. EV vehicles, they are generating more revenue per vehicle than a comparable ICE vehicle. We've seen this positive trend now over the last 10 quarters. So really super good news there.  \n Second, EV is beginning to grow. EV revenue in Q2, up 45% versus the prior year. And the number of U.K. EV commercial accounts nearly tripled in Q2 versus prior year. Okay. Second up is our fleet Board refreshment initiative. We added 3 new directors to the fleet Board here in calendar 2023 and have had 2 long tenured directors retire. This move has strengthened both our audit and tech committee oversight and greatly enhance our diversity.  \n So last up in terms of updates is our North America fleet sales pivot. You may recall, we were selling a lot of super small micro accounts digitally last year and made the decision to move digital sales upmarket to bigger company prospects. So some progress there. Again, we essentially stopped onboarding new super small 1 and 2 card sized companies about 9 months ago. And although this reduces our overall North America fleet sales, we do expect the second half fleet credit losses to decrease about 30% to 35% sequentially first half versus second half. Good news, we are increasing the number of new fuel apps that have more than 5 cards. That's from modifying our digital advertising bidding engine. So that's working. We do expect to be on the other side of this digital sales transition as we exit '23 and thus better positioned to accelerate fuel card sales next year.  \n Okay. Last up is the status of our strategic review in which we're reevaluating the portfolio of our company with the idea of potentially separating one or more of our businesses. As you can imagine, we've been quite busy with this review, along with our overall value creation plan.  \n So first, on overhangs on the FTC front, we have closed the FTC injunctive relief chapter. You may recall, we received the court order. We're implementing the remaining disclosure request there and expect to be in compliance by the end of this month. We do believe that our North America fuel business exceeds the very best industry marketing and disclosure practices. Russia, we have now received all necessary government approvals to close the Russia sale. We are working through some final closing mechanics and hopeful that, that deal will close later this month. Tom will speak to the expected financial impact of the Russia sale here in just a minute.  \n Second, noncore assets, we are progressing the potential sale of a couple of noncore assets. We're well underway in exploring the sale of our prepaid businesses. We're also in discussions regarding a few small divestitures that are within our vehicle line of business.  \n Third, fleet reinvention. We're pretty aggressively working to reposition our global fleet business, the goal is to create really an exciting future for fleet that promises sustainable and durable growth. We think we're out in front here in EV and actually expect EV to accelerate growth in that business. We're continuing to broaden our set of vehicle-related payment solutions, of solutions beyond fuel. And we do believe that re-rating our biggest business and biggest earnings contributors, is really the #1 driver of the company's overall value creation.  \n So lastly, the topic of separation. We are exploring with the help of Goldman Sachs, the idea of separating one or more of our businesses to further unlock value. Our path initially is to look simply at separating or spinning off one of our major businesses into a separate company. So the considerations or assumptions here are around forward pro forma multiples, what would the stand-alone company trade at, tax impacts dis-synergies of the separation, opportunities for future M&A, really a whole host of things.  \n The second path is to potentially combine one of our 3 major businesses with the [ dans ] partner. That would be a pure-play company that provides very similar solutions to one of our 3 big businesses. So we are actively involved in exploring a few [ dans ] partner combinations and evaluating the attractiveness of that path.  \n As promised on our last call, we expect to complete our work on each of these 4 initiatives before year-end and for sure, we'll share our conclusions with you then.  \n Okay. So look, in closing today, I do want to reiterate that we are pleased with Q2 and our first half performance, our financials and KPIs ahead of our initial expectations. We are flowing through our Q2 beat and raising full year 2023 guidance. We are progressing a few of our key priorities again, particularly on the EV front, and we are actively exploring several portfolio moves in an effort to re-rate our multiple.  \n So with that, let me turn the call back over to Tom to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Tom? \nThomas Panther: Thanks, Ron. Here are some additional details related to the macro environment during the quarter. We had 10% organic revenue growth in Q2, and our reported revenue growth was also 10% and as the growth from recent acquisitions offset fuel price headwinds. Revenue of $948 million exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $8 million, comprised of $13 million in higher revenue partially offset by $5 million of fuel-related macro, which flowed through to our $0.07 beat in cash EPS of $4.19.  \n Fuel prices were $3.65 per gallon for the quarter, lower than our $3.99 guide from May, which caused approximately $20 million of lower revenues versus prior year. We exited the quarter with fuel prices around $3.55 per gallon, but prices rose in July to approximately $3.60 per gallon, a trend we expect to continue over the balance of the year based on the EIA forecast. Fuel spreads were positive versus prior year by about $5 million.  \n Lastly, we had $9 million of negative impact from lower foreign exchange rates, mainly due to the decline in the ruble as the economic impact from the war drags on. In aggregate, we had $23 million of macro headwind versus last year that we were able to power through by way of organic and acquisition-related growth.  \n Now on to our performance for the quarter. As I previously mentioned, organic revenue growth was 10%, reflecting the healthy diversification of our business and the realization of strong sales from last year that continued into the first half of this year. Corporate Payments revenue was up 22%, driven by strength in our direct business, including full AP software solutions, which again grew over 50%. Our comprehensive menu of high-quality payment solutions continues to sell incredibly well as we sign up new customers who are looking to transform their AP operations.  \n Cross-border revenue was up almost 30% as sales remained strong and client transaction activity was again robust. We completed the global reach, customer migration and are now focused on selling our combined set of products and services in all geographies, which is contributing to our strong performance. In addition, we remain committed to realizing the cost synergies and as we rationalize the IT and facilities overlap, which will help expand margins in the second half of the year.  \n Turning to our fleet business. Organic revenue increased 6% driven by higher revenue per transaction and sales growth, especially in our international markets. In the U.S., we are seeing early success from our pivot and digital sales to a slightly larger customer segment but we are still feeling the effects from significantly reducing our micro SMB fleet sales beginning in the third quarter of last year. We anticipate digital sales to improve heading into next year as we adjust our lead generation strategies and conversion pipelines.  \n To expand on Ron's comments regarding our market-leading EV solutions in Europe, we are seeing over 20% sequential quarter growth in accounts, cards and home charging users, and we continue to expand our proprietary charging network which translated into over 30% sequential growth in kilowatt hours charged. While the revenue base remains relatively small, given the emerging usage of commercial EVs, it's a great start and we are committed to building upon our unique capabilities.  \n Brazil's revenue grew 15% compared to last year, driven by 7% tag growth. We now have 6.5 million tag users, which enables us to further increase the proportion of revenue from our expanded network of products where we earn interchange. In the current quarter, approximately 36% of our B2C revenue was from the expanded network.  \n Sales also remained strong, increasing 16% driven by a robust digital, field and partner distribution channels. Lodging revenue increased 14% which was in line with our expectations. I would note that the business grew 41% last year. So this quarter is up against a tough year-over-year comp. This quarter's solid performance was highlighted by sales success across our industry verticals. In addition to revenue per room night that increased 19%, driven primarily from channel and product mix.  \n The Other segment declined 14% due to a shift in the timing of cards ordered by our retail clients in our gift business. In the second quarter of last year, card orders were pulled forward from Q3 and Q4 as retailers wanted to ensure supply chain delays did not impact their card stock for the year-end holiday season. Our full year net revenue expectations for this business remain in line with our prior expectations.  \n Now looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses of $536 million represented a 9% increase over Q2 of the prior year, primarily due to the addition of the Roomex Plugsurfing and Global Reach Group operations. The increase in OpEx was also impacted by higher bad debt, increases tied to higher transaction and sales activities and investments to drive future growth. Bad debt expense was $35 million or 7 basis points of spend, which was stable with last year and in line with our expectations. We currently expect bad debt to improve approximately 20% in the back half of the year compared to the second half of 2022.  \n EBITDA margin in the quarter was 52.4% which is 140 basis points improvement from 51% in the first quarter of this year and 30 basis points higher than last year. Normalizing for our recent capability acquisitions, EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. We still expect our full year EBITDA margin to improve throughout the year and exit around 200 to 250 basis points better than the prior year. This will be driven by solid revenue growth and synergies realized from acquisitions.  \n Interest expense increased $65 million year-over-year driven by the increase in SOFR on our debt stack. The impact of higher interest rates resulted in an approximate $0.57 drag on Q2 adjusted EPS. Over the past few months, we've been monitoring swap rates relative to the SOFR forward curve. In August, we executed $2 billion of fixed rate swaps with an average maturity of 3.5 years, an average fixed rate of 4.3%. These swaps provide immediate positive carry of approximately 100 basis points and ladders out the fixed rate portion of our debt stack, which is now approximately 60% fixed. These interest rate risk management actions capitalized on the strong relative value of swap rates at the 3- to 4-year point of the curve, generating an immediate benefit to interest expense and substantially reduces interest expense volatility going forward without incurring outsized duration risk.  \n Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.6% versus 23.7% last year, which reflected a discrete tax item that positively affected the 2022 tax rate.  \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.25 billion in unrestricted cash, and we had $768 million available on our revolver. We have $5.5 million outstanding on our credit facilities and we had $1.25 billion borrowed under our securitization facility. As of June 30, our leverage ratio was 2.6x trailing 12 months EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. We made no open market share repurchases in the quarter, and we still have over $1.2 billion authorized for share repurchases. We have ample liquidity to pursue near-term M&A opportunities and continue to buy back shares when it makes sense. \n In addition to Ron's overview of our full year guidance, let me give you some additional detail, including some thoughts on our Q3 outlook and supporting assumptions, which can be found in our supplemental materials. For the full year, we now expect GAAP revenues between $3.836 billion and $3.86 billion. Adjusted net income between $1.281 billion and $1.303 billion. Adjusted net income per diluted share between $17.09 and $17.35. And finally, EBITDA growth of 17%.  \n For Q3, we're expecting revenue to be between $980 million and $1 billion, and adjusted net income per share to be between $4.44 and $4.64 per share, which, at the midpoint, is up 7% of what we reported in Q3 of 2022. All of these estimates include Russia for the full year.  \n We are now assuming an August close of our Russian business as we continue to work through the final closing details. Upon close, we expect revenues for the year to be $45 million to $55 million lower, resulting in a $0.25 to $0.35 decline in adjusted EPS over the remainder of the year. Based on using the sale proceeds for buybacks. This guidance is consistent with our previous guidance after adjusting for anticipated August close.  \n Related to our guidance assumptions. we are using $3.66 for our fuel price assumption for the rest of the year. Our interest expense guidance of $330 million to $340 million is based off an average SOFR rate of 5.31% for the rest of the year. Additional assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement. With that, thank you for your interest in FLEETCOR. And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. Thank you \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Tiem-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Good afternoon, everybody. I appreciate the update on thing. So I guess, Ron, I want to ask you, with you're moving forward with the strategic review, you mentioned a couple of options on the separation and some views on the noncore. And I know you've probably learned a ton here. I don't think you're going to tell us which way you're leaning per se. But as you've learned through this process, I mean, have you changed your priorities on how you're going to seek value? And I know this has taken up a lot of your time, but is the preference to seek immediate value for certain? Or are there some other things that you see that could be value creative that maybe could last over the mid- to longer term, if you follow my question. Really immediate gratification versus sort of a long-term balancing ex. \nRonald F. Clarke: Tien-Tsin, I have no idea where to go with that question. Yes. We're obviously, as I tried to say in the opening, working the thing pretty hard right? Running through these 3 or 4 different areas. I guess I would say in terms of leading your comment of, hey, what do we think? What do I think? Has the chance to re-rate to get the value. I'd say 2 things. One, we think getting people to believe the fleet business or what we're going to transform into the vehicle business that, that's got a durable, and exciting future as kind of Job 1, 2 and 3 because it's so big. It's such a big part of the company, and particularly the EV part of that story. So I'd say we are working that like super hard and it will come full with some stuff in [ 90 days ].  \n The second one on the separation thing, I'd say that, to me, the separation is much more interesting and compelling if we can do it in combination with something, not only because that could create more scale and stuff in the space but also potentially have a bunch of synergies with it. And so the structural separation enables in some ways transactions that are not as easy out of the mothership.  So I'd say that those would be my 2. It's the fleet reinvention where people believe in the future and the potential for separation that would also include a combination. \nTien-Tsin Huang: So, I wrote down, Ron. I didn't ask the question very well. I think you mentioned that EV would accelerate growth in the fleet business. I think EV grew 47%. Do you feel like you have a good line of sight now, at least in the short to midterm, on the EV piece and how it would supplement growth within fleet. Can you tell us a little bit more on where the sources of revenues are coming from? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, that's another too good question. I mean the first thing, Tien-tsin, is just if you take the existing accounts, the defensive nature. So, hey, this vehicle, we have millions of vehicles. What if some of those vehicles are EVs? So the first conclusion or forming conclusion is we don't care. We could be in different matter of what commercial vehicles exist in a bunch of years from now as long as they're owned by the company, we can make money, we can make revenue. And in fact, we're making more.  \n The second one is, it's looking like because our EV stuff is a bit better. We're out ahead of other people, including, for example, the oil companies. that we might do better in our basic selling and retaining commercial fleets that we have because we get advantage by having the combined old fashion and new fashion package. And then the third one, we've got a new trick comment on the consumer side, which is a segment that we're not in. So to the extent that we can light up the consumer side by just repurposing the stuff we have. So that's kind of the 1, 2, 3. Neutral to flat kind of in the first one, went a bit more in the commercial and then add the consumer, that would be the trifecta. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask about the fleet segment organic revenues. It came in above our model. I think you called out some outperformance in international markets, Mexico, Australia. Just curious what was the driver there that sort of upside surprise? And should we expect whatever boosted growth internationally to kind of continue through the remainder of the year? \nThomas Panther: Ramsey, it's Tom. I appreciate the question. Ram, it's just a variety of things. I think we saw some good transaction activity in our international markets. And keep in mind, our international markets diversified beyond just fuel. We have other businesses within that fleet segment that also helps drive growth. So it's just a function of where the business was performing. I'll also say that fuel price in our international markets were stickier, particularly at the retail side than what we necessarily would experience here in the U.S. So that also helps kind of bolster the international side and the overall revenue growth. Obviously, we'll relook at that growth rate going forward when we're successful in closing the Russia transaction. That will affect it to some degree. But overall, we saw a nice healthy pickup in the overall growth rate. \nRonald F. Clarke: Hey, Ramsey, it's Ron. Just to add, I think we said on the last call that the thing would kind of tick along, right? That it was lower. And so kind of mid-single digits is still kind of where our guide is. \nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. All right. And I think the answer to this question is probably no, based on your performance in the quarter and your guide, but I wanted to ask regardless, any impact from the yellow bankruptcy. I know they're not a big customer, any residual credit exposure or anything like that? \nRonald F. Clarke: No, no exposure to yellow. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Nick Cremo with Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Suisse. \nNikolai Cremo: I just wanted to follow up on Ramsey's question on the Fleet segment. Could you just tell us what growth was in the North American Fleet segment, maybe just like on a same-store sales basis? And then as my follow-up question, could we expect this mid-single-digit revenue per transaction growth to continue in the second half? \nThomas Panther: Nick, it's Tom. We actually don't break it down beyond the segment level. So I mean, I think overall, we kind of keep it at the total fleet level and the international business outperformed U.S. But getting into kind of the details is just something that we stay away from. And then going forward, I think as we just said, I think you can continue to expect borrowing, we see fuel prices and spreads hang to somewhere in the range of our guidance. That you would see that mid-single-digit type growth rate as we look ahead into Q3 and Q4. \nRonald F. Clarke: Hey, Nick, it's Ron. Let me just add on to what Tom said, pretty consistent same-store sales in the fleet business. Let's look about the same in the last few quarters, so not a lot going on there. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. \nDarrin Peller: Maybe just one on the core pay segment for a minute, just given how strong it continues to be. And if we break down the segment by obviously, the different sources of growth, I'd love to hear more about what you're seeing the most strength out of and sustainability of those. I mean, you made some comments, obviously, on invoice pay. But anything more would be great. And then, Ron, I know we've touched on cross-selling that business into the fleet side as well. So curious on your thoughts there if there's been any progress. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Darren, good question. Yes. So first off, we're happy someone picked on us or me. I think last time saying, hey, he said around 20%, I think it was 19%. So I don't that guys on [indiscernible] 22%. So on the strength side, the direct business is what I'd say we've called out before, that we're not happy with the channel of the partner business where the thing started 7 years ago. That thing is still negative and trending down. So to end up with 22%  consolidated to tell you that the direct stuff is well north of 22%, which obviously we're super excited about. There's no concentration in that business. So that's doing well. And I do need to call out for the cross-border thing. I mean, I don't know if you heard it, but the sales, so new business was up 80%, 8-0 percent quarter-over-quarter. So it's an all-time record of the amount of new business that we've sold and cross-border was just crazy in terms of sales. So I don't know if people are hearing this, but sales in that business and the performance in the direct business are trending way above what we thought they would be.  \n So your last question on cross-sell. So we did an interesting thing, saying as part of the strategic review, where we looked at our 3 biggest businesses in the U.S., right, fleet lodging and corporate payments. And we said, let's go into what we call the blue box. So companies that are not like micro, call it, above 10 million. And we focus on 3 industries where about 70% of the clients are. And we find that we've got about 15% to 20% overlap already. So in other words, when we take the clients that, let's say, fleet has, that lodging has, and the corporate payments has that are kind of not small, and we say, \"Hey, do they have more than one?\" The answer is lots of the clients have more than 1, that's 15% to 20% overlap. And the reason that we haven't called it out before is because we started in those product silos and unrelated brand, the  businesses just went to Ron Clarke and sold each of the 3 products. So now clearly, we started advertising in the Corpay brand to those bit bigger accounts and tell them, \"Hey, we got all 3 things.\" So everyone should expect that there'll be more of that, more of the same kind of decent sized prospective customer taking everything we've got. \nDarrin Peller: Good, good. That's good to hear. And just my quick follow-up would be around capital allocation. It just seems like there was a little bit less in the way of buybacks in the first half. So is there any change to your strategy on cap allocation? Or is it waiting for the Russia deal to close or anything else going on that we should just be aware of? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, it's a good follow-up. So no change. Obviously, M&A continues to be the lead dog. And given the strategic review and some of the M&A activity that's inherent, right, in the combination the comments that I've made. So that's part of it. And then the second one, you got it, we basically will earmark proceeds if we're successful in closing out the Russia sale and/or the prepaid sales, you should expect we'll be buying stock back. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Peter Christiansen with Citigroup. \nPeter Christiansen: Thanks for the question. Nice trends here. I wanted to first talk about the margin expansion that you're looking for this year, which is pretty commendable considering the full fuel price decline, which is we all know can be quite detrimental. I was just wondering where you're seeing the sources of margin uptake, I guess, for the full year, I guess, in the second half of the year? Is it a mix shift? Is it a particular segment that you're seeing better, cost execution, operating leverage? Any color there would be helpful. \nRonald F. Clarke: Pete, it's Ronald. Let me start, and then I'll let Tom jump in. So the first one is there's always operating leverage inherent in the business, right? So as our revenue climbs, right? So our second half revenue will be up, I don't know, a top $100 million or $150 million, Pete, is our guide over the first half. So the marginal EBITDA flow through on that incremental revenue is super duper high. \n And then the second one I'd say is kind of lapping the capability acquisitions. I think we said earlier that that's tapping, call it, 100 to 200 basis points out of our EBITDA margin, right? Investing in things for the future. So as we lap that, we'll pick it up. In fact, the piece of paper in front of me is our internal Q4 forecast, which has our consolidated margin up about 340 basis points. So if the revenue comes in, and we get the operating leverage and we lap the thing, our margins will be way strong. We're exiting Q4 than they were last year. \nJames Faucette: Add keeping on the acquisition front, we also expect to continue to realize some synergies from our GRT acquisition. So that will help some. And then also stock comp, bad debt will also improved relative to year-over-year related to those 2 items as well. So those items and the items that Ron commented on argument that acceleration in margin. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, that bad debt was just an important one, right? That they grew surprise , i think lots of people, right? In the second half, which is why we reacted relatively quickly and we're seeing the trends both in what we reported here and what we're forecasting. So to Tom's point, there's a pretty big step down as you exit Q4, which obviously is super helpful to the EBITDA margin. \nPeter Christiansen: No. That's a good point. You guys just have a good history of getting after bad debt in the past for sure. My follow-up question, and Ron hit on it earlier. You called out some really impressive growth in Corpay, particularly the cross-border and certainly full AP. Just wondering if you could paint the picture at least qualitatively what's going on in the virtual card side and the direct side, a little bit more, just give us a sense of the direction of those slices of business would be helpful. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, Pete, it's Ron again. I think as I mentioned, the sales is the lead indicator, right? So the fact that not only in the quarter, but I'm looking at the year-to-date, it's a record level of sales, both in the payables side of the business and in the cross-border. So that's the first point. And then in terms of what we're selling, the mix has shifted more to full AP, but we still do sell stand-alone virtual card. And I think if you had our sales group in the room, the idea of having both areas to draw on, hey, look, I'll pay some of your bills, pal, or I'll pay all of your bills. You tell me what you want, and I can give you some money back either way. So that 2 for pitch, I think, is resonating. So we're still selling both the stand-alone and the full, but a bit more of the full these days. \nJames Faucette: And Peter, we're also seeing good acceleration on just sheer volume increase. And some of that is from sales and some of that is just from deepening with our existing customer base, getting implementations onboarded and also working real hard to try to get as much cardable spend as possible. So all of those things in terms of the front door and mining the existing portfolio, all drive that to impress the growth level. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. \nAndrew Jeffrey: Appreciate you taking the question. Great results in Corpay, which is good to see. Maybe for you, Tom, can you elaborate a little bit on what mix might mean to yield in that segment? Are you sort of -- and maybe gross profit to relatively indifferent to full stack payables versus FX? And if FX continues to be as strong as it is, anything we need to think about as far as mix or contribution margin or gross profit margin within that segment? \nThomas Panther: No, they don't -- Andrew, they don't differ materially between the subsegments within that overall business. Both of them are attractive. They're also -- they're obviously different businesses. Our payables business is much more domestically oriented where our cross-border is much more internationally oriented. We like the diversification that, that brings. But there isn't necessarily a material margin difference that you need to be modeling in. I think both of them, as Ron mentioned, just in terms of what we see from a sales perspective, have very strong sales results, solid pipeline. And both of them have recurring business with existing customers. You may kind of think of cross-borders more transaction-oriented one-and-done kinds of relationships or anything but that. They're generally customers who have recurring tight cross-border transactions. And so that provides us kind of a healthy recurring type revenue stream coming from those businesses. So they're more probably, other than the products and their geographies, their economics and their kind of compositions are more similar than you may normally think. \nRonald F. Clarke: Hey, Andrew, it's Ron. Just one other difference to point out on top of Thomas made. The cross-border business not only do we make a lot of sales and their sales are way up, but their cost of sales are super attractive. They're the second most efficient sale in our company in terms of what it costs us to get $1 of sales, so we love that. And then second, they start super fast. So the start rate, what you would call implementation is super duper quick from kind of when we roll call or say it's contracted. So those are 2 things actually about that particular line of business that make it really attractive. \nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. That's helpful. And then I wanted to touch a little bit, if I could, on the digital marketing initiatives. It sounds like they're starting to gain some attraction up market. Any sort of LTV to CAC considerations as you sign those bigger accounts that we need to be thinking about? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd say not really, Andrew. I'd say it's pretty complicated to move a big machine like that. It gets tuned right a certain way, like a piano  or something gets tuned to work a certain way, and then we kind of haul the thing and say, okay, repoint the machinery in a different way. So it needs to grab lots of data to start it to kind of sort itself out again. So it's taken probably a bit longer. But as I said in my opening, it's working, the number of bigger new accounts coming to us digitally is growing now. So I don't want to say it was easy, but it's way easier to stop the problem. They just don't tune up the small ones. It's way harder to get more of the big one. So we've always -- I think 50% of our business has always been bigger accounts. So we're totally used to that, both underwriting them and servicing them and starting on that. So really, it's just getting smarter about how to spend money to get the appropriate segment in the door. \nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. So it sounds like only upside from here. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. It didn't matter. I mean that's what I want to call out is -- literally i brought the thing to a screeching halt because we were not going to pose some crazy credit number. And the good news is that work, the credit numbers are already down and we're forecasting a roll rates were to be down. So Job 1 is past tense, it's accomplished. Job 2, I'm saying started in Q2 to get better, the number of new bigger stuff has increased. And now I told the guy, it's getting up and go, get your horse going, we need to weigh more of it. So we'll report whether we're picking that pace up as we run through the second half. \nJames Eglseder: And field sales remain strong. And those are obviously already at a larger client segment level, and they continue to be a significant portion of the overall and they've been doing quite well as well. So that kind of buffers a little bit of the impact from our pivot in digital. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Nate Svensson with Deutsche Bank. \nChristopher Svensson: I wanted to ask about monthly trends in the organic fleet business as we move through the second quarter? And then any update on what you've seen in July and August month-to-date. And the reason I ask is it that previously you had pointed for sort of a continued acceleration off of that 3% organic growth that you saw in the first quarter through the remainder of the year. So kind of just wondering how that trended through the quarter. And I know you got it to mid-single digits for the full year, but just wondering about the potential for a continued sequential acceleration as we move into 3Q. \nJames Eglseder: Yes, I'll take it, Nate. I mean really from a monthly perspective, there weren't really anomalies. Obviously, there's certain day counts and how many weeks within a particular month that can kind of skew the numbers from month to month. So it can be a little bit misleading to kind of just look at pure months. But just from a business momentum perspective, I would say, we saw significant shifts in terms of volumes and transactions and things like that. As we head into July, I'd say, probably more of the same. Maybe with the benefit of what we've seen more recently, uptick in crude, that will translate into higher retail. And so that should provide a number that's right within the guidance number that we referenced right in that [ 365 366 ] range. So nothing really out of the ordinary to call out. I think we'll continue to expect some level of seasonal growth as the summer continues. We think it into some of the heavy agricultural months. Those months can also drive a fair amount of usage. So all of those things, I think, point us to kind of the direction we've commented on here earlier on the call. \nChristopher Svensson: Got it. I appreciate all that color. And I guess for my follow-up, I'll ask on lodging. I don't think that's come up here in the Q&A. So revenue growth, 14% off a very difficult comp was impressive. But noticed that revenue nights were down sequentially and year-over-year. And I also believe in the prepared remarks, you mentioned some softness in managed accounts. So maybe you can give some color on that softness that you're seeing? And then relatedly, I know you maintained sort of mid-teens growth for the full year, but any color on the cadence of growth as we move into the back half and comps get a lot easier moving past the second quarter? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, Nate. It's Ron again. So yes, you're right. I did call it out. I'd say, we're a little surprised. I'm not really super sure why, but when we go through our managed accounts, which in English means something like groups of people, consulting groups or an environmental group, the utility going somewhere, so larger groups like going to a place like to do something, merchandising groups that would go to Walmart.  I think that's kind of what that business is. And so for some reason, some number of accounts just on their own did less of it in Q2 than what we were out looking. And so when we call, it's not super clear, we say, \"Hey, is that going to be at that level?\" or \"kind of where you were before.\" So that was kind of a bit, call it, a couple of points of growth of the soft pocket that we didn't outlook. So I'd say we're not super certain what that's going to look like going forward. It's not like a lot of them quit us, as you can see in the retention rate. So look, we're hopeful that whatever that is, was kind of transitory for the quarter. \nUnknown Executive: There on that, Nate, is that we have a nice diversification of airline and insurance that kind of helps offset that as well where we've seen some pretty good strength as we commented earlier. \nRonald F. Clarke: And we have a big, what we call custom business and [ Joint ] accounts like railroads and trucking firms, we have a small SMB business, we call it direct. So there's a lot of other segments in the business. But there was this one -- this kind of consulting [ traveler ] group so I did want to call out. Look, still happy with mid-teens. We plan that business at mid-teens. So it's performed above that level. So I want people to be clear, still happy with it. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. \nTrevor Williams: So on Russia, I appreciate the updated sale impact on the reported numbers, but I was hoping we could get some help on what the organic growth in fleet in the quarter would have looked like ex Russia. And same thing for the mid-single-digit target for the full year for fleet, just what that growth rate would look like without Russia? \nUnknown Executive: Yes. Trevor, we'll update all of that when the transaction closes and we kind of refresh all of that. Let's come back to you on that. I think until we kind of get the transaction closed, we'll wait and reset after that, if that's okay. \nTrevor Williams: Okay. Fair enough. And then on the guide, Ron, you alluded to, there is still a decent amount of sequential growth implied both for the third and fourth quarter. Maybe just talk us through, especially for Q4, kind of the level of visibility you think you have in, I think it's $20 million that's implied quarter-over-quarter in Q4. It sounds like maybe you're getting some of the new sales into the larger fleet customers that might start layering on, but anything else just on kind of level of visibility into that? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, good question. The first thing I'd say is we had a decent look at July. So that's always helpful. So that's tracking to our guide. So when Tom and I built the second half, the output we have is that, that's on track. Yes, the thing does, bill sequentially, which is Ron's favorite thing about the business. I think I told people this is a snowball. He started downhill and there's more snows as you roll down the hill. So that's the nature of a recurring revenue business as we beat sales, so we're ahead of sales year-to-date. And I call it like corporate payments, which is way ahead as that stuff gets implemented to Tom's point, that attaches more snow, the ball rolls and obviously, sequentially, I think we're up about $40 million sequentially already Q2 versus Q1. So I'd say, look, our confidence is pretty high. We're on track. We have the sales in the bag. We just need to get them implemented and then there's the seasonality, right? Q3 is always a super duper quarter and Q4 is better than Q1. So we get some benefit of strength. For example, Brazil is always super duper good, for example, in Q4. So we've been having a long time, I think, unless something kind of go sideways on the planet that we're pretty comfortable with the guide. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. \nMihir Bhatia: I wanted to ask a little bit more about take rates or just the revenue per transaction or per spend in corporate payments. You saw some pretty good growth there. I think in lodging, you called out, it was product and channel driven. But maybe talk a little bit more about the fleet segment in particular. What drove the strength in revenue per transaction there and also in corporate payments, if you wouldn't mind. \nUnknown Executive: Yes, I'll take a swing at that, and I may have missed a little bit of the question. It's take rate in both corporate payments and fleet, Mihir ? \nMihir Bhatia: Yes. Correct. \nThomas Panther: Generally, just kind of mix. There's really nothing in particular to call out. You see a little bit of an increase in the take rate when you refer to our release. Again, it's a pretty modest increase. So I think it's just a matter of just mix of business and really nothing more to really call out besides that. We're always competitive with respect to our pricing and things like that. So I think, fuel will also factor into what our overall spread and how those things have played out. And so it's just a combination of things, but nothing really out of the ordinary. And that's kind of what you're seeing in the numbers in terms of just kind of a slight increase in rate. \nRonald F. Clarke: Mihir, it's Ron. Just to add to that, which is in corporate payments, the mix shift that Tom refers to, we think, will go on. So when we tell you guys today that we're growing mid- to high-20s in the direct corporate payments business and that the channel business is going backwards, the delta in those take rates is significant. Call it, 4 or 5x different. So every turn of that, every forward quarter with the direct business is growing, let's say, 25% or higher and the channel business is shrinking, that will improve that rate prospectively. \nMihir Bhatia: All right. No, that is helpful. And then if I can ask one big -- one more -- just a big picture type question. I think earlier you were talking about doing a little bit more digital marketing, more cross-sell. At the same time, you are in the midst of a strategic review about potentially divesting some businesses. I just wanted to ask about the puts and takes with that. How aggressive are you going to be on cross-sell in the short term 'til we know where the strategic review is ending up? \nRonald F. Clarke: Another really good question. So I'd say that we're trying to learn. And I think the first finding today is that we have cross selling. And when we study among the larger clients that we have, they use more than one of our products. I'm reporting today, yes, they do. So the second thing we're doing is advertising now that we've consolidated the brand, we're generating way more leads by offering up more solutions to the same prospective company. So I think that's just another input for us potentially in the synergies or dissynergies as we think about the separation. And obviously, to the extent that the separation still made lots of sense. There's no reason we couldn't have some kind of agreement -- commercial agreement with the company afterwards as an example. So I think we're just running them on separate tracks and learning what we can and see where it lands us. But it's clearly an input into the separation decision for sure. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Suchoski from Autonomous Research. \nKenneth Suchoski: I just wanted to ask about corporate payments. I think you mentioned, Ron, that the cross-border new business is up 80% quarter-over-quarter. Those new sales ramp pretty quickly. So I guess, is the expectation that this business grows above 20% or maybe even north of 22% for the rest of the year and into 2024? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. So look, I want to make sure it's clear what I said. I said the corporate payment sales, which are both, what we call payables internally and cross-border. Collectively, that book was up 80% year-over-year. So that's the first one. \n And then the second point is, yes, cross-border implements quickly payables does not. So to the extent that some amount of that incremental growth is in payables, it's actually a 2024 benefit more than is 2023. But on the guide, I don't have in front of me, my guess is that we're still guiding in the overall to 20% plus in the Corporate Payments business. And I don't know if you guys are hearing it, but it's kind of working. Sales are working, revenue is working. So it's -- we're -- the trends are certainly in a good spot. \nKenneth Suchoski: Yes, totally. And then, Ron, I guess just real quick, just on the strategic review and the separation, sales, spending, et cetera. I mean are there certain kind of segments that stand out in terms of having a greater opportunity to create more value? And anything else that you see just on the dissynergies, I know you mentioned some of the overlap in the customer base, but just anything on dissynergies as you think about the different segments? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Again, I think the strategic review of what we call value creation plan, it's just pretty complicated. So that's why I try to tick through kind of the 4 different pieces, kind of how we operationalize review, right? From the Russia thing, which is kind of a political and emotional thing to the noncore assets of the fleet reinvention to the separation. And so we're full speed ahead as you heard on the Russia thing, we're full-speed ahead on the noncore businesses, including a couple of small things that sit inside the vehicle business. \n So I think the question everyone has, we really have 3 big businesses, right? We have fleet, lodging and Corporate Payments. And I think people are focused on fleet, which is half the company or 40% and Corporate Payments. So that's really where we're focusing the attention on the separation. Would the company be better off if fleet and corporate payments were not all part of the same mothership, but in some way, separate, whichever one was separated. So I'd say that's the primary issue, if you will, question that we're trying to answer. And as I mentioned before, we're looking not only pure separation or stand-alone separation, but looking at the idea of some combination in parallel with the thing. So that's what we're working on. \n And yes, unfortunately, in any separation, there's dissynergies. I mean, to me, it takes away the most important thing, which is really the ability to sell something where you can get a defined price. I'd like to know what something is and have my eyes open. And so losing whatever, 25% or 20% after the cost base makes a straight sale of one of those businesses pretty difficult. You got to get a really good price, right, to cover that tax dissynergy, but there we're looking really particularly around both IT and management, right? Which is what IT is co-mingled and how would we run the stuff manage early. So we're kind of digging through all that and want to make sure that any thing that we pull that it would be worth it, right? That the benefits would far out weigh the cost here. So we're still working it. And we did commit to it to work because we can't study it forever. We're going to have an answer when we talk in 90 days. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Sheriq Sumar with Evercore ISI. \nSheriq Sumar: I have a question on the tags business, on the Brazil tag business, strong growth of around 15% and tag growth was like around 7% and strong sales growth too. Can you talk about what's working in terms of the products? The take rates in that segment was also up pretty much sequentially. So what's driving the take rate higher? And how should we think about the take rates for 3Q and 4Q from here? Any color would be appreciated. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, I think. First of all, I think it's a great question because it highlights the pivot and strategy there, right, that what you said, the volume of tag is up 7% of the revenue, the revenue is up double. And so 2 points. One is the volume is healthy, partly because we keep widening the distribution channels. So in the last year, we signed 2 of the 5 biggest banks in Brazil to sell our stuff, our Sem Parar tags. And so those things are pretty added at that channel doesn't cannibalize much the other ways that we sell tag. So we're reaching prospective customers that we weren't reaching before. So that's a super helpful. \n The second one is the take rate and the incremental growth is really from the add-ons. So the fuel that we're selling back to the tag holders is compounding. I don't have it in front of me, call it, 40% or 50%. And then these insurance add-ons, vehicle insurance add-ons, for like contents and micro insurance are crazy in demand. And so we're bolting incremental revenue on to the same account without adding any more tags. And so I think that's what we said to everybody was the idea that business was keep expanding distribution to sell more tags. But because we have millions and millions of customers there, find more things that are vehicle-related like fuel and parking and insurance that we could add on and the answer is we are. And just as a reminder, in the first quarter, I think almost 40% of the spend in Brazil was beyond toll. So lots and lots now of purchasing there is beyond toll products. And so that's the idea for the business. \nUnknown Executive: Yes. Like I have said in my prepared remarks, it was right at just under 40% this quarter again in terms of our B2C customer base. In terms of how much revenues coming from products other than our tag subscription. So it's showing good success. And their sales success has been just continuing to add to the momentum of that business. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, Just on to things get tired or whatever the sales, the absolute sales year-to-date or at a record level. And for the last 3 years, every year, it's been a record level of overall sales versus the prior year. So there's been no slowdown at the rate that we're reaching new customers. So again, it's another business that I'd say is working. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. So this concludes your conference for today. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ronald F. Clarke",
            "content": "Okay. Jim, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Up front here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects: first, provide my take on our Q2 results. Second, I'll share our updated 2023 guidance. Third, update you on a few key priorities that we're working and then lastly, discuss the status of our strategic review.  \n Okay. Let me begin with our Q2 results which finished better than our expectations. We reported revenue of $948 million and cash EPS of $419 million, both of those up sequentially. Our Q2 EBITDA almost touched $500 million, which is an all-time record for us. Both our print revenue  growth and organic revenue growth came in at 10% for the quarter. The reason is Q2 print revenue helped by acquisition revenue and hurt by lower fuel prices, so effectively a wash. The components of our overall 10% organic revenue growth were fleet stepping up 6% for the quarter, helped a lot there by our international markets, particularly Mexico and Australia, both of those up over 20% for the quarter. Also, our EV revenue increased 45% year-over-year.  \n Brazil grew 15% in Q2 and continued strength in our core toll line, tag volume, they're up 7%, helped by our new bank partnerships also increasing demand for our new vehicle insurance add-ons. Lodging, up 14%, led by our airline vertical, that results from a number of new airline implementations, along with the growing usage of our auto rebooking feature for distressed  passengers. And finally, corporate payments up 22%. That was led by our direct payables business. That was up over 30% in the quarter. Also our cross-border business doing great, enjoyed record levels of new sales and new accounts. \n Turning to the trends or fundamentals in the quarter, also quite good. sales grew 20% in Q2. Inside of that number, corporate payment sales up 80% versus last year which reflects strong demand for that product line. Our North America fuel sales remained pretty soft in the quarter. That reflects the pivot we made away from micro SMB accounts last fall in an effort to control bad debt. Retention good remained steady at 91%, and that's despite a set of aggressive credit policies that we changed. And same-store sales finishing flat, really a mix of pockets of both strength and weakness. Weakness, we saw in our lodging managed accounts business and strength really in the stability, improving stability in our North America trucking business.  \n So look, all in all, a bit better Q2 than we had expected, a really terrific start to the first half. Year-to-date revenues, sales and earnings all coming in ahead of plan.  \n Okay. Let me shift gears and share our outlook for rest of the year 2023. \n First off, we're calling for the second half macro to be roughly neutral to our recent [ 3 + 9 ] view, albeit with some puts and takes, specifically expecting better FX, but lower fuel prices. We're revising full year 2023 guidance, including Russia, of revenue of $3.848 billion at the midpoint and cash EPS of 17, 22 at the midpoint. This updated guide reflects the flow-through of our $8 million Q2 revenue beat and $0.07 cash EPS beat, so leaving the second half prior guide intact. And although the business is running ahead of our internal expectations for the first half, there is considerable sequential revenue growth still baked into our second half forecast. The revised second half guide implies  print revenue growth of about 12% and organic revenue growth of about 10%, pretty consistent with the first half.  \n Finally, the guide implies an attractive Q4 exit with revenue growth expected to be 14% and reach $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time. So pretty exciting. We do expect cash EPS growth of 16% in the exit as we begin to lap interest rates from last year.  \n Okay. Let me make the turn and share our progress against a few important priorities. So first, EV. We're continuing to progress our EV efforts along with our understanding of how the energy transition may in fact, affect our business. If you would look at Pages 12 through 14 in our earnings supplement. So on the economics front, EV vehicles, at least among our commercial mixed fleet clients continues to be very favorable. EV vehicles, they are generating more revenue per vehicle than a comparable ICE vehicle. We've seen this positive trend now over the last 10 quarters. So really super good news there.  \n Second, EV is beginning to grow. EV revenue in Q2, up 45% versus the prior year. And the number of U.K. EV commercial accounts nearly tripled in Q2 versus prior year. Okay. Second up is our fleet Board refreshment initiative. We added 3 new directors to the fleet Board here in calendar 2023 and have had 2 long tenured directors retire. This move has strengthened both our audit and tech committee oversight and greatly enhance our diversity.  \n So last up in terms of updates is our North America fleet sales pivot. You may recall, we were selling a lot of super small micro accounts digitally last year and made the decision to move digital sales upmarket to bigger company prospects. So some progress there. Again, we essentially stopped onboarding new super small 1 and 2 card sized companies about 9 months ago. And although this reduces our overall North America fleet sales, we do expect the second half fleet credit losses to decrease about 30% to 35% sequentially first half versus second half. Good news, we are increasing the number of new fuel apps that have more than 5 cards. That's from modifying our digital advertising bidding engine. So that's working. We do expect to be on the other side of this digital sales transition as we exit '23 and thus better positioned to accelerate fuel card sales next year.  \n Okay. Last up is the status of our strategic review in which we're reevaluating the portfolio of our company with the idea of potentially separating one or more of our businesses. As you can imagine, we've been quite busy with this review, along with our overall value creation plan.  \n So first, on overhangs on the FTC front, we have closed the FTC injunctive relief chapter. You may recall, we received the court order. We're implementing the remaining disclosure request there and expect to be in compliance by the end of this month. We do believe that our North America fuel business exceeds the very best industry marketing and disclosure practices. Russia, we have now received all necessary government approvals to close the Russia sale. We are working through some final closing mechanics and hopeful that, that deal will close later this month. Tom will speak to the expected financial impact of the Russia sale here in just a minute.  \n Second, noncore assets, we are progressing the potential sale of a couple of noncore assets. We're well underway in exploring the sale of our prepaid businesses. We're also in discussions regarding a few small divestitures that are within our vehicle line of business.  \n Third, fleet reinvention. We're pretty aggressively working to reposition our global fleet business, the goal is to create really an exciting future for fleet that promises sustainable and durable growth. We think we're out in front here in EV and actually expect EV to accelerate growth in that business. We're continuing to broaden our set of vehicle-related payment solutions, of solutions beyond fuel. And we do believe that re-rating our biggest business and biggest earnings contributors, is really the #1 driver of the company's overall value creation.  \n So lastly, the topic of separation. We are exploring with the help of Goldman Sachs, the idea of separating one or more of our businesses to further unlock value. Our path initially is to look simply at separating or spinning off one of our major businesses into a separate company. So the considerations or assumptions here are around forward pro forma multiples, what would the stand-alone company trade at, tax impacts dis-synergies of the separation, opportunities for future M&A, really a whole host of things.  \n The second path is to potentially combine one of our 3 major businesses with the [ dans ] partner. That would be a pure-play company that provides very similar solutions to one of our 3 big businesses. So we are actively involved in exploring a few [ dans ] partner combinations and evaluating the attractiveness of that path.  \n As promised on our last call, we expect to complete our work on each of these 4 initiatives before year-end and for sure, we'll share our conclusions with you then.  \n Okay. So look, in closing today, I do want to reiterate that we are pleased with Q2 and our first half performance, our financials and KPIs ahead of our initial expectations. We are flowing through our Q2 beat and raising full year 2023 guidance. We are progressing a few of our key priorities again, particularly on the EV front, and we are actively exploring several portfolio moves in an effort to re-rate our multiple.  \n So with that, let me turn the call back over to Tom to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Tom? Tien-Tsin, I have no idea where to go with that question. Yes. We're obviously, as I tried to say in the opening, working the thing pretty hard right? Running through these 3 or 4 different areas. I guess I would say in terms of leading your comment of, hey, what do we think? What do I think? Has the chance to re-rate to get the value. I'd say 2 things. One, we think getting people to believe the fleet business or what we're going to transform into the vehicle business that, that's got a durable, and exciting future as kind of Job 1, 2 and 3 because it's so big. It's such a big part of the company, and particularly the EV part of that story. So I'd say we are working that like super hard and it will come full with some stuff in [ 90 days ].  \n The second one on the separation thing, I'd say that, to me, the separation is much more interesting and compelling if we can do it in combination with something, not only because that could create more scale and stuff in the space but also potentially have a bunch of synergies with it. And so the structural separation enables in some ways transactions that are not as easy out of the mothership.  So I'd say that those would be my 2. It's the fleet reinvention where people believe in the future and the potential for separation that would also include a combination. Yes, that's another too good question. I mean the first thing, Tien-tsin, is just if you take the existing accounts, the defensive nature. So, hey, this vehicle, we have millions of vehicles. What if some of those vehicles are EVs? So the first conclusion or forming conclusion is we don't care. We could be in different matter of what commercial vehicles exist in a bunch of years from now as long as they're owned by the company, we can make money, we can make revenue. And in fact, we're making more.  \n The second one is, it's looking like because our EV stuff is a bit better. We're out ahead of other people, including, for example, the oil companies. that we might do better in our basic selling and retaining commercial fleets that we have because we get advantage by having the combined old fashion and new fashion package. And then the third one, we've got a new trick comment on the consumer side, which is a segment that we're not in. So to the extent that we can light up the consumer side by just repurposing the stuff we have. So that's kind of the 1, 2, 3. Neutral to flat kind of in the first one, went a bit more in the commercial and then add the consumer, that would be the trifecta. Hey, Ramsey, it's Ron. Just to add, I think we said on the last call that the thing would kind of tick along, right? That it was lower. And so kind of mid-single digits is still kind of where our guide is. No, no exposure to yellow. Hey, Nick, it's Ron. Let me just add on to what Tom said, pretty consistent same-store sales in the fleet business. Let's look about the same in the last few quarters, so not a lot going on there. Yes. Darren, good question. Yes. So first off, we're happy someone picked on us or me. I think last time saying, hey, he said around 20%, I think it was 19%. So I don't that guys on [indiscernible] 22%. So on the strength side, the direct business is what I'd say we've called out before, that we're not happy with the channel of the partner business where the thing started 7 years ago. That thing is still negative and trending down. So to end up with 22%  consolidated to tell you that the direct stuff is well north of 22%, which obviously we're super excited about. There's no concentration in that business. So that's doing well. And I do need to call out for the cross-border thing. I mean, I don't know if you heard it, but the sales, so new business was up 80%, 8-0 percent quarter-over-quarter. So it's an all-time record of the amount of new business that we've sold and cross-border was just crazy in terms of sales. So I don't know if people are hearing this, but sales in that business and the performance in the direct business are trending way above what we thought they would be.  \n So your last question on cross-sell. So we did an interesting thing, saying as part of the strategic review, where we looked at our 3 biggest businesses in the U.S., right, fleet lodging and corporate payments. And we said, let's go into what we call the blue box. So companies that are not like micro, call it, above 10 million. And we focus on 3 industries where about 70% of the clients are. And we find that we've got about 15% to 20% overlap already. So in other words, when we take the clients that, let's say, fleet has, that lodging has, and the corporate payments has that are kind of not small, and we say, \"Hey, do they have more than one?\" The answer is lots of the clients have more than 1, that's 15% to 20% overlap. And the reason that we haven't called it out before is because we started in those product silos and unrelated brand, the  businesses just went to Ron Clarke and sold each of the 3 products. So now clearly, we started advertising in the Corpay brand to those bit bigger accounts and tell them, \"Hey, we got all 3 things.\" So everyone should expect that there'll be more of that, more of the same kind of decent sized prospective customer taking everything we've got. Yes, it's a good follow-up. So no change. Obviously, M&A continues to be the lead dog. And given the strategic review and some of the M&A activity that's inherent, right, in the combination the comments that I've made. So that's part of it. And then the second one, you got it, we basically will earmark proceeds if we're successful in closing out the Russia sale and/or the prepaid sales, you should expect we'll be buying stock back. Pete, it's Ronald. Let me start, and then I'll let Tom jump in. So the first one is there's always operating leverage inherent in the business, right? So as our revenue climbs, right? So our second half revenue will be up, I don't know, a top $100 million or $150 million, Pete, is our guide over the first half. So the marginal EBITDA flow through on that incremental revenue is super duper high. \n And then the second one I'd say is kind of lapping the capability acquisitions. I think we said earlier that that's tapping, call it, 100 to 200 basis points out of our EBITDA margin, right? Investing in things for the future. So as we lap that, we'll pick it up. In fact, the piece of paper in front of me is our internal Q4 forecast, which has our consolidated margin up about 340 basis points. So if the revenue comes in, and we get the operating leverage and we lap the thing, our margins will be way strong. We're exiting Q4 than they were last year. Yes, that bad debt was just an important one, right? That they grew surprise , i think lots of people, right? In the second half, which is why we reacted relatively quickly and we're seeing the trends both in what we reported here and what we're forecasting. So to Tom's point, there's a pretty big step down as you exit Q4, which obviously is super helpful to the EBITDA margin. Yes, Pete, it's Ron again. I think as I mentioned, the sales is the lead indicator, right? So the fact that not only in the quarter, but I'm looking at the year-to-date, it's a record level of sales, both in the payables side of the business and in the cross-border. So that's the first point. And then in terms of what we're selling, the mix has shifted more to full AP, but we still do sell stand-alone virtual card. And I think if you had our sales group in the room, the idea of having both areas to draw on, hey, look, I'll pay some of your bills, pal, or I'll pay all of your bills. You tell me what you want, and I can give you some money back either way. So that 2 for pitch, I think, is resonating. So we're still selling both the stand-alone and the full, but a bit more of the full these days. Hey, Andrew, it's Ron. Just one other difference to point out on top of Thomas made. The cross-border business not only do we make a lot of sales and their sales are way up, but their cost of sales are super attractive. They're the second most efficient sale in our company in terms of what it costs us to get $1 of sales, so we love that. And then second, they start super fast. So the start rate, what you would call implementation is super duper quick from kind of when we roll call or say it's contracted. So those are 2 things actually about that particular line of business that make it really attractive. Yes, I'd say not really, Andrew. I'd say it's pretty complicated to move a big machine like that. It gets tuned right a certain way, like a piano  or something gets tuned to work a certain way, and then we kind of haul the thing and say, okay, repoint the machinery in a different way. So it needs to grab lots of data to start it to kind of sort itself out again. So it's taken probably a bit longer. But as I said in my opening, it's working, the number of bigger new accounts coming to us digitally is growing now. So I don't want to say it was easy, but it's way easier to stop the problem. They just don't tune up the small ones. It's way harder to get more of the big one. So we've always -- I think 50% of our business has always been bigger accounts. So we're totally used to that, both underwriting them and servicing them and starting on that. So really, it's just getting smarter about how to spend money to get the appropriate segment in the door. Yes. It didn't matter. I mean that's what I want to call out is -- literally i brought the thing to a screeching halt because we were not going to pose some crazy credit number. And the good news is that work, the credit numbers are already down and we're forecasting a roll rates were to be down. So Job 1 is past tense, it's accomplished. Job 2, I'm saying started in Q2 to get better, the number of new bigger stuff has increased. And now I told the guy, it's getting up and go, get your horse going, we need to weigh more of it. So we'll report whether we're picking that pace up as we run through the second half. Yes, Nate. It's Ron again. So yes, you're right. I did call it out. I'd say, we're a little surprised. I'm not really super sure why, but when we go through our managed accounts, which in English means something like groups of people, consulting groups or an environmental group, the utility going somewhere, so larger groups like going to a place like to do something, merchandising groups that would go to Walmart.  I think that's kind of what that business is. And so for some reason, some number of accounts just on their own did less of it in Q2 than what we were out looking. And so when we call, it's not super clear, we say, \"Hey, is that going to be at that level?\" or \"kind of where you were before.\" So that was kind of a bit, call it, a couple of points of growth of the soft pocket that we didn't outlook. So I'd say we're not super certain what that's going to look like going forward. It's not like a lot of them quit us, as you can see in the retention rate. So look, we're hopeful that whatever that is, was kind of transitory for the quarter. And we have a big, what we call custom business and [ Joint ] accounts like railroads and trucking firms, we have a small SMB business, we call it direct. So there's a lot of other segments in the business. But there was this one -- this kind of consulting [ traveler ] group so I did want to call out. Look, still happy with mid-teens. We plan that business at mid-teens. So it's performed above that level. So I want people to be clear, still happy with it. Yes, good question. The first thing I'd say is we had a decent look at July. So that's always helpful. So that's tracking to our guide. So when Tom and I built the second half, the output we have is that, that's on track. Yes, the thing does, bill sequentially, which is Ron's favorite thing about the business. I think I told people this is a snowball. He started downhill and there's more snows as you roll down the hill. So that's the nature of a recurring revenue business as we beat sales, so we're ahead of sales year-to-date. And I call it like corporate payments, which is way ahead as that stuff gets implemented to Tom's point, that attaches more snow, the ball rolls and obviously, sequentially, I think we're up about $40 million sequentially already Q2 versus Q1. So I'd say, look, our confidence is pretty high. We're on track. We have the sales in the bag. We just need to get them implemented and then there's the seasonality, right? Q3 is always a super duper quarter and Q4 is better than Q1. So we get some benefit of strength. For example, Brazil is always super duper good, for example, in Q4. So we've been having a long time, I think, unless something kind of go sideways on the planet that we're pretty comfortable with the guide. Mihir, it's Ron. Just to add to that, which is in corporate payments, the mix shift that Tom refers to, we think, will go on. So when we tell you guys today that we're growing mid- to high-20s in the direct corporate payments business and that the channel business is going backwards, the delta in those take rates is significant. Call it, 4 or 5x different. So every turn of that, every forward quarter with the direct business is growing, let's say, 25% or higher and the channel business is shrinking, that will improve that rate prospectively. Another really good question. So I'd say that we're trying to learn. And I think the first finding today is that we have cross selling. And when we study among the larger clients that we have, they use more than one of our products. I'm reporting today, yes, they do. So the second thing we're doing is advertising now that we've consolidated the brand, we're generating way more leads by offering up more solutions to the same prospective company. So I think that's just another input for us potentially in the synergies or dissynergies as we think about the separation. And obviously, to the extent that the separation still made lots of sense. There's no reason we couldn't have some kind of agreement -- commercial agreement with the company afterwards as an example. So I think we're just running them on separate tracks and learning what we can and see where it lands us. But it's clearly an input into the separation decision for sure. Yes. So look, I want to make sure it's clear what I said. I said the corporate payment sales, which are both, what we call payables internally and cross-border. Collectively, that book was up 80% year-over-year. So that's the first one. \n And then the second point is, yes, cross-border implements quickly payables does not. So to the extent that some amount of that incremental growth is in payables, it's actually a 2024 benefit more than is 2023. But on the guide, I don't have in front of me, my guess is that we're still guiding in the overall to 20% plus in the Corporate Payments business. And I don't know if you guys are hearing it, but it's kind of working. Sales are working, revenue is working. So it's -- we're -- the trends are certainly in a good spot. Yes. Again, I think the strategic review of what we call value creation plan, it's just pretty complicated. So that's why I try to tick through kind of the 4 different pieces, kind of how we operationalize review, right? From the Russia thing, which is kind of a political and emotional thing to the noncore assets of the fleet reinvention to the separation. And so we're full speed ahead as you heard on the Russia thing, we're full-speed ahead on the noncore businesses, including a couple of small things that sit inside the vehicle business. \n So I think the question everyone has, we really have 3 big businesses, right? We have fleet, lodging and Corporate Payments. And I think people are focused on fleet, which is half the company or 40% and Corporate Payments. So that's really where we're focusing the attention on the separation. Would the company be better off if fleet and corporate payments were not all part of the same mothership, but in some way, separate, whichever one was separated. So I'd say that's the primary issue, if you will, question that we're trying to answer. And as I mentioned before, we're looking not only pure separation or stand-alone separation, but looking at the idea of some combination in parallel with the thing. So that's what we're working on. \n And yes, unfortunately, in any separation, there's dissynergies. I mean, to me, it takes away the most important thing, which is really the ability to sell something where you can get a defined price. I'd like to know what something is and have my eyes open. And so losing whatever, 25% or 20% after the cost base makes a straight sale of one of those businesses pretty difficult. You got to get a really good price, right, to cover that tax dissynergy, but there we're looking really particularly around both IT and management, right? Which is what IT is co-mingled and how would we run the stuff manage early. So we're kind of digging through all that and want to make sure that any thing that we pull that it would be worth it, right? That the benefits would far out weigh the cost here. So we're still working it. And we did commit to it to work because we can't study it forever. We're going to have an answer when we talk in 90 days. Yes, I think. First of all, I think it's a great question because it highlights the pivot and strategy there, right, that what you said, the volume of tag is up 7% of the revenue, the revenue is up double. And so 2 points. One is the volume is healthy, partly because we keep widening the distribution channels. So in the last year, we signed 2 of the 5 biggest banks in Brazil to sell our stuff, our Sem Parar tags. And so those things are pretty added at that channel doesn't cannibalize much the other ways that we sell tag. So we're reaching prospective customers that we weren't reaching before. So that's a super helpful. \n The second one is the take rate and the incremental growth is really from the add-ons. So the fuel that we're selling back to the tag holders is compounding. I don't have it in front of me, call it, 40% or 50%. And then these insurance add-ons, vehicle insurance add-ons, for like contents and micro insurance are crazy in demand. And so we're bolting incremental revenue on to the same account without adding any more tags. And so I think that's what we said to everybody was the idea that business was keep expanding distribution to sell more tags. But because we have millions and millions of customers there, find more things that are vehicle-related like fuel and parking and insurance that we could add on and the answer is we are. And just as a reminder, in the first quarter, I think almost 40% of the spend in Brazil was beyond toll. So lots and lots now of purchasing there is beyond toll products. And so that's the idea for the business. Yes, Just on to things get tired or whatever the sales, the absolute sales year-to-date or at a record level. And for the last 3 years, every year, it's been a record level of overall sales versus the prior year. So there's been no slowdown at the rate that we're reaching new customers. So again, it's another business that I'd say is working."

            "content": "Thanks, Ron. Here are some additional details related to the macro environment during the quarter. We had 10% organic revenue growth in Q2, and our reported revenue growth was also 10% and as the growth from recent acquisitions offset fuel price headwinds. Revenue of $948 million exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $8 million, comprised of $13 million in higher revenue partially offset by $5 million of fuel-related macro, which flowed through to our $0.07 beat in cash EPS of $4.19.  \n Fuel prices were $3.65 per gallon for the quarter, lower than our $3.99 guide from May, which caused approximately $20 million of lower revenues versus prior year. We exited the quarter with fuel prices around $3.55 per gallon, but prices rose in July to approximately $3.60 per gallon, a trend we expect to continue over the balance of the year based on the EIA forecast. Fuel spreads were positive versus prior year by about $5 million.  \n Lastly, we had $9 million of negative impact from lower foreign exchange rates, mainly due to the decline in the ruble as the economic impact from the war drags on. In aggregate, we had $23 million of macro headwind versus last year that we were able to power through by way of organic and acquisition-related growth.  \n Now on to our performance for the quarter. As I previously mentioned, organic revenue growth was 10%, reflecting the healthy diversification of our business and the realization of strong sales from last year that continued into the first half of this year. Corporate Payments revenue was up 22%, driven by strength in our direct business, including full AP software solutions, which again grew over 50%. Our comprehensive menu of high-quality payment solutions continues to sell incredibly well as we sign up new customers who are looking to transform their AP operations.  \n Cross-border revenue was up almost 30% as sales remained strong and client transaction activity was again robust. We completed the global reach, customer migration and are now focused on selling our combined set of products and services in all geographies, which is contributing to our strong performance. In addition, we remain committed to realizing the cost synergies and as we rationalize the IT and facilities overlap, which will help expand margins in the second half of the year.  \n Turning to our fleet business. Organic revenue increased 6% driven by higher revenue per transaction and sales growth, especially in our international markets. In the U.S., we are seeing early success from our pivot and digital sales to a slightly larger customer segment but we are still feeling the effects from significantly reducing our micro SMB fleet sales beginning in the third quarter of last year. We anticipate digital sales to improve heading into next year as we adjust our lead generation strategies and conversion pipelines.  \n To expand on Ron's comments regarding our market-leading EV solutions in Europe, we are seeing over 20% sequential quarter growth in accounts, cards and home charging users, and we continue to expand our proprietary charging network which translated into over 30% sequential growth in kilowatt hours charged. While the revenue base remains relatively small, given the emerging usage of commercial EVs, it's a great start and we are committed to building upon our unique capabilities.  \n Brazil's revenue grew 15% compared to last year, driven by 7% tag growth. We now have 6.5 million tag users, which enables us to further increase the proportion of revenue from our expanded network of products where we earn interchange. In the current quarter, approximately 36% of our B2C revenue was from the expanded network.  \n Sales also remained strong, increasing 16% driven by a robust digital, field and partner distribution channels. Lodging revenue increased 14% which was in line with our expectations. I would note that the business grew 41% last year. So this quarter is up against a tough year-over-year comp. This quarter's solid performance was highlighted by sales success across our industry verticals. In addition to revenue per room night that increased 19%, driven primarily from channel and product mix.  \n The Other segment declined 14% due to a shift in the timing of cards ordered by our retail clients in our gift business. In the second quarter of last year, card orders were pulled forward from Q3 and Q4 as retailers wanted to ensure supply chain delays did not impact their card stock for the year-end holiday season. Our full year net revenue expectations for this business remain in line with our prior expectations.  \n Now looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses of $536 million represented a 9% increase over Q2 of the prior year, primarily due to the addition of the Roomex Plugsurfing and Global Reach Group operations. The increase in OpEx was also impacted by higher bad debt, increases tied to higher transaction and sales activities and investments to drive future growth. Bad debt expense was $35 million or 7 basis points of spend, which was stable with last year and in line with our expectations. We currently expect bad debt to improve approximately 20% in the back half of the year compared to the second half of 2022.  \n EBITDA margin in the quarter was 52.4% which is 140 basis points improvement from 51% in the first quarter of this year and 30 basis points higher than last year. Normalizing for our recent capability acquisitions, EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. We still expect our full year EBITDA margin to improve throughout the year and exit around 200 to 250 basis points better than the prior year. This will be driven by solid revenue growth and synergies realized from acquisitions.  \n Interest expense increased $65 million year-over-year driven by the increase in SOFR on our debt stack. The impact of higher interest rates resulted in an approximate $0.57 drag on Q2 adjusted EPS. Over the past few months, we've been monitoring swap rates relative to the SOFR forward curve. In August, we executed $2 billion of fixed rate swaps with an average maturity of 3.5 years, an average fixed rate of 4.3%. These swaps provide immediate positive carry of approximately 100 basis points and ladders out the fixed rate portion of our debt stack, which is now approximately 60% fixed. These interest rate risk management actions capitalized on the strong relative value of swap rates at the 3- to 4-year point of the curve, generating an immediate benefit to interest expense and substantially reduces interest expense volatility going forward without incurring outsized duration risk.  \n Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.6% versus 23.7% last year, which reflected a discrete tax item that positively affected the 2022 tax rate.  \n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.25 billion in unrestricted cash, and we had $768 million available on our revolver. We have $5.5 million outstanding on our credit facilities and we had $1.25 billion borrowed under our securitization facility. As of June 30, our leverage ratio was 2.6x trailing 12 months EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. We made no open market share repurchases in the quarter, and we still have over $1.2 billion authorized for share repurchases. We have ample liquidity to pursue near-term M&A opportunities and continue to buy back shares when it makes sense. \n In addition to Ron's overview of our full year guidance, let me give you some additional detail, including some thoughts on our Q3 outlook and supporting assumptions, which can be found in our supplemental materials. For the full year, we now expect GAAP revenues between $3.836 billion and $3.86 billion. Adjusted net income between $1.281 billion and $1.303 billion. Adjusted net income per diluted share between $17.09 and $17.35. And finally, EBITDA growth of 17%.  \n For Q3, we're expecting revenue to be between $980 million and $1 billion, and adjusted net income per share to be between $4.44 and $4.64 per share, which, at the midpoint, is up 7% of what we reported in Q3 of 2022. All of these estimates include Russia for the full year.  \n We are now assuming an August close of our Russian business as we continue to work through the final closing details. Upon close, we expect revenues for the year to be $45 million to $55 million lower, resulting in a $0.25 to $0.35 decline in adjusted EPS over the remainder of the year. Based on using the sale proceeds for buybacks. This guidance is consistent with our previous guidance after adjusting for anticipated August close.  \n Related to our guidance assumptions. we are using $3.66 for our fuel price assumption for the rest of the year. Our interest expense guidance of $330 million to $340 million is based off an average SOFR rate of 5.31% for the rest of the year. Additional assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement. With that, thank you for your interest in FLEETCOR. And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. Thank you Ramsey, it's Tom. I appreciate the question. Ram, it's just a variety of things. I think we saw some good transaction activity in our international markets. And keep in mind, our international markets diversified beyond just fuel. We have other businesses within that fleet segment that also helps drive growth. So it's just a function of where the business was performing. I'll also say that fuel price in our international markets were stickier, particularly at the retail side than what we necessarily would experience here in the U.S. So that also helps kind of bolster the international side and the overall revenue growth. Obviously, we'll relook at that growth rate going forward when we're successful in closing the Russia transaction. That will affect it to some degree. But overall, we saw a nice healthy pickup in the overall growth rate. Nick, it's Tom. We actually don't break it down beyond the segment level. So I mean, I think overall, we kind of keep it at the total fleet level and the international business outperformed U.S. But getting into kind of the details is just something that we stay away from. And then going forward, I think as we just said, I think you can continue to expect borrowing, we see fuel prices and spreads hang to somewhere in the range of our guidance. That you would see that mid-single-digit type growth rate as we look ahead into Q3 and Q4. No, they don't -- Andrew, they don't differ materially between the subsegments within that overall business. Both of them are attractive. They're also -- they're obviously different businesses. Our payables business is much more domestically oriented where our cross-border is much more internationally oriented. We like the diversification that, that brings. But there isn't necessarily a material margin difference that you need to be modeling in. I think both of them, as Ron mentioned, just in terms of what we see from a sales perspective, have very strong sales results, solid pipeline. And both of them have recurring business with existing customers. You may kind of think of cross-borders more transaction-oriented one-and-done kinds of relationships or anything but that. They're generally customers who have recurring tight cross-border transactions. And so that provides us kind of a healthy recurring type revenue stream coming from those businesses. So they're more probably, other than the products and their geographies, their economics and their kind of compositions are more similar than you may normally think. Generally, just kind of mix. There's really nothing in particular to call out. You see a little bit of an increase in the take rate when you refer to our release. Again, it's a pretty modest increase. So I think it's just a matter of just mix of business and really nothing more to really call out besides that. We're always competitive with respect to our pricing and things like that. So I think, fuel will also factor into what our overall spread and how those things have played out. And so it's just a combination of things, but nothing really out of the ordinary. And that's kind of what you're seeing in the numbers in terms of just kind of a slight increase in rate."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the FLEETCOR Technologies First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nJames Eglseder: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; Tom Panther, our new CFO; and Alissa Vickery, our Chief Accounting Officer. Following their prepared comments, the operator will announce the queue will open for the Q&A session. It is only then that you can get in line for questions.\n Please note that our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com. Now throughout this call, we will be covering organic growth. As a reminder, this metric neutralizes for the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads. It also includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed during the 2 years being compared.\n We will also be covering non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website.\n I also need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today, and all statements about our outlook, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We undertake no obligation to update any of these statements.\n These expected results are also subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov.\n With that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron? \nRonald F. Clarke: Okay. Jim, thanks. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q1 '23 earnings call. Also joining us here today is Tom Panther, our new CFO, who is now official, so delighted to have Tom here with us. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects: first, provide my take on Q1 results; second, I'll share our updated full year 2023 guidance; third, discuss progress on our value creation and simplification plan; and then lastly, I'll comment briefly on our newly formed strategic review committee.\n Okay. Let me turn to our Q1 results. We reported revenue of $901 million, up 14%, and cash EPS of $3.80. That's up 4%. Both results finished above the top of our guidance range. The cash EPS of $3.80 clearly weighed down predominantly by higher interest expense. At constant interest expense for the quarter, cash EPS would have been $4.30, up 17%, so our model's intact.\n The macro environment did cooperate, basically coming in as we anticipated. EBITDA for Q1 exceeded $460 million, up 17%. Margins there, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We invested incrementally about another 100 basis points of margin and a set of capability acquisitions from 2022, those intended to better position the company for the midterm.\n Trends in the quarter, quite good. Organic revenue growth, Q1 was up 12% overall. That accelerated sequentially and is above our 9% to 11% target range. Same-store sales finished plus 3%, so healthy. Retention finished at 91%, slightly impacted by the credit actions we took in Q4 to contain credit risk in the micro segment. That does drive a bit of involuntary attrition. Sales performance, absolutely terrific in the quarter, up 31%, setting new record levels of new bookings. So look, fundamentals, in a good spot.\n I do want to highlight our Brazil performance in Q1. So that business, really doing a nice job of transforming from a toll-centric business initially to now a broader vehicle payments business, again, for both businesses and consumers. The vehicle-related payments now include not only tolls but fuel, parking, fast food and recently now even vehicle insurance. Another super good sales quarter for Brazil, new toll tags, record level, and those were helped by a new bank relationship with Santander, which added almost 15% to the overall sales in the quarter.\n We also had terrific fuel transaction growth, up 39%, as we continue to increase the fueling acceptance sites. But most surprisingly in the quarter is, of our approximately 5 million active consumer users there, 3 million utilized our new Sem Parar app, mobile app in the quarter. And that engagement helped drive almost a 15% attach rate of insurance policy add-on sales, so consumers coming to the app, looking around, seeing offers and actually transacting with us. So we think this engagement opens up big-time cross-sell opportunities. So look, all in all, a very good start here to Q1. Sales, revenues, profits, all of those above our expectations.\n Okay. Let me shift gears and turn to our updated full year 2023 guidance along with assumptions behind it. So we're revising full year revenue and cash EPS guidance up by our Q1 beat, so revenue at the midpoint now of $3.840 billion and cash EPS at the midpoint now, $17.15. We are expecting the rest of year environment to be pretty consistent with what we forecasted 90 days ago, a few puts and takes but overall in the same place.\n Also, we've got an early view of April trends and results, so continuing to track to our plan. I do want to point out that we're expecting rest of year organic revenue growth in the 9% to 11% range. Inside of that, fuel improving to kind of mid-single digits, Brazil and Lodging in the mid-teens and Corporate Payments in the high teens.\n We're expecting rest of year earnings to accelerate. That'll be driven by these record levels of sales flowing into the second half, a stronger Q2 and Q3 seasonality; again, a second half fuel acceleration driven really by the pivot in sales in that business from micro to a bit up market. We'll see better operating leverage as we run through the year. Revenues will expand faster than expenses. That should result in EBITDA margins in Q4 about 200 to 250 basis points better than last year. Second half EPS will also improve mostly as we lap the interest expense and higher bad debt levels that we experienced last year. \n Finally, we will keep a close eye out for any signs of macro weakness so that we can react quickly if we need to. Again, our solutions are generally pretty essential, pretty important. And demand for our services tends to actually run higher in inflationary times.\n Okay. Let me transition to the progress that we're making on our value creation or simplification plan. So we're working across 3 areas there: first, to eliminate overhang related to the Russia and FTC case; we're working to reduce complexity and present a simpler company; and finally, EV, we're working to demonstrate that we can basically succeed in this energy transition.\n So first up, Russia. We have signed definitive documents now to sell our Russia business to a local firm. We're awaiting a Russian government approval for the deal. And if we can get through the various hoops here, we would expect to close at the end of the quarter, the end of Q2. Tom Panther will provide some additional details on the impact of the transaction.\n Okay. Next up, the FTC case. So not much new to report here. As a reminder, both we and the FTC filed proposed orders back in February outlining some additional disclosure enhancements that we have been discussing with the court. So now it's really up to the court to decide what the conclusions will be and what the order will be. Given again that these are disclosure-related subjects, we continue to believe the court order will not have a material impact on the go-forward financial performance of the company.\n Over to simplification, we are evaluating ways to simplify our company. Three things under consideration: first, we are actively exploring the divestiture now of a few noncore assets, so that's underway; second, we're considering moving to 3 reporting segments versus today's 5; and then lastly, we're continuing to evaluate a brand change for the entire company to Corpay that would better reflect really the broad set of corporate payments solutions that we're offering. So expect to make decisions on these simplification ideas over the next 90 days.\n Okay. Let me make the turn to EV and reference Pages 11, 12 and 13 in our earnings supplement. So we've launched a pretty unique solution, the EV solution in the U.K. We call it our 3-in-1 solution. So that solution provides our fleet clients with a single program, one program where they can make traditional diesel purchases, on-road public EV recharging and manage at-home EV recharging and reimbursement, so 3 in 1.\n The early indications are that the EV economics could actually be favorable to us. So we looked at a sample, 271 clients in the U.K. that have been with us over the last 8 quarters, and examined the revenue pattern. And what you can see in the supplement is that the EV revenue per vehicle is actually higher than our ICE revenue per vehicle. So although early days, really pretty good news. So the driver here has really the need for businesses to measure and reimburse recharging and potentially, in our case, 1 million homes, right, the number of users we have. So it will be quite a task.\n I also want to point out that we're continuing to pursue the consumer EV payment opportunity so providing some potential upside to the EV energy transition. Since we are building, acquiring EV networks and EV technology for the B2B market, we decided to repurpose those capabilities to serve consumers. So underway doing that in Europe, we're building a consumer EV payment business. We've signed 10 EV vehicle manufacturers, and we're serving their new EV consumer buyers. So when a new EV consumer drives off a lot, they will be using our EV network and payment app, so out of the blocks there.\n Okay. Let me make the turn to my last subject, which is our new strategic review committee, formed to evaluate the portfolio options for the company. So we did retain Goldman Sachs to support the assignments. They have shared their preliminary analysis and thoughts with both the committee and our Board. I do want you to know we're taking this portfolio assessment quite seriously, and we're evaluating really all options to potentially increase shareholder value.\n I want you to know that I am personally aligned here with shareholders, both in terms of the importance of re-rating our multiple but also the urgency of doing so. So early days, but we're digging in. We're evaluating options. We're meeting folks. We're sizing dissynergies. We're getting at it. We do expect to have much more to report when we speak again in 90 days.\n So look, in closing, again, Q1 out of the blocks in a good way, ahead of our expectations. Our rest of year guide, up, assuming 9% to 11% organic revenue growth with improving margins and earnings, working aggressively to close out our Russia and FTC overhangs, begin communicating hopefully a simpler company and advancing the EV capabilities. And lastly, as I just said, we are just underway evaluating portfolio separation options, so a lot going on.\n So with that, let me turn the call over to Tom Panther, our new CFO, to provide some additional details on the quarter. Tom? \nTom Panther: Thanks, Ron. It's great to be formally onboard and to have joined the FLEETCOR team at such an exciting time. The last several weeks have been a great opportunity for me to learn the business by spending in-depth time with our people to better understand our markets, products, sales strategies, key initiatives, technology and much more. There is more for me to learn, but the team has been incredibly helpful, accelerating my journey up the learning curve.\n I'm impressed by the exceptional talent and high-caliber capabilities that support the organization. FLEETCOR has a proven track record of generating strong top line growth and accretive operating leverage, and I can see why it's able to deliver those sustained high-quality results. I'm looking forward to digging in and helping the company achieve its business, strategic and financial objectives, and I'm confident in FLEETCOR's growth prospects, both organic and inorganic moving forward.\n And we need to look no farther than the first quarter results to understand why I'm confident in the company's future. As Ron mentioned, we posted 14% revenue growth in the quarter, including 12% organic growth. The incremental 2% of reported growth was due to acquisitions made last year as the macro fuel and FX factors were mostly a push versus prior year. Revenue of $901 million exceeded our guidance by $19 million, which flowed through to our $0.15 beat in cash EPS of $3.80.\n Moving on to the segments. I want to point out that we changed our organic growth solution disclosures to match the segment reporting that we implemented last year. Going forward, both reported and organic results will be disclosed in Fleet, Corporate Payments, Lodging, Brazil and other. This will be cleaner and eliminate any confusion between segment and solution categories. We've provided organic growth information on this basis for the last 8 quarters on Slide 7 of our earnings supplement, and we've provided a map in the appendix so you can track these classification changes.\n Now on to the quarter. Organic revenue growth was 12% as we delivered results 2% above guidance, reflecting the strong diversification of our business and the realization of strong sales results from last year across all of our businesses. This is despite the intentional strategy to pivot our U.S. fleet sales upmarket to mitigate credit exposure. Our Corporate Payments revenue grew 19%, led by our direct Corpay payables business, which was up over 30%, driven by continuing strong sales, especially in full AP automation. Our solutions are selling well in the marketplace, and we continue to believe that we have attractive and differentiated offerings that will drive future growth over time.\n Cross border revenue was up 21%, which is normalized for the Global Reach acquisition in January. The cross border team had another very good quarter as new sales and customer wins remained strong while also substantially completing the Global Reach integration, which is underscored by 90% of the Global Reach revenue already migrated to our platform.\n Fleet revenue increased 6% on a reported basis, driven by higher volume. Organically, when we isolate the impact of fuel prices, Fleet grew 3%, in line with our expectations. This reflects the continued drag from the weakness in the micro SMB fleet and the recent change in sales focus to a slightly larger customer. We are seeing good success from our sales pivot with sales trends continuing to improve, and we feel good about our ability to reaccelerate the growth in the back half of the year.\n Brazil revenue was up 18% compared to last year as the business continues to perform at an extremely high level. Our strategy of using the vehicle and now the Sem Parar mobile app for additional purchases like fuel, insurance and certain retail purchases continues to grow, which significantly expands the addressable market across B2B and B2C. We have transformed the Brazil business beyond a single-product toll tags business. It really is the center of an entire vehicle payment ecosystem that continues to grow, and we're the only provider that offers this breadth in the market. We have a highly differentiated value proposition in the marketplace and it is clearly winning share.\n Lodging continued to perform well, growing 26%. This solid performance highlighted by strong sales across our industry verticals that reflect our success in driving innovation to win new clients and capturing more business from existing clients. In addition, revenue per night increased 24% due to customer mix and additional fee-based revenue sources as we continue to expand our product capabilities. Our near-term focus is on consolidating our various hotel networks into one  in order to enhance the customer experience.\n Looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses were $526 million, representing a 12% increase over the prior year, primarily due to the addition of the Global Reach operations and the capability acquisitions we made last year, like Plugsurfing in the EV space. The remaining increase in operating expense was primarily in Corporate Payments and Lodging, where we generated significant operating leverage.\n Bad debt expense was 8 basis points but more importantly, slightly down sequentially from Q4 '22. Our delinquency trends give us confidence that we're on the path to lower bad debt expense in the back half of the year, even after giving consideration to a potentially soft macroeconomic cycle.\n The EBITDA margin in the quarter was 51%, 100 basis points better than Q1 '22. This includes $11 million or about 100 basis points of drag from expenses associated with recent acquisitions, including integrating and building out our AP automation and EV capabilities that we bought last year. We still expect our full year EBITDA margin to increase approximately 150 basis points compared to last year and Q4 to exit the year 200 to 250 basis points higher than Q4 '22. Remember, margins expand throughout the year as we generate revenue growth and realize the benefits of synergies from recent acquisitions.\n Interest expense increased by $58 million year-over-year, driven by higher rates on our debt stack. The impact of higher interest rates resulted in approximate $0.49 drag on first quarter adjusted EPS. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.1% versus 26% last year, with the increase driven primarily by increases in tax rates in some international jurisdictions and some onetime discrete items. We anticipate the quarterly effective tax rate for the rest of the year to be between 26% and 27%.\n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with about $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash, and we had $779 million available on our revolver. There was $5.5 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, and we had $1.3 billion borrowed in our securitization facility. As of March 31, our leverage ratio was 2.7x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. We made no open market share repurchases in the quarter as we deployed roughly $230 million in capital for 3 deals, including Global Reach while also maintaining our leverage ratio.\n I would like to remind you that our first port of call for capital deployment is always accretive acquisitions. And then if there's nothing near term, we'll evaluate buybacks or debt paydowns as appropriate. We still have over $1.2 billion authorized for share repurchases, and we believe we have ample liquidity to pursue near-term M&A opportunities and continue to buy back shares when it makes sense.\n In addition to Ron's overview of our full year guidance, let me give some additional detail, including some thoughts on our Q2 outlook and supporting assumptions, which can be found on Slide 14. For the full year, we now expect GAAP revenues between $3.82 billion and $3.86 billion, adjusted net income between $1.263 billion and $1.303 billion, adjusted net income per diluted share between $16.95 and $17.35, and finally, EBITDA growth of 15%. All of these numbers include Russia for the full year.\n Assuming a June 30 close of our Russia business, we expect GAAP revenues to be $55 million to $65 million lower, resulting in a $0.30 to $0.40 decline in adjusted EPS based on using the sale proceeds for buybacks over the remainder of the year.\n I also want to emphasize that the transaction is subject to approval by the Russian government, which involves an added level of complexity. For the second quarter, we're expecting revenue to be between $930 million and $950 million and adjusted net income per share to be between $4.02 and $4.22, which at the midpoint is down slightly from what we reported in Q2 of 2022, which is driven by higher interest expense of approximately $60 million and roughly $20 million of expected macro headwinds from fuel price and FX rates.\n Related to our guidance assumptions, we are using $3.99 as our fuel price assumption for the rest of the year. Our interest expense guidance of $310 million to $330 million is based off an average LIBOR rate of 4.9% for the rest of the year. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement.\n Finally, I'd like to thank our 10,000-plus employees around the world who helped deliver a fantastic start to 2023. This quarter's results and our go-forward prospects reinforce the power of our growth-oriented, diversified business and the strength of our franchise.\n Thank you for your interest in FLEETCOR. And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n Our first question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi. \nPeter Christiansen: Tom, welcome aboard here. Great to have you. I had 2 questions here. There's a lot to dig into. But Ron, I guess now with the new segmentation, how should we think about long-term kind of normalized growth for the Fleet business now that we've added some other things to that segment? I know in the past, you've talked about the segment being kind of like 4% to 8%. Does that change with the new classification? And perhaps maybe we could also address Brazil in that same vein. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Pete, it's Ron. So I'd say kind of in the base business based on how we're allocating sales and marketing investment, we're probably still in that target range, kind of mid-single digits. But I think the couple of wild cards on it are AEV, right? Does that thing, particularly with the early view we're getting of the economics, does that help accelerate it along with that consumer leg? And then B, do we get the cross-sell thing to hunt a bit more? so I'd say the wildcard is those 2 things. If those 2 things come in, obviously could accelerate quite a bit. \nPeter Christiansen: Okay. That's helpful. I know the toll businesses in Brazil, switching to free flow. I know it's been a benefit to some toll payment administrators here in the U.S. when E-ZPass went free flow. Just curious your take on how that could impact the business nearer term. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, that's a good question. So, so far, it's good news. It's -- for those who don't know, it's pretty early days in Brazil in terms of trying to make the transition to free flow. So they're actually testing it in one region. So the good news on that for -- obviously, for the toll operator is, hey, there's no more gates and stopping people. The bad news is the, whatever, the 20% to 30% of the people that don't have electronic, have a [ clue folly ] way of paying after the fact.\n So it'll help us. It's a tailwind short term because it makes the electronic blast right through even more attractive than today because, again, it's more difficult for people to follow up after the fact. So we're actually seeing that, Pete, in the test region. So in the one place where they put it in, we're actually doing a bit better, so I'd say the only reason I get super excited. It'll probably take quite a while, right? There's a lot to test. There's a lot of infrastructure and stuff to move that post-payment thing to work out. So I don't think it's going to be super duper immediately but I'd say, over the midterm, helpful to us. \nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. \nAndrew Jeffrey: Ron, I wonder if you can update a little bit on the selling motion as you move up market in fuel. It sounds like you've met with some pretty good early success. But can you just kind of elaborate on what that looks like? Can you continue to go to market using primarily digital means? Is it more kind of feet on the street? Is there a pricing or yield difference on some of those bigger fleets? Just want to try to understand how that might compare to how the fuel business looks prior. \nRonald F. Clarke: Andrew, another good question. So point one is we already sell up market, so although we don't say it, call it, I don't know, 40% of the sales even in the U.S. business are kind of not digital, 40% to 50%. So we're already kind of in the business is point one. And point two is, I'd say, even more so internationally, we have way longer time and see there with universal networks, so we sold a bigger account for a lot longer.\n But back here to the U.S. So the 2 ways that we'll kind of drift up market is, one, is repointing of our digital engine. So we basically kind of reworked the algorithm there to look for different kind of search characteristics. So we let through the door, if you will, we bid in a way basically to encourage bigger accounts to come to us and obviously kind of shun smaller accounts. So that's underway. We made that pivot, call it, last October, November, so that's already started to work.\n And then second, what you said. We're starting to grow now the feet on the street that would go into the seam. And what we're working on is what I mentioned to Pete, Andrew, a few minutes ago of maybe going to market with not only the fuel card but going to market with this Corpay One that kind of has the corporate payments stuff built into it to see if that might be a little bit more compelling. So we're kind of in test mode now of putting some people against a bit larger prospects and giving them something a little newer kind of interesting to say. So those are the couple of ideas. \nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. That's helpful. And then I like the U.K. mixed fleet disclosure slide from a revenue standpoint. Is it safe to assume that you see similar unit economics or maybe think about it as contribution margin in addition to more revenue? In other words, is operating leverage in those mixed fleet EV offerings? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, I'd say that's way too early to call, right? We've got a tiny, tiny, little EV business and set of assets and cost structure. So our 99% focus at this point is on the revenue side, right, and figuring out how to serve these clients and win. And I don't know if people think it's a big deal, but as I kind of dug through the data, I'll say to everybody, it is a big deal, right, that companies, real clients that we have are willing to pay us more money to be more helpful in more places, and if you look at the chart, kind of significantly more money.\n So that is way different than I think we would have thought 2 years ago getting into the thing. So what I would say people ought to focus on is the fact that we have it. I think I'm accurate in saying we're the only ones. There's no one else that has this 3-in-1 kind of offering that brings all the things together. So I'd say, come back, Andrew, a different day to me on the margin side, but there's nothing structurally that would make us think we couldn't be at the same level over time. It's just not we're on today. \nOperator: The next question comes from Sheriq Sumar with Evercore ISI. \nSheriq Sumar: I just wanted to get a sense on the trends in the month that you saw in the first quarter as to was there a sequential decline in the month of March versus what you saw in Jan and Feb? Or was it highly consistent across all the months? And early read across how trends have been in April and any areas of weakness or strength that you have seen so far? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. Sheriq, it's Ron. So no, I'd say, if anything, the months are increasing, why we're a snowball business where we add more than we lose. And I think -- I don't know, but probably March has more workdays, so it would have been a higher print. And I did call out we've had a pretty good peak here in April, both revenue and other trends that I'd say it's kind of spot on the plan, which obviously fits with the guidance. So we're still just not seeing much. We built a plan, whatever, a few months ago, and as you can hear from the results and the April comment, we kind of track in the -- right where we thought. \nSheriq Sumar: One follow-up. On Corporate Payments, if I remember correctly, on the last quarter, you had mentioned that the growth will be around 20%, north of 20%, but now you had like around high teens, unless I'm wrong over here. So I just wanted to get a sense as to what's causing the difference in outlook for Corporate Payments? \nRonald F. Clarke: Are you trying to pick on, hey, it's 19% instead of 20%? \nSheriq Sumar: Yes. No, I thought it was more like 20-plus percent, so I thought it probably was more like a [ 50, 100 basis point ] of decline. Yes. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. If you go back and read kind of prior scripts, I would have said high teens to 20%. So 19%, I think qualifies as high teens. And I did say I think it's likely you will see in 1 of the next 2 or 3 quarters to think -- tick above the 20%. So again, we try to build, design that business to run right around the 20%, plus or minus, so still highly confident of that. \nOperator: The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Ron, appreciate the commentary on the strategic review committee, and it seems like you're onboard. I know in the past, you've considered divestitures or sales of some of the businesses, and the price simply was not compelling enough. I'm just curious, one, has the backdrop changed in terms of that pricing? Or are you just willing to make the deal in the name of simplification? And then second, maybe you could just talk about core versus noncore, sort of how you guys are looking at this. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, Sanjay, on the first part of your question, the backdrop has changed our value of our earnings, right? So historically, I'd say up until, call it, the last 1.5 years, we traded in the mid- to high teens EBITDA, kind of next 12 months EBITDA sort of trade at, call it, 10, 11x is the first part of the backdrop. So a price from a third party that would be a lot higher than where we are would be more interesting to me than it would have been when we traded obviously at 15% to 20%.\n So in terms of the segments, I'd say it's really the size of the businesses is how we think about things that are core. So things that are big for us have big leadership positions we would call core. And so if you know what those are, that would be Fleet, Brazil, Corporate Payments. Lodging for sure would be businesses that we would view as big and core and have great positions.\n But again, as I said in the opening comments, we're -- when you're trading for whatever reason at this level, we are -- starting with me, we are wide open to someone else other than who's in our stock, valuing some or all of the company at a more appropriate level. And so I do want to make sure people know we are out talking and trying to get feedback if we can ID people that would value some or all the business higher. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Okay. And then just a follow-up on the Russia sale. I guess, can you just elaborate a little bit on what specific approvals need -- are needed for the -- from the Russian authorities, I mean, how much time that takes if this presents a risk? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, that's also a good question. So I don't know how many months ago, somewhere 3 to 6 months ago, the Russian government created a separate, I don't know if you call it agency, commission, group, whatever it is, for this purpose of international western companies trying to exit and effectively created a sign-off requirement, almost like an antitrust or something, oversight. And so as western companies like us make deals, right, sign SPA to sell things, then these go to this group, this agency, this committee, whatever it is, and they opine on it. Hey, we're happy to approve this deal; or, hey, we'd like to see this or that.\n So that's what it is. We've been told that it's a month or 2. I think it's a function, right, of the volume of transactions that are in front of the group. But they have been -- we've looked at the history. As long as they've been established, they have been processing, one way or the other, transactions. So we do think, obviously, the buyer there is communicating to us that they're in conversations with this group, so it's in some kind of a process.\n Risk, yes, I've used the word. There's some hoops, so for us to say we know how that ball is going to bounce would not be accurate. So we have an agreement and assuming that it gets approved, we will transact. And our best guess, it's probably in the next 60 days. But I want people on the call, it is not risk free. There's obviously some chance that they would deny the sale or ask for changes in the sale that are unpalatable, and so we're just kind of waiting. \nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. \nKenneth Suchoski: Tom, congrats on the new role. Great to connect again. It's great to hear the comments on the portfolio review and that you're moving quickly on that front. There have been some discussions going around that FLEETCOR should consider breaking up the business and maybe ring-fence some of the things that might be weighing on the multiple. So I guess, one, what is your preliminary analysis pointing to in terms of value creation as well as any dissynergies that need to be taken into account? And I guess if you were to go through with a potential corporate action, what might a separation look like and how should we think about the timing around that? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, Ken, I'd say it's too early really to try to answer that. We're, whatever, 5 or 6 weeks into kicking this thing into gear and studying it. So we don't really have a super-formed view. I think I kind of said what I said, which is we're underway. We've run, tumbled a bunch of numbers. We're obviously out talking to people. So really, we're just working our way through the options, and as I said, would be in a way better spot for a clear answer to you in 90 days. \nKenneth Suchoski: Okay. Okay. We'll wait on that, Ron. I guess as my follow-up, can you talk about the trends you're seeing on the corporate payments side? I mean it kind of feels like the current macro slowdown or recession looks a little different than '08, '09 and maybe businesses might be pulling back ahead of the consumer. So maybe you could just talk about how you're feeling about the spending trends in the Corporate Payments segment. And then any puts and takes across the underlying businesses within that segment? \nRonald F. Clarke: Sure. I'd say that I think we report spend in some of the appendices here and stuff, so it continues to be strong really across the board. I think maybe most importantly is the sales are just record levels. I mean our Q1 sales in our Corporate Payments business was not only an all-time high. It was an all-time high by, I don't know, 50% or something. So we're pouring money into advertising the brand now and reaching more people. We've got more people on the street. We finally have a really put-together product line.\n So the -- I think the fill on the top of the bucket is in -- is really the best place that it's ever been in. So I think it's -- without getting over my skis, it's kind of all systems go, the things work in. Our outlook is to compound now, like I said, high teens to 20%. And other than the channel thing, which is, I don't know, 10%, 12% of the business now, really, all the other parts of that business are rocking. So no warning flags at all. \nOperator: The next question comes from Trevor Williams. \nTrevor Williams: I want to ask on corporate payments in the cross border business in particular. Maybe just a higher level if you could give us a refresher just on what differentiates you on the cross border and the FX side. And now with AFEX and Global Reach, just the main benefits you get with that added scale and then how that feeds into the durability of the growth that you're seeing there? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. That's really super good question, Trevor. The first and most important thing I think I'd say is who do we compete with. So how do we get business and who would we lose business to? And the answer is banks. And because we mostly serve the middle market, it's Tier 2 banks. So it's super important that everyone has that in the brand. We're playing little league. But maybe we're playing Minor League Baseball versus Major League Baseball.\n And so we have to be able to get a mid-sized business to trust us to make either spot or hedge transactions for them versus, let me call it, kind of a Tier 2 bank. So when you have that context, the answer is we got to win everywhere. We have a better network, right, in terms of basically the destination, if you will, of payments, more breadth, more countries. We have better tech because it's all we do versus a bank running or using some third party.\n But the winner, I think, Trevor, is the people. We just have more specialists, right? We have hundreds of people in these different originating markets here, Canada, U.K., Europe, Australia, that really know FX, that have grown up in FX. So I think they really just outthink and outpitch the representatives that are at these Tier 2 banks. And so it's the combo of all of those things. But we compete well because, honestly, who has the book of business would be my answer to you. \nTrevor Williams: Okay. Got it. And then on the Fleet segment, any help just on how we should think of the cadence of growth over the course of the year? Is the pivot of new sales to the larger customers as those start to flow through? Ron, I think you said earlier on, getting to the mid-single digits. But just any way you could put a finer point around timing and just as we're thinking of the next 3 quarters, just progression of growth in fleet would be helpful. \nRonald F. Clarke: Super good question. I'd say think of it as just stepping up. So if it's, call it, 3 for the print for Q1, we're going to end middle kind of [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 3, 5, 6, 7 ]. It's going to step up basically based on the plan we've built. So kind of 1 point or so acceleration sequentially. \nOperator: The next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair. \nSpencer James: This is Spencer James on for Bob Napoli. The new sales definitely impressed us. Ron, could you maybe just provide a summary of what's driving the strength in new sales and the components of that number and what's driving the strength there? And then maybe if you could touch on how the digital ad environment might -- may or may not be impacting new sales motion. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I'm not so sure, Spencer, the second part of the question, but the first part, I can cover, which is, yes, it was a crazy good sales quarter, right? We're [ tallying guys ] up 31%, and that's in the face of taking the gas off of our North America Fleet business, right? We used to get, I don't know, 10%, 15% of the business in that micro segment, and I just shut it down, right, to try to contain. So it tells you that the rest of international fleet and all the rest of the businesses grew faster even to 31%.\n And I think it's a combo of things. One is, again, we've stepped up marketing and sales investment, particularly marketing. We've been pouring more money in corporate payments into this Corpay brand campaign, and so that's helping a lot. And then I'd say, second, I think we're finally getting the hang of digital leads, which is generating way more leads in every business. We have a couple of unique campaigns, digital campaigns, both in Fleet. We call one of them Barbara -- I feel like I'm naming boats or something here -- and one in our Lodging business called Sara.\n And so these campaigns that kind of create a bit of a personality in the space have been incredibly successful for us. So I don't want to say they're shooting fish in a barrel, but the sales force is getting fed with a lot more quality leads, call it, in the last year than they were before. So it's just all good. It's inflationary time, so we have kind of cost reduction products. We have better products than we have. We have more people on the street, and our lead thing is working better. So it's just -- I mean, I'd just say it's working, what we're doing. \nSpencer James: Great. And as a follow-up, maybe an update on credit and fraud trends in the Fleet business. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. So I don't know if we -- Alissa print that or not. So it's a smidgy bit better sequentially from Q4. And again, based on when we started to take the actions, most of the benefit in terms of improvement is expected in the second half. So we're seeing a lot kind of in our -- what we call our delinquency roll rates. So we're staring at the last week. We have super good visibility into Q2, which doesn't necessarily impact the credit reserve we'll take for this quarter but super does for the following quarter. So we can see that thing really coming down.\n So I don't know if we can take it to the bank yet, but the early warning, the early good news signs are that the actions we've taken are going to take credit losses down in the second half like we planned. And then same on the fraud side. The fraud side has been a combo of what we call application fraud, which are fully people pretending to be somebody and getting us. So we basically put in a bit of a new system that does way better at that, has a few more variables that it looks at before it says okay.\n And then the second one is just criminal fraud, right? People at a truck stop putting in skimming and selling cars and stuff. And so I think we're down 40% in fraud sequentially in those couple of areas. And our partners, like the truck stop partners, have been helpful in trying to police that better at the site. So as those numbers got bigger, right, because fuel prices, what, Q2, I guess, peaked last year, I'm going to say Q2, it became a more attractive target. And so it took time, I think, for us and others to get on it. So not mission accomplished yet, but we're making good progress. \nOperator: The next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. \nJames Faucette: I had a couple of follow-up operational questions here. Retention in the quarter was really strong. I think it was like 91.2% but was down about 100 basis points from last quarter. And I know you just mentioned kind of the credit actions taken. But can you expand if there were any other factors driving that? Is there seasonality, et cetera, that we should be aware of? And how are you thinking about that for the remainder of the year? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, James, Ron again. No, that's it. I mean the reason it shows up there is what we call involuntary attrition, which is about half of our losses, right? So let's use 10% not to hurt our head. Hey, 10% of our customers quit us every year. We quit 5 of them, which means we get uncomfortable with your credit profile and so you're not our customer anymore.\n And so when you go through what we did of having greater -- heightened attention on these small-ish 1, 2, 3 kind of card accounts, we took actions basically to cut lines and pull back payment cycles and stuff really just obviously to contain losses. And so that just translates into us effectively kicking those clients out. So that's it. That's the totality of the thing. And I want everyone clear, we did it with our eyes just completely wide open. And based on what we're seeing, happy that we did it. In your opening comment, we're still -- work for ADP for 10 years and still super happy with a consolidated 91% revenue retention rate. So we're -- no tears here. \nJames Faucette: Got it. And then just a follow-up on -- there's been a lot of conversation obviously on segments and strategy, et cetera. But from a realignment perspective, at least as you've redefined some of the segment definitions, any change to how that strategically impacts those businesses or planned go to market, et cetera? \nRonald F. Clarke: That's really a super good question. Yes. Let me say what I think kind of the insight is, and it comes a little bit from how we started on kind of a product-centric view of our lines of business versus a market rider or a customer-centric view. And I think the Brazil guys that I called out at the top of the call, they've proven that if you want to redefine your business as, hey, I'm going to help vehicle-related drivers make payments, whether they're a business guy driving around or whether they're a consumer driving around, all those things that you pay related to the vehicles, right, fuel, toll, EV, maintenance, stopping for food, parking, now even insurance, that those things -- getting into those shows that the businesses and the consumers believe that our business has the right to offer to provision all of those payment things and having all those things on one account seems like a good idea to them.\n So I'd say that's kind of where we're headed. The idea would be to basically stop looking at the thing as, hey, you're driving around, and we're selling you one thing. Like go to Europe. We're now -- I said -- talked about the 3 in 1. Now we're selling fleets, but we're also selling old-fashioned diesel and EV. Why can't we sell parking and toll and insurance to those sets of millions of users and stuff? And so I think that's the strategic turn for us, is to think about really the multiple things we could sell to the same customer that makes sense to them.\n And the great news is we have a live case, like a real case to that. And the other thing I'm guessing people missed is the phone, right? The mobile phone is starting to matter. Like I tell you that 3 million out of 5 million users, consumers in Brazil decided to go to our phone app in a month. I don't know if that's crazy to you guys, but it is to me. We used to stick a tag on the windshield, and now 60% of the people are on their phone in our app looking for stuff. And so that creates, I think, an enormous ability again to offer up, like the insurance example, more things to the customer base. So we're going to -- the headline is we're looking at the world more through the lens of the customer and what we can offer than we are product by product. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Cantwell with Wells Fargo. \nJeffrey Cantwell: And just to follow up on some of the questions about core versus noncore and you giving us a ton of color on this. I just wanted to bounce something off you and see if you would agree that this is a fair statement that, over the years, amongst Fleet, Corporate Payments and Lodging, there would be potentially a number of operational synergies amongst those 3 segments. And so the clear follow-up question to that would be could you maybe give us some comments on Brazil within the context of core versus noncore. Just curious how that piece of your business ties in with the rest. \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, I think Jeff, I kind of just said it. To me, in some ways, Brazil is the lead dog, is kind of the poster child for really how we should think about the portfolio, right? That, hey, when we bought that business 7 years ago, it was mostly a toll-centric business, and it's transformed, right, in the -- like I said, selling 5 or 6 things to the same, both businesses and consumers. And notice how we're selling EV, right, to both businesses and consumers. We're just basically repurposing the networks and the tech. Well, obviously, that's what Brazil has done, right?\n They've got toll networks that both use. They've got fuel networks that both use. They have parking that both use. So they've literally taken the same networks and tech and sold the stuff to the 2 different groups. So I'd say, if anything, that business looks more related. The other thing, which is so weird, is fleet's in 8 giant markets today. Fleet's not only in the U.S.A. It's in, obviously, the U.K. It's in Czech. It's in Germany. It's in Russia. It's in Australia. It's in Canada. Obviously, it's in Brazil. Obviously, we have a Fleet business that's in 8 geographies, of which 1 of them just happens to be Brazil.\n So our lenses are, in some ways, it might be the -- it is -- the most related business in the company to our Fleet business would be our Brazil business because all of it is another country doing fleet, vehicle stuff. So I would say that would be a super duper long shot. The only thing is I like businesses that are working, just as an aside. So the fact that the business is compounding in the teens and pressed at about the 50% EBITDA line and beaten down people that are giving things away for free and continuing to compound, we like that. I mean I like that like a lot, the performance of the business. \nJeffrey Cantwell: Okay. And my follow-up is for Tom. For those of us who have not covered you at your prior, would you maybe just, if you don't mind, give us a sense of how you think strategically and also conceptually about managing the business and so forth? Would love to get your thoughts on what your mindset is as you're coming onboard here. \nTom Panther: Sure, Jeff. Look forward to working with you and good to work with many of you on the call that did cover EVO. My DNA as a finance person is really to approach it from a business-centric perspective. I've had the benefit over the last month or so being able to participate in a variety of meetings here, really learning the company firsthand, and getting grounded in how the business operates is centric to how I and the rest of the team within finance thinks and supports the business.\n Our role is to make sure we bring good information and good advice and ideas to the business. And we can't do that by just looking at the output of the results. I've said repeatedly over the course of my career, I like focusing on the inputs in order to drive the outputs. And my dialogue and the team's dialogue with the business is around their KPIs. And if we can get their focus on their KPIs and how those KPIs drive the kind of outcomes that we're looking for financially, then the company wins.\n So you'll find me and again, the rest of the team very focused on making sure that we understand how the business is operating and how we can help it become more and more successful. Very focused on things up and down the income statement and balance sheet, so no real bias there. It's where the opportunity is, is where we'll focus. \nOperator: The next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. \nMihir Bhatia: My first question just has to do with the consumer EV build-out that you kind of mentioned, Ron. Can you maybe expand on that? Is the idea there to build a FLEETCOR consumer brand? Or are you white labeling? Is the -- I mean, I guess, based on some of your other comments about Brazil, is the thinking there that using EV instead of tolls, you can do something similar on the consumer side as what they have done in Brazil using tolls as the wedge if you will? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes, that's a good question. So as I mentioned at the top, the motivation initially here is repurposing assets we have, which are networks, right, in tech. But your comment about brand is a good one. So the first thing I'd say is some of that build initially will be under other people's brands, where we'll be kind of Intel Inside. So what I mean by that is think of us going to an EV car manufacturer. Pick Volvo, Renault, somebody who's making EV cars and they want to give their new buyers an easy way to find public recharging and pay for it. They're going to use our network and our app.\n The brand and sometimes even the app will get pulled into Renault's or Volvo's way, right, of communicating. So that's one, so leveraging kind of the carmaker's brand to get to those drivers. And then the second one is kind of the CPOs, the gas stations, if you will, the charge point operators is what they call them. Same thing, we would go to someone that's got 100 charge points and has customers coming in that wants them to be able to roam to go to places other than their 100. They would be trying to sign those customers up and get them under an app that we would provide them. So that's the first headline, is that some amount of our consumer business would leverage these intermediary brands.\n But lastly, I think it is a good idea. We have this brand, this company we bought called Plugsurfing, which, I guess, kind of sounds like an EV brand. So yes, we're not going to use, for sure, the FLEETCOR brand. We want something that's representative of EV. And so we might invest. We may take a market, to your point, and invest digitally to see if we can build that brand and add some consumers directly. But that's for a different day. \nMihir Bhatia: Understood. And then just switching gears to this year, and obviously, you're seeing some sales momentum that you've highlighted. But just in general, as you sit here today, do you think things are getting better or worse relative to 3 months ago? Because there's a lot of conflicting data. I guess, from your -- the data you are seeing, are you seeing any pockets of weakness across your offerings? Or is it really just the macro is the only -- like outside macro is a big question mark for you? \nRonald F. Clarke: Yes. I know it's the question on everyone's mind, but I guess I'd make a couple of points. So first is our best internal metric here is what we call same-store sales, which basically isolates existing clients in the period that we had in the same period a year ago and just ask, hey, are they getting healthier or sicker, and the answer is healthier. So across our -- across the globe, at least among our clients, they're plus 3% healthier than they were 12 months ago. So that's kind of point one.\n The second point is our company that grows revenues double digit and grows profits faster isn't super reliant on GDP. I don't know what our GDP is here in the U.S. or in some of our big markets, but let's say it's 1% or 2%. We're growing by gaining share, right? We sell way more than we lose. So the growth rate and potential of our company is way more in our control of being able to sell way more businesses at the top of the bucket and lose less businesses at the bottom. If the existing clients shrink 1 point or so, oh, woe is me for a quarter or 2 maybe, but that's not our game.\n Our game is to basically power through, either happier or a little bit sadder, GDP kind of environment. So again, we're not seeing much, and frankly, I think it's -- the impact, it's at the margin for us. \nOperator: This has concluded our question-and-answer session, and the conference has also now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may all now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ronald F. Clarke",
            "content": "Okay. Jim, thanks. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q1 '23 earnings call. Also joining us here today is Tom Panther, our new CFO, who is now official, so delighted to have Tom here with us. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects: first, provide my take on Q1 results; second, I'll share our updated full year 2023 guidance; third, discuss progress on our value creation and simplification plan; and then lastly, I'll comment briefly on our newly formed strategic review committee.\n Okay. Let me turn to our Q1 results. We reported revenue of $901 million, up 14%, and cash EPS of $3.80. That's up 4%. Both results finished above the top of our guidance range. The cash EPS of $3.80 clearly weighed down predominantly by higher interest expense. At constant interest expense for the quarter, cash EPS would have been $4.30, up 17%, so our model's intact.\n The macro environment did cooperate, basically coming in as we anticipated. EBITDA for Q1 exceeded $460 million, up 17%. Margins there, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We invested incrementally about another 100 basis points of margin and a set of capability acquisitions from 2022, those intended to better position the company for the midterm.\n Trends in the quarter, quite good. Organic revenue growth, Q1 was up 12% overall. That accelerated sequentially and is above our 9% to 11% target range. Same-store sales finished plus 3%, so healthy. Retention finished at 91%, slightly impacted by the credit actions we took in Q4 to contain credit risk in the micro segment. That does drive a bit of involuntary attrition. Sales performance, absolutely terrific in the quarter, up 31%, setting new record levels of new bookings. So look, fundamentals, in a good spot.\n I do want to highlight our Brazil performance in Q1. So that business, really doing a nice job of transforming from a toll-centric business initially to now a broader vehicle payments business, again, for both businesses and consumers. The vehicle-related payments now include not only tolls but fuel, parking, fast food and recently now even vehicle insurance. Another super good sales quarter for Brazil, new toll tags, record level, and those were helped by a new bank relationship with Santander, which added almost 15% to the overall sales in the quarter.\n We also had terrific fuel transaction growth, up 39%, as we continue to increase the fueling acceptance sites. But most surprisingly in the quarter is, of our approximately 5 million active consumer users there, 3 million utilized our new Sem Parar app, mobile app in the quarter. And that engagement helped drive almost a 15% attach rate of insurance policy add-on sales, so consumers coming to the app, looking around, seeing offers and actually transacting with us. So we think this engagement opens up big-time cross-sell opportunities. So look, all in all, a very good start here to Q1. Sales, revenues, profits, all of those above our expectations.\n Okay. Let me shift gears and turn to our updated full year 2023 guidance along with assumptions behind it. So we're revising full year revenue and cash EPS guidance up by our Q1 beat, so revenue at the midpoint now of $3.840 billion and cash EPS at the midpoint now, $17.15. We are expecting the rest of year environment to be pretty consistent with what we forecasted 90 days ago, a few puts and takes but overall in the same place.\n Also, we've got an early view of April trends and results, so continuing to track to our plan. I do want to point out that we're expecting rest of year organic revenue growth in the 9% to 11% range. Inside of that, fuel improving to kind of mid-single digits, Brazil and Lodging in the mid-teens and Corporate Payments in the high teens.\n We're expecting rest of year earnings to accelerate. That'll be driven by these record levels of sales flowing into the second half, a stronger Q2 and Q3 seasonality; again, a second half fuel acceleration driven really by the pivot in sales in that business from micro to a bit up market. We'll see better operating leverage as we run through the year. Revenues will expand faster than expenses. That should result in EBITDA margins in Q4 about 200 to 250 basis points better than last year. Second half EPS will also improve mostly as we lap the interest expense and higher bad debt levels that we experienced last year. \n Finally, we will keep a close eye out for any signs of macro weakness so that we can react quickly if we need to. Again, our solutions are generally pretty essential, pretty important. And demand for our services tends to actually run higher in inflationary times.\n Okay. Let me transition to the progress that we're making on our value creation or simplification plan. So we're working across 3 areas there: first, to eliminate overhang related to the Russia and FTC case; we're working to reduce complexity and present a simpler company; and finally, EV, we're working to demonstrate that we can basically succeed in this energy transition.\n So first up, Russia. We have signed definitive documents now to sell our Russia business to a local firm. We're awaiting a Russian government approval for the deal. And if we can get through the various hoops here, we would expect to close at the end of the quarter, the end of Q2. Tom Panther will provide some additional details on the impact of the transaction.\n Okay. Next up, the FTC case. So not much new to report here. As a reminder, both we and the FTC filed proposed orders back in February outlining some additional disclosure enhancements that we have been discussing with the court. So now it's really up to the court to decide what the conclusions will be and what the order will be. Given again that these are disclosure-related subjects, we continue to believe the court order will not have a material impact on the go-forward financial performance of the company.\n Over to simplification, we are evaluating ways to simplify our company. Three things under consideration: first, we are actively exploring the divestiture now of a few noncore assets, so that's underway; second, we're considering moving to 3 reporting segments versus today's 5; and then lastly, we're continuing to evaluate a brand change for the entire company to Corpay that would better reflect really the broad set of corporate payments solutions that we're offering. So expect to make decisions on these simplification ideas over the next 90 days.\n Okay. Let me make the turn to EV and reference Pages 11, 12 and 13 in our earnings supplement. So we've launched a pretty unique solution, the EV solution in the U.K. We call it our 3-in-1 solution. So that solution provides our fleet clients with a single program, one program where they can make traditional diesel purchases, on-road public EV recharging and manage at-home EV recharging and reimbursement, so 3 in 1.\n The early indications are that the EV economics could actually be favorable to us. So we looked at a sample, 271 clients in the U.K. that have been with us over the last 8 quarters, and examined the revenue pattern. And what you can see in the supplement is that the EV revenue per vehicle is actually higher than our ICE revenue per vehicle. So although early days, really pretty good news. So the driver here has really the need for businesses to measure and reimburse recharging and potentially, in our case, 1 million homes, right, the number of users we have. So it will be quite a task.\n I also want to point out that we're continuing to pursue the consumer EV payment opportunity so providing some potential upside to the EV energy transition. Since we are building, acquiring EV networks and EV technology for the B2B market, we decided to repurpose those capabilities to serve consumers. So underway doing that in Europe, we're building a consumer EV payment business. We've signed 10 EV vehicle manufacturers, and we're serving their new EV consumer buyers. So when a new EV consumer drives off a lot, they will be using our EV network and payment app, so out of the blocks there.\n Okay. Let me make the turn to my last subject, which is our new strategic review committee, formed to evaluate the portfolio options for the company. So we did retain Goldman Sachs to support the assignments. They have shared their preliminary analysis and thoughts with both the committee and our Board. I do want you to know we're taking this portfolio assessment quite seriously, and we're evaluating really all options to potentially increase shareholder value.\n I want you to know that I am personally aligned here with shareholders, both in terms of the importance of re-rating our multiple but also the urgency of doing so. So early days, but we're digging in. We're evaluating options. We're meeting folks. We're sizing dissynergies. We're getting at it. We do expect to have much more to report when we speak again in 90 days.\n So look, in closing, again, Q1 out of the blocks in a good way, ahead of our expectations. Our rest of year guide, up, assuming 9% to 11% organic revenue growth with improving margins and earnings, working aggressively to close out our Russia and FTC overhangs, begin communicating hopefully a simpler company and advancing the EV capabilities. And lastly, as I just said, we are just underway evaluating portfolio separation options, so a lot going on.\n So with that, let me turn the call over to Tom Panther, our new CFO, to provide some additional details on the quarter. Tom? Yes. Pete, it's Ron. So I'd say kind of in the base business based on how we're allocating sales and marketing investment, we're probably still in that target range, kind of mid-single digits. But I think the couple of wild cards on it are AEV, right? Does that thing, particularly with the early view we're getting of the economics, does that help accelerate it along with that consumer leg? And then B, do we get the cross-sell thing to hunt a bit more? so I'd say the wildcard is those 2 things. If those 2 things come in, obviously could accelerate quite a bit. Yes, that's a good question. So, so far, it's good news. It's -- for those who don't know, it's pretty early days in Brazil in terms of trying to make the transition to free flow. So they're actually testing it in one region. So the good news on that for -- obviously, for the toll operator is, hey, there's no more gates and stopping people. The bad news is the, whatever, the 20% to 30% of the people that don't have electronic, have a [ clue folly ] way of paying after the fact.\n So it'll help us. It's a tailwind short term because it makes the electronic blast right through even more attractive than today because, again, it's more difficult for people to follow up after the fact. So we're actually seeing that, Pete, in the test region. So in the one place where they put it in, we're actually doing a bit better, so I'd say the only reason I get super excited. It'll probably take quite a while, right? There's a lot to test. There's a lot of infrastructure and stuff to move that post-payment thing to work out. So I don't think it's going to be super duper immediately but I'd say, over the midterm, helpful to us. Andrew, another good question. So point one is we already sell up market, so although we don't say it, call it, I don't know, 40% of the sales even in the U.S. business are kind of not digital, 40% to 50%. So we're already kind of in the business is point one. And point two is, I'd say, even more so internationally, we have way longer time and see there with universal networks, so we sold a bigger account for a lot longer.\n But back here to the U.S. So the 2 ways that we'll kind of drift up market is, one, is repointing of our digital engine. So we basically kind of reworked the algorithm there to look for different kind of search characteristics. So we let through the door, if you will, we bid in a way basically to encourage bigger accounts to come to us and obviously kind of shun smaller accounts. So that's underway. We made that pivot, call it, last October, November, so that's already started to work.\n And then second, what you said. We're starting to grow now the feet on the street that would go into the seam. And what we're working on is what I mentioned to Pete, Andrew, a few minutes ago of maybe going to market with not only the fuel card but going to market with this Corpay One that kind of has the corporate payments stuff built into it to see if that might be a little bit more compelling. So we're kind of in test mode now of putting some people against a bit larger prospects and giving them something a little newer kind of interesting to say. So those are the couple of ideas. Yes, I'd say that's way too early to call, right? We've got a tiny, tiny, little EV business and set of assets and cost structure. So our 99% focus at this point is on the revenue side, right, and figuring out how to serve these clients and win. And I don't know if people think it's a big deal, but as I kind of dug through the data, I'll say to everybody, it is a big deal, right, that companies, real clients that we have are willing to pay us more money to be more helpful in more places, and if you look at the chart, kind of significantly more money.\n So that is way different than I think we would have thought 2 years ago getting into the thing. So what I would say people ought to focus on is the fact that we have it. I think I'm accurate in saying we're the only ones. There's no one else that has this 3-in-1 kind of offering that brings all the things together. So I'd say, come back, Andrew, a different day to me on the margin side, but there's nothing structurally that would make us think we couldn't be at the same level over time. It's just not we're on today. Yes. Sheriq, it's Ron. So no, I'd say, if anything, the months are increasing, why we're a snowball business where we add more than we lose. And I think -- I don't know, but probably March has more workdays, so it would have been a higher print. And I did call out we've had a pretty good peak here in April, both revenue and other trends that I'd say it's kind of spot on the plan, which obviously fits with the guidance. So we're still just not seeing much. We built a plan, whatever, a few months ago, and as you can hear from the results and the April comment, we kind of track in the -- right where we thought. Are you trying to pick on, hey, it's 19% instead of 20%? Yes. If you go back and read kind of prior scripts, I would have said high teens to 20%. So 19%, I think qualifies as high teens. And I did say I think it's likely you will see in 1 of the next 2 or 3 quarters to think -- tick above the 20%. So again, we try to build, design that business to run right around the 20%, plus or minus, so still highly confident of that. Yes, Sanjay, on the first part of your question, the backdrop has changed our value of our earnings, right? So historically, I'd say up until, call it, the last 1.5 years, we traded in the mid- to high teens EBITDA, kind of next 12 months EBITDA sort of trade at, call it, 10, 11x is the first part of the backdrop. So a price from a third party that would be a lot higher than where we are would be more interesting to me than it would have been when we traded obviously at 15% to 20%.\n So in terms of the segments, I'd say it's really the size of the businesses is how we think about things that are core. So things that are big for us have big leadership positions we would call core. And so if you know what those are, that would be Fleet, Brazil, Corporate Payments. Lodging for sure would be businesses that we would view as big and core and have great positions.\n But again, as I said in the opening comments, we're -- when you're trading for whatever reason at this level, we are -- starting with me, we are wide open to someone else other than who's in our stock, valuing some or all of the company at a more appropriate level. And so I do want to make sure people know we are out talking and trying to get feedback if we can ID people that would value some or all the business higher. Yes, that's also a good question. So I don't know how many months ago, somewhere 3 to 6 months ago, the Russian government created a separate, I don't know if you call it agency, commission, group, whatever it is, for this purpose of international western companies trying to exit and effectively created a sign-off requirement, almost like an antitrust or something, oversight. And so as western companies like us make deals, right, sign SPA to sell things, then these go to this group, this agency, this committee, whatever it is, and they opine on it. Hey, we're happy to approve this deal; or, hey, we'd like to see this or that.\n So that's what it is. We've been told that it's a month or 2. I think it's a function, right, of the volume of transactions that are in front of the group. But they have been -- we've looked at the history. As long as they've been established, they have been processing, one way or the other, transactions. So we do think, obviously, the buyer there is communicating to us that they're in conversations with this group, so it's in some kind of a process.\n Risk, yes, I've used the word. There's some hoops, so for us to say we know how that ball is going to bounce would not be accurate. So we have an agreement and assuming that it gets approved, we will transact. And our best guess, it's probably in the next 60 days. But I want people on the call, it is not risk free. There's obviously some chance that they would deny the sale or ask for changes in the sale that are unpalatable, and so we're just kind of waiting. Yes, Ken, I'd say it's too early really to try to answer that. We're, whatever, 5 or 6 weeks into kicking this thing into gear and studying it. So we don't really have a super-formed view. I think I kind of said what I said, which is we're underway. We've run, tumbled a bunch of numbers. We're obviously out talking to people. So really, we're just working our way through the options, and as I said, would be in a way better spot for a clear answer to you in 90 days. Sure. I'd say that I think we report spend in some of the appendices here and stuff, so it continues to be strong really across the board. I think maybe most importantly is the sales are just record levels. I mean our Q1 sales in our Corporate Payments business was not only an all-time high. It was an all-time high by, I don't know, 50% or something. So we're pouring money into advertising the brand now and reaching more people. We've got more people on the street. We finally have a really put-together product line.\n So the -- I think the fill on the top of the bucket is in -- is really the best place that it's ever been in. So I think it's -- without getting over my skis, it's kind of all systems go, the things work in. Our outlook is to compound now, like I said, high teens to 20%. And other than the channel thing, which is, I don't know, 10%, 12% of the business now, really, all the other parts of that business are rocking. So no warning flags at all. Yes. That's really super good question, Trevor. The first and most important thing I think I'd say is who do we compete with. So how do we get business and who would we lose business to? And the answer is banks. And because we mostly serve the middle market, it's Tier 2 banks. So it's super important that everyone has that in the brand. We're playing little league. But maybe we're playing Minor League Baseball versus Major League Baseball.\n And so we have to be able to get a mid-sized business to trust us to make either spot or hedge transactions for them versus, let me call it, kind of a Tier 2 bank. So when you have that context, the answer is we got to win everywhere. We have a better network, right, in terms of basically the destination, if you will, of payments, more breadth, more countries. We have better tech because it's all we do versus a bank running or using some third party.\n But the winner, I think, Trevor, is the people. We just have more specialists, right? We have hundreds of people in these different originating markets here, Canada, U.K., Europe, Australia, that really know FX, that have grown up in FX. So I think they really just outthink and outpitch the representatives that are at these Tier 2 banks. And so it's the combo of all of those things. But we compete well because, honestly, who has the book of business would be my answer to you. Super good question. I'd say think of it as just stepping up. So if it's, call it, 3 for the print for Q1, we're going to end middle kind of [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 3, 5, 6, 7 ]. It's going to step up basically based on the plan we've built. So kind of 1 point or so acceleration sequentially. Yes. I'm not so sure, Spencer, the second part of the question, but the first part, I can cover, which is, yes, it was a crazy good sales quarter, right? We're [ tallying guys ] up 31%, and that's in the face of taking the gas off of our North America Fleet business, right? We used to get, I don't know, 10%, 15% of the business in that micro segment, and I just shut it down, right, to try to contain. So it tells you that the rest of international fleet and all the rest of the businesses grew faster even to 31%.\n And I think it's a combo of things. One is, again, we've stepped up marketing and sales investment, particularly marketing. We've been pouring more money in corporate payments into this Corpay brand campaign, and so that's helping a lot. And then I'd say, second, I think we're finally getting the hang of digital leads, which is generating way more leads in every business. We have a couple of unique campaigns, digital campaigns, both in Fleet. We call one of them Barbara -- I feel like I'm naming boats or something here -- and one in our Lodging business called Sara.\n And so these campaigns that kind of create a bit of a personality in the space have been incredibly successful for us. So I don't want to say they're shooting fish in a barrel, but the sales force is getting fed with a lot more quality leads, call it, in the last year than they were before. So it's just all good. It's inflationary time, so we have kind of cost reduction products. We have better products than we have. We have more people on the street, and our lead thing is working better. So it's just -- I mean, I'd just say it's working, what we're doing. Yes. So I don't know if we -- Alissa print that or not. So it's a smidgy bit better sequentially from Q4. And again, based on when we started to take the actions, most of the benefit in terms of improvement is expected in the second half. So we're seeing a lot kind of in our -- what we call our delinquency roll rates. So we're staring at the last week. We have super good visibility into Q2, which doesn't necessarily impact the credit reserve we'll take for this quarter but super does for the following quarter. So we can see that thing really coming down.\n So I don't know if we can take it to the bank yet, but the early warning, the early good news signs are that the actions we've taken are going to take credit losses down in the second half like we planned. And then same on the fraud side. The fraud side has been a combo of what we call application fraud, which are fully people pretending to be somebody and getting us. So we basically put in a bit of a new system that does way better at that, has a few more variables that it looks at before it says okay.\n And then the second one is just criminal fraud, right? People at a truck stop putting in skimming and selling cars and stuff. And so I think we're down 40% in fraud sequentially in those couple of areas. And our partners, like the truck stop partners, have been helpful in trying to police that better at the site. So as those numbers got bigger, right, because fuel prices, what, Q2, I guess, peaked last year, I'm going to say Q2, it became a more attractive target. And so it took time, I think, for us and others to get on it. So not mission accomplished yet, but we're making good progress. Yes, James, Ron again. No, that's it. I mean the reason it shows up there is what we call involuntary attrition, which is about half of our losses, right? So let's use 10% not to hurt our head. Hey, 10% of our customers quit us every year. We quit 5 of them, which means we get uncomfortable with your credit profile and so you're not our customer anymore.\n And so when you go through what we did of having greater -- heightened attention on these small-ish 1, 2, 3 kind of card accounts, we took actions basically to cut lines and pull back payment cycles and stuff really just obviously to contain losses. And so that just translates into us effectively kicking those clients out. So that's it. That's the totality of the thing. And I want everyone clear, we did it with our eyes just completely wide open. And based on what we're seeing, happy that we did it. In your opening comment, we're still -- work for ADP for 10 years and still super happy with a consolidated 91% revenue retention rate. So we're -- no tears here. That's really a super good question. Yes. Let me say what I think kind of the insight is, and it comes a little bit from how we started on kind of a product-centric view of our lines of business versus a market rider or a customer-centric view. And I think the Brazil guys that I called out at the top of the call, they've proven that if you want to redefine your business as, hey, I'm going to help vehicle-related drivers make payments, whether they're a business guy driving around or whether they're a consumer driving around, all those things that you pay related to the vehicles, right, fuel, toll, EV, maintenance, stopping for food, parking, now even insurance, that those things -- getting into those shows that the businesses and the consumers believe that our business has the right to offer to provision all of those payment things and having all those things on one account seems like a good idea to them.\n So I'd say that's kind of where we're headed. The idea would be to basically stop looking at the thing as, hey, you're driving around, and we're selling you one thing. Like go to Europe. We're now -- I said -- talked about the 3 in 1. Now we're selling fleets, but we're also selling old-fashioned diesel and EV. Why can't we sell parking and toll and insurance to those sets of millions of users and stuff? And so I think that's the strategic turn for us, is to think about really the multiple things we could sell to the same customer that makes sense to them.\n And the great news is we have a live case, like a real case to that. And the other thing I'm guessing people missed is the phone, right? The mobile phone is starting to matter. Like I tell you that 3 million out of 5 million users, consumers in Brazil decided to go to our phone app in a month. I don't know if that's crazy to you guys, but it is to me. We used to stick a tag on the windshield, and now 60% of the people are on their phone in our app looking for stuff. And so that creates, I think, an enormous ability again to offer up, like the insurance example, more things to the customer base. So we're going to -- the headline is we're looking at the world more through the lens of the customer and what we can offer than we are product by product. Yes, I think Jeff, I kind of just said it. To me, in some ways, Brazil is the lead dog, is kind of the poster child for really how we should think about the portfolio, right? That, hey, when we bought that business 7 years ago, it was mostly a toll-centric business, and it's transformed, right, in the -- like I said, selling 5 or 6 things to the same, both businesses and consumers. And notice how we're selling EV, right, to both businesses and consumers. We're just basically repurposing the networks and the tech. Well, obviously, that's what Brazil has done, right?\n They've got toll networks that both use. They've got fuel networks that both use. They have parking that both use. So they've literally taken the same networks and tech and sold the stuff to the 2 different groups. So I'd say, if anything, that business looks more related. The other thing, which is so weird, is fleet's in 8 giant markets today. Fleet's not only in the U.S.A. It's in, obviously, the U.K. It's in Czech. It's in Germany. It's in Russia. It's in Australia. It's in Canada. Obviously, it's in Brazil. Obviously, we have a Fleet business that's in 8 geographies, of which 1 of them just happens to be Brazil.\n So our lenses are, in some ways, it might be the -- it is -- the most related business in the company to our Fleet business would be our Brazil business because all of it is another country doing fleet, vehicle stuff. So I would say that would be a super duper long shot. The only thing is I like businesses that are working, just as an aside. So the fact that the business is compounding in the teens and pressed at about the 50% EBITDA line and beaten down people that are giving things away for free and continuing to compound, we like that. I mean I like that like a lot, the performance of the business. Yes, that's a good question. So as I mentioned at the top, the motivation initially here is repurposing assets we have, which are networks, right, in tech. But your comment about brand is a good one. So the first thing I'd say is some of that build initially will be under other people's brands, where we'll be kind of Intel Inside. So what I mean by that is think of us going to an EV car manufacturer. Pick Volvo, Renault, somebody who's making EV cars and they want to give their new buyers an easy way to find public recharging and pay for it. They're going to use our network and our app.\n The brand and sometimes even the app will get pulled into Renault's or Volvo's way, right, of communicating. So that's one, so leveraging kind of the carmaker's brand to get to those drivers. And then the second one is kind of the CPOs, the gas stations, if you will, the charge point operators is what they call them. Same thing, we would go to someone that's got 100 charge points and has customers coming in that wants them to be able to roam to go to places other than their 100. They would be trying to sign those customers up and get them under an app that we would provide them. So that's the first headline, is that some amount of our consumer business would leverage these intermediary brands.\n But lastly, I think it is a good idea. We have this brand, this company we bought called Plugsurfing, which, I guess, kind of sounds like an EV brand. So yes, we're not going to use, for sure, the FLEETCOR brand. We want something that's representative of EV. And so we might invest. We may take a market, to your point, and invest digitally to see if we can build that brand and add some consumers directly. But that's for a different day. Yes. I know it's the question on everyone's mind, but I guess I'd make a couple of points. So first is our best internal metric here is what we call same-store sales, which basically isolates existing clients in the period that we had in the same period a year ago and just ask, hey, are they getting healthier or sicker, and the answer is healthier. So across our -- across the globe, at least among our clients, they're plus 3% healthier than they were 12 months ago. So that's kind of point one.\n The second point is our company that grows revenues double digit and grows profits faster isn't super reliant on GDP. I don't know what our GDP is here in the U.S. or in some of our big markets, but let's say it's 1% or 2%. We're growing by gaining share, right? We sell way more than we lose. So the growth rate and potential of our company is way more in our control of being able to sell way more businesses at the top of the bucket and lose less businesses at the bottom. If the existing clients shrink 1 point or so, oh, woe is me for a quarter or 2 maybe, but that's not our game.\n Our game is to basically power through, either happier or a little bit sadder, GDP kind of environment. So again, we're not seeing much, and frankly, I think it's -- the impact, it's at the margin for us."

            "name": "Tom Panther",
            "content": "Thanks, Ron. It's great to be formally onboard and to have joined the FLEETCOR team at such an exciting time. The last several weeks have been a great opportunity for me to learn the business by spending in-depth time with our people to better understand our markets, products, sales strategies, key initiatives, technology and much more. There is more for me to learn, but the team has been incredibly helpful, accelerating my journey up the learning curve.\n I'm impressed by the exceptional talent and high-caliber capabilities that support the organization. FLEETCOR has a proven track record of generating strong top line growth and accretive operating leverage, and I can see why it's able to deliver those sustained high-quality results. I'm looking forward to digging in and helping the company achieve its business, strategic and financial objectives, and I'm confident in FLEETCOR's growth prospects, both organic and inorganic moving forward.\n And we need to look no farther than the first quarter results to understand why I'm confident in the company's future. As Ron mentioned, we posted 14% revenue growth in the quarter, including 12% organic growth. The incremental 2% of reported growth was due to acquisitions made last year as the macro fuel and FX factors were mostly a push versus prior year. Revenue of $901 million exceeded our guidance by $19 million, which flowed through to our $0.15 beat in cash EPS of $3.80.\n Moving on to the segments. I want to point out that we changed our organic growth solution disclosures to match the segment reporting that we implemented last year. Going forward, both reported and organic results will be disclosed in Fleet, Corporate Payments, Lodging, Brazil and other. This will be cleaner and eliminate any confusion between segment and solution categories. We've provided organic growth information on this basis for the last 8 quarters on Slide 7 of our earnings supplement, and we've provided a map in the appendix so you can track these classification changes.\n Now on to the quarter. Organic revenue growth was 12% as we delivered results 2% above guidance, reflecting the strong diversification of our business and the realization of strong sales results from last year across all of our businesses. This is despite the intentional strategy to pivot our U.S. fleet sales upmarket to mitigate credit exposure. Our Corporate Payments revenue grew 19%, led by our direct Corpay payables business, which was up over 30%, driven by continuing strong sales, especially in full AP automation. Our solutions are selling well in the marketplace, and we continue to believe that we have attractive and differentiated offerings that will drive future growth over time.\n Cross border revenue was up 21%, which is normalized for the Global Reach acquisition in January. The cross border team had another very good quarter as new sales and customer wins remained strong while also substantially completing the Global Reach integration, which is underscored by 90% of the Global Reach revenue already migrated to our platform.\n Fleet revenue increased 6% on a reported basis, driven by higher volume. Organically, when we isolate the impact of fuel prices, Fleet grew 3%, in line with our expectations. This reflects the continued drag from the weakness in the micro SMB fleet and the recent change in sales focus to a slightly larger customer. We are seeing good success from our sales pivot with sales trends continuing to improve, and we feel good about our ability to reaccelerate the growth in the back half of the year.\n Brazil revenue was up 18% compared to last year as the business continues to perform at an extremely high level. Our strategy of using the vehicle and now the Sem Parar mobile app for additional purchases like fuel, insurance and certain retail purchases continues to grow, which significantly expands the addressable market across B2B and B2C. We have transformed the Brazil business beyond a single-product toll tags business. It really is the center of an entire vehicle payment ecosystem that continues to grow, and we're the only provider that offers this breadth in the market. We have a highly differentiated value proposition in the marketplace and it is clearly winning share.\n Lodging continued to perform well, growing 26%. This solid performance highlighted by strong sales across our industry verticals that reflect our success in driving innovation to win new clients and capturing more business from existing clients. In addition, revenue per night increased 24% due to customer mix and additional fee-based revenue sources as we continue to expand our product capabilities. Our near-term focus is on consolidating our various hotel networks into one  in order to enhance the customer experience.\n Looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses were $526 million, representing a 12% increase over the prior year, primarily due to the addition of the Global Reach operations and the capability acquisitions we made last year, like Plugsurfing in the EV space. The remaining increase in operating expense was primarily in Corporate Payments and Lodging, where we generated significant operating leverage.\n Bad debt expense was 8 basis points but more importantly, slightly down sequentially from Q4 '22. Our delinquency trends give us confidence that we're on the path to lower bad debt expense in the back half of the year, even after giving consideration to a potentially soft macroeconomic cycle.\n The EBITDA margin in the quarter was 51%, 100 basis points better than Q1 '22. This includes $11 million or about 100 basis points of drag from expenses associated with recent acquisitions, including integrating and building out our AP automation and EV capabilities that we bought last year. We still expect our full year EBITDA margin to increase approximately 150 basis points compared to last year and Q4 to exit the year 200 to 250 basis points higher than Q4 '22. Remember, margins expand throughout the year as we generate revenue growth and realize the benefits of synergies from recent acquisitions.\n Interest expense increased by $58 million year-over-year, driven by higher rates on our debt stack. The impact of higher interest rates resulted in approximate $0.49 drag on first quarter adjusted EPS. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.1% versus 26% last year, with the increase driven primarily by increases in tax rates in some international jurisdictions and some onetime discrete items. We anticipate the quarterly effective tax rate for the rest of the year to be between 26% and 27%.\n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with about $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash, and we had $779 million available on our revolver. There was $5.5 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, and we had $1.3 billion borrowed in our securitization facility. As of March 31, our leverage ratio was 2.7x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. We made no open market share repurchases in the quarter as we deployed roughly $230 million in capital for 3 deals, including Global Reach while also maintaining our leverage ratio.\n I would like to remind you that our first port of call for capital deployment is always accretive acquisitions. And then if there's nothing near term, we'll evaluate buybacks or debt paydowns as appropriate. We still have over $1.2 billion authorized for share repurchases, and we believe we have ample liquidity to pursue near-term M&A opportunities and continue to buy back shares when it makes sense.\n In addition to Ron's overview of our full year guidance, let me give some additional detail, including some thoughts on our Q2 outlook and supporting assumptions, which can be found on Slide 14. For the full year, we now expect GAAP revenues between $3.82 billion and $3.86 billion, adjusted net income between $1.263 billion and $1.303 billion, adjusted net income per diluted share between $16.95 and $17.35, and finally, EBITDA growth of 15%. All of these numbers include Russia for the full year.\n Assuming a June 30 close of our Russia business, we expect GAAP revenues to be $55 million to $65 million lower, resulting in a $0.30 to $0.40 decline in adjusted EPS based on using the sale proceeds for buybacks over the remainder of the year.\n I also want to emphasize that the transaction is subject to approval by the Russian government, which involves an added level of complexity. For the second quarter, we're expecting revenue to be between $930 million and $950 million and adjusted net income per share to be between $4.02 and $4.22, which at the midpoint is down slightly from what we reported in Q2 of 2022, which is driven by higher interest expense of approximately $60 million and roughly $20 million of expected macro headwinds from fuel price and FX rates.\n Related to our guidance assumptions, we are using $3.99 as our fuel price assumption for the rest of the year. Our interest expense guidance of $310 million to $330 million is based off an average LIBOR rate of 4.9% for the rest of the year. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement.\n Finally, I'd like to thank our 10,000-plus employees around the world who helped deliver a fantastic start to 2023. This quarter's results and our go-forward prospects reinforce the power of our growth-oriented, diversified business and the strength of our franchise.\n Thank you for your interest in FLEETCOR. And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. Sure, Jeff. Look forward to working with you and good to work with many of you on the call that did cover EVO. My DNA as a finance person is really to approach it from a business-centric perspective. I've had the benefit over the last month or so being able to participate in a variety of meetings here, really learning the company firsthand, and getting grounded in how the business operates is centric to how I and the rest of the team within finance thinks and supports the business.\n Our role is to make sure we bring good information and good advice and ideas to the business. And we can't do that by just looking at the output of the results. I've said repeatedly over the course of my career, I like focusing on the inputs in order to drive the outputs. And my dialogue and the team's dialogue with the business is around their KPIs. And if we can get their focus on their KPIs and how those KPIs drive the kind of outcomes that we're looking for financially, then the company wins.\n So you'll find me and again, the rest of the team very focused on making sure that we understand how the business is operating and how we can help it become more and more successful. Very focused on things up and down the income statement and balance sheet, so no real bias there. It's where the opportunity is, is where we'll focus."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to today\u2019s Corpay Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this call is being recorded and I will be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Head of Investor Relations, Jim Eglseder. Please go ahead.\nJim Eglseder: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Panther, our CFO. Following their prepared comments, the operator will announce the queue will open for the Q&A session. Today\u2019s documents, including our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at corpay.com. Now, throughout this call, we will be covering several non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income, and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. We will also be covering organic revenue growth. This metric neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in FX rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads. It also includes pro forma results for acquisitions and divestitures or scope changes closed during the two years being compared. None of these measures are calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today\u2019s press release and on our website. It\u2019s important to understand that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today. All statements about our outlook, new products, and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We undertake no obligation to update any of these statements. These expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today\u2019s press release on Form 8-K and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron?\nRon Clarke: Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q3 2024 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover three subjects. First, provide my take on Q3 results, share our Q4 guidance along with a 2025 preview. Second, I'll discuss our U.S.A. opportunity. and our recent sales reorganization. And then lastly, I'll provide an update on our M&A activities. Okay. Let me begin with our Q3 results, starting with we surpassed $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the very first time. So, quite a big milestone for us. We reported revenue of $1.29 billion, up 7%, excluding Russia and cash EPS of $5, up 14%, excluding Russia. The result is really in line with our expectations, both revenue and earnings finishing on the high side of our guidance range. EBITDA margins in Q3, 54.2%, that's up about 100 basis points sequentially. Our trends in Q3 really quite good. Same-store sales remained essentially flat, and that's consistent with Q2. Retention improved slightly to a bit above 92% for the quarter. That's a return to record levels. Sales are what we call new bookings growth of 14% and inside of that corporate payment sales growth leading the way with a 28% sales growth in the quarter. And payables spend monetization levels remaining steady sequentially. Organic revenue growth, finishing at 6% overall. Again, strong growth in corporate payments, Brazil and international fleet. And a continued drag for North America fleet in lodging. Although lodging did show signs of improvement in the quarter. So, the wrap on Q3, really, no surprises here, lodging a bit better. North America fleet a bit worse. But more importantly, trends, same-store sales, retention, sales and spend monetization, all stable or improving. So, really a good result. Okay. Let me make the turn to Q4 and full year 2024 guidance. So, we're outlooking a very strong Q4 finish. We're expecting organic revenue growth to accelerate to 13% and an early view of our October revenue flash supports this acceleration. Outlook in EBITDA margins of 55.6%, which should be up about another 140 basis points sequentially. Cash EPS of $5.35 at the midpoint, up 21% and hopeful for Q4 sales growth coming in above 20%. So, really firing on all cylinders. A couple additional positives. We expect lodging revenue growth to turn positive here in Q4 and the infamous Corporate Payments channel segment expected to finally grow again here in Q4. So, both of these things support our overall revenue growth acceleration. So, as I said back in August, our expected arrival to a better place is now Q4. For full year 2024, our staying put with $19 of full year cash EPS at the midpoint. That implies 16% year-over-year EPS growth, excluding Russia. So, really in line with our 15% to 20% midterm earnings growth target. Okay. Let me transition to a 2025 preview, obviously, early days, but we think it's setting up quite well. In terms of organic revenue growth, we're out looking 9% to 11% driven by a recovery of our North America fleet in lodging businesses, both moving into positive territory next year. Corporate Payments in Brazil maintaining mid- to high teens growth rates even our gift business outlooking double-digit growth next year. We do expect an incremental 3% of print revenue growth that's above organic from the combination of the two Corporate Payments acquisitions. Planning our 2025 sales growth around 20% next year. That's driven by the demand for our new products, along with incremental investment in sales coverage. So, taken together, we're targeting 2025 cash EPS at a $22 per share ballpark. Still lots to work through a couple of big assumptions behind the 2025 cash EPS will be FX assumptions, particularly the Brazil real, along with the net impact of lower interest rates offset by higher 2025 tax rates. So, look, net-net, we're outlooking a pretty good 2025 setup. Okay. Let me make the turn to our USA sales opportunity, along with the recent decision to reorganize U.S. sales and a point a new CRO. So, recently, our U.S. sales growth has not been as good as our international sales growth and particularly our North America fleet and lodging solutions. We see the U.S. opportunity for all of our lines to be enormous. Take, for example, our payables business, we've got about a 2% or 3% share of the mid-market. Recall that's a business of about $500 million of annualized revenue. And yet there's a couple hundred thousand prospects to convert and we've got 2% to 3%. So, look, a big opportunity. So, to get at this opportunity more urgently, we've taken the following actions. We've established a consolidated U.S. sales organization with the associated marketing and sales support functions reporting into one new CRO exec. His name is Mike Jeffrey. We've rebranded sections of the vehicle, lodging and payables lines of business to Corpay to leverage the brand and we've established a dedicated cross-sell team that will take each of our solutions back to our existing client base to drive sales. So, lots of energy focus and urgency around selling more here in the U.S. Okay. And finally, I'll move to my last subject, which is an M&A update. So, quite busy in 2024 on the M&A front. Four deals finalized, a couple still in the pipeline. So, first, Paymerang, the AP automation company -- we closed that July 1st. Good news. It's tracking closely to our second half plan and we're seeing significant synergies here in Q4. GPS across border business that we signed up this summer, still on track to close at the end of the year. Through Q3, the business is performing at forecast. So good news there. So, we'll be excited to bring that business across. Taken together these two Corporate Payment deals should contribute about $0.50, of cash EPS accretion in 2025. Third is our Zapay Brazil deal, which is a vehicle car debts company helps drivers pay for registration renewals and tickets. We acquired that business in the spring. It gave us an entry to really a new payments TAM, that is 5 times the size of the toll TAM, so pretty big. And the that Zapay business year-to-date, up 45% in revenue. We've also signed up 90,000 Sem Parar toll users to using the Zapay solutions in the first six months. So, a good start. And lastly, the Comdata Merchant Solutions business, it's a POS solutions business for truck stop merchants, it's being sold to a PE-backed company planning that sale to close by year-end. You might recall this divestiture is tied to the strategic review from last spring and then to simplify the company. We do have a couple of active deals now that we're still working and although relatively small, if we do proceed we will close those early next year. So, look, in conclusion, today, Q3, again, results finishing on the high side of our guidance range stable or improving same-store sales, retention and spend monetization trends, outlooking meaningful revenue growth acceleration here in Q4, along with record earnings. Early take on 2025 good outlook in revenue and earnings growth kind of in line with our stated midterm objectives. And lastly, very pleased with our 2024 M&A activity, the two Corporate Payment acquisitions, tracking and the business really just positioned better overall for faster growth. So, with that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Tom?\nTom Panther: Thanks Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Here are some additional details related to the quarter. As we announced last week, Q3 revenue was $1.029 billion, which I was pleased to see at the higher end of our guide despite lower fuel prices. Organic revenue grew 6% versus Q3 last year, led by 18% growth in Corporate Payments. Strong expense discipline and another quarter of lower bad debt resulted in EBITDA margin of 54.2%. We generated $355 million of free cash flow, which translates into $5 per share in cash EPS, $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance, up 11%, versus last year and up 14%, excluding the impact of the sale of our Russia business. Overall, our first $1 billion revenue quarter, reflecting the quality and diversification of our business. Now, turning to our segment performance and the underlying drivers of our organic revenue growth. Corporate Payments revenue was up 18%, driven by 7% growth in spend volume and stable card penetration rates. Strength in our direct business, which grew 21% was again led by strong growth in full AP. We closed the Paymerang deal in July, which contributed $14 million of revenue in the quarter and we continue to migrate the business to our platform. Everything is progressing according to plan, and we expect meaningful synergy contributions beginning in the fourth quarter. From an adjusted EPS perspective, we still expect Paymerang to be EPS neutral in Q4. Cross-border revenue was up 21%, led by 40% sales growth. Both new client acquisition and recurring client transaction activity was robust as our scale, technology, and talent advantages continue to power share gains from legacy financial players. Our previously announced acquisition of GPS Capital Markets continues to progress through the approval process, and we expect it to close in early 2025. Turning to vehicle payments. Organic revenue increased 4% during the quarter. Growth was driven by a 7% increase in transactions and higher revenue per transaction which were both broad-based across all businesses and geographies. Organic revenue growth was again driven by Brazil and international fleet, which both grew double-digits. We're beginning to see some progress related to our sales and marketing investment in our local U.S. fleet business. As a reminder, this customer segment services middle market and SMB field services businesses that used vehicles to deliver their goods and services every day. During the quarter, transactions and spend volume on a constant fuel price basis showed signs of accelerating growth. In addition, we're seeing a quarterly trend of improving performance across same-store sales, new sales, and retention. There's more work to be done to increase sales, but it's encouraging to see some initial progress. In the U.K., we continue to expand the PayByPhone parking app into a multi-point consumer vehicle payment app by leveraging our proprietary networks and partnerships to add relevant products and services. In Q2, we launched the ability to acquire car content insurance when parking and added a search function for nearby fuel stations and EV chargers. We've gone live this quarter with 2 additional services. One, our first vehicle maintenance and repair product for the U.K.'s mandatory annual vehicle inspection service. And secondly, EV charging payments, where app users can directly pay for EV charging from their PayByPhone app. We continue to be quite excited about the future prospects from repurposing our B2B networks and payment solutions to a large consumer segment. In Brazil, business performance was again quite strong with revenue growing 18% and sales increasing 22%. Tag growth was 8% and toll-related revenue grew 20%. We continue to see success not just in selling tags, but also selling additional payment solutions. Both insurance policies sold and car debt payment transactions were up over 100% in the quarter. Additionally, card debt app users and revenue were up over 30% compared to last year. These additional products are quite popular and continue to support our cross-sell success. Lodging revenue decreased 5% and improved 5 points sequentially from Q2. Room nights increased 10%, in part due to an improvement in same-store sales as well as storm-related emergency services. The softness in the business appears to have bottomed, and we're expecting the segment to grow slightly in the fourth quarter. Now, looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses of $561 million represent a 7% increase versus Q3 of last year, driven primarily by acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, operating expenses were flat. Bad debt expense declined 3% from last year to $28 million or 5 basis points of spend. So, credit remains controlled. EBITDA margin in the quarter was 54.2%, the slight year-over-year decline was impacted by acquisitions and divestitures over the last 12 months. Normalizing for these transactions, EBITDA margin increased 77 basis points. Our positive operating leverage is driven by solid revenue growth and disciplined expense management, both of which we're quite good at. Interest expense increased $21 million versus Q3 of 2023, due to higher debt balances from acquisitions and share buybacks. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.9% versus 26.6% last year, quite a bit lower as a result of option exercises during the quarter. Now, turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash, and we had $800 million available on our revolver. We have $6.2 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, which includes an additional $500 million of Term Loan B we issued in September at substantially similar terms to the existing credit facility. We used the proceeds to pay down the revolver after our purchase of Paymerang on July 1st. As of September 30th, our leverage ratio was 2.82 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. We also took actions in September to reduce our interest expense by entering into an additional $500 million 3.19% fixed rate swap and re-struck our Canadian dollar to USD cross-currency swap at a more favorable rate. The combination of these transactions is expected to reduce interest expense next year by approximately $7 million. We repurchased 300,000 shares in the quarter for $90 million entirely related to employee stock option exercises. We have over $500 million authorized for share repurchases and the Board recently authorized an additional $1 billion of share repurchases, so we now have over $1.5 billion available for buybacks. We will continue to pursue near-term M&A opportunities, and we'll also buy back shares when it makes sense while maintaining our leverage within our target range. Now, let me provide some additional details related to our outlook. For the full year, we are maintaining our cash EPS guide of $19 per share and slightly lowering our revenue guide to $3.995 billion at the midpoint as a result of unfavorable fuel prices and FX rates. We are not flowing through the third quarter B as most of that $4 million of revenue was driven by the timing of customer transactions near quarter end. For the fourth quarter, we are outlooking 13% revenue growth and 21% earnings growth at the midpoint. We expect revenue growth acceleration across each of our segments in the fourth quarter, driven by new sales, strong retention, and the realization of synergies from the Pairing acquisition. So, all-in-all, quite similar to what we expected in August. For more details regarding our fourth quarter and full year outlook, please refer to our earnings release. Thank you for your interest in Corpay. And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Shyam [ph] on for Ramsey. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could break down the retention by segment? And how much of the retention improvement that you saw, how much of that is from Corporate Payments becoming a larger part of the business versus just improving retention trends throughout the remainder of the business?\nRon Clarke: Yes, Shyam, thanks for the question. Yes, we really don't break the retention down by segment. We've talked generally in terms of how the segments performed relative to the overall line average but Corporate Payments business is much better than the line average in some of the SMB businesses within fleet, vehicle payments are below. I think generally, what we've seen is improving signs of retention on an absolute basis yes, as the mix gets more directed towards those higher retention businesses that are naturally repeat up. But that's going to move at a slow pace, and you haven't seen a dramatic shift in mix just from one quarter to the next. You'd have to look out over a 12-month period before you probably start seeing that have much of an impact. So, I think you can assume or take away the point that the improvement that we saw in retention is just core retention improving within the businesses versus a mix story.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on -- sorry.\nRon Clarke: Go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then just a quick follow-up on lodging for me. I was wondering if you guys could size if FEMA had any contribution to lodging payments in the quarter, given the hurricanes and if you guys are expecting any further tailwind from just extended disaster relief efforts?\nTom Panther: Hey it's Tom. It's a good question. I'd say it's probably about $1 million each for, maybe $1 million above kind of the normalized emergencies we get and maybe $1 million this quarter.\nUnidentified Analyst: Very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, great. Good afternoon. Good to talk to you guys. I just want to ask on new sales, if that's okay. Just a couple of questions there. How did the third quarter come in versus plan? And how quickly can the new sales reorg and CRO here produce results in your mind? Thank you.\nRon Clarke: Good question. So, I'd say Corporate Payments was rocking in Q3, I think I called it out, it was in the high 20s over the prior year. The NAF business was still a bit soft. I think it was 14 in total. The outlook is kind of low to mid-20s for Q4. So, the full year would be around 20% for the full year in the preliminary plan that we built for 2025 kind of did that to be up against 20% next year. The hope is that we're going to get some leverage from this thing, which is why we did it both on the expense side, right, consolidating some of the back office things so we can have more line people right out with customers. And then also the cross-selling, right? It's cheaper to sell things back to clients we have in terms of the contact rate is much better. So, he's a terrific guy. The guy we put in the job ran about half of the field in pay checks. So, a pretty big group. And so look, I'm super bullish both on the structure, the advantages the structure creates -- and then second, just on the guy just a super duper guy. So with the products that we have, the structure now in that guy, I'm hoping that things are going to do better next year.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Okay. No, that's great to hear. And then just my follow-up just thinking about visibility into 2025. I know we're so got certainty on the election, and we'll see what happens with rates here, but double-digit growth at this point? How do you feel about visibility there, Ron versus 90 days ago or even same time this time last year?\nRon Clarke: Yes, I think better, Tien-Tsin, for a couple of reasons. One is that we're outlooking the acceleration right now sitting in this quarter. And I've had a chance to peak in October, right, which supports the port, which is good. So, to sit here today and say, hey, I think organic is going to go from 666 to 13 is the first statement I'd make. And then the second one, I think, is just the mix helps us as we look into next year, I think the confidence is higher because the two problem children and moved to flat or kind of low single-digit and the Corporate Payments in Brazil that are super good mid- to high teens or bigger share side of the business. So, I think the mix, the ratio to get back the line averages better. So, I think it's a business you can plan when we go into next year, we've got 90% of the revenue engine next year. Whatever is 20 years of stats now on retention, same-store sales, I mean, you guys are good at math. So, that helps us basically frame what the revenue is going to be.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Nate Svensson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nNate Svensson: Hey guys. Sorry about that. I wanted to ask about North American fleet still remains a little bit of a drag on overall growth. And I know one of the other players in the space recently talked about some macro-driven softness there. So, wondering if you can call out some of the broader trends you're seeing in in that business. I know you mentioned same-store sales flat 3Q, but any call-outs you have on trends quarter-to-date? And then maybe more importantly, your 2025 outlook calls for North American fleet to return positive growth. So, can you talk about your confidence, maybe follow-up on Tien-Tsin's questions about visibility into that positive inflection sort of beyond the sales work changes that you mentioned?\nRon Clarke: Hey Nate, it's Ron. So on the first one, the same-store sales, we're seeing nothing. So, again, the thing is basically flat sequential and again, it's improved from the couple of previous quarters, point one. Point two, the retention and that business has improved it sequentially and quite a bit from 12 months ago. And so at this point, now that we finally lapped the infamous pivot of two years ago, it's really just a function now of sales, right? The retention levels are good. We're not seeing anything unusual in the same-store sales. And lastly, we're not setting that big target to try to get to our overall number in the 9% to 11% number, we're saying, hey, let's look for that thing be low single digit, better than it was this year, but no work beater. So, we're not trying to plan some crazy amount of sales next year, but we do expect sales to be up. So, we're not seeing many of the same things that the other company called those.\nNate Svensson: Got it. That's helpful. And then another question with regard to the 2025 outlook. I think you mentioned a couple of the key assumptions being the net impact of lower interest rates and higher taxes. So, hoping you could drill down into each of those a little more? So, on interest rates, obviously -- lower interest rate impact to interest expense. But I wanted to ask about the impact of flow revenue, particularly within Corporate Payments. I know it's not something you manage the business for probably spend two seconds thinking about it. But it's obviously been a little bit of a tailwind to growth there. year-to-date. So, how should we weigh sort of lower rates versus maybe higher average cash balances that you hold for clients and anything else we could be with aware of regards to lapping float revenue? And then on tax rate, I know there's been a lot of talk about Pillar 2 and the impact facing other companies. So, I just wanted to clarify if you had any impact there. And then beyond Pillar 2, any other things we should keep in mind when thinking about the tax rate next year, whether it's impact the share options and back with the election, et cetera?\nTom Panther: That is one loaded--\nRon Clarke: Hold on Nate, let's write that down and move on.\nTom Panther: Let me try to move through each of those quickly to leave some time for another caller. So first on rates, obviously, we had about $3 billion of our debt that's still rate sensitive. So, as the Fed mood continues to cut off, and they cut today and expectation would be to continue to move down, we will get the benefit of that. So, you can against the $3 billion notional. We pencil that out based on what we're seeing in the rate curve is that rates go down average to average, call it, 70 basis points. With respect to float, it doesn't have an overly material impact in terms of the overall impact -- affect our revenue or to our interest income, depending on where the balances are classified and we a little bit of a headwind. But the numbers that we quoted in terms of the overall guide, take that into account in terms of being able to power through any impact from the flow side. With respect to your question on taxes, we do have some exposure to the global minimum tax as that rounded to 2025, it's not overly material. I think what I would say is that this year, we've commented that our tax rate was benefited from some discrete items, namely the exercise of some stock options just by employees given where the stock price has moved over the course of the year, not necessarily counting on that to always continue. And so I think you can look at the tax rate that's closer to our more recent history versus where we were this year where we benefited from outsized employee exercises.\nNate Svensson: Thanks for the color. I appreciate the [indiscernible].\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.\nDave Koning: Yes, hey guys. Thanks so much. I guess, first of all, the growth is so good in Q4, and then obviously it's good next year, too. But what's in Q4, the 13% that if we look at next year at 10%, that's not totally sustainable. It seem lodging would probably get better next year, not worse. So, what is going to be different in Q4 than the rest of next year?\nRon Clarke: Yes. Hey Dave, it's Ron. So, the comps would be the main thing. So, let me start with just the acceleration from Q3 to Q4, so kind of $6 million to $13 million. So call that, we report $10 million, $29 million, so call it $25 million, $55 million. Sequentially, we've got three businesses that basically will do way better in Q4 than Q3. So, Brazil because it our corporate Payments Business, partly to the synergies of the latest acquisition or big, and that business is still growing fast. And then our gift business, which is a big seasonal business super active in Q4. So, those three businesses will add $25 million, $30 million incremental. So, I'd say our confidence plus peaking in October is pretty high. So, then when you roll the clock to the next thing, some of those things roll off, right, that Brazil and gift are super powerful in the other quarters, they are big quarters Q4. And again, like last year, with the comps, the gifting got pushed out, I think I mentioned into 2024 or 2023. So, it's really just how things line up against the prior period. But as I said, for the 2025 number $9 million to $11 million, we're just taking the problem children going from negative to low single-digits into the plus column. Corporate Payments in Brazil, mid to high and then kind of international, call it, around 10%. So, when you add those things together, our confidence in that number is pretty high for next year.\nTom Panther: And then also one thing to clarify, the 10% midpoint in that range is exclusive of the Paymerang and the GPS acquisition. So, on a print basis, it would be closer to the 13% that we've referenced.\nDave Koning: Got you. Yes, that makes sense. And -- maybe a quick follow-up. Just corporate mix of growth in volume and yield, yield was super strong this quarter, volume decel. Was that just purely the mix of what was happening?\nTom Panther: Yes. That's exactly right. It's just purely a mix story behind that.\nDave Koning: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Ron, and Tom, you guys talked about a pipeline and M&A pipeline. I'm just curious sort of what's in there. I know there's more on the share buyback. But as we think about where you're going to allocate your capital next, I mean, is it M&A more so than buyback given some of the valuations are compressed?\nRon Clarke: Yes. Let me go to the first part of the question, the pipeline. So, I think we said last time, we're focused really on corporate payments, transactions and then the consumer vehicle, things that could help us build bigger volume faster there. So, no shock that the things we're out looking are in that that group. In terms of the split between buybacks and acquisitions, it's always the same, if we have attractive earnings and assets that we can buy create forward growth. That's always our top priority, if the business case turns. And to the extent that -- the stock price rates out of a range that we like, we use liquidity for that. So, I don't think anything materially different in terms of the priority ahead into next year. Although I think the Board did at the last meeting increased the authorization. By another $1 billion. So, we've got liquidity get next year. We've got the authorization, so we'll see where the stock goes.\nSanjay Sakhrani: I guess to follow-up, I know you talked just on that previous question about the acceleration and then the comps and stuff. I guess -- as we think about this acceleration, I mean, you said you peaked into October, it looks good. where is there any risk in the numbers? I mean, it seems like things are progressing quite well. But they're -- you're calling for a pretty decent exception in the fourth quarter. I'm just curious as we look at these, is it just all comps and therefore, you're pretty comfortable because sometimes the comp base isn't more guy there? Just curious.\nRon Clarke: No, it's a good question to say, 13% revenue growth and I think a 21% earnings growth in Q4 is obviously we've arrived. I'd say the biggest risk, we tend to look at the business sequentially would be in that gifting -- last year, we had it in the Q4 number because it's historically been the big quarter. not only to retailers order tons of get cars, but then people activate them like crazy, late in the quarter. So, it's a late game call. And so there's only so much science in that. So, I'd say if we were back on a call in 90 days and we're short in Q4, I would say that would be the most likely answer as to why.\nTom Panther: Sanjay -- what Ron said on the sequential point. So, it's going up $25 million sequentially. We've got -- the gift piece call that [indiscernible]. And then the other pieces are things that we've got a pretty good line of sight into some realization of Paymerang synergies is another piece of that. And then Brazil, given the summer season down there, predict we have high predictability around the sequential increase there from Q3 to Q4. So, I think those give us added confidence that we'll be able to hit the Q4 number.\nRon Clarke: Yes. There are also record numbers, right? There's comps and the growth over the prior year, but it will be record revenue, record earnings, I mean, almost record margins. So, everything I'd say to you guys is pretty positive, separate from having easier comps from last year. Good spot.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Peter Christiansen with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPeter Christiansen: Good evening. Thanks for the question here. Really nice -- impressive results. Tom, question I was asking initiative in the past -- you have to pick the business out of the micro accounts in between that last effort, just trying to see how you're going about the cross-sell differently this time around and what makes you confident that this a more viable opportunity in 2024?\nRon Clarke: Hey Pete, thanks for reminding me -- [indiscernible], but -- it's a super fair question. I think a few things. Every day, we get a little bit smarter. So, the handful of differences this time around is, first and foremost, the targeting I think I've mentioned that before. We were romanced by the numbers instead of by the targets. And so this time, we're much clearer who among our client base makes sense to bring our other products to. It's a smaller group of larger accounts. That will be the first one. The second, I think, is the brand, bringing products back that share the brand. We've moved a bunch of existing clients, let's say, in the fleet card business, to what we call a Corpay One fleet card. So when you go to them with a Corpay Business card or Corpay AP Automation solution, that's that company Zapay, okay? It's the same thing. And then lastly, I think this dedication of sales people that are just doing this. So, it's not a part-time job, but it's kind of what they do and we are marketing people focused on it. So, I think the whole approach to the thing is just better organized and better set up this time around, you get tired running cycles. And so we should have some pretty decent read over the next three to six months, whether this version is going to be way more successful. It should be.\nPeter Christiansen: I appreciate that color. It certainly sounds more encouraging this time around. I did want to ask a little bit about the preview for 2025, super helpful. I appreciate the initial preliminary look there. Just curious on view on margins generally. Obviously, there's going to be a lot of factors that could influence that over the year. But at least from what you're looking at now, do you see that as a component to earnings growth next year? Thank you.\nRon Clarke: Yes, for sure. Again, you get a little bit of noise right from the acquisitions that generally come across as lower margin. But I think the answer is yes. We expect some operating leverage again, role in the next year.\nTom Panther: Pete, you just have the structural advantage of the business where significant amount of fixed cost. And so when you're growing revenue 13% at the midpoint inclusive of acquisitions, you're just going to get positive operating coverage. We've been pleased with the sequential increase of margins quarterly this year, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but like a 51, 52, 54, 55 kind of number. And so I think that -- some of that quarterly variation is seasonal, but exiting at that mid-50s and overall at about 54, for the year, I think, gives us and reason to believe that it will bring paid up next year as well.\nPeter Christiansen: That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you, Tom, thank you, Ron. Great results. Thank you.\nRon Clarke: Thanks Pete. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Rufus Hone with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nRufus Hone: Hey guys. Thanks. Sorry, I joined the call a little late, so hopefully it hasn't been asked. But on Corporate Payments, the gross sales performance looks really strong and you noted 40% growth in cross-border I think about the retention there is slightly better than the Corpay average. So, how are you thinking about the organic growth in that segment heading into 2025 with that kind of sales traction, obviously, moving pieces from the acquisitions, but any thoughts there would be great? Thank you.\nRon Clarke: Yes. Rufus, it's Ron. High-teens is what I say we're looking at, you're right, the sales have been literally record levels now for the last two years, and you write the retention in the business is a bit a bit above -- better, I should say, than our line average. And so when you put that math together, you get back to high teens in revenue. And obviously, as to Tom's point, this operating leverage in that business, it runs off of one system. So you're probably in the mid-20s in terms of EBITDA growth in the business. So, it's been compounding at that level for a couple of years now. And then as you recall, that's an interesting area for us in terms of deals. We're going to add, obviously, an asset that we hope to close at the end of the year that there's synergies in and continue to look in that space for other assets. So, we do have the ability to layer additional transactions in that space on our platform.\nRufus Hone: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Jim Eglseder for closing remarks.\nJim Eglseder: Thanks for interest in guys. I know it's a busy night. So, if you anything else, are you working through your model, feel to should be happy to help. But thank you for getting on the call.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Tom Panther",
            "content": "Thanks Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Here are some additional details related to the quarter. As we announced last week, Q3 revenue was $1.029 billion, which I was pleased to see at the higher end of our guide despite lower fuel prices. Organic revenue grew 6% versus Q3 last year, led by 18% growth in Corporate Payments. Strong expense discipline and another quarter of lower bad debt resulted in EBITDA margin of 54.2%. We generated $355 million of free cash flow, which translates into $5 per share in cash EPS, $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance, up 11%, versus last year and up 14%, excluding the impact of the sale of our Russia business. Overall, our first $1 billion revenue quarter, reflecting the quality and diversification of our business. Now, turning to our segment performance and the underlying drivers of our organic revenue growth. Corporate Payments revenue was up 18%, driven by 7% growth in spend volume and stable card penetration rates. Strength in our direct business, which grew 21% was again led by strong growth in full AP. We closed the Paymerang deal in July, which contributed $14 million of revenue in the quarter and we continue to migrate the business to our platform. Everything is progressing according to plan, and we expect meaningful synergy contributions beginning in the fourth quarter. From an adjusted EPS perspective, we still expect Paymerang to be EPS neutral in Q4. Cross-border revenue was up 21%, led by 40% sales growth. Both new client acquisition and recurring client transaction activity was robust as our scale, technology, and talent advantages continue to power share gains from legacy financial players. Our previously announced acquisition of GPS Capital Markets continues to progress through the approval process, and we expect it to close in early 2025. Turning to vehicle payments. Organic revenue increased 4% during the quarter. Growth was driven by a 7% increase in transactions and higher revenue per transaction which were both broad-based across all businesses and geographies. Organic revenue growth was again driven by Brazil and international fleet, which both grew double-digits. We're beginning to see some progress related to our sales and marketing investment in our local U.S. fleet business. As a reminder, this customer segment services middle market and SMB field services businesses that used vehicles to deliver their goods and services every day. During the quarter, transactions and spend volume on a constant fuel price basis showed signs of accelerating growth. In addition, we're seeing a quarterly trend of improving performance across same-store sales, new sales, and retention. There's more work to be done to increase sales, but it's encouraging to see some initial progress. In the U.K., we continue to expand the PayByPhone parking app into a multi-point consumer vehicle payment app by leveraging our proprietary networks and partnerships to add relevant products and services. In Q2, we launched the ability to acquire car content insurance when parking and added a search function for nearby fuel stations and EV chargers. We've gone live this quarter with 2 additional services. One, our first vehicle maintenance and repair product for the U.K.'s mandatory annual vehicle inspection service. And secondly, EV charging payments, where app users can directly pay for EV charging from their PayByPhone app. We continue to be quite excited about the future prospects from repurposing our B2B networks and payment solutions to a large consumer segment. In Brazil, business performance was again quite strong with revenue growing 18% and sales increasing 22%. Tag growth was 8% and toll-related revenue grew 20%. We continue to see success not just in selling tags, but also selling additional payment solutions. Both insurance policies sold and car debt payment transactions were up over 100% in the quarter. Additionally, card debt app users and revenue were up over 30% compared to last year. These additional products are quite popular and continue to support our cross-sell success. Lodging revenue decreased 5% and improved 5 points sequentially from Q2. Room nights increased 10%, in part due to an improvement in same-store sales as well as storm-related emergency services. The softness in the business appears to have bottomed, and we're expecting the segment to grow slightly in the fourth quarter. Now, looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses of $561 million represent a 7% increase versus Q3 of last year, driven primarily by acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, operating expenses were flat. Bad debt expense declined 3% from last year to $28 million or 5 basis points of spend. So, credit remains controlled. EBITDA margin in the quarter was 54.2%, the slight year-over-year decline was impacted by acquisitions and divestitures over the last 12 months. Normalizing for these transactions, EBITDA margin increased 77 basis points. Our positive operating leverage is driven by solid revenue growth and disciplined expense management, both of which we're quite good at. Interest expense increased $21 million versus Q3 of 2023, due to higher debt balances from acquisitions and share buybacks. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.9% versus 26.6% last year, quite a bit lower as a result of option exercises during the quarter. Now, turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash, and we had $800 million available on our revolver. We have $6.2 billion outstanding on our credit facilities, which includes an additional $500 million of Term Loan B we issued in September at substantially similar terms to the existing credit facility. We used the proceeds to pay down the revolver after our purchase of Paymerang on July 1st. As of September 30th, our leverage ratio was 2.82 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. We also took actions in September to reduce our interest expense by entering into an additional $500 million 3.19% fixed rate swap and re-struck our Canadian dollar to USD cross-currency swap at a more favorable rate. The combination of these transactions is expected to reduce interest expense next year by approximately $7 million. We repurchased 300,000 shares in the quarter for $90 million entirely related to employee stock option exercises. We have over $500 million authorized for share repurchases and the Board recently authorized an additional $1 billion of share repurchases, so we now have over $1.5 billion available for buybacks. We will continue to pursue near-term M&A opportunities, and we'll also buy back shares when it makes sense while maintaining our leverage within our target range. Now, let me provide some additional details related to our outlook. For the full year, we are maintaining our cash EPS guide of $19 per share and slightly lowering our revenue guide to $3.995 billion at the midpoint as a result of unfavorable fuel prices and FX rates. We are not flowing through the third quarter B as most of that $4 million of revenue was driven by the timing of customer transactions near quarter end. For the fourth quarter, we are outlooking 13% revenue growth and 21% earnings growth at the midpoint. We expect revenue growth acceleration across each of our segments in the fourth quarter, driven by new sales, strong retention, and the realization of synergies from the Pairing acquisition. So, all-in-all, quite similar to what we expected in August. For more details regarding our fourth quarter and full year outlook, please refer to our earnings release. Thank you for your interest in Corpay. And now operator, we'd like to open the line for questions. Hey it's Tom. It's a good question. I'd say it's probably about $1 million each for, maybe $1 million above kind of the normalized emergencies we get and maybe $1 million this quarter. That is one loaded-- Let me try to move through each of those quickly to leave some time for another caller. So first on rates, obviously, we had about $3 billion of our debt that's still rate sensitive. So, as the Fed mood continues to cut off, and they cut today and expectation would be to continue to move down, we will get the benefit of that. So, you can against the $3 billion notional. We pencil that out based on what we're seeing in the rate curve is that rates go down average to average, call it, 70 basis points. With respect to float, it doesn't have an overly material impact in terms of the overall impact -- affect our revenue or to our interest income, depending on where the balances are classified and we a little bit of a headwind. But the numbers that we quoted in terms of the overall guide, take that into account in terms of being able to power through any impact from the flow side. With respect to your question on taxes, we do have some exposure to the global minimum tax as that rounded to 2025, it's not overly material. I think what I would say is that this year, we've commented that our tax rate was benefited from some discrete items, namely the exercise of some stock options just by employees given where the stock price has moved over the course of the year, not necessarily counting on that to always continue. And so I think you can look at the tax rate that's closer to our more recent history versus where we were this year where we benefited from outsized employee exercises. And then also one thing to clarify, the 10% midpoint in that range is exclusive of the Paymerang and the GPS acquisition. So, on a print basis, it would be closer to the 13% that we've referenced. Yes. That's exactly right. It's just purely a mix story behind that. Sanjay -- what Ron said on the sequential point. So, it's going up $25 million sequentially. We've got -- the gift piece call that [indiscernible]. And then the other pieces are things that we've got a pretty good line of sight into some realization of Paymerang synergies is another piece of that. And then Brazil, given the summer season down there, predict we have high predictability around the sequential increase there from Q3 to Q4. So, I think those give us added confidence that we'll be able to hit the Q4 number. Pete, you just have the structural advantage of the business where significant amount of fixed cost. And so when you're growing revenue 13% at the midpoint inclusive of acquisitions, you're just going to get positive operating coverage. We've been pleased with the sequential increase of margins quarterly this year, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but like a 51, 52, 54, 55 kind of number. And so I think that -- some of that quarterly variation is seasonal, but exiting at that mid-50s and overall at about 54, for the year, I think, gives us and reason to believe that it will bring paid up next year as well."

            "name": "Ron Clarke",
            "content": "Okay, Jim. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q3 2024 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover three subjects. First, provide my take on Q3 results, share our Q4 guidance along with a 2025 preview. Second, I'll discuss our U.S.A. opportunity. and our recent sales reorganization. And then lastly, I'll provide an update on our M&A activities. Okay. Let me begin with our Q3 results, starting with we surpassed $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the very first time. So, quite a big milestone for us. We reported revenue of $1.29 billion, up 7%, excluding Russia and cash EPS of $5, up 14%, excluding Russia. The result is really in line with our expectations, both revenue and earnings finishing on the high side of our guidance range. EBITDA margins in Q3, 54.2%, that's up about 100 basis points sequentially. Our trends in Q3 really quite good. Same-store sales remained essentially flat, and that's consistent with Q2. Retention improved slightly to a bit above 92% for the quarter. That's a return to record levels. Sales are what we call new bookings growth of 14% and inside of that corporate payment sales growth leading the way with a 28% sales growth in the quarter. And payables spend monetization levels remaining steady sequentially. Organic revenue growth, finishing at 6% overall. Again, strong growth in corporate payments, Brazil and international fleet. And a continued drag for North America fleet in lodging. Although lodging did show signs of improvement in the quarter. So, the wrap on Q3, really, no surprises here, lodging a bit better. North America fleet a bit worse. But more importantly, trends, same-store sales, retention, sales and spend monetization, all stable or improving. So, really a good result. Okay. Let me make the turn to Q4 and full year 2024 guidance. So, we're outlooking a very strong Q4 finish. We're expecting organic revenue growth to accelerate to 13% and an early view of our October revenue flash supports this acceleration. Outlook in EBITDA margins of 55.6%, which should be up about another 140 basis points sequentially. Cash EPS of $5.35 at the midpoint, up 21% and hopeful for Q4 sales growth coming in above 20%. So, really firing on all cylinders. A couple additional positives. We expect lodging revenue growth to turn positive here in Q4 and the infamous Corporate Payments channel segment expected to finally grow again here in Q4. So, both of these things support our overall revenue growth acceleration. So, as I said back in August, our expected arrival to a better place is now Q4. For full year 2024, our staying put with $19 of full year cash EPS at the midpoint. That implies 16% year-over-year EPS growth, excluding Russia. So, really in line with our 15% to 20% midterm earnings growth target. Okay. Let me transition to a 2025 preview, obviously, early days, but we think it's setting up quite well. In terms of organic revenue growth, we're out looking 9% to 11% driven by a recovery of our North America fleet in lodging businesses, both moving into positive territory next year. Corporate Payments in Brazil maintaining mid- to high teens growth rates even our gift business outlooking double-digit growth next year. We do expect an incremental 3% of print revenue growth that's above organic from the combination of the two Corporate Payments acquisitions. Planning our 2025 sales growth around 20% next year. That's driven by the demand for our new products, along with incremental investment in sales coverage. So, taken together, we're targeting 2025 cash EPS at a $22 per share ballpark. Still lots to work through a couple of big assumptions behind the 2025 cash EPS will be FX assumptions, particularly the Brazil real, along with the net impact of lower interest rates offset by higher 2025 tax rates. So, look, net-net, we're outlooking a pretty good 2025 setup. Okay. Let me make the turn to our USA sales opportunity, along with the recent decision to reorganize U.S. sales and a point a new CRO. So, recently, our U.S. sales growth has not been as good as our international sales growth and particularly our North America fleet and lodging solutions. We see the U.S. opportunity for all of our lines to be enormous. Take, for example, our payables business, we've got about a 2% or 3% share of the mid-market. Recall that's a business of about $500 million of annualized revenue. And yet there's a couple hundred thousand prospects to convert and we've got 2% to 3%. So, look, a big opportunity. So, to get at this opportunity more urgently, we've taken the following actions. We've established a consolidated U.S. sales organization with the associated marketing and sales support functions reporting into one new CRO exec. His name is Mike Jeffrey. We've rebranded sections of the vehicle, lodging and payables lines of business to Corpay to leverage the brand and we've established a dedicated cross-sell team that will take each of our solutions back to our existing client base to drive sales. So, lots of energy focus and urgency around selling more here in the U.S. Okay. And finally, I'll move to my last subject, which is an M&A update. So, quite busy in 2024 on the M&A front. Four deals finalized, a couple still in the pipeline. So, first, Paymerang, the AP automation company -- we closed that July 1st. Good news. It's tracking closely to our second half plan and we're seeing significant synergies here in Q4. GPS across border business that we signed up this summer, still on track to close at the end of the year. Through Q3, the business is performing at forecast. So good news there. So, we'll be excited to bring that business across. Taken together these two Corporate Payment deals should contribute about $0.50, of cash EPS accretion in 2025. Third is our Zapay Brazil deal, which is a vehicle car debts company helps drivers pay for registration renewals and tickets. We acquired that business in the spring. It gave us an entry to really a new payments TAM, that is 5 times the size of the toll TAM, so pretty big. And the that Zapay business year-to-date, up 45% in revenue. We've also signed up 90,000 Sem Parar toll users to using the Zapay solutions in the first six months. So, a good start. And lastly, the Comdata Merchant Solutions business, it's a POS solutions business for truck stop merchants, it's being sold to a PE-backed company planning that sale to close by year-end. You might recall this divestiture is tied to the strategic review from last spring and then to simplify the company. We do have a couple of active deals now that we're still working and although relatively small, if we do proceed we will close those early next year. So, look, in conclusion, today, Q3, again, results finishing on the high side of our guidance range stable or improving same-store sales, retention and spend monetization trends, outlooking meaningful revenue growth acceleration here in Q4, along with record earnings. Early take on 2025 good outlook in revenue and earnings growth kind of in line with our stated midterm objectives. And lastly, very pleased with our 2024 M&A activity, the two Corporate Payment acquisitions, tracking and the business really just positioned better overall for faster growth. So, with that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Tom? Yes, Shyam, thanks for the question. Yes, we really don't break the retention down by segment. We've talked generally in terms of how the segments performed relative to the overall line average but Corporate Payments business is much better than the line average in some of the SMB businesses within fleet, vehicle payments are below. I think generally, what we've seen is improving signs of retention on an absolute basis yes, as the mix gets more directed towards those higher retention businesses that are naturally repeat up. But that's going to move at a slow pace, and you haven't seen a dramatic shift in mix just from one quarter to the next. You'd have to look out over a 12-month period before you probably start seeing that have much of an impact. So, I think you can assume or take away the point that the improvement that we saw in retention is just core retention improving within the businesses versus a mix story. Go ahead. Good question. So, I'd say Corporate Payments was rocking in Q3, I think I called it out, it was in the high 20s over the prior year. The NAF business was still a bit soft. I think it was 14 in total. The outlook is kind of low to mid-20s for Q4. So, the full year would be around 20% for the full year in the preliminary plan that we built for 2025 kind of did that to be up against 20% next year. The hope is that we're going to get some leverage from this thing, which is why we did it both on the expense side, right, consolidating some of the back office things so we can have more line people right out with customers. And then also the cross-selling, right? It's cheaper to sell things back to clients we have in terms of the contact rate is much better. So, he's a terrific guy. The guy we put in the job ran about half of the field in pay checks. So, a pretty big group. And so look, I'm super bullish both on the structure, the advantages the structure creates -- and then second, just on the guy just a super duper guy. So with the products that we have, the structure now in that guy, I'm hoping that things are going to do better next year. Yes, I think better, Tien-Tsin, for a couple of reasons. One is that we're outlooking the acceleration right now sitting in this quarter. And I've had a chance to peak in October, right, which supports the port, which is good. So, to sit here today and say, hey, I think organic is going to go from 666 to 13 is the first statement I'd make. And then the second one, I think, is just the mix helps us as we look into next year, I think the confidence is higher because the two problem children and moved to flat or kind of low single-digit and the Corporate Payments in Brazil that are super good mid- to high teens or bigger share side of the business. So, I think the mix, the ratio to get back the line averages better. So, I think it's a business you can plan when we go into next year, we've got 90% of the revenue engine next year. Whatever is 20 years of stats now on retention, same-store sales, I mean, you guys are good at math. So, that helps us basically frame what the revenue is going to be. Hey Nate, it's Ron. So on the first one, the same-store sales, we're seeing nothing. So, again, the thing is basically flat sequential and again, it's improved from the couple of previous quarters, point one. Point two, the retention and that business has improved it sequentially and quite a bit from 12 months ago. And so at this point, now that we finally lapped the infamous pivot of two years ago, it's really just a function now of sales, right? The retention levels are good. We're not seeing anything unusual in the same-store sales. And lastly, we're not setting that big target to try to get to our overall number in the 9% to 11% number, we're saying, hey, let's look for that thing be low single digit, better than it was this year, but no work beater. So, we're not trying to plan some crazy amount of sales next year, but we do expect sales to be up. So, we're not seeing many of the same things that the other company called those. Hold on Nate, let's write that down and move on. Yes. Hey Dave, it's Ron. So, the comps would be the main thing. So, let me start with just the acceleration from Q3 to Q4, so kind of $6 million to $13 million. So call that, we report $10 million, $29 million, so call it $25 million, $55 million. Sequentially, we've got three businesses that basically will do way better in Q4 than Q3. So, Brazil because it our corporate Payments Business, partly to the synergies of the latest acquisition or big, and that business is still growing fast. And then our gift business, which is a big seasonal business super active in Q4. So, those three businesses will add $25 million, $30 million incremental. So, I'd say our confidence plus peaking in October is pretty high. So, then when you roll the clock to the next thing, some of those things roll off, right, that Brazil and gift are super powerful in the other quarters, they are big quarters Q4. And again, like last year, with the comps, the gifting got pushed out, I think I mentioned into 2024 or 2023. So, it's really just how things line up against the prior period. But as I said, for the 2025 number $9 million to $11 million, we're just taking the problem children going from negative to low single-digits into the plus column. Corporate Payments in Brazil, mid to high and then kind of international, call it, around 10%. So, when you add those things together, our confidence in that number is pretty high for next year. Yes. Let me go to the first part of the question, the pipeline. So, I think we said last time, we're focused really on corporate payments, transactions and then the consumer vehicle, things that could help us build bigger volume faster there. So, no shock that the things we're out looking are in that that group. In terms of the split between buybacks and acquisitions, it's always the same, if we have attractive earnings and assets that we can buy create forward growth. That's always our top priority, if the business case turns. And to the extent that -- the stock price rates out of a range that we like, we use liquidity for that. So, I don't think anything materially different in terms of the priority ahead into next year. Although I think the Board did at the last meeting increased the authorization. By another $1 billion. So, we've got liquidity get next year. We've got the authorization, so we'll see where the stock goes. No, it's a good question to say, 13% revenue growth and I think a 21% earnings growth in Q4 is obviously we've arrived. I'd say the biggest risk, we tend to look at the business sequentially would be in that gifting -- last year, we had it in the Q4 number because it's historically been the big quarter. not only to retailers order tons of get cars, but then people activate them like crazy, late in the quarter. So, it's a late game call. And so there's only so much science in that. So, I'd say if we were back on a call in 90 days and we're short in Q4, I would say that would be the most likely answer as to why. Yes. There are also record numbers, right? There's comps and the growth over the prior year, but it will be record revenue, record earnings, I mean, almost record margins. So, everything I'd say to you guys is pretty positive, separate from having easier comps from last year. Good spot. Hey Pete, thanks for reminding me -- [indiscernible], but -- it's a super fair question. I think a few things. Every day, we get a little bit smarter. So, the handful of differences this time around is, first and foremost, the targeting I think I've mentioned that before. We were romanced by the numbers instead of by the targets. And so this time, we're much clearer who among our client base makes sense to bring our other products to. It's a smaller group of larger accounts. That will be the first one. The second, I think, is the brand, bringing products back that share the brand. We've moved a bunch of existing clients, let's say, in the fleet card business, to what we call a Corpay One fleet card. So when you go to them with a Corpay Business card or Corpay AP Automation solution, that's that company Zapay, okay? It's the same thing. And then lastly, I think this dedication of sales people that are just doing this. So, it's not a part-time job, but it's kind of what they do and we are marketing people focused on it. So, I think the whole approach to the thing is just better organized and better set up this time around, you get tired running cycles. And so we should have some pretty decent read over the next three to six months, whether this version is going to be way more successful. It should be. Yes, for sure. Again, you get a little bit of noise right from the acquisitions that generally come across as lower margin. But I think the answer is yes. We expect some operating leverage again, role in the next year. Thanks Pete. Appreciate it. Yes. Rufus, it's Ron. High-teens is what I say we're looking at, you're right, the sales have been literally record levels now for the last two years, and you write the retention in the business is a bit a bit above -- better, I should say, than our line average. And so when you put that math together, you get back to high teens in revenue. And obviously, as to Tom's point, this operating leverage in that business, it runs off of one system. So you're probably in the mid-20s in terms of EBITDA growth in the business. So, it's been compounding at that level for a couple of years now. And then as you recall, that's an interesting area for us in terms of deals. We're going to add, obviously, an asset that we hope to close at the end of the year that there's synergies in and continue to look in that space for other assets. So, we do have the ability to layer additional transactions in that space on our platform."

        "content": "Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to today's Corpay First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jim Eglseder. Please go ahead, Sir.\nJim Eglseder: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO, and Tom Panther, our CFO. Following the prepared comments, the operator will announce that the queue will open for the Q&A session. Today's documents, including our earnings release and supplement, can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website as corpay.com. Throughout this call, we will be covering organic growth. As a reminder, this metric neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and spreads, and it also includes pro forma results for acquisitions and divestitures or scope changes closed during the two years being compared. We will also be covering other non-GAAP financial metrics, including revenues, net income and net income per diluted share, all on an adjusted basis. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than at other companies. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP information can be found in today's press release and on our website. It's important to understand that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today, and all statements about our outlook, new products and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We undertake no obligations to update any of these statements. These expected results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on form 8-k and in our annual report on 10-K. These documents are available on our website and at SEC.gov. With that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron?\nRon Clarke: Okay Jim, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q1 2024 earnings call, our first as Corpay, the corporate payments company. So upfront here, I'll plan to cover three subjects. First, provide my take on Q1 results and share our updated 2024 guidance. Second, I'll cover conclusions from our recent three-year strategy offsite, regarding the way forward for the company, and then lastly, I'll highlight a couple developments since we last spoke. Okay, let me begin with our Q1 results, which finished really right in line with our expectations. We reported revenue of $935 million. That's up 8% excluding Russia and cash EPS of $410 million. That's up 14% excluding Russia. Overall, organic revenue growth 6% for the quarter, although against a pretty tough comp. Pleased with our corporate payments business, revenue growth there up 17% overall, but up 21% if you exclude the channel partners. Trends in Q1 quite good; retention, overall retention remains stable at 91%. Sales or new bookings up 11% year-over-year and same-store sales soft negative 2% for the quarter, driven primarily by lodging, although same-store sales did improve one point sequentially from minus three to minus two this quarter. For sure we're dealing with a couple problem children here in Q1, our North America vehicle business, as you'll recall, making the pivot away from low quality micro accounts to SMB accounts. We are increasing the sales ramp there with incremental digital and a new kind of upmarket field sales channel to drive the pivot, but taking a bit longer than expected, but I do want to say we are for sure making progress. Our workforce lodging business continuing to experience continued softness. That's from a combo of macro weakness and a couple of areas there, along with issues in converting to a new IT system. Fortunately, we've now converted the majority of the client base across to the new IT system, and we've introduced a brand new employee-friendly solution we call Choice, hoping these enhancements will harden the base. Good news, the early look at April volume in lodging does suggest that the softness is stabilizing. We're outlooking both the North America vehicle business and the workforce lodging business to return to positive organic growth in Q4. So look in summary for the quarter, no real surprises and numbers coming in really on expectation. All right, let me make the turn to our updated 2024 full year guidance. Really two major differences today in our outlook for the year versus 90 days ago. So first, FX has moved against us and interest rates look to be holding higher for longer. So both of these macro factors, unfortunately will depress our print rest of year. Additionally, as I said, we're expecting our lodging client softness to hang around longer, thereby reducing our full year lodging revenue forecast. On the good news front, we do have greater visibility now around our high performing businesses, corporate payments, international vehicle and Brazil, and their ability to over deliver rest of year. So as a result of these updated assumptions, we're reducing our full year 2024 revenue guide at the midpoint from $4.80 billion to $4 billion. So down $80 million. That consists of $40 million of lower FX translation and then second $40 million of incremental lodging revenue softness. We're also reducing full year '24 cash EPS at the midpoint from $19.40 to $19. This is 100% the result of the macro. We do plan to absorb the profit impact from the $40 million launching revenue divot through a combination of expense reductions, currency swaps and some tax planning. So despite the bit softer full year outlook, we're still expecting a very strong Q4 exit, with organic revenue there well above 10% and cash EPS above $5. Okay, moving on, let me shift gears and share some of our conclusions from our recent midterm strategy offsite. That's where we lay out plans for the next three years. So first off, in terms of objectives, we aspire to be a top quartile growth company within the S&P 500. We're committed to 10%-plus organic revenue growth and 15% plus earnings growth and that's a pretty small club. Second, deeper, not wider, we've concluded to go deeper in each of our three core segments, vehicle, corporate payments and lodging, and not to expand into new segments, at least for now. Our research across the three core segments confirms that we've got plenty of TAM and plenty of sales expansion opportunity in each major business, such that we can achieve our growth objectives without going wider. Third, in terms of acquisition strategy, our focus will be on corporate payments and consumer vehicle businesses, I think pay by phone. We're going to focus on wheelhouse or accretive deals rather than capability deals that we've executed recently and then lastly, from the offsite, in each of our major businesses, we plan to sell what we call a flagship product most of the time, so that more and more of our scale will be built on a single product in each line of business and then over time, we'd convert existing clients off of other products onto the flagship product. This will result in a narrower set of SKUs over time. So look, we believe that this more focused way forward will result in a much easier company to manage and grow. Okay, lastly, let me make the turn to talk about two recent developments. First, our brand and ticker change. We did make our overall company brand change to Corpay, the corporate payments company, in March, at the same time changing the ticker symbol to CPAY. We are planning to use the Corpay brand as a go-to-market brand, here in the US. We already go to market as Corpay in our corporate payments business. We've now launched the Corpay1 universal fleet card and business card in our vehicle payment segment and we're soon to relaunch CLC as Corpay Lodging. So in this case, we'll have one single Corpay go to market brand across payables, lodging and vehicle. So sure to help us on the cross selling front. Second, acquisitions; we've been pretty active on the acquisition front. We did announce earlier this year that we closed the majority investment in Zapay. That's a vehicle payments business in Brazil with three million monthly active users. You might recall the idea there is to add Zapay's vehicle registration renewals and payments of vehicle tickets or fines to our overall Brazil consumer vehicle bundle. The business is doing great. Zapay revenue grew over 50% in Q1. We did announce earlier today signing Paymerang. That's a full AP corporate payments company, runs about $50 million in annual revenue. We like the deal. It'll strengthen our corporate payments AP automation business and four new verticals. We're expecting the deal to close here in Q2, pending regulatory approval and expected to be accretive to both revenue growth and EPS growth next year. We see lots of synergies to chase. Okay, so in conclusion, Q1 out of the blocks, kind of, kind of per our expectations. Rest of your outlook? Unfortunately, a bit of a mixed bag, now expecting unfavorable macro and lodging softness for longer offset by strong performance in corporate payments, international vehicle and Brazil. We have refined our three year growth plan. It calls for a narrower, simpler company that we can manage and compound. That's got plenty of growth potential. So we like the way forward. Finally, we're excited about these latest acquisitions; Zapay and Paymerang, along with the active pipeline in front of us. We expect these wheelhouse deals to be accretive to 2025 revenue and earnings growth. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Tom to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Tom?\nTom Panther: Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Here are some additional details related to the quarter. Overall results were in line with our expectations. Print revenue was $935 million, which was consistent with our guide, despite a $7 million macro headwind from both fuel and FX. Organic revenue growth was 6% as 17% growth in corporate payments was partially offset by softness in lodging. Reported revenue growth was 4%, but if you exclude the impact from the sale of our Russia business, revenue growth was 8%. Strong expense discipline and another quarter of lower bad debt, produced positive operating leverage. Combined with a lower tax rate, we delivered $4.10 per share in cash EPS, $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance, up 8% versus last year and excluding the impact from the sale of our Russia business, cash EPs increased 14%. Now, turning to our segment performance and the underlying drivers of our revenue growth, corporate payments revenue increased 17% during the quarter, within which our direct business grew 27%. Our direct business exhibited strong underlying performance with solid growth across spend volume transactions and customers. In addition, higher revenue per transaction rates further contributed to the revenue growth. Cross border revenue increased 18% and sales grew 25%, despite the low FX volatility during the quarter. Client acquisition and spend volume activity was robust as nearly every geography was up double digits, with particular strength in Asia Pac. We continue to make significant investments in this business through increased sales and marketing resources. Turning to vehicle payments, organic revenue grew 4% during the quarter with the increase driven by Brazil and international fleet. Our international fleet business continues to perform very well, led by double digit revenue growth in Europe, Australia and our maintenance business. In the UK, the soft economy impacted volumes in specific industry sectors, but we're confident that will rebound as economic growth resumes, given our strong market position, which includes 75% of the UK's top 200 fleet companies. During the quarter, we continued to build on our market-leading position in EV with customer accounts nearly doubling, which includes our three in one charge pass product and home charging sales. We're also excited to report that the charge pass product won the innovation in EV Technology Award at the 2024 Great British Fleet Awards, a prestigious and longstanding event across the automotive and fleet community. Our EV success is further reinforced with over 40% of the top 200 fleet companies using our charge pass product. Related to our expansion into the UK consumer vehicles market, we are making progress developing the integrations between our proprietary fuel, EV and vehicle networks, into the pay by phone app. We expect this functionality to be in place by the third quarter of this year. In Brazil, business performance was extremely strong, led by tag growth of 9%, now totalling over seven million tag users. Our B2C extended network revenue was double compared to Q1 of 2023 and now over 30% of total revenue is non-toll. Also, sales growth continued to be strong across the tag and insurance products. In March, we closed on the majority investment of Zapay, which has over three million customers that use the Zapay solution to pay for vehicle registration and compliance fees. The addition of Zapay further advances our consumer vehicle payment strategy in Brazil and allows us to capitalize on the attractive two way cross sell opportunity. We are now beginning to cross sell Zapay solutions to our existing seven million drivers and conversely cross selling our existing suite of vehicle payment products to Zapay's client base. In the US, the impact from our shift away from microclimates continues to impact our sales and revenue results. Our upmarket digital and field sales efforts are improving as we continue to see growth in applications, approvals and starts. As we mentioned last quarter, the shift to higher credit quality clients has impacted late fees, which were down $8 million compared to Q1 of 2023. However, we've seen a $15 million reduction in bad debt expense, yielding a positive earnings trade. Lodging revenue was down 9% against 26% organic growth in Q1 2023, so a pretty tough comp. Recall that last year we had significant high weather driven distressed passenger volume and insurance claims. We continue to see softness in the base, particularly related to smaller field services companies that are deploying fewer workers as a result of the uncertain macro environment. We've recently completed some IT enhancements that will strengthen our value proposition to both existing and new customers, which translated into 16% growth in Q1 sales compared to a year ago. Now, looking further down the income statement, our Q1 operating expenses of $538 million were up 2% versus Q1 of last year. Expense growth from acquisitions and sales investments were offset by lower bad debt expense and the sale of our Russia business. Bad debt expense declined $14 million, or 35% from last year to $25 million, or five basis points of total spend. Substantially all of the decline was in US vehicle payments as we realized the benefit from our lower exposure to US micro clients. EBITDA margin in the quarter was 51.6%, a 53 basis point improvement from the first quarter of last year. The positive operating leverage was driven by solid revenue growth, lower bad debt expense and disciplined expense management. Excluding our Russia business sold in 2023, EBITDA margin increased approximately 160 basis points. Interest expense for the quarter increased $9 million year-over-year due to decline in interest income from the sale of our Russia business and the impact of higher interest rates which were partially offset by lower debt balances. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.7% versus 27.1% last year. The lower tax rate was primarily driven from tax benefits from the exercises of stock options. Now turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash and we had nearly $1.5 billion available. On our revolver. We have $5.4 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and we had $1.4 billion borrowed under our securitization facility. As of the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 2.4 x trailing 12 month EBITDA, which is at the lower end of our target range. Our strong liquidity and debt capacity, coupled with our ability to generate over $300 million in quarterly free cash flow, positions us well to actively deploy capital during the year. We have ample capacity to support M&A as well as to continue to buy back our stock. Related to our $800 million buyback program, we announced in February, to date, we've repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares for $700 million. We view $800 million as the floor, not a ceiling, and will continue to evaluate additional buybacks over the course of the year. In addition to Ron's comments regarding guidance, let me provide some additional detail on our full year guidance and some thoughts on our Q2 outlook. For the economic outlook, we are not assuming either a recession or meaningful economic improvement in overall business activity across our markets. We have updated our macro forecast to reflect the latest fuel, FX and interest rate projections. The fuel related macro assumptions are essentially unchanged. However, the higher for longer expectation related interest rates that gained traction in April caused the US dollar to significantly strengthen and the forward curve to increase approximately 90 basis points as of yearend. The impact from FX is approximately a $40 million reduction in revenue and higher interest rates resulting result in an additional $14 million of interest expense. Additionally, we are lowering our revenue guidance $40 million due to the softness in lodging. However, we are executing specific actions to reduce expenses that offset this reduction in revenue, so that it doesn't flow through to earnings. In the supplement, we outline the impact of these changes in the macro and operating performance, to revenue, EBITDA and adjusted EPS. In summary, for the full year, we now expect GAAP revenue growth of 5% to 7% and organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%. EBITDA growth of 7% to 9% as well, with margin expanding 100 basis points and adjusted net income per diluted share growth of 11% to 13%. Excluding the impact from the sale of our Russia business, we're expecting cash EPS growth of 15% to 17%. I'll underscore that these estimates exclude the impact from our pending acquisition of Paymerang. For Q2, we're expecting revenue to grow 1% to 3% on a GAAP basis and 4% to 6% organically and cash EPS to grow 6% to 8%. Excluding the impact of the sale of our Russia business, we're expecting Q2 cash EPS to grow 12% to 14%. This reflects roughly $13 million of expected revenue, macro headwinds from FX and $3 million of additional interest expense versus the outlook we provided in February. Looking forward into the second half of the year, we anticipate revenue and adjusted net income growth to accelerate as we realized the benefits from the implementation of new sales, improved retention in US vehicle payments, and specific business initiatives. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement. Thank you for interest in Corpay and now, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang, JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Good afternoon, Ron and Tom. I just wanted to ask on the lodging maybe to start with that. I don't think I fully caught some of it was macro and there was an IT cutover, maybe that drove some attrition, but it didn't look like the retention was off either. So I just want to get a little bit more detail and what we might expect in the next two to three quarters before it turns positive again in the fourth.\nRon Clarke: Hey, Tien-Tsin, it's Ron. You mostly got it right. So basically last year we put in an upgraded IT system, kind of the foundation, but waited till this first quarter to try to convert. So it created a few bumps and created a divot with kind of a set of clients, kind of softness with a set of clients. But fortunately from watching it, it hasn't gotten any wider. I think we stuck a page Tom in the document. Page 16 Tien-Tsin in the supplement basically shows the softness is still sitting there in Q1 that we reported but hot off the press in April. It's kind of stabilized. Kind of the business is flattening and so the hope that we have is as we lap the dividend here in Q1 and Q3, that basically again, the retention is good and the new sales are good. Sales actually were up, what, 16% in Q1, that will be on the other side of it. So hopefully it's a blip with a select set of clients that we can get to the other side on.\nTien-Tsin Huang: I see. Okay, so you're basically -- you're rebasing off of the set of clients coming off and you're seeing growth from that. Okay, I think I get it. Thanks for the slide. I missed it. On the Paymerang acquisition, what stood out about this one, Ron? Was it the verticals? Something around the tech specifically? I'm curious what drew you to it.\nRon Clarke: Yeah, The first thing Tien-Tsin is it's the kind of business we like. So inside of corporate payments, our favorite piece of business is what we call full AP, where we take literally 100% of the clients invoices, no matter how we pay them. So we like that the most because it gives us the most control. We have the best retention with it. Clients like it the most. So that's the first one. But yes, the appeal to us that you pick up three or four verticals that we're not in, we have no referenceable clients; one, two vendors that are kind of in those verticals, or three, like ERPs or other partners. So you pick up the, whatever, the 10 years or 15 years that company's been building those up, suddenly we're set up now to go bigger in those spots. And then lastly, obviously, because it's so super adjacent to what we do, the synergies are, as you'd expect, quite significant, really super meaningful to us. So, yes, with the things kind of we get through the first few months here, the model we have is it'll be quite accretive in '25.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Ron, could you talk about the North America vehicle business? It sounded like it's performing a little bit weaker than you'd like. Are you guys expecting that to inflect as we move through the year and so what's going to drive that?\nRon Clarke: Yeah. Hey, Sanjay, it's a good question. So I think the story is a little bit old now of whatever. A year and a half ago, we made the pivot. We flushed whatever 40,000 micro accounts that gave us revenue and late fees, but also a ton of bad debt. So as we work that through both, stopping new micro accounts coming in and then second tamping down on terms and credit lines in the first half last year, we were successful in exiting a lot of that business. And so now we have a cleaner business with a steadier kind of 80,000, call it bigger clients that have a steadier latency mix, volume mix, lots of characteristics and stuff and so we're lapping kind of that prior period. So now it's really just the addition of some of the new products there and the new sales snowballing enough to kind of build off of the base and so like every pivot or change in the business, it's gone a bit slower than I would hope, but internally, I've got that thing well into the positive as we exit the year. So as we lap the thing and we head into the back half, into Q4. So I would say that structurally, you get retention benefit. Whenever you have a base and you flush super micro accounts, a lot of them become insolvent. You have a lot of involuntary attrition. So we'll get structural improvement both in base hardness and in retention. So really it's just waiting a couple of these new sales channels to layer on and we like back where we'll be. That's the basic outlook. So a little painful getting here, but we like the way forward.\nTom Panther: Sanjay, just a couple of proof points on that. In the first quarter, we actually saw sales growth up 12%. So that was improved from what we saw on a quarterly basis last year. We've also seen approval rates back to 2021 levels. So we've been doing some things on credit side tuning our models and approval rates are back to where we were prior to the pivot into the digital channel. And on late fees, we've actually seen those bottom out and start to slightly rebound. So I think there's line of sight into the things that caused the drag over the last three or four quarters to be lapping and normalizing.\nRon Clarke: Sanjay just on Tom's comment, the approval rate is up about 50% from September. So we track it monthly. So all the stuff that comes to us. So we're pointing marketing, if you will, at higher quality prospects or better applications now that we can approve. So that makes it an easier business to run.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay, great. And just a follow up question on Paymerang, I understand it's sort of full AP automation, but how does it fit into what you have right now? And how long have you guys been looking at this business? And then just final one, Tom, like, are you including the revenues associated with the acquisition? I know, Ron, you mentioned it's probably not going to be accretive until next year, but maybe you could just talk about that too. Thank you.\nRon Clarke: So let me try to take the order of those questions. So how long? I guess we've known the business for a few years, have visited and stuff. And so I've reached out to the principal directly, make this transaction. Second question, is it included? No, we signed, but we haven't closed. So basically when we close, which we expect to be, certainly this quarter, when we talk again in 90 days, we'll roll that in. So call it $25 million to $30 million incremental, assuming we close in the next couple of months. And how it fits is, again, we're in the exact same business. We do exactly the same thing, but we generally do it for different kinds of companies and different verticals and as people pointed out, there's a bit of a breeder react. So once you get into a vertical, your brand becomes known. You have clients in the area, you pay the vendors of those clients. You have ERP and other kinds of partners and so the thing works in a way, basically, where you can build a business better via verticals than you can geographically. So although we do exactly the same things, we don't do those things in those verticals. So effectively we will. We'll use, obviously, a lot of our back office and some of our advantaged contracts and stuff like that and some of our sales techniques to kind of basically build up the business that they have in those verticals and get, obviously a bunch of synergies along the way. So it's a super attractive. It's what we call a wheelhouse deal. We know it super cold. We studied the company well and we're super clear on what we're going to do with.\nTom Panther: It's right in our sweet spot where we're getting both customers, 1,300 customers, and expanding our merchant portfolio by 250,000 merchants. So we've talked a lot about customers and networks as our two competitive moats out there and this is right in that spot where we gain those things with this acquisition and then, as Ron said, we can germinate it from here into something bigger.\nSanjay Sakhrani: I'm sorry, they won't make money until next year. Or do they make money now?\nTom Panther: Yeah, they make money now, but we need them to make a lot more money.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El Assal with Barclays.\nRamsey El Assal: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question this evening. I wanted to ask again about lodging and just maybe ask you to comment on your visibility in that business right now. April. It was great to see April stabilize. Do you feel like the recovery in lodging is kind of pretty much locked in at this point, or are there still variables that you're having to worry about to kind of get from point A to point B there?\nRon Clarke: Yeah. Hey, Ramsey, it's Ron. It's a good question. So I think locked in is a pretty, pretty strong word. What I'd say is what we can see that's super clear is what caused the divot and the D cell, which is softness. So yet we've got 15,000 clients or something in that business, and a select group of clients went soft on us starting Q2, Q3 last year and so the good news is, other than that select group that went soft, the others didn't. So the other clients didn't go soft, and neither did the retention, did we have any kind of big spike in retention. So, effectively, kind of, once we lapped this select group of clients that went soft, the key to the thing reaccelerating again, is just sales. It's a high retention business generally and so as long as the sales that we have in the plan come to fruition and we get those implemented, then we'll grow basically over that lap base. So, again, a little bit of your seeing of that is we started to catch it a little bit here in April. So we think really the turn in the business would be Q3, where if we said, hey, what's the softest? I think it was still 10%, 11%, 12% in Q1, and we had 2% as a company overall. My estimate would be by Q3, that thing would be close to zero. So the softness would be, if you will, client base would be relatively flat. So, and again, the good news is there's no more IT boogieman. We spent a year and a half, two years building the thing. We converted the base. It's a new great feature, so the product is actually better. So we're going to get the benefits this year forward of the pain, effectively, that we inflicted last year. So that's a positive, that there was some benefit, basically, in the journey on IT.\nTom Panther: And, Ramsey, what I'd add is we've kind of taken this beyond the analytics. We've actually got a very structured campaign where we're calling those customers, talking to them, giving them the value proposition of the improvements that we've made, understanding why they maybe are using us less. We're gaining really good insights into that. So I would agree. Not locked in, but we've taken this beyond the math and are really doing this at a customer level, which has given us a lot of additional insights over the last month or so. That's perfect.\nRamsey El Assal: Thanks. And a quick follow up from me. I noticed that the stock repurchases seem to accelerate in the last 30 days, meaning you did more repurchases in the last month than you did in the entire first quarter. Should we expect you to kind of lean more aggressively into buybacks when it comes to capital deployment. Not entirely a fair question, because you're also announcing deals that you're doing. So I'm just curious if you can comment on the balance there and what we should expect.\nTom Panther: Yeah, I'll random Tom. And so I think it's kind of comparing a little bit of an apple and an orange there, because in the first quarter was really just the month of March was when we got started in terms of the buybacks. We waited until we got our K filed and started the buybacks. You're really only seeing one month in the month of March and then basically, obviously the month of April. So they're fairly evenly split across that 700 in terms of how that played out in the period. We did a 10b5-1 plan so that we could continue to be in the market during the blackout period. So nothing there other than just timing. We were pretty much evenly in the market over those 60 days, if you will and as I said in my prepared remarks, I think we're at around the $700 million marks to touch under it, and we'll finish up the $800 million we would expect in the month of May. And we still have ample liquidity, notwithstanding the Paymerang acquisition. As we sit here today, we've got over a $1 billion on the revolver outstanding and we have additional liquidity should we want to be in the market above the $800 million. And as we also look at our business, there could be other sources of capital that we're able to create over the course of the year as well that give us additional liquidity if there's some non-core assets that we end up divesting of if that played out.\nRon Clarke: Hey, Ramsey, it's Ron. So I did mention at the top that we have a pipeline. So we're working on some additional transactions. So my answer on top of Tom's would be, I would expect us to do to both of those things, likely buy more companies this year, and depending on where our stock price is, buy back more stock. And so between the liquidity that we have the leverage ratio and then we're getting close on a couple of divestitures, that gets us capital. We feel we got, obviously plenty of liquidity to do both of those things rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nate Svensson with Deutsche bank.\nNate Svensson: Hey, guys, thanks for the question. Maybe kind of following up on that repurchase question, can you talk a little bit more about the corporate actions you're taking to offset that softness that you're seeing in lodging. So I guess specifically, what are you doing to lower OpEx? And then related to the repurchase question, I think on one of the slides you've talked about increasing repurchases. So how does that tie in versus the $800 million plan and what was incorporated into guide previously? And I guess the follow up is how much of these actions have already been completed, and is there any risk in executing these that may weigh out results as we move through the year?\nTom Panther: Yes, sure. I think it's a range of options. That's one of the things that's good about the company and the way it's structured and the levers we have do a variety of things related to the OpEx side that is just kind of just good old fashioned belt tightening. We'll look at some things, maybe some projects that we could delay, some t and e that we could avoid, things like that that are more, I would say, structural. We don't want to do anything to infringe upon the go forward power of the company from a sales and marketing perspective. So I think that's fairly sacred ground. But there are always some things that we can do to adjust on some fixed costs that come out. Plus there will be some natural variable costs that come out as well below the EBITDA line. There's some things that we've already executed related to some cross currency swaps that allows us to essentially convert a portion of our debt. We've already done a euro denominated, we've done a sterling and a canadian. So that causes our debt to be about 25% converted to foreign, which is still low relative to how you think about the overall company. And then we've had in the queue for a while just a variety of tax planning ideas that we would have executed with or without the softness and lodging, but those are coming together at a fortuitous time where that can also offset from an earnings perspective. So I would say there's good line of sight into those company actions, the no Hail Marys in there, and now it's just about executing, which I think we've got some pretty good demonstrated performance of being able to execute and deliver on those.\nRon Clarke: But no additional stock repurchases are in that recovery. So we said, hey, 1940 was our, was our guide. Hey, 19, because of the effects and the interest rates. Hey, we'll get the $0.40 backstage at 19. That doesn't assume any incremental buybacks above the 800, which we may do depending on the stock price.\nNate Svensson: Got it. That's helpful. Color. And I guess from my follow up, Ron, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned for a positive for the full year that you had greater visibility into some of your high performing businesses? So I guess namely corporate payments international vehicle in Brazil. So maybe you can talk about what you're seeing across those businesses. What gives you that confidence into the greater visibility. And then maybe growth expectations across each of those three for the full year?\nRon Clarke: Yes. I mean, always, Nate, when you lay out a plan and the businesses volume rate revenue is tracking and the initiatives that you've laid out are tracking. And so, for example, in corporate payments, I don't know how many times we've mentioned it over the last couple of years as channel partners. Oh shit. The growth is wherever we said, hey, it's 17% at the print, but 21 without channel partners. And I think we went on record really in the last call last year and said, hey, that thing's turning. We've kind of renewed some stuff with some existing partners and signed some new ones. So instead of that thing declining, it's going to actually turn and start increasing. And so we have those contracts signed and we're starting to put some of that volume through. So that'd be like an example of sitting here now on the other side of that I can see. And another big partner, we signed up there too in the last 45 days. So that would be an example of things that actually happened that are in the rear view that will create that acceleration of the rest of the year. In Brazil. I'd say it's just the power of the distribution. We have ten ways to sell tags and fuel and parking and insurance there and they're just rocking the bank channel thing we launched a couple of years ago with Santander and Kasia. They're selling a pile like 1015 percent of all of our new tags. Now coming through that brand new channel, the cross sell is working. I think we've sold a million insurance policies. We bought this app pay thing, which is super unique, to add, obviously this demand, it grew at 50% in the quarter. So the things that we plan in the businesses to make the businesses go, we're seeing real evidence in this first, whatever, four months that that stuff's working. And the materials that we need to get the forward numbers are clear. Obviously there's less months less. So I just say that they're beating the plan we put together for the first four months. And the progress suggests to me that they'll beat the plan, the remaining eight.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Kennedy with William Blair.\nChris Kennedy: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Ron, you talked about narrowing the focus of the business. You also alluded to some potential divestitures. Can you just kind of frame what you're thinking about the relative size of the, these initiatives?\nRon Clarke: Chris, are you asking first about the size of the divestitures? The size of the divestitures. And then you also talked about narrowing the focus of the business. So just, I'm trying to get how big of a narrow the focus of the business are you thinking here? How material is that? Yes. Let me start with the second part of the question and then go back to the more important first part. So, yeah, we, as part of the strategic review, we identified a couple of kind of smallish column in the $200 million to 300 million dollar range, kind of market price for the assets. One in our vehicle business, really both in and around our vehicle business. And so we're well along on those things with counterparties. So with those transactions, I said before, we'll have a simpler company and will redeploy that capital. But on the more important question, I think we spent the last year studying the company and said the most important thing to create value in the company was the fleet transformation and the redefinition of our fleet business to be a broader vehicle business right across the US, Brazil and Europe, and then even adding the consumer leg right to that business. And so those three segments, vehicle, corporate payments and lodging, are where we're headed. There's obviously plenty and plenty of tam and coverage for us to go get. We have new products in all three of them. And so the conclusion from all of us going through the thing is, let's just double down there. We did all this friggin Humpty Dumpty work the last five years to assemble this company in these segments, buying stuff, stitching it, fixing it. So we finally have, I think, super advantaged products in these segments. And so we're really in the marketing and sales phase. Right. Just basically sell more stuff in these three areas. And the reason I like it is it's just an easier company to manage. There's less kind of, call it Humpty Dumpty, figure it out, work, connect stuff, work. It's more kind of just basic sell stuff and then add related stuff, like the pay merang thing or, the Zappa thing, add stuff that's in the three segments. So we're going to be on that course for a while, just chasing to grow these three segments and maybe making acquisitions in those three segments.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citigroup.\nPeter Christiansen: Thank you. Good evening. Thanks for the question, Ron. I think I certainly appreciate the deeper versus wider approach, product homogenization, all that. Just curious, as you're looking out the next three years, are you considering making any changes to, like the margin versus growth kind of trade off that algorithm? Do you see opportunities there to kind of invest more and maybe spur growth a bit, a bit harder?\nTom Panther: Yes. Hey, Pete, it's a good question. I think you probably have heard a bit of the answer. I like that. Right. As an idea, even if it trims, if you will, margins for a while, if you could see the return. But I think I said this to you repeatedly, we're into profitable growth and so the incremental marketing and sales investment has to be productive. I don't want to spend another $50 million and it doesn't produce anything. And so, as with people, these things take some time to build and so you're better off. Let's say you're spending Ron Clarke $300 million last year to spend $300 million , $350 million and $400 million , $450 million over the next three years, rather than, hey, watch me go from $300 million to $400 million to $500 million. You'll have a lot more waste in those bigger steps, way more newbie people, way less productivity, and obviously you'll eat more profits. And so I say with that balance in mind, if we saw things, particularly around the digital front, where we could spend more that was productive, we would do that and probably take some costs out of other places. But look, it's working. We're selling enough of the businesses we have. We're planning to be up 20% again. I think we finished what guys at 20% last year in sales. And so if we can keep compounding sales at 20% and kind of growing marketing and sales investment, that's all we need, Pete, to compound the top at 10, 20 minus 10% retention. Sorry, attrition is 10% growth. And so that's really the model. Just stay on that. Make productive sales, keep profits growing at the same time.\nPeter Christiansen: Thanks, I appreciate that. And then on the Paymarang deal, talking about revenue synergies, obviously scaling it versus core pay's infrastructure is, is an obvious opportunity there. I'm just curious if you believe there's any cross selling opportunities here on the synergy side, perhaps layering those new verticals versus other product categories that you may be selling?\nTom Panther: Yes, for sure. I mean, I think I did mention there's both revenue synergies and, to your point, obvious cost synergies. So one, for example, which we do in all these transactions, is Tom mentioned the merchant network. So that company has 250,000 merchants. We have about a million. And each of us pay some amount of those merchant network with virtual cards. So as part of the diligence, we run an overlap where each of us could find merchants that we have that the other guy is paying with a virtual card that we're not, and vice versa. So obviously, we're going to go right back and try to put each guy's respective merchants, if you will, on virtual card. That creates lift. They have contracts with banks and processes that are six times as expensive as us because of their scale. That's all contra revenue. So for a dollar of spend, we bring way more of it to the revenue line, for example, than they do. And then there's the whole card business. All they have, basically, is full ap. Right. They help companies with what we call invoice automation, fix the process and the workflow, and then payment automation or outsourcing, pay all the bills. Well, we have, as a big card business. Walk around cards, business cards, fuel cards, even standalone virtual cards that they don't have because they're not in the card business. They're not an issuer, they're not a processor. And so clearly, we've looked at that as well, us bringing, putting some of our sales guys against their base to sell our cars. So, Yes, there's not only clear paw synergy, there's a bunch of revenue synergies. So we expect to think it's already growing, I don't know, 20% or 30% on its own. It's a great business. It's super duper good people, which I want to call out as an asset, too. You can't run companies without people. So when you add our super adjacent capabilities, we think the thing will perform really well.\nPeter Christiansen: That's super helpful. Thank you. Sounds very interesting.\nRon Clarke: Thank you. And there's not many of them, Pete. The other thing is, they're scarce. Right. There's only a handful, really, that we're aware of any kind of sizable people that do what we call full AP in the middle market, really of any size. And obviously we know them all.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Trevor Williams with Jefferies.\nTrevor Williams: Great, thanks. I want to go back to fleet and just how you guys are thinking about the shape of the year. I think the prior guide for vehicle had assumed fleet would get back to back up to the high single digits or so by the end of the year. Just if that still holds and the level of visibility you have into the acceleration on your mentioning late fees, retention, anything there would be helpful. Thanks\nRon Clarke: Trev, it's Ron again. So you called it right. So if you took our vehicle business and you looked at our internal documents of how we build into the end of the second half, you're right. Show the vehicle business in total exiting in the high single digits both in Q3 and in Q4. So again, part of that is the lapping of the pivot. North America and the other two businesses that are sitting inside vehicle are performing fine and well and compounding. And so that's the view that we'd go from kind of low mid single digits for vehicle to high single digits as we exit the year.\nTrevor Williams: Okay, got it. And then on corporate payments, Tom, I think you called out higher rev per transaction being a tailwind on the direct piece. Should we think going forward on top of the new sales growth? That's kind of how we've been oriented to think about growth in the business. That pricing could maybe be a bigger lever for growth across both direct and cross border. Thanks.\nRon Clarke: Yes, Trevor, I went over emphasize the pricey beat. Obviously we always look to price competitively. I think what you're seeing in our trend line of rev per trend is just a mix variance there in terms of where channel was a bigger portion of first quarter of last year. You also see that in our spend numbers where they were dominating spend numbers kind of diluted the overall year over year, but sequentially you see 10% growth. That also translated into the take rate. So I think what you see is a run rate take rate is pretty good. We'll look for opportunities to optimize on any kind of pricing or monetization strategies, but it's more of a mix when you're looking in the rear view mirror than it is some kind of over pricing strategy that we've deployed. That's true also within cross border, I know we focus a lot on payables, but the cross border business as well as the mix of that business has also been toward products where we earn more. We're doing more sophisticated type FX transactions on behalf of our customers, and because of that we're getting paid. And so that too is factoring into that overall trend and the shift in mix from kind of the basic stuff, commoditized kind of stuff, to the more specialized, sophisticated stuff that we're bringing our customers.\nTom Panther: Hey, Trevor, let me make sure you guys get clear on this price thing and how we can be, can be advanced. Let's say simplistically that we're managing spend for you and there's 250 basis points of interchange and we agree to split the thing. I'll give you a rebate of 125 basis points and I'll keep 125, as keep for me, for revenue. For me, the pitch to get more price isn't just the split of the 250, it's how much of your spend I can get on virtual card. So if you spend a million dollars a month and I can get 20% on and someone else can only get ten, I don't necessarily have to meet the 125 basis point rebate because I'm going to return you way more absolute money. So we're able to capture effectively a better price, a better keep price than banks, which are, I'd say the main competition, because of our merchant network and tech, allows us to in people, we get way more of the client spend on card programs, thus generating a bigger pool, and so we can effectively keep more money than other people and still have better value to the client. So I just want to pick up on Tom's comment that although it's not kind of pure price, it does result in a price advantage for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Fossett with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Fossett: Thank you very much. Delved into a lot of different topics. I want to just quickly, I guess, in the interest of completeness, go back to the EV. And you provided some interesting comments there and certainly appreciate the detail on the UK EV economics, but I'm just wondering if you can unpack what's driving the increased penetration of EV carts relative to fuel cards. I mean, this is as simple on an incremental basis as mixed fleet is growing and share more broadly, or is there something else going on there?\nRon Clarke: Yes. Hey, James, it's Ron. So the exhibits in the supplement again, I think what we're trying to say there is of a sample of whatever 300 or 400 clients that we've had for some period of time. The chart shows that they're incrementally adding EV relative to combustion. Right. So the percentage of total vehicles among that pool of clients is becoming more EV. I think the main point we're trying to say is that because we do not only, on the road, but also at home with a super high attach rate, we can actually get more revenue per vehicle, per EV vehicle than we can from old fashioned combustion vehicles. So that's the point we're really trying to make to everybody is, oh, woe is me. When the world goes to more EV, fleet or Corpe will be hurt by it. We're trying to make the point that, no, no, no clients are willing to pay for this mixed solution we have and on the road and at home, and even as they grow to a higher and higher share of EV vehicles to total, we keep getting paid more, not less. That's really what we're trying to show you there. It's really just a share of wallet. We're keeping, obviously, the ice, the ice business, the fuel. But as they evolve their fleet to EV, we're getting that business as well. So it's incremental business for us.\nJames Fossett: That's great. I appreciate that. And then I just wanted to. To get one last point here. I think you've broken down kind of the growth expectations for corporate payments and talked about pricing and some of those things. I just want to make sure I understand. Are we close to channel drag being over and that stopping, being kind of a headwind, or how should we think about the timing of that? What does channel drag mean? Channel or channel partners?\nRon Clarke: Oh, the channel partners, Yes. So again, yes is the short answer. I'd say for sure by Q three. And then again, the thing, point to point, the channel itself is actually higher, I think, when we get to Q three and Q four. So, yes, I'd say maybe the quarter we're sitting in is the last time. Hopefully we'll have to talk about this. And again, I said it earlier, our confidence. My confidence is high in it because the stuff that's forward is literally contracted. So we just have to make sure we implement it.\nOperator: Thanks so much. Our next question comes from Daniel Krebs with Wolfe Research. Hi, this is Daniel on Verdairn.\nDaniel Krebs: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to unpack some of the drivers of fleet transaction growth down 12% year-over-year. Is this also primarily driven by the loss of the micro fleets?\nTom Panther: It seems like maybe a bigger impact than we would have expected. I think you're looking at the print there, and that would be Russia, where we would have Russia in the prior year. I think if you look at the organic is probably where we reference the pro forma macro adjusted is a better indication. You see transactions up 7% and then we kind of break that down based on some of the different types of transactions that now flow through the whole vehicle payment segment.\nDaniel Krebs: Okay, got it. So that won't be an issue then moving forward then maybe as a follow up on corpay, could you speak to the performance across the FX versus the full AP business? Any material delta between the two in terms of revenue or volume growth there? Thank you.\nRon Clarke: Yes. Hey, Krebs, its Ron. No, they're kind of the same. They're both growing high teens to 20%. So not a big difference. Across border business is a bit bigger. Call it. I know 30% bigger won't be quite as big after we get close this pay merang, but no, they're quite similar. The one thing I will point out between the two businesses, just to remind everybody, is the cross border business has a massive tam because we originate customers in five geographies. So only about a quarter of that business is Us origination. The other 75% of it is know Canada, UK, Europe, Australia. And so you've got way number of companies and prospects to basically fish in the pond in that business because they sit in lots of geographies.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird.\nDavid Koning: Yes. Hey guys. Thank you. And I guess one follow up on just the channel drag question. Are we still going to see for a couple more quarters kind of flattish corporate payment volume? We're going to keep seeing that. And then by Q4, it reaccelerates when you hit the easier comp. Is that a fair way to think about that?\nRon Clarke: It is, yes. Because the channel, remember, is lots of spend at no rate and the direct is obviously less spend at a decent rate. What you just said is right. Once the channel gets cleaned up effectively and is on its own, is higher than the prior period, that will wash away. Yes. And you accelerated corporate, which was great, even with the transaction decelerating.\nDavid Koning: So that was good. My follow up quick share count was flat sequentially, despite big, big buybacks in Q1. Was that just timing in March? So we'll see a lot more in Q2?\nTom Panther: Yes. David, a little bit of that is also the stock price. So when stock price goes up, there's more dilution on the options and restricted stock. That's outstanding. So that kind of counterbalances some of the actions that were taken on the buyback front. So there's a little bit of a headwind when it comes to that. But with the buybacks, as you said, back end loaded to Q1 and then active in the first month of Q2, there'll be a bigger benefit when we print Q2.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Rufus Hone with BMO Capital Markets.\nRufus Hone: Hey, guys, thanks for the question.Just wanted to ask on the same store sales, and I. I know you mentioned it's improved a percentage point sequentially to minus two this quarter. I guess. What's the path and the timeline for getting that back to flat? Is that a two Q goal or more like something around year end? Thanks.\nTom Panther: Yes, I would say it's probably closer to year end. A lot of it turns again on this lodging thing, which I mentioned was called ten or 11%. And the big period there is q three. The other one I think I did call out, or if I didn't the last time, the UK as an economy has been a bit soft in the last year, and so that would be the other dragger. I'd say the rest of them are improving. So I think part of our plan would be the minus three, the minus two that that thing gets back to close to flat by Q4.",

            "name": "Tom Panther",
            "content": "Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Here are some additional details related to the quarter. Overall results were in line with our expectations. Print revenue was $935 million, which was consistent with our guide, despite a $7 million macro headwind from both fuel and FX. Organic revenue growth was 6% as 17% growth in corporate payments was partially offset by softness in lodging. Reported revenue growth was 4%, but if you exclude the impact from the sale of our Russia business, revenue growth was 8%. Strong expense discipline and another quarter of lower bad debt, produced positive operating leverage. Combined with a lower tax rate, we delivered $4.10 per share in cash EPS, $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance, up 8% versus last year and excluding the impact from the sale of our Russia business, cash EPs increased 14%. Now, turning to our segment performance and the underlying drivers of our revenue growth, corporate payments revenue increased 17% during the quarter, within which our direct business grew 27%. Our direct business exhibited strong underlying performance with solid growth across spend volume transactions and customers. In addition, higher revenue per transaction rates further contributed to the revenue growth. Cross border revenue increased 18% and sales grew 25%, despite the low FX volatility during the quarter. Client acquisition and spend volume activity was robust as nearly every geography was up double digits, with particular strength in Asia Pac. We continue to make significant investments in this business through increased sales and marketing resources. Turning to vehicle payments, organic revenue grew 4% during the quarter with the increase driven by Brazil and international fleet. Our international fleet business continues to perform very well, led by double digit revenue growth in Europe, Australia and our maintenance business. In the UK, the soft economy impacted volumes in specific industry sectors, but we're confident that will rebound as economic growth resumes, given our strong market position, which includes 75% of the UK's top 200 fleet companies. During the quarter, we continued to build on our market-leading position in EV with customer accounts nearly doubling, which includes our three in one charge pass product and home charging sales. We're also excited to report that the charge pass product won the innovation in EV Technology Award at the 2024 Great British Fleet Awards, a prestigious and longstanding event across the automotive and fleet community. Our EV success is further reinforced with over 40% of the top 200 fleet companies using our charge pass product. Related to our expansion into the UK consumer vehicles market, we are making progress developing the integrations between our proprietary fuel, EV and vehicle networks, into the pay by phone app. We expect this functionality to be in place by the third quarter of this year. In Brazil, business performance was extremely strong, led by tag growth of 9%, now totalling over seven million tag users. Our B2C extended network revenue was double compared to Q1 of 2023 and now over 30% of total revenue is non-toll. Also, sales growth continued to be strong across the tag and insurance products. In March, we closed on the majority investment of Zapay, which has over three million customers that use the Zapay solution to pay for vehicle registration and compliance fees. The addition of Zapay further advances our consumer vehicle payment strategy in Brazil and allows us to capitalize on the attractive two way cross sell opportunity. We are now beginning to cross sell Zapay solutions to our existing seven million drivers and conversely cross selling our existing suite of vehicle payment products to Zapay's client base. In the US, the impact from our shift away from microclimates continues to impact our sales and revenue results. Our upmarket digital and field sales efforts are improving as we continue to see growth in applications, approvals and starts. As we mentioned last quarter, the shift to higher credit quality clients has impacted late fees, which were down $8 million compared to Q1 of 2023. However, we've seen a $15 million reduction in bad debt expense, yielding a positive earnings trade. Lodging revenue was down 9% against 26% organic growth in Q1 2023, so a pretty tough comp. Recall that last year we had significant high weather driven distressed passenger volume and insurance claims. We continue to see softness in the base, particularly related to smaller field services companies that are deploying fewer workers as a result of the uncertain macro environment. We've recently completed some IT enhancements that will strengthen our value proposition to both existing and new customers, which translated into 16% growth in Q1 sales compared to a year ago. Now, looking further down the income statement, our Q1 operating expenses of $538 million were up 2% versus Q1 of last year. Expense growth from acquisitions and sales investments were offset by lower bad debt expense and the sale of our Russia business. Bad debt expense declined $14 million, or 35% from last year to $25 million, or five basis points of total spend. Substantially all of the decline was in US vehicle payments as we realized the benefit from our lower exposure to US micro clients. EBITDA margin in the quarter was 51.6%, a 53 basis point improvement from the first quarter of last year. The positive operating leverage was driven by solid revenue growth, lower bad debt expense and disciplined expense management. Excluding our Russia business sold in 2023, EBITDA margin increased approximately 160 basis points. Interest expense for the quarter increased $9 million year-over-year due to decline in interest income from the sale of our Russia business and the impact of higher interest rates which were partially offset by lower debt balances. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.7% versus 27.1% last year. The lower tax rate was primarily driven from tax benefits from the exercises of stock options. Now turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash and we had nearly $1.5 billion available. On our revolver. We have $5.4 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and we had $1.4 billion borrowed under our securitization facility. As of the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 2.4 x trailing 12 month EBITDA, which is at the lower end of our target range. Our strong liquidity and debt capacity, coupled with our ability to generate over $300 million in quarterly free cash flow, positions us well to actively deploy capital during the year. We have ample capacity to support M&A as well as to continue to buy back our stock. Related to our $800 million buyback program, we announced in February, to date, we've repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares for $700 million. We view $800 million as the floor, not a ceiling, and will continue to evaluate additional buybacks over the course of the year. In addition to Ron's comments regarding guidance, let me provide some additional detail on our full year guidance and some thoughts on our Q2 outlook. For the economic outlook, we are not assuming either a recession or meaningful economic improvement in overall business activity across our markets. We have updated our macro forecast to reflect the latest fuel, FX and interest rate projections. The fuel related macro assumptions are essentially unchanged. However, the higher for longer expectation related interest rates that gained traction in April caused the US dollar to significantly strengthen and the forward curve to increase approximately 90 basis points as of yearend. The impact from FX is approximately a $40 million reduction in revenue and higher interest rates resulting result in an additional $14 million of interest expense. Additionally, we are lowering our revenue guidance $40 million due to the softness in lodging. However, we are executing specific actions to reduce expenses that offset this reduction in revenue, so that it doesn't flow through to earnings. In the supplement, we outline the impact of these changes in the macro and operating performance, to revenue, EBITDA and adjusted EPS. In summary, for the full year, we now expect GAAP revenue growth of 5% to 7% and organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%. EBITDA growth of 7% to 9% as well, with margin expanding 100 basis points and adjusted net income per diluted share growth of 11% to 13%. Excluding the impact from the sale of our Russia business, we're expecting cash EPS growth of 15% to 17%. I'll underscore that these estimates exclude the impact from our pending acquisition of Paymerang. For Q2, we're expecting revenue to grow 1% to 3% on a GAAP basis and 4% to 6% organically and cash EPS to grow 6% to 8%. Excluding the impact of the sale of our Russia business, we're expecting Q2 cash EPS to grow 12% to 14%. This reflects roughly $13 million of expected revenue, macro headwinds from FX and $3 million of additional interest expense versus the outlook we provided in February. Looking forward into the second half of the year, we anticipate revenue and adjusted net income growth to accelerate as we realized the benefits from the implementation of new sales, improved retention in US vehicle payments, and specific business initiatives. The rest of our assumptions can be found in our press release and supplement. Thank you for interest in Corpay and now, operator, please open the line for questions. Sanjay, just a couple of proof points on that. In the first quarter, we actually saw sales growth up 12%. So that was improved from what we saw on a quarterly basis last year. We've also seen approval rates back to 2021 levels. So we've been doing some things on credit side tuning our models and approval rates are back to where we were prior to the pivot into the digital channel. And on late fees, we've actually seen those bottom out and start to slightly rebound. So I think there's line of sight into the things that caused the drag over the last three or four quarters to be lapping and normalizing. It's right in our sweet spot where we're getting both customers, 1,300 customers, and expanding our merchant portfolio by 250,000 merchants. So we've talked a lot about customers and networks as our two competitive moats out there and this is right in that spot where we gain those things with this acquisition and then, as Ron said, we can germinate it from here into something bigger. Yeah, they make money now, but we need them to make a lot more money. And, Ramsey, what I'd add is we've kind of taken this beyond the analytics. We've actually got a very structured campaign where we're calling those customers, talking to them, giving them the value proposition of the improvements that we've made, understanding why they maybe are using us less. We're gaining really good insights into that. So I would agree. Not locked in, but we've taken this beyond the math and are really doing this at a customer level, which has given us a lot of additional insights over the last month or so. That's perfect. Yeah, I'll random Tom. And so I think it's kind of comparing a little bit of an apple and an orange there, because in the first quarter was really just the month of March was when we got started in terms of the buybacks. We waited until we got our K filed and started the buybacks. You're really only seeing one month in the month of March and then basically, obviously the month of April. So they're fairly evenly split across that 700 in terms of how that played out in the period. We did a 10b5-1 plan so that we could continue to be in the market during the blackout period. So nothing there other than just timing. We were pretty much evenly in the market over those 60 days, if you will and as I said in my prepared remarks, I think we're at around the $700 million marks to touch under it, and we'll finish up the $800 million we would expect in the month of May. And we still have ample liquidity, notwithstanding the Paymerang acquisition. As we sit here today, we've got over a $1 billion on the revolver outstanding and we have additional liquidity should we want to be in the market above the $800 million. And as we also look at our business, there could be other sources of capital that we're able to create over the course of the year as well that give us additional liquidity if there's some non-core assets that we end up divesting of if that played out. Yes, sure. I think it's a range of options. That's one of the things that's good about the company and the way it's structured and the levers we have do a variety of things related to the OpEx side that is just kind of just good old fashioned belt tightening. We'll look at some things, maybe some projects that we could delay, some t and e that we could avoid, things like that that are more, I would say, structural. We don't want to do anything to infringe upon the go forward power of the company from a sales and marketing perspective. So I think that's fairly sacred ground. But there are always some things that we can do to adjust on some fixed costs that come out. Plus there will be some natural variable costs that come out as well below the EBITDA line. There's some things that we've already executed related to some cross currency swaps that allows us to essentially convert a portion of our debt. We've already done a euro denominated, we've done a sterling and a canadian. So that causes our debt to be about 25% converted to foreign, which is still low relative to how you think about the overall company. And then we've had in the queue for a while just a variety of tax planning ideas that we would have executed with or without the softness and lodging, but those are coming together at a fortuitous time where that can also offset from an earnings perspective. So I would say there's good line of sight into those company actions, the no Hail Marys in there, and now it's just about executing, which I think we've got some pretty good demonstrated performance of being able to execute and deliver on those. Yes. Hey, Pete, it's a good question. I think you probably have heard a bit of the answer. I like that. Right. As an idea, even if it trims, if you will, margins for a while, if you could see the return. But I think I said this to you repeatedly, we're into profitable growth and so the incremental marketing and sales investment has to be productive. I don't want to spend another $50 million and it doesn't produce anything. And so, as with people, these things take some time to build and so you're better off. Let's say you're spending Ron Clarke $300 million last year to spend $300 million , $350 million and $400 million , $450 million over the next three years, rather than, hey, watch me go from $300 million to $400 million to $500 million. You'll have a lot more waste in those bigger steps, way more newbie people, way less productivity, and obviously you'll eat more profits. And so I say with that balance in mind, if we saw things, particularly around the digital front, where we could spend more that was productive, we would do that and probably take some costs out of other places. But look, it's working. We're selling enough of the businesses we have. We're planning to be up 20% again. I think we finished what guys at 20% last year in sales. And so if we can keep compounding sales at 20% and kind of growing marketing and sales investment, that's all we need, Pete, to compound the top at 10, 20 minus 10% retention. Sorry, attrition is 10% growth. And so that's really the model. Just stay on that. Make productive sales, keep profits growing at the same time. Yes, for sure. I mean, I think I did mention there's both revenue synergies and, to your point, obvious cost synergies. So one, for example, which we do in all these transactions, is Tom mentioned the merchant network. So that company has 250,000 merchants. We have about a million. And each of us pay some amount of those merchant network with virtual cards. So as part of the diligence, we run an overlap where each of us could find merchants that we have that the other guy is paying with a virtual card that we're not, and vice versa. So obviously, we're going to go right back and try to put each guy's respective merchants, if you will, on virtual card. That creates lift. They have contracts with banks and processes that are six times as expensive as us because of their scale. That's all contra revenue. So for a dollar of spend, we bring way more of it to the revenue line, for example, than they do. And then there's the whole card business. All they have, basically, is full ap. Right. They help companies with what we call invoice automation, fix the process and the workflow, and then payment automation or outsourcing, pay all the bills. Well, we have, as a big card business. Walk around cards, business cards, fuel cards, even standalone virtual cards that they don't have because they're not in the card business. They're not an issuer, they're not a processor. And so clearly, we've looked at that as well, us bringing, putting some of our sales guys against their base to sell our cars. So, Yes, there's not only clear paw synergy, there's a bunch of revenue synergies. So we expect to think it's already growing, I don't know, 20% or 30% on its own. It's a great business. It's super duper good people, which I want to call out as an asset, too. You can't run companies without people. So when you add our super adjacent capabilities, we think the thing will perform really well. Hey, Trevor, let me make sure you guys get clear on this price thing and how we can be, can be advanced. Let's say simplistically that we're managing spend for you and there's 250 basis points of interchange and we agree to split the thing. I'll give you a rebate of 125 basis points and I'll keep 125, as keep for me, for revenue. For me, the pitch to get more price isn't just the split of the 250, it's how much of your spend I can get on virtual card. So if you spend a million dollars a month and I can get 20% on and someone else can only get ten, I don't necessarily have to meet the 125 basis point rebate because I'm going to return you way more absolute money. So we're able to capture effectively a better price, a better keep price than banks, which are, I'd say the main competition, because of our merchant network and tech, allows us to in people, we get way more of the client spend on card programs, thus generating a bigger pool, and so we can effectively keep more money than other people and still have better value to the client. So I just want to pick up on Tom's comment that although it's not kind of pure price, it does result in a price advantage for us. It seems like maybe a bigger impact than we would have expected. I think you're looking at the print there, and that would be Russia, where we would have Russia in the prior year. I think if you look at the organic is probably where we reference the pro forma macro adjusted is a better indication. You see transactions up 7% and then we kind of break that down based on some of the different types of transactions that now flow through the whole vehicle payment segment. Yes. David, a little bit of that is also the stock price. So when stock price goes up, there's more dilution on the options and restricted stock. That's outstanding. So that kind of counterbalances some of the actions that were taken on the buyback front. So there's a little bit of a headwind when it comes to that. But with the buybacks, as you said, back end loaded to Q1 and then active in the first month of Q2, there'll be a bigger benefit when we print Q2. Yes, I would say it's probably closer to year end. A lot of it turns again on this lodging thing, which I mentioned was called ten or 11%. And the big period there is q three. The other one I think I did call out, or if I didn't the last time, the UK as an economy has been a bit soft in the last year, and so that would be the other dragger. I'd say the rest of them are improving. So I think part of our plan would be the minus three, the minus two that that thing gets back to close to flat by Q4."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ron Clarke",
            "content": "Okay Jim, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q1 2024 earnings call, our first as Corpay, the corporate payments company. So upfront here, I'll plan to cover three subjects. First, provide my take on Q1 results and share our updated 2024 guidance. Second, I'll cover conclusions from our recent three-year strategy offsite, regarding the way forward for the company, and then lastly, I'll highlight a couple developments since we last spoke. Okay, let me begin with our Q1 results, which finished really right in line with our expectations. We reported revenue of $935 million. That's up 8% excluding Russia and cash EPS of $410 million. That's up 14% excluding Russia. Overall, organic revenue growth 6% for the quarter, although against a pretty tough comp. Pleased with our corporate payments business, revenue growth there up 17% overall, but up 21% if you exclude the channel partners. Trends in Q1 quite good; retention, overall retention remains stable at 91%. Sales or new bookings up 11% year-over-year and same-store sales soft negative 2% for the quarter, driven primarily by lodging, although same-store sales did improve one point sequentially from minus three to minus two this quarter. For sure we're dealing with a couple problem children here in Q1, our North America vehicle business, as you'll recall, making the pivot away from low quality micro accounts to SMB accounts. We are increasing the sales ramp there with incremental digital and a new kind of upmarket field sales channel to drive the pivot, but taking a bit longer than expected, but I do want to say we are for sure making progress. Our workforce lodging business continuing to experience continued softness. That's from a combo of macro weakness and a couple of areas there, along with issues in converting to a new IT system. Fortunately, we've now converted the majority of the client base across to the new IT system, and we've introduced a brand new employee-friendly solution we call Choice, hoping these enhancements will harden the base. Good news, the early look at April volume in lodging does suggest that the softness is stabilizing. We're outlooking both the North America vehicle business and the workforce lodging business to return to positive organic growth in Q4. So look in summary for the quarter, no real surprises and numbers coming in really on expectation. All right, let me make the turn to our updated 2024 full year guidance. Really two major differences today in our outlook for the year versus 90 days ago. So first, FX has moved against us and interest rates look to be holding higher for longer. So both of these macro factors, unfortunately will depress our print rest of year. Additionally, as I said, we're expecting our lodging client softness to hang around longer, thereby reducing our full year lodging revenue forecast. On the good news front, we do have greater visibility now around our high performing businesses, corporate payments, international vehicle and Brazil, and their ability to over deliver rest of year. So as a result of these updated assumptions, we're reducing our full year 2024 revenue guide at the midpoint from $4.80 billion to $4 billion. So down $80 million. That consists of $40 million of lower FX translation and then second $40 million of incremental lodging revenue softness. We're also reducing full year '24 cash EPS at the midpoint from $19.40 to $19. This is 100% the result of the macro. We do plan to absorb the profit impact from the $40 million launching revenue divot through a combination of expense reductions, currency swaps and some tax planning. So despite the bit softer full year outlook, we're still expecting a very strong Q4 exit, with organic revenue there well above 10% and cash EPS above $5. Okay, moving on, let me shift gears and share some of our conclusions from our recent midterm strategy offsite. That's where we lay out plans for the next three years. So first off, in terms of objectives, we aspire to be a top quartile growth company within the S&P 500. We're committed to 10%-plus organic revenue growth and 15% plus earnings growth and that's a pretty small club. Second, deeper, not wider, we've concluded to go deeper in each of our three core segments, vehicle, corporate payments and lodging, and not to expand into new segments, at least for now. Our research across the three core segments confirms that we've got plenty of TAM and plenty of sales expansion opportunity in each major business, such that we can achieve our growth objectives without going wider. Third, in terms of acquisition strategy, our focus will be on corporate payments and consumer vehicle businesses, I think pay by phone. We're going to focus on wheelhouse or accretive deals rather than capability deals that we've executed recently and then lastly, from the offsite, in each of our major businesses, we plan to sell what we call a flagship product most of the time, so that more and more of our scale will be built on a single product in each line of business and then over time, we'd convert existing clients off of other products onto the flagship product. This will result in a narrower set of SKUs over time. So look, we believe that this more focused way forward will result in a much easier company to manage and grow. Okay, lastly, let me make the turn to talk about two recent developments. First, our brand and ticker change. We did make our overall company brand change to Corpay, the corporate payments company, in March, at the same time changing the ticker symbol to CPAY. We are planning to use the Corpay brand as a go-to-market brand, here in the US. We already go to market as Corpay in our corporate payments business. We've now launched the Corpay1 universal fleet card and business card in our vehicle payment segment and we're soon to relaunch CLC as Corpay Lodging. So in this case, we'll have one single Corpay go to market brand across payables, lodging and vehicle. So sure to help us on the cross selling front. Second, acquisitions; we've been pretty active on the acquisition front. We did announce earlier this year that we closed the majority investment in Zapay. That's a vehicle payments business in Brazil with three million monthly active users. You might recall the idea there is to add Zapay's vehicle registration renewals and payments of vehicle tickets or fines to our overall Brazil consumer vehicle bundle. The business is doing great. Zapay revenue grew over 50% in Q1. We did announce earlier today signing Paymerang. That's a full AP corporate payments company, runs about $50 million in annual revenue. We like the deal. It'll strengthen our corporate payments AP automation business and four new verticals. We're expecting the deal to close here in Q2, pending regulatory approval and expected to be accretive to both revenue growth and EPS growth next year. We see lots of synergies to chase. Okay, so in conclusion, Q1 out of the blocks, kind of, kind of per our expectations. Rest of your outlook? Unfortunately, a bit of a mixed bag, now expecting unfavorable macro and lodging softness for longer offset by strong performance in corporate payments, international vehicle and Brazil. We have refined our three year growth plan. It calls for a narrower, simpler company that we can manage and compound. That's got plenty of growth potential. So we like the way forward. Finally, we're excited about these latest acquisitions; Zapay and Paymerang, along with the active pipeline in front of us. We expect these wheelhouse deals to be accretive to 2025 revenue and earnings growth. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Tom to provide some additional detail on the quarter. Tom? Hey, Tien-Tsin, it's Ron. You mostly got it right. So basically last year we put in an upgraded IT system, kind of the foundation, but waited till this first quarter to try to convert. So it created a few bumps and created a divot with kind of a set of clients, kind of softness with a set of clients. But fortunately from watching it, it hasn't gotten any wider. I think we stuck a page Tom in the document. Page 16 Tien-Tsin in the supplement basically shows the softness is still sitting there in Q1 that we reported but hot off the press in April. It's kind of stabilized. Kind of the business is flattening and so the hope that we have is as we lap the dividend here in Q1 and Q3, that basically again, the retention is good and the new sales are good. Sales actually were up, what, 16% in Q1, that will be on the other side of it. So hopefully it's a blip with a select set of clients that we can get to the other side on. Yeah, The first thing Tien-Tsin is it's the kind of business we like. So inside of corporate payments, our favorite piece of business is what we call full AP, where we take literally 100% of the clients invoices, no matter how we pay them. So we like that the most because it gives us the most control. We have the best retention with it. Clients like it the most. So that's the first one. But yes, the appeal to us that you pick up three or four verticals that we're not in, we have no referenceable clients; one, two vendors that are kind of in those verticals, or three, like ERPs or other partners. So you pick up the, whatever, the 10 years or 15 years that company's been building those up, suddenly we're set up now to go bigger in those spots. And then lastly, obviously, because it's so super adjacent to what we do, the synergies are, as you'd expect, quite significant, really super meaningful to us. So, yes, with the things kind of we get through the first few months here, the model we have is it'll be quite accretive in '25. Yeah. Hey, Sanjay, it's a good question. So I think the story is a little bit old now of whatever. A year and a half ago, we made the pivot. We flushed whatever 40,000 micro accounts that gave us revenue and late fees, but also a ton of bad debt. So as we work that through both, stopping new micro accounts coming in and then second tamping down on terms and credit lines in the first half last year, we were successful in exiting a lot of that business. And so now we have a cleaner business with a steadier kind of 80,000, call it bigger clients that have a steadier latency mix, volume mix, lots of characteristics and stuff and so we're lapping kind of that prior period. So now it's really just the addition of some of the new products there and the new sales snowballing enough to kind of build off of the base and so like every pivot or change in the business, it's gone a bit slower than I would hope, but internally, I've got that thing well into the positive as we exit the year. So as we lap the thing and we head into the back half, into Q4. So I would say that structurally, you get retention benefit. Whenever you have a base and you flush super micro accounts, a lot of them become insolvent. You have a lot of involuntary attrition. So we'll get structural improvement both in base hardness and in retention. So really it's just waiting a couple of these new sales channels to layer on and we like back where we'll be. That's the basic outlook. So a little painful getting here, but we like the way forward. Sanjay just on Tom's comment, the approval rate is up about 50% from September. So we track it monthly. So all the stuff that comes to us. So we're pointing marketing, if you will, at higher quality prospects or better applications now that we can approve. So that makes it an easier business to run. So let me try to take the order of those questions. So how long? I guess we've known the business for a few years, have visited and stuff. And so I've reached out to the principal directly, make this transaction. Second question, is it included? No, we signed, but we haven't closed. So basically when we close, which we expect to be, certainly this quarter, when we talk again in 90 days, we'll roll that in. So call it $25 million to $30 million incremental, assuming we close in the next couple of months. And how it fits is, again, we're in the exact same business. We do exactly the same thing, but we generally do it for different kinds of companies and different verticals and as people pointed out, there's a bit of a breeder react. So once you get into a vertical, your brand becomes known. You have clients in the area, you pay the vendors of those clients. You have ERP and other kinds of partners and so the thing works in a way, basically, where you can build a business better via verticals than you can geographically. So although we do exactly the same things, we don't do those things in those verticals. So effectively we will. We'll use, obviously, a lot of our back office and some of our advantaged contracts and stuff like that and some of our sales techniques to kind of basically build up the business that they have in those verticals and get, obviously a bunch of synergies along the way. So it's a super attractive. It's what we call a wheelhouse deal. We know it super cold. We studied the company well and we're super clear on what we're going to do with. Yeah. Hey, Ramsey, it's Ron. It's a good question. So I think locked in is a pretty, pretty strong word. What I'd say is what we can see that's super clear is what caused the divot and the D cell, which is softness. So yet we've got 15,000 clients or something in that business, and a select group of clients went soft on us starting Q2, Q3 last year and so the good news is, other than that select group that went soft, the others didn't. So the other clients didn't go soft, and neither did the retention, did we have any kind of big spike in retention. So, effectively, kind of, once we lapped this select group of clients that went soft, the key to the thing reaccelerating again, is just sales. It's a high retention business generally and so as long as the sales that we have in the plan come to fruition and we get those implemented, then we'll grow basically over that lap base. So, again, a little bit of your seeing of that is we started to catch it a little bit here in April. So we think really the turn in the business would be Q3, where if we said, hey, what's the softest? I think it was still 10%, 11%, 12% in Q1, and we had 2% as a company overall. My estimate would be by Q3, that thing would be close to zero. So the softness would be, if you will, client base would be relatively flat. So, and again, the good news is there's no more IT boogieman. We spent a year and a half, two years building the thing. We converted the base. It's a new great feature, so the product is actually better. So we're going to get the benefits this year forward of the pain, effectively, that we inflicted last year. So that's a positive, that there was some benefit, basically, in the journey on IT. Hey, Ramsey, it's Ron. So I did mention at the top that we have a pipeline. So we're working on some additional transactions. So my answer on top of Tom's would be, I would expect us to do to both of those things, likely buy more companies this year, and depending on where our stock price is, buy back more stock. And so between the liquidity that we have the leverage ratio and then we're getting close on a couple of divestitures, that gets us capital. We feel we got, obviously plenty of liquidity to do both of those things rest of the year. But no additional stock repurchases are in that recovery. So we said, hey, 1940 was our, was our guide. Hey, 19, because of the effects and the interest rates. Hey, we'll get the $0.40 backstage at 19. That doesn't assume any incremental buybacks above the 800, which we may do depending on the stock price. Yes. I mean, always, Nate, when you lay out a plan and the businesses volume rate revenue is tracking and the initiatives that you've laid out are tracking. And so, for example, in corporate payments, I don't know how many times we've mentioned it over the last couple of years as channel partners. Oh shit. The growth is wherever we said, hey, it's 17% at the print, but 21 without channel partners. And I think we went on record really in the last call last year and said, hey, that thing's turning. We've kind of renewed some stuff with some existing partners and signed some new ones. So instead of that thing declining, it's going to actually turn and start increasing. And so we have those contracts signed and we're starting to put some of that volume through. So that'd be like an example of sitting here now on the other side of that I can see. And another big partner, we signed up there too in the last 45 days. So that would be an example of things that actually happened that are in the rear view that will create that acceleration of the rest of the year. In Brazil. I'd say it's just the power of the distribution. We have ten ways to sell tags and fuel and parking and insurance there and they're just rocking the bank channel thing we launched a couple of years ago with Santander and Kasia. They're selling a pile like 1015 percent of all of our new tags. Now coming through that brand new channel, the cross sell is working. I think we've sold a million insurance policies. We bought this app pay thing, which is super unique, to add, obviously this demand, it grew at 50% in the quarter. So the things that we plan in the businesses to make the businesses go, we're seeing real evidence in this first, whatever, four months that that stuff's working. And the materials that we need to get the forward numbers are clear. Obviously there's less months less. So I just say that they're beating the plan we put together for the first four months. And the progress suggests to me that they'll beat the plan, the remaining eight. Chris, are you asking first about the size of the divestitures? The size of the divestitures. And then you also talked about narrowing the focus of the business. So just, I'm trying to get how big of a narrow the focus of the business are you thinking here? How material is that? Yes. Let me start with the second part of the question and then go back to the more important first part. So, yeah, we, as part of the strategic review, we identified a couple of kind of smallish column in the $200 million to 300 million dollar range, kind of market price for the assets. One in our vehicle business, really both in and around our vehicle business. And so we're well along on those things with counterparties. So with those transactions, I said before, we'll have a simpler company and will redeploy that capital. But on the more important question, I think we spent the last year studying the company and said the most important thing to create value in the company was the fleet transformation and the redefinition of our fleet business to be a broader vehicle business right across the US, Brazil and Europe, and then even adding the consumer leg right to that business. And so those three segments, vehicle, corporate payments and lodging, are where we're headed. There's obviously plenty and plenty of tam and coverage for us to go get. We have new products in all three of them. And so the conclusion from all of us going through the thing is, let's just double down there. We did all this friggin Humpty Dumpty work the last five years to assemble this company in these segments, buying stuff, stitching it, fixing it. So we finally have, I think, super advantaged products in these segments. And so we're really in the marketing and sales phase. Right. Just basically sell more stuff in these three areas. And the reason I like it is it's just an easier company to manage. There's less kind of, call it Humpty Dumpty, figure it out, work, connect stuff, work. It's more kind of just basic sell stuff and then add related stuff, like the pay merang thing or, the Zappa thing, add stuff that's in the three segments. So we're going to be on that course for a while, just chasing to grow these three segments and maybe making acquisitions in those three segments. Thank you. And there's not many of them, Pete. The other thing is, they're scarce. Right. There's only a handful, really, that we're aware of any kind of sizable people that do what we call full AP in the middle market, really of any size. And obviously we know them all. Trev, it's Ron again. So you called it right. So if you took our vehicle business and you looked at our internal documents of how we build into the end of the second half, you're right. Show the vehicle business in total exiting in the high single digits both in Q3 and in Q4. So again, part of that is the lapping of the pivot. North America and the other two businesses that are sitting inside vehicle are performing fine and well and compounding. And so that's the view that we'd go from kind of low mid single digits for vehicle to high single digits as we exit the year. Yes, Trevor, I went over emphasize the pricey beat. Obviously we always look to price competitively. I think what you're seeing in our trend line of rev per trend is just a mix variance there in terms of where channel was a bigger portion of first quarter of last year. You also see that in our spend numbers where they were dominating spend numbers kind of diluted the overall year over year, but sequentially you see 10% growth. That also translated into the take rate. So I think what you see is a run rate take rate is pretty good. We'll look for opportunities to optimize on any kind of pricing or monetization strategies, but it's more of a mix when you're looking in the rear view mirror than it is some kind of over pricing strategy that we've deployed. That's true also within cross border, I know we focus a lot on payables, but the cross border business as well as the mix of that business has also been toward products where we earn more. We're doing more sophisticated type FX transactions on behalf of our customers, and because of that we're getting paid. And so that too is factoring into that overall trend and the shift in mix from kind of the basic stuff, commoditized kind of stuff, to the more specialized, sophisticated stuff that we're bringing our customers. Yes. Hey, James, it's Ron. So the exhibits in the supplement again, I think what we're trying to say there is of a sample of whatever 300 or 400 clients that we've had for some period of time. The chart shows that they're incrementally adding EV relative to combustion. Right. So the percentage of total vehicles among that pool of clients is becoming more EV. I think the main point we're trying to say is that because we do not only, on the road, but also at home with a super high attach rate, we can actually get more revenue per vehicle, per EV vehicle than we can from old fashioned combustion vehicles. So that's the point we're really trying to make to everybody is, oh, woe is me. When the world goes to more EV, fleet or Corpe will be hurt by it. We're trying to make the point that, no, no, no clients are willing to pay for this mixed solution we have and on the road and at home, and even as they grow to a higher and higher share of EV vehicles to total, we keep getting paid more, not less. That's really what we're trying to show you there. It's really just a share of wallet. We're keeping, obviously, the ice, the ice business, the fuel. But as they evolve their fleet to EV, we're getting that business as well. So it's incremental business for us. Oh, the channel partners, Yes. So again, yes is the short answer. I'd say for sure by Q three. And then again, the thing, point to point, the channel itself is actually higher, I think, when we get to Q three and Q four. So, yes, I'd say maybe the quarter we're sitting in is the last time. Hopefully we'll have to talk about this. And again, I said it earlier, our confidence. My confidence is high in it because the stuff that's forward is literally contracted. So we just have to make sure we implement it. Yes. Hey, Krebs, its Ron. No, they're kind of the same. They're both growing high teens to 20%. So not a big difference. Across border business is a bit bigger. Call it. I know 30% bigger won't be quite as big after we get close this pay merang, but no, they're quite similar. The one thing I will point out between the two businesses, just to remind everybody, is the cross border business has a massive tam because we originate customers in five geographies. So only about a quarter of that business is Us origination. The other 75% of it is know Canada, UK, Europe, Australia. And so you've got way number of companies and prospects to basically fish in the pond in that business because they sit in lots of geographies. It is, yes. Because the channel, remember, is lots of spend at no rate and the direct is obviously less spend at a decent rate. What you just said is right. Once the channel gets cleaned up effectively and is on its own, is higher than the prior period, that will wash away. Yes. And you accelerated corporate, which was great, even with the transaction decelerating."
