Presentation materials are available for download from Otis\u2019 website at www.otis.com. I will now turn it over to Stacy Laszewski, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations.\nStacy Laszewski: Thank you, Justin, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Otis' fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Judy Marks, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rahul Ghai, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and significant one-time non-recurring items. The company will also refer to adjusted results where adjustments were made as though Otis was a standalone company in the current period and prior year. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis' SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, upcoming annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on the Form 10-Q provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Stacy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us, and we hope that everyone listening is safe and well. I'm pleased we've delivered a strong quarter and a solid year. Despite the challenging environment, our 2020 results demonstrate the resiliency of our business and the benefits of becoming an independent Otis.  We grew adjusted earnings for the second year in a row, generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow, expanded our product and service offerings, and remained agile to support our customers as the pandemic evolved. We expanded adjusted margins by 70 basis points in 2020 following eight years without margin expansion as a segment of UTC, demonstrating the benefits of our independence. I could not be prouder of our 69,000 Otis colleagues who rose to the unique challenges presented throughout the year and never wavered in their commitment to provide essential services to our customers. And we did this while staying true to who we are, recognizing the challenges within our communities and allowing our Otis absolutes to keep each other safe and guide our actions and behaviors toward a more equitable future. For the full-year, organic sales were down 2.1%. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit was up $52 million, a $17 million improvement from the mid-point of our prior outlook. Margin expanded 70 basis points, reflecting the strong performance in the Service segment throughout the year. Adjusted EPS was $2.52, up $0.28, or 12.5% versus the prior year and a $0.10 improvement from our prior outlook. Now turning to Page 4. In our New Equipment segment, we grew share by 60 basis points, with growth in all major regions. We proudly mark the 20th anniversary of our Gen2 platform and hit a major milestone, surpassing more than 1 million Gen2 units delivered to date. We continue to innovate, introducing new solutions for customers. For example, in India and other developing markets, we introduced the Gen2 Prime, a low-cost entry-level elevator. And in China, we began shipping new equipment units enabled with our IoT platform Otis ONE. This year, we'll expand this offering to include shipping IoT-enabled units in the U.S., Asia Pacific and EMEA. And we continue to pilot Gen360, our next generation digitally native elevator that brings the advantages of connectivity into a new, more compact platform. We anticipate formally launching this transformational solution in the EMEA region later this year. We enhanced our sales force\u2019s\u2019 ability to address the market by increasing sales coverage mid-single digits, including adding more than 850 agents and distributors in China, and implemented tools to improve efficiency on the back-end. To date, more than 85% of our business is on a common CRM system, and we continue to find new ways to reach customers in this dynamic and more digitally-enabled environment. Service is the core of our business. In 2020, we added to our industry-leading maintenance portfolio by approximately 2% with growth in all major regions, including high-single-digit growth in China. This growing portfolio, which accelerates our recurring revenue business model, along with cost containment actions and productivity initiatives, allowed us to grow earnings. This resulted in adjusted margin expansion in all four quarters and 110 basis points of expansion for the year. I'm pleased with our progress made on IoT deployment. We added approximately 100,000 Otis ONE units as planned, bringing us to approximately 540,000 connected units. Over the medium-term, we plan to accelerate portfolio connectivity to approximately 60% of units, up from the roughly 25% currently connected, creating value for our customers and productivity benefits for Otis. This year, organic modernization sales were flat globally, as we face project delays in some regions due to COVID-19. However, modernization demand in Asia-Pacific was particularly strong, with orders up approximately 30% and sales up double digits, driven largely by regulatory demand. Our operational initiatives generated favorable outcomes. We're very focused on material and service productivity to offset headwinds from labor inflation and commodities, approximately 70% of our service cost basis labor and approximately 70% of our New Equipment cost basis material. We have material productivity initiatives to more than offset any potential impacts from raw materials. And in 2020, we achieved our goal of 3% material cost savings, helping to offset some of the volume headwinds in New Equipment. The early actions taken by our supply chain team, leveraging our scale, rationalizing spend, and taking cost out of products provided the protection and assurance even during COVID that we would deliver on commitments made to customers. Our focus on cost containment extended to adjusted SG&A, where we reduced expenses by $38 million versus the prior year, while expanding our sales coverage. As noted, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow with conversion of 143% exceeding our prior outlook by $150 million. We channeled our strong cash generation into our capital allocation strategy, including bolt-on acquisitions to increase our scale and density, $350 million to repay debt ahead of our original schedule, and returned approximately $260 million to shareholders through dividends in the last three quarters of the year. We made significant progress on our tax structure throughout the year, reducing our adjusted tax rate by 370 basis points versus the prior year and 260 basis points better than Investor Day expectations. We expect over the medium-term to bring our adjusted tax rate to a range of 25% to 28%. And as a final comment to 2020, and amid promising news of vaccine approvals and distribution plans, the three-month study using scientific data and analysis on elevator airflow, sponsored by Otis and led by a Purdue University professor and indoor air quality expert concluded that elevators have significant air exchange by design and required by code and a short elevator ride has a risk of exposure level less than that of outdoor dining. Turning to Slide 5, and starting with the industry's outlook. While market dynamics remain fluid, the industry's long-term fundamentals remain solid. We are encouraged by the pace of recovery and signs of wider availability of COVID-19 vaccines. The industry's New Equipment segment is expected to return to growth in all regions with mid-single-digit growth in Asia, low-single-digit growth in EMEA, and slight growth in the Americas. The recovery in New Equipment will continue to feed the global installed base and present future service opportunities. The core of our business is based on our service model, and the service market itself is expected to grow about 1 million units per year globally industry-wide. Industry installed base in the Americas is expected to grow low-single digits. EMEA were roughly 50% of the Otis maintenance portfolio sits is expected to grow low-single digits. And in Asia, we're expecting mid-single-digit growth driven by China. At Otis, we are confident in the momentum we built in 2020 and our ability to execute on our long-term strategy. Looking specifically at our 2021 Otis outlook. For the year, we expect sales growth of 4.5% to 6.5% with organic sales growth of 2% to 4%. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $125 million to $175 million, and adjusted EPS is expected in a range of $2.67 to $2.77, up 6% to 10% versus prior year and $0.20 at the midpoint. Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion with conversion of approximately 120% of GAAP net income. We will remain disciplined in our capital deployment and are well-positioned to start share repurchases following $150 million of debt repayment that was already completed in January. The foundation we built this year as an independent company, along with the expected recovery in our end markets gives us confidence that our strategy is working for our customers and shareholders. Our operating leverage, our global footprint, our successful innovation program, our capital management and strong balance sheet, and our industry leading colleagues give me full confidence we can deliver on our outlook this year and many years beyond. With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and 2021 outlook in more detail.\nRahul Ghai: Thank you, Judy and good morning everyone. Starting with fourth quarter results on Slide six. Net sales returned to growth in the quarter, and were up 4.2% to $3.5 billion. Organic sales were up 1.3% driven by a strong recovery in the New Equipment business, partially offset by the expected decline in the service segment. Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 8% or $36 million and up $19 million at constant currency as higher New Equipment volume and strong material and service productivity was partially offset by the impact of lower service volume, unfavorable price mix, and field inefficiencies in the New Equipment business. Our focus on execution [grew] 50 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was up 40% or $0.19, driven by $0.05 of operating profit growth, and $0.11 from a lower adjusted tax rate. As Judy mentioned earlier, these results were $0.10 ahead of prior outlook driven by better than expected growth in the New Equipment business, increased benefit from material productivity, and a slightly better service pricing environment. Moving to Slide 7. New Equipment orders were down 3.5% at constant currency, as strong order intake in EMEA and Asia driven by China, that was up double digits was more than offset by a 21% decline in the Americas, due to a tough compare and weakness in the northeast and larger metropolitan areas in the western region of the United States. Awards, which typically precede order booking by a couple of months was stable in the quarter in North America. Net booked margin adjusted for mix was down 50 basis points in the quarter, and backlog was up 2% at constant currency, driven by growth in the Americas, Europe, and China with overall backlog margin down slightly versus the prior year. New Equipment organic sales were up 4.8% with Americas and EMEA up about 18% and 5% respectively, driven by strong backlog conversion. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Asia. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit was up $7 million in the segment and margin expanded 20 basis points as higher volume and strong material productivity more than offset incremental investments in China to develop agent and distributor channel, unfavorable price mix, and field inefficiencies. Service segment results on Slide 8. The number of units under maintenance contracts increased by 2%, and modernization orders were up 4.9% at constant currency as double digit-growth in Asia, driven by the mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets was partially offset by lower order intake in the Americas and EMEA. Service organic sales were down 1.4% in the fourth quarter with contractual maintenance demand up slightly, while discretionary repair and modernization projects were pushed out. However, we were encouraged by the repair business improving sequentially over the prior periods with a lower year-over-year rate of decline, compared to the second and the third quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 70 basis points and profit grew $8 million at constant currency. A strong contribution from productivity was partially offset by the impact from lower volume. The service pricing environment, excluding the impact of price concessions was modestly favorable. Overall, full-year results on Slide 9 reflect solid performance, with $52 million of adjusted operating profit growth at constant currency and 70 basis points of margin expansion, despite organic sales being down 2.1%. The service business was particularly resilient, growing adjusted operating profit at constant currency by $55 million, and margin by 100 basis points, notwithstanding a slight decline in organic sales, as our focus on productivity initiatives continued to yield results with maintenance hours per unit down close to 6% versus 2019. Despite the environment, we are pleased with the operational progress we made a New Equipment business. Operating profit was down $45 million at constant currency on 4% organic sales decline with detrimental margins more or less in-line with our contribution margin. We achieve the goal of 3% material cost savings in 2020, partially offsetting the headwinds from COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in lower volume, the associated under absorption of costs, field inefficiencies, and higher bad debt expense. Cost containment efforts were also a large contributor to profit growth and full-year adjusted SG&A expense was down close to $40 million versus prior year. At the same time, we maintained the investments in R&D and other strategic projects at 1.6% of sales, which was about flat versus the prior year. Full-year adjusted EPS was up 12.5% or $0.28 versus the prior year. Driven by $0.07 from strong operating performance and $0.15 from the progress we are making on reducing our adjusted tax rate, down 370 basis points to 30.4%. Net interest was also favorable by $0.06, reflecting the benefit of $350 million of debt repayment, and $500 million of refinancing during the year. This EPS performance is not only better than the outlook provided in October, but also better than the pre-COVID outlook provided in February on our Investor Day, and caps a successful first year as a public company. As we look forward to 2021, on Slide 10, we feel confident of growth across all key metrics, given the higher starting New Equipment backlog, resiliency of the maintenance business in 2020, normalizing job site and building access levels, and our focus on operational excellence. Service callbacks, our proxy for repair volume is also showing continued sequential improvement. Even though the rate of improvement slowed in Q4, due to the resurgence of COVID-19 pandemic, we do expect year-over-year compares to turn favorable in the second quarter of 2021. These encouraging trends, combined with a strong foundation we built in 2020 gives us confidence to grow overall organic sales by 2% to 4% with adjusted operating profit by $125 million to $175 million with 30 basis points to 40 basis points of margin expansion. We expect sales, operating profit, and margins to improve in both segments. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.67 to $2.77, up 8% or $0.20 at the midpoint. This year-over-year increase is driven by strong operating profit outlook, and a 90-basis point reduction in the adjusted tax rate to 29.5%, partially offset by a $12 million increase in interest cost from the full-year impact of debt placed at spin. We expect free cash flow in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, with conversion at approximately 120% of GAAP net income. This reflects a strong earnings growth outlook, partially offset by incremental interest, and non-recurring tax related payments in 2021. Given our strong working capital performance in 2020, a reduction of more than 90 million or close to 25% from 2019 year-end balances we\u2019re holding working capital flat in 2021 at the mid-point of our outlook. Our capital deployment plans remain on track. And we have completed the previously disclosed $500 million of debt repayment with $150 million payment in January and expect share repurchases of $300 million in 2021, a year ahead of the original schedule at spin. Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 11. The New Equipment business is projected to be up between 2% to 5% driven by accelerated conversion of the backlog that was up 2% in 2020 and the expected return to growth in the market. We expect broad-based recovery with all three regions returning to growth in 2021. America is up low-to-mid single-digits, EMEA up low-single-digits, and Asia up mid-single-digits driven by growth in China. In the service segment, we expect maintenance and repair sales to be up 2% to 4%, with maintenance sales growing from a stable base and recovery in discretionary repairs that will accelerate post Q1. Modernization sales should be up low-to-mid single-digits with Asia Pacific maintaining the growth momentum from an effective go to market strategy to tap into the demand created by the regulatory requirements, and other regions returning to growth as they convert the higher year-end backlog. Overall, the sales growth of 2% to 4% represents a solid turnaround after difficult 2020 with growth across all regions and all lines of business. Switching to operating profit on Slide 12. We expect operating profit to be up $125 million to $175 million, and up $75 million to $125 million at constant currency, reflecting the benefit of volumes, returning to pre-COVID levels, and continued strong contribution from material and service productivity to offset the headwinds from pricing in the New Equipment market, increases in commodity prices, step-up in maintenance expenses, and incremental standalone costs in the first half of the year. This outlook represents the third consecutive year of strong earnings growth as we continue to execute the basics, deal with the challenges, leverage the investments we have made in the business and benefit from a market recovery. And with that, I'll request Justin to please open the line for questions.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.\nJudy Marks: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Good morning. I'm wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on, I guess it's kind of a multifaceted question, but all this is somewhat interrelated, the topics of unfavorable price mix and some of the pressure you might be seeing on the OE equipment side, and how that dovetails with your productivity efforts to offset that?\nRahul Ghai: Sure. Good morning, Jeff. So, we've seen earnings momentum going into 2021, with earnings up close to $50 million in the second half of 2020. And we are projecting to continue this momentum into 2021. So, if you look at the New Equipment segment, there\u2019s a couple of drivers that are driving the growth in 2021 on the earnings side. The biggest piece of that is that segment returns to growth in 2021, after a challenging 2020 with 3.5% organic sales growth at the mid-point, and the drop through we'll get from that is a strong contributor to earnings growth. Along with strong material productivity, we still think we can deliver the 3% material cost productivity after absorbing the impact from commodity headwinds. And this, along with the restructuring actions that we took last year, will help us offset the incremental standalone cost, headwind from some of the actions that we took, some of the short-term actions that we took last year to protect the earnings and any adverse pricing that may materialize. I mean, the pricing was more or less stable . I mean, we were down slightly on the backlog.  So, we expect some headwinds or pricing, but we obviously are building that into our guidance. So, the key here is that we are able to grow margins of the New Equipment side despite the commodity headwinds, increase in standalone cost, temporary costs coming back, and the pricing pressures. This has been the key part of our strategy. We've been talking about it since our first earnings call back in April last year that we understand the challenges we are facing, and we have these operational excellence programs that we\u2019re working on, whether it's backlog acceleration, or material productivity to deal with anything that may arise. So, we feel good about where we sit, Jeff \u2013 sit here right now, Jeff.\nJudy Marks: Yes. Let me just add one thing, Jeff. It's we \u2013 when we stood up at Investor Day, I think, you heard Rahul and I both set a target to end 2020 at a higher backlog, and to go into 2021 with a higher backlog than we entered 2020, and that was something we've reiterated at every earnings call. And with this 2% and improved backlog conversion, we really think that's going to make a difference in New Equipment in terms of driving the revenue, and then we'll get the fall through \u2013 drop-through.\nJeff Sprague: And maybe just one kind of related follow-on. Have you found that your actual realized margin is consistently coming in above kind of the booked margin at the time of order? How that \u2013 how did that play actually through the year and then the quarter?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. No, it's coming in \u2013 the \u2013 our operational excellence not only is based in what we do in the factory, but also it's equally important what we do in the field. And we track that thing very, very closely, Jeff. Every month, every quarter, we get reports from every country around the world, and our delivered margin consistently is above our booked margin. So, that and \u2013 and that will be \u2013 that we will continue to push that and along with pushing material productivity in the field as well. So, the booked, the delivered margin is higher than a booked margin.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And thank you. And our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to, I mean, I think there's a few questions about the orders, down 4%, backlog up 2% versus the sales outlook \u2013 there\u2019s a 2% to 5% for equipment. Now, you\u2019ve clearly got some very easy comp in 2021, but would you expect to be burning backlog as you shift from that backlog to achieve maybe the high-end of that range? Or are you expecting orders to accelerate through the year? Just any color in terms of the forward look would be helpful as well?\nJudy Marks: Yes. So, I mean, Nigel, good morning, it's Judy. Let\u2019s - there's a few questions in there. We do expect orders to accelerate. I think we've shared that two-thirds of our book that we will execute on in 2021 is in backlog. The rest is kind of book and build type business for us across the Board both New Equipment and Service. So, we do expect it to accelerate and we will be using 2021 to fill the 2022 backlog, so that we go in strong and keep this momentum going. Orders on any quarter basis aren't really the best determinant. They do go up and down. There's different levels in different regions. But we did have - we do have \u2013 we were down 3.5% at constant. on the New Equipment side. I would point out our modernization orders were up almost 5%. So that business, which we see is a growing opportunity for us as well. Even with all the discretion that's been happening in modernization, our modernization orders are up.\nRahul Ghai: The other way, Nigel, just to add to that is that you can almost look at the two - the guide of 2% to 5% with our backlog up on the New Equipment revenue. With our backlog up 2%, you can almost look at that as a floor, right, because that's what we\u2019re starting with. And then, Judy mentioned about the acceleration of backlog. We demonstrated that in the fourth quarter of 2020 driving substantially higher organic revenue than where our starting backlog was at the beginning of the quarter. So that shows the steps that we are taking to accelerate a backlog conversion is happening, and we\u2019ll continue that into 2021. And then, obviously, the markets are coming back. And that is what Judy was talking about. We expect, I mean Judy shared the data that we are expecting growth across the world with Asia up mid-single digits. So that helps the growth as well. But you start with 2%, add on the backlog conversion, and then add on the market recovery that gets us to the 2% to 5% range.\nNigel Coe: Thanks for the detail into that. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: And thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nJudy Marks: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, just to be clear, I think the organic \u2013 the backlog was influenced a bit by Forex, too, right? The organic backlog is actually up a little more than that?\nRahul Ghai: The \u2013 yes. Absolutely. Steve, the \u2013 at constant currency, the backlog is up 2%, which is what we\u2019re talking to. But at actual FX, we benefited from backlog conversion that's having up about 6% at reported numbers.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, reported numbers, right? Okay, got it. I must have missed that and got that wrong. Just on the Services growth, is there anything in there that's reading through from what you're doing specifically around the technology or is it, kind of too early for that to show up in the Services growth rate for 2021?\nJudy Marks: Yes, I think, you know, I think we're starting to see the benefits of the IoT Otis ONE investment. We're clearly seeing the benefits, the productivity benefits of all the apps that our field professionals have, and are being able to put in play and \u2013 but Otis ONE, we're starting to see that. We deployed just about 100,000 new units in Otis ONE, primarily in China, EMEA, and in North America, and there's real demand pull for that from our field professionals. It's really giving them that advanced look, that ability to be able to fix things remote, and to really bring down, you know our callbacks. Our retention rate, we think that's really where you're going to see this n the retention rate. In our retention rate, we ended the year at 94%, which is industry leading and is up from earlier in the year when we were closer to 93%. So, we're seeing it there, and then the reason we believe in it, we're going to be deploying at least that same number this year. And we're also now pre-positioning our Otis One, on our units that we're shipping from the factory. It\u2019s already started in China, we're adding the U.S. EMEA, and Asia Pacific. That'll take some time to work its way through, obviously, the warranty period, a year or so in those places, but we believe in it. We're seeing the early returns, and we're seeing the productivity gains, and our customers are able to really have that access for really operational knowledge, whether they're on site or not, is my elevator working, am I getting more uptime? And we think that's just going to buy more stickiness, and that's the whole thesis of our connected strategy.\nSteve Tusa: And then just one last one, just on China, pretty decent orders number, can you maybe just clarify what types of differences you guys may have an exposure versus your kind of, you know, more visible publicly traded peers within China? You know, they make comments all the time, but sometimes it's, you know, tough to read directly through from what they're saying. So, you know, what's your outlook on China? And maybe how May you be different than those guys? And I'll leave it at that. Thanks.\nJudy Marks: Sure. Let me just, kind of look back at China for 2020. You know, as we started at Investor Day, we thought it was going to be a flat segment, The New Equipment segment really had mid-single-digit growth. And we held our own to slightly up, we also had high-single-digit growth in our portfolio in China, which is key as that becomes a large market for us for the installed base. Where we gain share on the order side, Steve was really in the office, commercial, and infrastructure markets in China, as we really look at the back half of the year, and we're seeing that kind of roll through in January as well. Our high rise business continues to perform well. And you know, we made a lot of investments in China since we became independent. And this whole expansion, significant expansion 850 agents and distributors that are helping us get garner more key accounts, which then have a higher conversion rate. It's really, last year was a great investment year for us in China to build the foundation. We had strong results as the market came back. And we expect strong results as that market grows. And we expand to outgrow the market this year in 2021.\nRahul Ghai: And Steve, just to add to that, we continue to do really, really well in the Tier 3 to Tier 6 [series], and that has been our bread and butter. We've done well over the last five, six years there, we've continued to gain share in those markets. And those markets was slightly slow to recover in the Tier 1 markets, and you know, that's where we need to do the work as we've previously discussed, that's odd where some of our publicly traded peers have a slightly stronger share. But I think the agents and distributors that we've added this year with that we're confident we\u2019ll do better next year or in 2021 in those, you know, Tier 1 markets as well. But our success in 2020 was in the Tier 3 to Tier 6 series.\nOperator: And thank you. And our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Your line is now open.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. Thank you very much nice results. So, your maintenance units were up 2% in the fourth quarter. My recollection is, they were up 1% in the third. Can you comment how much of that is organic versus acquisition and maybe trends outside of China?\nRahul Ghai: The 2% was a full-year number Cai. So, that's a full-year number. So, I think that's where we ended the year, and you know, in the growth that we saw in the quarter was all organic. There was, you know, I don't think there's any acquisition worth speaking about. So, it was all organic?\nCai von Rumohr: I mean, am I correct? I think you published that the third quarter, the units were up 1%. So, if 2% is for the full-year, what was the fourth quarter?\nRahul Ghai: It depends on where, you know, it just depends on \u2013 the way you should look at it is, where we ended Q3 last year versus Q3 of 2019. You know, it's a year-over-year growth, but you know, for the, you know, like, this is a Q4, it's a balance sheet number, right. That's a way to think about it. So, it's in, in Q4 of 2020, at the end of 2020, we ended up at, you know, 2% higher units versus where we ended at in 2019.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific. And then on the raw material front, refresh my memory; is it the percent of raw materials, the absolute number of raw material purchases? What percent is stainless steel? Because stainless, basically, what it topped something like close to 20% since the middle of a quarter?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. So, our commodity spend Cai is about - total commodity spend is about $300 million, out of which about 80% is steel. And you\u2019re right, you know, if you look at, kind of what we are seeing right now, for 2021, steel is about 7% to 8%, maybe a little higher in Q1 right now, and the fall was a little bit lower. So, it averages out to about 7% to 8%. So, the way we are thinking about the commodity issue for next year is, it was a tailwind in 2020. It's for 2021. It is a headwind given where the steel prices sits today. And the spreadsheet math would suggest, hey, that could be like a $20 million plus headwind for us. But the other part that is simultaneously happened is that both Euro and RMB have appreciated against the dollar, and the buy in local currency in both Europe and China.  So, we should be able to offset part of this commodity increase by just appreciation of the local currency. So that's one piece of it. The second piece is that we\u2019re working really, really hard on material productivity to offset the commodity headwinds. I think that's what Julie said earlier. And we\u2019re starting 2021 in a much, much better position than we did in 2020 given the cadence that we gained last year, and a carryover benefit from the projects that we started mid-year in 2020 is higher than where we were at this point last year.  So, we still think we can deliver 3% material productivity after absorbing the commodity headwinds and grow a New Equipment margins, which is, you know, what I said earlier, in response to Jeff's question. The other piece, you know, to the extent that dollar weakness is causing the commodity headwinds, we\u2019re also seeing the $50 million FX gain on our, you know, on earnings overall. So, it's in a different line of the P&L, but, you know, some of the commodity weakness is because of appreciation of the depreciation of the dollar, but we gain that on the overall earnings side. So a little bit of a trade-off. But overall, you know, it is an issue, but it's built into our guidance and we feel we can get to 3%, material productivity and grow our New Equipment margins in 2021.\nCai von Rumohr: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And thank you. And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.\nJudy Marks: Good morning.\nJulian Mitchell: Good morning. Maybe just a couple of clarifications, really, one was around the free cash flow outlook, there isn't a lot of growth dialed into that guide despite a reasonable adjusted earnings increase, just wondered any sort of split there around working capital versus CapEx? And if you've seen any change in working capital terms, perhaps as some of your customers are fairly squeezed? And then a very quick clarification, just non-controlling interest, I think was lower year-on-year. So, just trying to understand that.\nRahul Ghai: Yes. So, let me start with cash and then we can talk about the [indiscernible] payment. So, you know, if you look at our cash, really strong year last year. We ended $150 million better than what we had guided and the net income came in better, working capital was really good. And as I said in my prepared remarks, reduced working capital were $90 million, which is a quarter for working capital, which was a fantastic performance given you know, what you hear overall, and as we look at 2021, the biggest driver is improvement in earnings, Julian, as you referenced, but there are two issues that we are trying to deal with next year. One is, just the timing of the interest payments. So, just the way where the interest payments landed, we do have an extra interest payment in 2021, which we did not have in 2020, given the timing of when we raised debt. The other issue is that we do need to make a tax-related payment for an old tax matter that we've inherited from UTC. So, we've built that into our guidance as well. That matter is still ongoing, but we\u2019ve built that into our guidance. As I said in my prepared remarks, we have not built any working capital improvement into our guidance at this point. We\u2019ll obviously keep working at the midpoint of our guidance, because when we'll keep working, we\u2019ll keep working there hard. But our plan at this point doesn't contemplate that. You know, 1.35 billion for 2021 is a solid number. It's 120% of GAAP net income, and, you know, substantially higher than where we expected 2021 to be on Investor Day. So, we think it's a solid start to the year. On NCI for 2020, not any one single driver, it was a combination of various things. You know, couple of them were here and there and then FX was a little bit of a headwind as well. So, I wouldn't read too much into where we ended on NCI for 2020.\nJulian Mitchell: Great, thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. And our next question comes from John Walsh from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning.\nRahul Ghai : Good morning, John.\nJohn Walsh: So, it was great to hear and it sounds like there's a lot of excitement around the new products and rolling them out across the different geographies. I guess one of the questions I had is, as you roll these new products across U.S., EMEA, China, APAC, do you believe that these new products are ahead of where your other kind of public competitors are? You know, are these to get you to be in-line? Because you've talked about making these investments or do you think that there's still some other folks that might still be leading even with these new products? I'm just trying to understand, kind of the competitive dynamics there with a lot of these new launches, if you're kind of leaping ahead or if this is to kind of get back in-line with where some of the market already is?\nJudy Marks: Yes, John, it's a little of both. And, you know, we've increased our R&D investments 60% since 2015. And we've made, actually, we've done really well, our patents have gone up four times since that same period, and our new product releases since 2018 are up 250%. So, we've made a conscious effort to really reinvigorate the innovation engine and the DNA in this company. So, some of that is a little bit of catch up, but others like our Gen360, is going to be an incredibly new, digitally native, with an electronic safety first in the industry that code authorities have to approve. It's going to revolutionize really how people are gracefully handled when there's an issue in the elevator, and the elevator has to actually stop. It's going to gracefully bring them down to an actual landing floor so that customers and more importantly, passengers aren't, you know, entrapped, if, you know at any length of time. So, you know, our destination dispatch product is, we believe is industry leading, we've released the Compass 360 product that gives us even more capability. And we found customers are really very interested in that whole destination product, because it's touch free. And we've always talked about the safety of our products. Now, we also talk about the health offerings of our products, and our team moved very rapidly during the COVID era to generate new products, whether it be gesture, whether it be our apps, our e-call app that allows you either via Bluetooth or other connectivity to use your phone.  And then, you know we've tried not just to hit the high-end with a Gen360, in terms of complexity, and features. We've also tried, as we talked about our Gen2 Prime to find a nice, stable, affordable entrant that'll be a workhorse for us in India, in the Middle East, in Africa and other emerging markets. So, we're trying to hit that whole span. On the service side, you know, when we rolled out Otis One, we made a conscious decision to roll it out as a, you know, as a productivity enabler first. And we think we're going to drive one-point of productivity with Otis One, and we're going to keep adding units to do that. The reason we did that and the strategy we did that, that we took was a density based approach. There's not value, as much value, if you just sprinkle sensors or IoT units across the globe. So, we did a very focused density-based route-based attempt and focus to be able to actually yield that production. And that will grow in productivity, but it'll also grow in terms of customer value and retention for us. And it provides a foundation for us to add services. So, a little bit of catch-up, no argument based on some, you know, prior years lack of investments pre-2015. But I think we've really accelerated both in the mechanical, the digital, the electronic, and most importantly the passenger experience.\nJohn Walsh: Thank you for that answer. And then just as a follow up, looking at the America's orders growth, and I know any one quarter can, you know, isn't maybe necessarily the best data point, and they need to be looked at, you know, probably over a four quarter period, but can you remind us what your order to ship is right now in the Americas, because I'm just trying to figure out, you know, elevators typically lead, and how to kind of roll through these negative orders we've seen in the Americas through the model. And I think you also talked about awards being kind of stable. I didn't know if that was an Americas comment or a total portfolio comment. Thank you.\nRahul Ghai: Yes, no John. So, the typical, I would say the, you know, the order to the ship time on elevators is about 12 months in North America. That's what we said before. So that's where we are. The comment on awards, which typically proceed orders by a couple of months, and they were stable in the quarter. That was a North America comment. But you know, if you look at America's overall, John, I think the markets are, kind of uncertain, right? I mean, we've seen as Judy mentioned, in her prepared remarks, we've seen good growth in Asia, we know, kind of [feel good] about the mid-single-digit growth there. If you look at EMEA, we feel good about the low-single-digit. Americas remains challenging, and the market was down mid-teens last year. So, obviously, we did better than the market. And if you look at the Dodge momentum index that just turned strongly positive in December, for the first time in several months. So that's an initial sign of recovery since COVID, but if you look at the architectural billings index, that's still under 50. But now the inquiries have been positive for four months straight. So, kind of mixed signals. And if you look at the range of guidance that we are giving, you know, part of that range is driven by the America's growth outlook. So that's a contributor to that. But you know, overall, again, I think, you know, we discussed with Nigel earlier, you know, we feel good about all the steps that we've taken in terms of improving our sales coverage, you know, kind of, you know, 7 points in China, 10 points, overall new product introductions. Our proposals were up 7% last year. So that, obviously, is another good sign that we can keep building on this momentum that we have, and the share gain that we've enjoyed, we can keep building on that. But the America's market is uncertain, but that's what we built into our guidance.\nJohn Walsh: Great, thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. And our next question comes from Carter Copeland from Melius Research. Your line is now open.\nCarter Copeland: Hey, thanks and good morning everybody.\nJudy Marks: Hey, Carter.\nRahul Ghai : Good morning, Carter.\nCarter Copeland: I wondered \u2013 could you speak specifically to conversion rates? I think at one point in time, you talked about \u2013 given those, you know, sort of once a year, and even if you can't give us the exact number, just some of the regional trends, data, any color on that on just how you finished the year in terms of conversion?\nJudy Marks: Yes, let me start, and I'll give you more of some regional flavor and then Rahul can add. You know, we saw strong conversion growth and uptick in China, which is the most encouraging for us. Because that's obviously the largest, you know, at over 50% of the segment. That's our largest opportunity base to grow our service portfolio, and the service portfolio. You know, as I mentioned, we had high single digit growth in there. So, we saw nice conversion, and our retention rate went up in China, as well, as did our recapture rate on units we wanted to get back. So, all three metrics that helped drive net recovery for us, in China were positive. And we think that's the strategy playing out. Everything we've told you about, you know, enhanced customer stickiness, IoT more key accounts, which have higher conversion rates closer to the 80% range, more infrastructure, which also has higher conversion rates. So, with that pivot in our strategy in China, that's where we're seeing that accelerate. Rahul, do you want to comment on at the macro level?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. The overall conversion kind of hung in there at about [60%-ish] Carter. So, not a lot of change to the overall conversions. We said China was up about a point and a half. So, that was good momentum. And you know, the only other thing is the retention rate for us, which is very, very critical was at 94% in 2020, versus 93% in 2019. So that picked up as well. So, that's good. So good momentum in the service business. Obviously, you saw that come through the results as well.\nJudy Marks: Yes, and the other thing, I'll just comment on, Carter, just, you know, from a service pricing, what we saw, you know, if you hold the concessions off, they still exist, and we believe they're still going to happen in 2021, in the early 2021, in the hospitality, or parts of the business in retail, our service pricing held well as we finished 2020. So, not only, you know, were we getting the conversions and keeping the retention, we were getting \u2013 we were holding price if not just slightly up.\nCarter Copeland: So based on those trends, presumably you expect your service portfolio growth to accelerate and 2021 versus 2020, I would assume?\nJudy Marks: Yes.\nCarter Copeland: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.\nRahul Ghai: Thanks Carter.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we have a follow-up question from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks for the follow-up, appreciate it. Rahul, I was just wondering if you could maybe [just size] that text number you've got dialed into your forecast? And then maybe just clarify the $20 million of raw material, you know, that sort of like delved into your budget. Is that, kind of the growth impact or is that net of productivity or FX movement? Is that just the pure increase in [stock prices]?\nRahul Ghai: No. 20 million is just the commodity piece. We think we will offset that Nigel with a 3% material productivity and we will deliver 3% net productivity after absorbing that $20 million headwind. So that's just a commodity piece. On the tax savings, you know, it's kind of in tens of millions, Nigel, so it's a big number. It's not a small number. You know, it's a tax matter. So, we will, you know, we will continue dealing with it. Again, no P&L impact. The P&L is all accrued. It is basically a cash outflow for us in 2021.\nNigel Coe: So, it\u2019s like a separation type number. Does that [indiscernible] the separation matters more or less at this point?\nRahul Ghai: There will be a few, you know, tax matters that will continue. We had this old toll tax if you guys remember from \u2013 you guys have been following UTC for a long time and that will continue for a few years. But that's not a year-over-year change, Nigel, and that's in the $15 million to $20 million of cash outflow every year. So that's not a big number, but this is one of the biggest issues that we have remaining from separation.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And thank you. And now I would like to turn the call back over to Judy Marks for closing remarks.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Justin. To summarize, we delivered a strong close to a solid first year as an independent company. I'm pleased with the performance we delivered against a challenging economic backdrop. Nearly a year ago, we held our Investor Day at the New York Stock Exchange. We shared with you the strength of our portfolio, our long-term strategy to deliver growth and profitability, our track record of execution, and our commitment toward disciplined capital allocation, all to drive shareholder value. We laid a strong foundation and the targets set out for 2021 reflect the resiliency of our business model, and the strength of our long-term strategy. Our fundamentals remain strong. We're well-positioned to continue driving value for our customers, for our colleagues, and our shareholders. I hope you all stay safe and well and thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Judy Marks",
            "content": "Thank you, Stacy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us, and we hope that everyone listening is safe and well. I'm pleased we've delivered a strong quarter and a solid year. Despite the challenging environment, our 2020 results demonstrate the resiliency of our business and the benefits of becoming an independent Otis.  We grew adjusted earnings for the second year in a row, generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow, expanded our product and service offerings, and remained agile to support our customers as the pandemic evolved. We expanded adjusted margins by 70 basis points in 2020 following eight years without margin expansion as a segment of UTC, demonstrating the benefits of our independence. I could not be prouder of our 69,000 Otis colleagues who rose to the unique challenges presented throughout the year and never wavered in their commitment to provide essential services to our customers. And we did this while staying true to who we are, recognizing the challenges within our communities and allowing our Otis absolutes to keep each other safe and guide our actions and behaviors toward a more equitable future. For the full-year, organic sales were down 2.1%. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit was up $52 million, a $17 million improvement from the mid-point of our prior outlook. Margin expanded 70 basis points, reflecting the strong performance in the Service segment throughout the year. Adjusted EPS was $2.52, up $0.28, or 12.5% versus the prior year and a $0.10 improvement from our prior outlook. Now turning to Page 4. In our New Equipment segment, we grew share by 60 basis points, with growth in all major regions. We proudly mark the 20th anniversary of our Gen2 platform and hit a major milestone, surpassing more than 1 million Gen2 units delivered to date. We continue to innovate, introducing new solutions for customers. For example, in India and other developing markets, we introduced the Gen2 Prime, a low-cost entry-level elevator. And in China, we began shipping new equipment units enabled with our IoT platform Otis ONE. This year, we'll expand this offering to include shipping IoT-enabled units in the U.S., Asia Pacific and EMEA. And we continue to pilot Gen360, our next generation digitally native elevator that brings the advantages of connectivity into a new, more compact platform. We anticipate formally launching this transformational solution in the EMEA region later this year. We enhanced our sales force's' ability to address the market by increasing sales coverage mid-single digits, including adding more than 850 agents and distributors in China, and implemented tools to improve efficiency on the back-end. To date, more than 85% of our business is on a common CRM system, and we continue to find new ways to reach customers in this dynamic and more digitally-enabled environment. Service is the core of our business. In 2020, we added to our industry-leading maintenance portfolio by approximately 2% with growth in all major regions, including high-single-digit growth in China. This growing portfolio, which accelerates our recurring revenue business model, along with cost containment actions and productivity initiatives, allowed us to grow earnings. This resulted in adjusted margin expansion in all four quarters and 110 basis points of expansion for the year. I'm pleased with our progress made on IoT deployment. We added approximately 100,000 Otis ONE units as planned, bringing us to approximately 540,000 connected units. Over the medium-term, we plan to accelerate portfolio connectivity to approximately 60% of units, up from the roughly 25% currently connected, creating value for our customers and productivity benefits for Otis. This year, organic modernization sales were flat globally, as we face project delays in some regions due to COVID-19. However, modernization demand in Asia-Pacific was particularly strong, with orders up approximately 30% and sales up double digits, driven largely by regulatory demand. Our operational initiatives generated favorable outcomes. We're very focused on material and service productivity to offset headwinds from labor inflation and commodities, approximately 70% of our service cost basis labor and approximately 70% of our New Equipment cost basis material. We have material productivity initiatives to more than offset any potential impacts from raw materials. And in 2020, we achieved our goal of 3% material cost savings, helping to offset some of the volume headwinds in New Equipment. The early actions taken by our supply chain team, leveraging our scale, rationalizing spend, and taking cost out of products provided the protection and assurance even during COVID that we would deliver on commitments made to customers. Our focus on cost containment extended to adjusted SG&A, where we reduced expenses by $38 million versus the prior year, while expanding our sales coverage. As noted, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow with conversion of 143% exceeding our prior outlook by $150 million. We channeled our strong cash generation into our capital allocation strategy, including bolt-on acquisitions to increase our scale and density, $350 million to repay debt ahead of our original schedule, and returned approximately $260 million to shareholders through dividends in the last three quarters of the year. We made significant progress on our tax structure throughout the year, reducing our adjusted tax rate by 370 basis points versus the prior year and 260 basis points better than Investor Day expectations. We expect over the medium-term to bring our adjusted tax rate to a range of 25% to 28%. And as a final comment to 2020, and amid promising news of vaccine approvals and distribution plans, the three-month study using scientific data and analysis on elevator airflow, sponsored by Otis and led by a Purdue University professor and indoor air quality expert concluded that elevators have significant air exchange by design and required by code and a short elevator ride has a risk of exposure level less than that of outdoor dining. Turning to Slide 5, and starting with the industry's outlook. While market dynamics remain fluid, the industry's long-term fundamentals remain solid. We are encouraged by the pace of recovery and signs of wider availability of COVID-19 vaccines. The industry's New Equipment segment is expected to return to growth in all regions with mid-single-digit growth in Asia, low-single-digit growth in EMEA, and slight growth in the Americas. The recovery in New Equipment will continue to feed the global installed base and present future service opportunities. The core of our business is based on our service model, and the service market itself is expected to grow about 1 million units per year globally industry-wide. Industry installed base in the Americas is expected to grow low-single digits. EMEA were roughly 50% of the Otis maintenance portfolio sits is expected to grow low-single digits. And in Asia, we're expecting mid-single-digit growth driven by China. At Otis, we are confident in the momentum we built in 2020 and our ability to execute on our long-term strategy. Looking specifically at our 2021 Otis outlook. For the year, we expect sales growth of 4.5% to 6.5% with organic sales growth of 2% to 4%. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $125 million to $175 million, and adjusted EPS is expected in a range of $2.67 to $2.77, up 6% to 10% versus prior year and $0.20 at the midpoint. Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion with conversion of approximately 120% of GAAP net income. We will remain disciplined in our capital deployment and are well-positioned to start share repurchases following $150 million of debt repayment that was already completed in January. The foundation we built this year as an independent company, along with the expected recovery in our end markets gives us confidence that our strategy is working for our customers and shareholders. Our operating leverage, our global footprint, our successful innovation program, our capital management and strong balance sheet, and our industry leading colleagues give me full confidence we can deliver on our outlook this year and many years beyond. With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and 2021 outlook in more detail. Good morning, Jeff. Yes. Let me just add one thing, Jeff. It's we \u2013 when we stood up at Investor Day, I think, you heard Rahul and I both set a target to end 2020 at a higher backlog, and to go into 2021 with a higher backlog than we entered 2020, and that was something we've reiterated at every earnings call. And with this 2% and improved backlog conversion, we really think that's going to make a difference in New Equipment in terms of driving the revenue, and then we'll get the fall through \u2013 drop-through. Yes. So, I mean, Nigel, good morning, it's Judy. Let's - there's a few questions in there. We do expect orders to accelerate. I think we've shared that two-thirds of our book that we will execute on in 2021 is in backlog. The rest is kind of book and build type business for us across the Board both New Equipment and Service. So, we do expect it to accelerate and we will be using 2021 to fill the 2022 backlog, so that we go in strong and keep this momentum going. Orders on any quarter basis aren't really the best determinant. They do go up and down. There's different levels in different regions. But we did have - we do have \u2013 we were down 3.5% at constant. on the New Equipment side. I would point out our modernization orders were up almost 5%. So that business, which we see is a growing opportunity for us as well. Even with all the discretion that's been happening in modernization, our modernization orders are up. Hi, Steve. Yes, I think, you know, I think we're starting to see the benefits of the IoT Otis ONE investment. We're clearly seeing the benefits, the productivity benefits of all the apps that our field professionals have, and are being able to put in play and \u2013 but Otis ONE, we're starting to see that. We deployed just about 100,000 new units in Otis ONE, primarily in China, EMEA, and in North America, and there's real demand pull for that from our field professionals. It's really giving them that advanced look, that ability to be able to fix things remote, and to really bring down, you know our callbacks. Our retention rate, we think that's really where you're going to see this n the retention rate. In our retention rate, we ended the year at 94%, which is industry leading and is up from earlier in the year when we were closer to 93%. So, we're seeing it there, and then the reason we believe in it, we're going to be deploying at least that same number this year. And we're also now pre-positioning our Otis One, on our units that we're shipping from the factory. It's already started in China, we're adding the U.S. EMEA, and Asia Pacific. That'll take some time to work its way through, obviously, the warranty period, a year or so in those places, but we believe in it. We're seeing the early returns, and we're seeing the productivity gains, and our customers are able to really have that access for really operational knowledge, whether they're on site or not, is my elevator working, am I getting more uptime? And we think that's just going to buy more stickiness, and that's the whole thesis of our connected strategy. Sure. Let me just, kind of look back at China for 2020. You know, as we started at Investor Day, we thought it was going to be a flat segment, The New Equipment segment really had mid-single-digit growth. And we held our own to slightly up, we also had high-single-digit growth in our portfolio in China, which is key as that becomes a large market for us for the installed base. Where we gain share on the order side, Steve was really in the office, commercial, and infrastructure markets in China, as we really look at the back half of the year, and we're seeing that kind of roll through in January as well. Our high rise business continues to perform well. And you know, we made a lot of investments in China since we became independent. And this whole expansion, significant expansion 850 agents and distributors that are helping us get garner more key accounts, which then have a higher conversion rate. It's really, last year was a great investment year for us in China to build the foundation. We had strong results as the market came back. And we expect strong results as that market grows. And we expand to outgrow the market this year in 2021. Good morning. Yes, John, it's a little of both. And, you know, we've increased our R&D investments 60% since 2015. And we've made, actually, we've done really well, our patents have gone up four times since that same period, and our new product releases since 2018 are up 250%. So, we've made a conscious effort to really reinvigorate the innovation engine and the DNA in this company. So, some of that is a little bit of catch up, but others like our Gen360, is going to be an incredibly new, digitally native, with an electronic safety first in the industry that code authorities have to approve. It's going to revolutionize really how people are gracefully handled when there's an issue in the elevator, and the elevator has to actually stop. It's going to gracefully bring them down to an actual landing floor so that customers and more importantly, passengers aren't, you know, entrapped, if, you know at any length of time. So, you know, our destination dispatch product is, we believe is industry leading, we've released the Compass 360 product that gives us even more capability. And we found customers are really very interested in that whole destination product, because it's touch free. And we've always talked about the safety of our products. Now, we also talk about the health offerings of our products, and our team moved very rapidly during the COVID era to generate new products, whether it be gesture, whether it be our apps, our e-call app that allows you either via Bluetooth or other connectivity to use your phone.  And then, you know we've tried not just to hit the high-end with a Gen360, in terms of complexity, and features. We've also tried, as we talked about our Gen2 Prime to find a nice, stable, affordable entrant that'll be a workhorse for us in India, in the Middle East, in Africa and other emerging markets. So, we're trying to hit that whole span. On the service side, you know, when we rolled out Otis One, we made a conscious decision to roll it out as a, you know, as a productivity enabler first. And we think we're going to drive one-point of productivity with Otis One, and we're going to keep adding units to do that. The reason we did that and the strategy we did that, that we took was a density based approach. There's not value, as much value, if you just sprinkle sensors or IoT units across the globe. So, we did a very focused density-based route-based attempt and focus to be able to actually yield that production. And that will grow in productivity, but it'll also grow in terms of customer value and retention for us. And it provides a foundation for us to add services. So, a little bit of catch-up, no argument based on some, you know, prior years lack of investments pre-2015. But I think we've really accelerated both in the mechanical, the digital, the electronic, and most importantly the passenger experience. Hey, Carter. Yes, let me start, and I'll give you more of some regional flavor and then Rahul can add. You know, we saw strong conversion growth and uptick in China, which is the most encouraging for us. Because that's obviously the largest, you know, at over 50% of the segment. That's our largest opportunity base to grow our service portfolio, and the service portfolio. You know, as I mentioned, we had high single digit growth in there. So, we saw nice conversion, and our retention rate went up in China, as well, as did our recapture rate on units we wanted to get back. So, all three metrics that helped drive net recovery for us, in China were positive. And we think that's the strategy playing out. Everything we've told you about, you know, enhanced customer stickiness, IoT more key accounts, which have higher conversion rates closer to the 80% range, more infrastructure, which also has higher conversion rates. So, with that pivot in our strategy in China, that's where we're seeing that accelerate. Rahul, do you want to comment on at the macro level? Yes, and the other thing, I'll just comment on, Carter, just, you know, from a service pricing, what we saw, you know, if you hold the concessions off, they still exist, and we believe they're still going to happen in 2021, in the early 2021, in the hospitality, or parts of the business in retail, our service pricing held well as we finished 2020. So, not only, you know, were we getting the conversions and keeping the retention, we were getting \u2013 we were holding price if not just slightly up. Yes. Thank you, Justin. To summarize, we delivered a strong close to a solid first year as an independent company. I'm pleased with the performance we delivered against a challenging economic backdrop. Nearly a year ago, we held our Investor Day at the New York Stock Exchange. We shared with you the strength of our portfolio, our long-term strategy to deliver growth and profitability, our track record of execution, and our commitment toward disciplined capital allocation, all to drive shareholder value. We laid a strong foundation and the targets set out for 2021 reflect the resiliency of our business model, and the strength of our long-term strategy. Our fundamentals remain strong. We're well-positioned to continue driving value for our customers, for our colleagues, and our shareholders. I hope you all stay safe and well and thank you for joining us."

            "content": "Thank you, Judy and good morning everyone. Starting with fourth quarter results on Slide six. Net sales returned to growth in the quarter, and were up 4.2% to $3.5 billion. Organic sales were up 1.3% driven by a strong recovery in the New Equipment business, partially offset by the expected decline in the service segment. Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 8% or $36 million and up $19 million at constant currency as higher New Equipment volume and strong material and service productivity was partially offset by the impact of lower service volume, unfavorable price mix, and field inefficiencies in the New Equipment business. Our focus on execution [grew] 50 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was up 40% or $0.19, driven by $0.05 of operating profit growth, and $0.11 from a lower adjusted tax rate. As Judy mentioned earlier, these results were $0.10 ahead of prior outlook driven by better than expected growth in the New Equipment business, increased benefit from material productivity, and a slightly better service pricing environment. Moving to Slide 7. New Equipment orders were down 3.5% at constant currency, as strong order intake in EMEA and Asia driven by China, that was up double digits was more than offset by a 21% decline in the Americas, due to a tough compare and weakness in the northeast and larger metropolitan areas in the western region of the United States. Awards, which typically precede order booking by a couple of months was stable in the quarter in North America. Net booked margin adjusted for mix was down 50 basis points in the quarter, and backlog was up 2% at constant currency, driven by growth in the Americas, Europe, and China with overall backlog margin down slightly versus the prior year. New Equipment organic sales were up 4.8% with Americas and EMEA up about 18% and 5% respectively, driven by strong backlog conversion. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Asia. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit was up $7 million in the segment and margin expanded 20 basis points as higher volume and strong material productivity more than offset incremental investments in China to develop agent and distributor channel, unfavorable price mix, and field inefficiencies. Service segment results on Slide 8. The number of units under maintenance contracts increased by 2%, and modernization orders were up 4.9% at constant currency as double digit-growth in Asia, driven by the mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets was partially offset by lower order intake in the Americas and EMEA. Service organic sales were down 1.4% in the fourth quarter with contractual maintenance demand up slightly, while discretionary repair and modernization projects were pushed out. However, we were encouraged by the repair business improving sequentially over the prior periods with a lower year-over-year rate of decline, compared to the second and the third quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 70 basis points and profit grew $8 million at constant currency. A strong contribution from productivity was partially offset by the impact from lower volume. The service pricing environment, excluding the impact of price concessions was modestly favorable. Overall, full-year results on Slide 9 reflect solid performance, with $52 million of adjusted operating profit growth at constant currency and 70 basis points of margin expansion, despite organic sales being down 2.1%. The service business was particularly resilient, growing adjusted operating profit at constant currency by $55 million, and margin by 100 basis points, notwithstanding a slight decline in organic sales, as our focus on productivity initiatives continued to yield results with maintenance hours per unit down close to 6% versus 2019. Despite the environment, we are pleased with the operational progress we made a New Equipment business. Operating profit was down $45 million at constant currency on 4% organic sales decline with detrimental margins more or less in-line with our contribution margin. We achieve the goal of 3% material cost savings in 2020, partially offsetting the headwinds from COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in lower volume, the associated under absorption of costs, field inefficiencies, and higher bad debt expense. Cost containment efforts were also a large contributor to profit growth and full-year adjusted SG&A expense was down close to $40 million versus prior year. At the same time, we maintained the investments in R&D and other strategic projects at 1.6% of sales, which was about flat versus the prior year. Full-year adjusted EPS was up 12.5% or $0.28 versus the prior year. Driven by $0.07 from strong operating performance and $0.15 from the progress we are making on reducing our adjusted tax rate, down 370 basis points to 30.4%. Net interest was also favorable by $0.06, reflecting the benefit of $350 million of debt repayment, and $500 million of refinancing during the year. This EPS performance is not only better than the outlook provided in October, but also better than the pre-COVID outlook provided in February on our Investor Day, and caps a successful first year as a public company. As we look forward to 2021, on Slide 10, we feel confident of growth across all key metrics, given the higher starting New Equipment backlog, resiliency of the maintenance business in 2020, normalizing job site and building access levels, and our focus on operational excellence. Service callbacks, our proxy for repair volume is also showing continued sequential improvement. Even though the rate of improvement slowed in Q4, due to the resurgence of COVID-19 pandemic, we do expect year-over-year compares to turn favorable in the second quarter of 2021. These encouraging trends, combined with a strong foundation we built in 2020 gives us confidence to grow overall organic sales by 2% to 4% with adjusted operating profit by $125 million to $175 million with 30 basis points to 40 basis points of margin expansion. We expect sales, operating profit, and margins to improve in both segments. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.67 to $2.77, up 8% or $0.20 at the midpoint. This year-over-year increase is driven by strong operating profit outlook, and a 90-basis point reduction in the adjusted tax rate to 29.5%, partially offset by a $12 million increase in interest cost from the full-year impact of debt placed at spin. We expect free cash flow in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, with conversion at approximately 120% of GAAP net income. This reflects a strong earnings growth outlook, partially offset by incremental interest, and non-recurring tax related payments in 2021. Given our strong working capital performance in 2020, a reduction of more than 90 million or close to 25% from 2019 year-end balances we're holding working capital flat in 2021 at the mid-point of our outlook. Our capital deployment plans remain on track. And we have completed the previously disclosed $500 million of debt repayment with $150 million payment in January and expect share repurchases of $300 million in 2021, a year ahead of the original schedule at spin. Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 11. The New Equipment business is projected to be up between 2% to 5% driven by accelerated conversion of the backlog that was up 2% in 2020 and the expected return to growth in the market. We expect broad-based recovery with all three regions returning to growth in 2021. America is up low-to-mid single-digits, EMEA up low-single-digits, and Asia up mid-single-digits driven by growth in China. In the service segment, we expect maintenance and repair sales to be up 2% to 4%, with maintenance sales growing from a stable base and recovery in discretionary repairs that will accelerate post Q1. Modernization sales should be up low-to-mid single-digits with Asia Pacific maintaining the growth momentum from an effective go to market strategy to tap into the demand created by the regulatory requirements, and other regions returning to growth as they convert the higher year-end backlog. Overall, the sales growth of 2% to 4% represents a solid turnaround after difficult 2020 with growth across all regions and all lines of business. Switching to operating profit on Slide 12. We expect operating profit to be up $125 million to $175 million, and up $75 million to $125 million at constant currency, reflecting the benefit of volumes, returning to pre-COVID levels, and continued strong contribution from material and service productivity to offset the headwinds from pricing in the New Equipment market, increases in commodity prices, step-up in maintenance expenses, and incremental standalone costs in the first half of the year. This outlook represents the third consecutive year of strong earnings growth as we continue to execute the basics, deal with the challenges, leverage the investments we have made in the business and benefit from a market recovery. And with that, I'll request Justin to please open the line for questions. Sure. Good morning, Jeff. So, we've seen earnings momentum going into 2021, with earnings up close to $50 million in the second half of 2020. And we are projecting to continue this momentum into 2021. So, if you look at the New Equipment segment, there's a couple of drivers that are driving the growth in 2021 on the earnings side. The biggest piece of that is that segment returns to growth in 2021, after a challenging 2020 with 3.5% organic sales growth at the mid-point, and the drop through we'll get from that is a strong contributor to earnings growth. Along with strong material productivity, we still think we can deliver the 3% material cost productivity after absorbing the impact from commodity headwinds. And this, along with the restructuring actions that we took last year, will help us offset the incremental standalone cost, headwind from some of the actions that we took, some of the short-term actions that we took last year to protect the earnings and any adverse pricing that may materialize. I mean, the pricing was more or less stable . I mean, we were down slightly on the backlog.  So, we expect some headwinds or pricing, but we obviously are building that into our guidance. So, the key here is that we are able to grow margins of the New Equipment side despite the commodity headwinds, increase in standalone cost, temporary costs coming back, and the pricing pressures. This has been the key part of our strategy. We've been talking about it since our first earnings call back in April last year that we understand the challenges we are facing, and we have these operational excellence programs that we're working on, whether it's backlog acceleration, or material productivity to deal with anything that may arise. So, we feel good about where we sit, Jeff \u2013 sit here right now, Jeff. Yes. No, it's coming in \u2013 the \u2013 our operational excellence not only is based in what we do in the factory, but also it's equally important what we do in the field. And we track that thing very, very closely, Jeff. Every month, every quarter, we get reports from every country around the world, and our delivered margin consistently is above our booked margin. So, that and \u2013 and that will be \u2013 that we will continue to push that and along with pushing material productivity in the field as well. So, the booked, the delivered margin is higher than a booked margin. The other way, Nigel, just to add to that is that you can almost look at the two - the guide of 2% to 5% with our backlog up on the New Equipment revenue. With our backlog up 2%, you can almost look at that as a floor, right, because that's what we're starting with. And then, Judy mentioned about the acceleration of backlog. We demonstrated that in the fourth quarter of 2020 driving substantially higher organic revenue than where our starting backlog was at the beginning of the quarter. So that shows the steps that we are taking to accelerate a backlog conversion is happening, and we'll continue that into 2021. And then, obviously, the markets are coming back. And that is what Judy was talking about. We expect, I mean Judy shared the data that we are expecting growth across the world with Asia up mid-single digits. So that helps the growth as well. But you start with 2%, add on the backlog conversion, and then add on the market recovery that gets us to the 2% to 5% range. The \u2013 yes. Absolutely. Steve, the \u2013 at constant currency, the backlog is up 2%, which is what we're talking to. But at actual FX, we benefited from backlog conversion that's having up about 6% at reported numbers. And Steve, just to add to that, we continue to do really, really well in the Tier 3 to Tier 6 [series], and that has been our bread and butter. We've done well over the last five, six years there, we've continued to gain share in those markets. And those markets was slightly slow to recover in the Tier 1 markets, and you know, that's where we need to do the work as we've previously discussed, that's odd where some of our publicly traded peers have a slightly stronger share. But I think the agents and distributors that we've added this year with that we're confident we'll do better next year or in 2021 in those, you know, Tier 1 markets as well. But our success in 2020 was in the Tier 3 to Tier 6 series. The 2% was a full-year number Cai. So, that's a full-year number. So, I think that's where we ended the year, and you know, in the growth that we saw in the quarter was all organic. There was, you know, I don't think there's any acquisition worth speaking about. So, it was all organic? It depends on where, you know, it just depends on \u2013 the way you should look at it is, where we ended Q3 last year versus Q3 of 2019. You know, it's a year-over-year growth, but you know, for the, you know, like, this is a Q4, it's a balance sheet number, right. That's a way to think about it. So, it's in, in Q4 of 2020, at the end of 2020, we ended up at, you know, 2% higher units versus where we ended at in 2019. Yes. So, our commodity spend Cai is about - total commodity spend is about $300 million, out of which about 80% is steel. And you're right, you know, if you look at, kind of what we are seeing right now, for 2021, steel is about 7% to 8%, maybe a little higher in Q1 right now, and the fall was a little bit lower. So, it averages out to about 7% to 8%. So, the way we are thinking about the commodity issue for next year is, it was a tailwind in 2020. It's for 2021. It is a headwind given where the steel prices sits today. And the spreadsheet math would suggest, hey, that could be like a $20 million plus headwind for us. But the other part that is simultaneously happened is that both Euro and RMB have appreciated against the dollar, and the buy in local currency in both Europe and China.  So, we should be able to offset part of this commodity increase by just appreciation of the local currency. So that's one piece of it. The second piece is that we're working really, really hard on material productivity to offset the commodity headwinds. I think that's what Julie said earlier. And we're starting 2021 in a much, much better position than we did in 2020 given the cadence that we gained last year, and a carryover benefit from the projects that we started mid-year in 2020 is higher than where we were at this point last year.  So, we still think we can deliver 3% material productivity after absorbing the commodity headwinds and grow a New Equipment margins, which is, you know, what I said earlier, in response to Jeff's question. The other piece, you know, to the extent that dollar weakness is causing the commodity headwinds, we're also seeing the $50 million FX gain on our, you know, on earnings overall. So, it's in a different line of the P&L, but, you know, some of the commodity weakness is because of appreciation of the depreciation of the dollar, but we gain that on the overall earnings side. So a little bit of a trade-off. But overall, you know, it is an issue, but it's built into our guidance and we feel we can get to 3%, material productivity and grow our New Equipment margins in 2021. Yes. So, let me start with cash and then we can talk about the [indiscernible] payment. So, you know, if you look at our cash, really strong year last year. We ended $150 million better than what we had guided and the net income came in better, working capital was really good. And as I said in my prepared remarks, reduced working capital were $90 million, which is a quarter for working capital, which was a fantastic performance given you know, what you hear overall, and as we look at 2021, the biggest driver is improvement in earnings, Julian, as you referenced, but there are two issues that we are trying to deal with next year. One is, just the timing of the interest payments. So, just the way where the interest payments landed, we do have an extra interest payment in 2021, which we did not have in 2020, given the timing of when we raised debt. The other issue is that we do need to make a tax-related payment for an old tax matter that we've inherited from UTC. So, we've built that into our guidance as well. That matter is still ongoing, but we've built that into our guidance. As I said in my prepared remarks, we have not built any working capital improvement into our guidance at this point. We'll obviously keep working at the midpoint of our guidance, because when we'll keep working, we'll keep working there hard. But our plan at this point doesn't contemplate that. You know, 1.35 billion for 2021 is a solid number. It's 120% of GAAP net income, and, you know, substantially higher than where we expected 2021 to be on Investor Day. So, we think it's a solid start to the year. On NCI for 2020, not any one single driver, it was a combination of various things. You know, couple of them were here and there and then FX was a little bit of a headwind as well. So, I wouldn't read too much into where we ended on NCI for 2020. Good morning, John. Yes, no John. So, the typical, I would say the, you know, the order to the ship time on elevators is about 12 months in North America. That's what we said before. So that's where we are. The comment on awards, which typically proceed orders by a couple of months, and they were stable in the quarter. That was a North America comment. But you know, if you look at America's overall, John, I think the markets are, kind of uncertain, right? I mean, we've seen as Judy mentioned, in her prepared remarks, we've seen good growth in Asia, we know, kind of [feel good] about the mid-single-digit growth there. If you look at EMEA, we feel good about the low-single-digit. Americas remains challenging, and the market was down mid-teens last year. So, obviously, we did better than the market. And if you look at the Dodge momentum index that just turned strongly positive in December, for the first time in several months. So that's an initial sign of recovery since COVID, but if you look at the architectural billings index, that's still under 50. But now the inquiries have been positive for four months straight. So, kind of mixed signals. And if you look at the range of guidance that we are giving, you know, part of that range is driven by the America's growth outlook. So that's a contributor to that. But you know, overall, again, I think, you know, we discussed with Nigel earlier, you know, we feel good about all the steps that we've taken in terms of improving our sales coverage, you know, kind of, you know, 7 points in China, 10 points, overall new product introductions. Our proposals were up 7% last year. So that, obviously, is another good sign that we can keep building on this momentum that we have, and the share gain that we've enjoyed, we can keep building on that. But the America's market is uncertain, but that's what we built into our guidance. Good morning, Carter. Yes. The overall conversion kind of hung in there at about [60%-ish] Carter. So, not a lot of change to the overall conversions. We said China was up about a point and a half. So, that was good momentum. And you know, the only other thing is the retention rate for us, which is very, very critical was at 94% in 2020, versus 93% in 2019. So that picked up as well. So, that's good. So good momentum in the service business. Obviously, you saw that come through the results as well. Thanks Carter. No. 20 million is just the commodity piece. We think we will offset that Nigel with a 3% material productivity and we will deliver 3% net productivity after absorbing that $20 million headwind. So that's just a commodity piece. On the tax savings, you know, it's kind of in tens of millions, Nigel, so it's a big number. It's not a small number. You know, it's a tax matter. So, we will, you know, we will continue dealing with it. Again, no P&L impact. The P&L is all accrued. It is basically a cash outflow for us in 2021. There will be a few, you know, tax matters that will continue. We had this old toll tax if you guys remember from \u2013 you guys have been following UTC for a long time and that will continue for a few years. But that's not a year-over-year change, Nigel, and that's in the $15 million to $20 million of cash outflow every year. So that's not a big number, but this is one of the biggest issues that we have remaining from separation."

Presentation materials are available for download from Otis' website at www.otis.com. I will now turn it over to Stacy Laszewski, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations.\nStacy Laszewski: Thank you, Sonia and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Otis' Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Judy Marks, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rahul Ghai, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and significant non-recurring items. The company will also refer to adjusted results where adjustments were made as though Otis was a stand-alone company in the current period and the prior year. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis' SEC filings, including our Form 10 and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Stacy and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us and we hope that everyone listening is safe and well. To start, I want to thank each of our colleagues around the world for their unwavering dedication as we continue to deliver on our commitments to passengers, customers, and shareholders. Overall, as you'll see in our results, our business is trending back towards pre-COVID levels, improving sequentially across all metrics.  I'm pleased to share that we had a very strong quarter. We gained share in new equipment, paid down debt, and are raising our outlook with Rahul providing additional details. Our strategy is robust despite the unique environment we're in and as an example of our ability to continue to execute, this quarter we completed the acquisition of Bay State Elevator, expanding our scale and density in the Northeast United States. We're delighted to have the Bay State colleagues join the Otis team, and we remain focused on accelerating growth of the service portfolio, both organically and inorganically. Our bolt on M&A strategy is working and serves as an accretive source of growth.  Innovation is core to Otis. COVID accelerates the need for new health and safety solutions, which we expect to continue post COVID. Otis is a leader in this space, continuing to bring new products to market and during the quarter we commissioned an elevator airflow study examining the risk of airborne transmission in elevators and how to best mitigate those risks through science based safety protocols. This study is being led by a Purdue University expert in the spread and prevention of infectious diseases through indoor air systems. We look forward to sharing these findings in the coming months.  Furthering our ability to provide innovative cutting edge products, we opened a new industry 4.0 escalator factory in East China that incorporates intelligent manufacturing, advanced automation, and digital technologies such as 3-D modeling, custom engineering, and real time quality management. This move continues to rationalize our footprint and build on our legacy of excellence while upgrading our smart manufacturing capabilities for a new era. We continue to deploy iPhones to our field professionals, adding four more countries during this quarter, and the adoption of our suite of apps continues to expand driving service productivity within the organization. In addition, our IoT deployment continues to build momentum, and we have plans in place to enhance the capability of Otis ONE solutions over the next several months to drive productivity in our organization. Despite the challenges introduced by the pandemic, we continue to deploy these units in the U.S., Europe, and China during the first nine months and expect the pace of deployment to accelerate.  Otis also received several key orders across each of the regions, highlighted on Slide 3. In Chicago we received an order to outfit the new Salesforce Tower Chicago office building with over 30 sky rise and Gen 2 elevators. Each of the passenger elevators will have our new innovative Compass 360 dispatching system allowing for seamless travel in a 60 story building. In China Otis was selected to support Tianjin\u2019s Metro Expansion Project, we will add approximately 120 elevators to Line 6, bringing the total number of Otis elevators and escalators throughout the Tianjin Metro to approximately 1400 units. This award extends Otis's involvement in infrastructure development in the region, a key strategy for us. And in France, we're helping bring La D\u00e9fense the business area of Paris to new heights with an order to deliver 60 elevators and several escalators to The Link, the next tallest building in France. This project will include CompassPlus, eCall, and OptiSense technologies, creating a faster, safer and more seamless trip for the passengers.  These are just a handful of examples that led to the approximate 70 basis points of new equipment share gain during the first nine months. In terms of liquidity we ended Q3 with $1.7 billion of cash and continue to maintain a revolving credit facility which serves as a backstop for our commercial paper issuances and an additional source of liquidity if needed. We also made progress on our debt repayment goal of $350 million in 2020, repaying $250 million in the quarter. And as we remain dedicated to delivering results for our customers and shareholders, our commitment to global corporate citizenship has not wavered.  Last quarter, I shared with you the launch of our commitment to change. In just three months we are going to make Otis a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture and identify and prioritize actions we need to take to get there. For example, in the quarter we enlisted an outside diversity equity and inclusion expert to independently assess our practices and provide recommendations to guide future decisions and programs. Later during the quarter, we launched Made to Move Communities, a CSR program focused on advancing youth STEM education and providing inclusive mobility solutions for communities in need. This extends Otis's ongoing commitment to the communities where we live and work and we look forward to providing the avenue and resources to help young minds explore new ways to give people freedom to connect and thrive in a taller, faster, smarter world.  Turning to Slide 4, Q3 results and 2020 outlook. New equipment orders were up slightly at constant currency with low single-digit growth in EMEA and Asia partially offset by low single-digit decline in the Americas. China orders were up high single-digits as the business continued its rapid recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. On a rolling 12 months, total Otis orders were down approximately 1%. New equipment backlog continued to grow up 3% versus the prior year at constant currency. In the third quarter, organic sales were down 1.2% with the new equipment segment down 1% and the service segment down 1.4%. Adjusted operating profit was up $33 million and margin expanded 120 basis points, driven by continued expansion in the service segment on strong contribution from productivity and the benefit from cost containment actions and favorable transactional foreign exchange.  Free cash flow was robust at $311 million, with 117% conversion of GAAP net income. While there remains uncertainty around the global recovery from the pandemic, we are encouraged by these strong year-to-date results and the trends we're experiencing, giving us confidence to revise our 2020 outlook. We are improving the organic sales range now expected to be down 2% to 3%. Adjusted operating profit is now expected to be in the range of up $30 million to $40 million, a $60 million improvement versus the prior outlook at the midpoint. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $2.42, up $0.17 versus the prior midpoint. This reflects our improved adjusted operating profit outlook, lower adjusted tax rate, and lower net interest costs. Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust at approximately $1.15 billion, with full year free cash flow conversion at approximately 135% of GAAP net income.  With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and outlook in more detail.\nRahul Ghai: Thank you, Judy and good morning everyone. Starting with third quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3.3 billion, down 1.4% with a 1.2% decline in organic sales. As anticipated, both the new equipment and service segments declined organically primarily from the impact of COVID-19. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was up approximately 7% or $33 million and up $30 million at constant currency, as the impact of lower volume, temporary price concessions, and field inefficiencies was more than offset by strong productivity, cost containment, and favorable transactional effects. Our focus on reducing material cost continues to yield results and maintenance hours per unit sustained a downward trajectory. Cost containment efforts that we launched in Q1 of 2020 also helped alleviate the pressure from lower volume and year-to-date SG&A expense was down by more than $60 million year-over-year.  At the same time, we continued to invest in the business and R&D expense as a percentage of sales was about flat versus the prior year. Our strong focus on operational execution drove 120 basis points of adjusted margin expansion with continued margin improvement in the service segment. Third quarter adjusted EPS was up 25% or $0.14 from $0.06 of operating profit growth and the balance from a lower adjusted tax rate and a drop in interest costs. These results were better than we had expected in the previous outlook, driven by the stability of the maintenance business, higher savings from service productivity, and progress on reducing the adjusted tax rate.  Moving to Slide 6, new equipment orders were up slightly at constant currency and were down approximately 1% on a rolling 12-month basis. Order intake continues to outperform the market and regained approximately 40 basis points of share in the third quarter in a market that was down low single-digits. Book margins were up slightly in the quarter and were flat year-to-date versus the prior year. In the quarter, book margin improvement in China and North America was partially offset by pressure in parts of Asia Pacific and EMEA. New equipment backlog was up 3% at constant currency driven by growth in the Americas, with overall backlog margin improving slightly from Q2 and remaining stable versus the prior year. New equipment organic sales were down 1% as mid-single-digit growth in China was more than offset by declines in Asia-Pacific and parts of EMEA. At constant currency, new equipment adjusted operating profit was down $9 million and margin contracted 50 basis points as strong material productivity and cost containment was more than offset by the impact of under absorption, field inefficiencies, and an unfavorable mix.  Service segment results on Slide 7 remained strong in the quarter. Number of units under maintenance contracts increased by over 1% with growth in all major regions and China up more than 6%. Modernization orders were down 7.3% at constant currency as double-digit growth in Asia, driven by the mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets was more than offset by lower order intake in the Americas and EMEA. Service organic sales were down 1.4% as maintenance demand remains strong while discretionary repair and modernization projects were pushed out. At constant, currency adjusted operating profit margin expanded 140 basis points and profit grew $19 million, a strong contribution from productivity and cost containment actions more than offset the impact from volume decline, temporary price concessions, and an increase in bad debt expense. The service pricing environment, excluding the impact of these price concessions was about flat.  Overall, year-to-date results reflect solid performance with $33 million of adjusted profit growth at constant currency and 90 basis points of margin expansion despite organic sales being down 3.3% versus the prior year. The service business was particularly resilient with adjusted operating profit growth of $47 million at constant currency on a slight decline in organic sales, in an extremely challenging market environment. Also, third quarter results reflect sequential improvement in both segments and steady progress towards returning to pre-COVID levels. Access to job sites and buildings has largely returned to normal outside of India and Southeast Asia, and the service call volume is back to 2019 levels in China and Asia-Pacific. And the trends are heading in the right direction in Europe and Americas. We are improving our 2020 outlook to reflect strong progress during the year and these encouraging trends.  Turning to Slide 8, we now expect overall organic sales to be down 2% to 3% for the year, up from prior expectations of down 2% to 4% with improvement in both new equipment and service segments. We now expect new equipment sales to be down mid-single-digits and service sales to be flat to down slightly. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $30 million to $40 million at constant currency for the year with 60 to 70 basis points of margin expansion. This is an improvement of $60 million versus the prior outlook at midpoint reflecting the strong year-to-date performance, benefit from an improved sales outlook, and higher service productivity. At actual currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $5 million to $15 million, reflecting favorable foreign exchange trends in addition to the operational improvement. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be up 8% versus the prior year to approximately $2.42 and up $0.17 versus the prior midpoint driven by an improved operating profit outlook, lower net interest cost, and a reduced tax rate. We now expect the adjusted tax rate for the year to be about 30.5% down one point versus the prior outlook.  Taking a further look at the organic growth assumptions on Slide 9, in the new equipment segment, Americas is now expected to be down mid-single-digits, reflecting strong recovery in the third quarter with sequential improvement and year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. EMEA is now expected to be down mid to high single-digits, reflecting a strong recovery in Northern and Eastern Europe. We are improving the Asia outlook driven by better than expected third quarter performance in China. However, we expect Asia to be down in the fourth quarter due to continuing challenges in India and Southeast Asia.  In the service segment, we expect the maintenance and repair business to be flat to down slightly with the maintenance sales remaining resilient and a slower recovery in discretionary repairs. We are raising the modernization outlook to be about flat for the year, driven by better than expected performance in Asia Pacific from an effective go to market strategy to tap into the demand created by regulatory requirements. Overall, the outlook of 2% to 3% organic sales decline reflects sequential improvement and return to pre-COVID levels in the fourth quarter at the midpoint.  Switching to operating profit on Slide 10, at constant currency operating profit is now expected to be up $30 million to $40 million versus the prior year, reflecting the benefit of solid contribution from materials and service productivity and cost containment actions that are more than offsetting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic, incremental under absorption of costs, and temporary price concessions in the service business. This represents a $60 million improvement versus the prior expectations with improvements in both new equipment and service segments. The fourth quarter outlook includes incremental investments in the new equipment and service sales channel in China, additional cost to complete the maintenance visits, sequentially higher R&D expense, and the expected step up in public company costs. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of approximately $25 million, an improvement from a headwind of $40 million to $50 million that we had expected in July, primarily due to the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar.  An update on capital deployment on Slide 11. We started 2020 with about $1.4 billion of cash and now expect to generate approximately $1.15 billion of free cash flow in 2020, an improvement of $100 million versus the prior midpoint from higher net income and an improved working capital performance. As Judy mentioned, we repaid $250 million of debt in the quarter with another $100 million of repayment planned for Q4. We also refinanced $500 million of the U.S. stone [ph] room towards Euro Commercial Paper Program, our first foreign currency denominated debt transaction, as we continued to evaluate our capital structure. We still expect to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in Q2 through Q4 and spent approximately $200 million between non-controlling interest and M&A. These actions will allow us to maintain sufficient liquidity and position us to increase cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year, giving us optionality depending on the overall liquidity conditions to start share buyback in 2021. After we complete the previously disclosed $500 million of debt repayment. With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for closing remarks.\nJudy Marks: Thanks Rahul. I'm pleased with our year-to-date performance navigating continued COVID challenges while continuing to drive our long-term strategy all in our first year as a standalone company. In early 2021, we'll provide an update on our 2021 and medium term outlook for we continue to expect sustainable growth and global share and are seeing traction with new equipment share of approximately 70 basis points year-to-date. This growth will continue to feed our leading service portfolio, where we remain focused on service transformation initiatives, deploying IoT and digital tools that drive value for our customers, productivity, and margin expansion. We remain committed to driving value for our shareholders, driving EPS growth and robust cash generation, all while investing at sustainable levels to position us to stay at the forefront of this industry. With that, I'd like Sonia to open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Your line is now open.\nCarter Copeland: Hey, good morning everybody. \nJudy Marks: Good morning, Carter.\nCarter Copeland: Just quick ones. One, the Bay State acquisition, did that add any meaningful amount to the service portfolio growth you talked about in the Americas? And then just as a follow-up on Otis ONE and pricing differentials you've seen on those connected units or what your expectation is for those in the future, just high level thoughts on that would be appreciated? Thanks.\nJudy Marks: You bet. So Bay State, again, pleased to have them join the Otis family, but that is not material in terms of what contributed to the portfolio growth in the Americas, specifically in North America for the quarter. In terms of Otis ONE, we are ramping up and accelerating our deployment. We've seen productivity gains but in terms of additional subscriptions or revenue, it's still early in terms of where we're able to gain traction on that. It's certainly adding value and productivity, we've seen that in China, we've seen it in Spain, and we're now seeing and hearing from our mechanics in North America in terms of how it's giving them the ability to show up quicker, to have less running on arrivals when they get there because they know it's already running on arrival and they don't have to actually make that service call. So we're pleased with the early results, but it's not anything that's really added to the top line in terms of subscription revenue yet.\nRahul Ghai: So just to add to that Carter, Otis ONE joins the suite of other connected applications that we have like destination dispatch system, elevator management system, and those applications combined add about 30% to 40% of the subscription revenue. So as Judy said our first focus on Otis ONE is productivity and we do feel the benefit to the customer, both in terms of visibility and better uptime that we can provide will start adding incremental and additional revenue over time. And we see that in Asia and other parts of Europe where we do have remote service capability that we provide through even the phone lines. We are able to get incremental price in those units. So it will help over time but our first focus has been productivity on Otis ONE as we previously stated.\nCarter Copeland: Great, thank you for the color. I'll let somebody else ask.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, guys. Good morning. \nJudy Marks: Hey, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: So just first of all on the kind of new equipment guide for the year, it just looks like you kind of took up the high end of the range for some of those or at least move those higher at the high end. And, you're really only removing the low end of the range, is that just kind of some rounding error around some of the regions, it just seems like maybe that total number should have moved up a bit more?\nRahul Ghai: We -- Steve, you're right. I mean, we did kind of looked across all the regions and we did -- we have improved the bottom end of the range and down from mid to high single-digits to down mid-single-digits and keep in mind it was down 5% to 10% on the Q1 call. So continued movement in the right direction. And the outlook has improved kind of across all the regions. Strong performance in Q3 and especially in China and the Americas and at the mid and the high end, we have growth planned for Q4. So, there could be some rounding because we don\u2019t give specific ranges, so I think you can take that offline if there are certain questions. But overall we feel really good about the way the business is moving and we do expect growth in EMEA and Americas at the mid and the high end of the range. So that's -- we feel good about our guidance.\nSteve Tusa: And then just listening to some of these other guys, I mean, Kone, Schindler and you guys are all talking about intense price pressure. And I think Schindler mentioned pricing like 50 times in its presentation or something like that using round numbers. Yet you guys are saying that your booked margin was actually okay in the quarter. Can you try and reconcile like what you're seeing financially in your orders and your business, is it something in the pipeline that you guys all see that is sneaking up on you from a price perspective, it's just going to be a matter of timing or is that just, hey, this is COVID, things are flying around where it's uncertain. So, we just don't want to make any price -- promises on price because it just seems like there's a lot more high-level caution around price, but I don't really see it in orders or the numbers, can you just kind of help reconcile that?\nJudy Marks: Yes. So, Steve in the third quarter, we saw better volumes, you know our productivity remains strong and our pricing held. Our orders were up slightly and you said it, we are up 20 basis points in both margin and really pleased with that improvement, especially coming after the second quarter where we had 70 basis points going the other way and we grew our backlog. So every 3%, where we're going with 3% up in backlog. So while we're seeing -- the market's competitive, pricing was competitive in the third quarter, we would tell you the place it was most competitive was in North America. And but we are seeing -- we had low single-digit gains in terms of EMEA and Asia, high single-digit gains in China, and low single-digit we were down in the Americas. So, so far we're dealing with what we can control, which is winning the business, growing the share. We grew at about 40 basis points and then executing on that backlog by driving as much productivity and cost control as we can. And this backlog, by growing is really going to feed our 2021 and put us in a pretty good position there. So we were pleased with what we saw Q3 versus Q2 and all the sequential improvements. But we would -- I would tell you, it is getting more competitive certainly in North America on pricing.\nRahul Ghai: And then to add, Steve just sort of -- just maybe a couple of points to add to what Judy said, our year-to-date booked margins are flat. So that's going to -- that's a good thing. First quarter was up, second quarter was down, third quarter was up. So year-to-date the booked margin are flat for the nine months of the year. And the other point is our backlog is up and the backlog margins are sequentially better than Q2 and flat to last year. So that goes back to the comment that you made on the pipeline, right. So our backlog margins, which would drive revenue for next year those margins are flat. And again, we do -- this is the story we've been saying since our kind of our Investor Day that we do expect tough pricing environment. We've expected it. Obviously, the macro economic conditions are not great, but the focus that we have on driving productivity and the fact that we've been hitting a 3% target now for nine months and we constantly are going to hit for 12 months and that is -- that focus is unwavering. So we'll continue to improve our execution installation, our maintenance productivity, and if there is pricing pressure, we'll find a way to offset that.\nSteve Tusa: One last quick one for you guys. We're all trying to kind of learn how to compare all these companies over time. And I guess you guys defined share gain differently. These companies, your competitors say different things about the markets. When you guys talk about your kind of market share and how you're competing, are you looking at like very high level numbers versus the Schindler's and the Kone\u2019s of the world, or are you saying within our specific verticals that's kind of how we analyze it, because that obviously would explain why it's not directly necessarily like a one for one read from a Kone or a Schindler or are you looking kind of high level globally and you're not really paying attention to fighting with those guys and across the different verticals like residential, commercial infrastructure, etcetera?\nRahul Ghai: Yeah, so when we talk about share Steve, we talk about how we have done versus the market. So again, I think Kone and Schindler report and the other companies that don't, so we don't know who exactly we're gaining share from. But the fact is, when we compare our orders, we know that we've outgrown the market and that's how we compare it. So if you look at, it's flat for the quarter, down 1% on a rolling 12-month basis and obviously in this environment, the market we know is down more than 1% on a rolling 12-month basis. And we are down about two points year-to-date. So that's a fairly strong performance given the environment. And so based on the analysis that we do, we believe, as Judy said in her prepared remarks, that we think we've gained about 70 basis points of share and that has allowed us to grow our backlog by about three points. \nJudy Marks: And Steve we task every one of our countries to beat share, to grow share in their country and that's going to continue through 2021. So we do look at it at a pretty finite level.\nSteve Tusa: Great, thanks a lot. Appreciate it. \nRahul Ghai: Thanks, Steve. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open. \nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Hey, maybe just the first question around the orders out looking in new equipment. They are sort of flattish in the third quarter globally, down a touch on a trailing 12 months basis. When you look at the overall environment, do you think that this is kind of a status quo level that you're at now for the foreseeable few quarters, maybe there's some regional differences so Americas gets a bit better, but then you start to see China rolling over as comps get tougher, maybe just help us understand how we should think about orders for the next couple of quarters? \nRahul Ghai: Yeah. So Julian, it's hard to comment, right, I mean it's hard to comment on the orders but we are pleased with the performance we have year-to-date. And, go back to what we said on the last call that for 2021 our priorities were that we wanted to end the year in a strong backlog position. And being up 3% year-to-date obviously gives us a lot of confidence. And what we want to -- to take it a step further, our next step obviously is the fact that we want to accelerate the backlog conversion for 2021 and that gives us confidence to grow our new equipment business and not have the volume related headwinds that we've had this year. So that's kind of our focus for driving new equipment revenue next year. In terms of market, I think Judy can comment as well but, the picture is mixed. I mean, the fact is we're seeing a pretty -- we are seeing a sharp bounce back in China. The other market is a little bit softer as you would expect. And, the projections are a little bit harder based on the data we are seeing, there's a little bit of a snap back in Asia and in China and then -- and Europe looks okay as well. North America is a little bit more mixed but we'll see where that goes. But what we're focused on is kind of driving what we can control. And the other point I want to make up is our proposal activity, our proposal activity year-to-date is up double-digits. And that goes to all the things that we've been saying we are going to do in terms of expanding our sales coverage, adding more salespeople. We've added more than 100 salespeople year-to-date. Added 700 more channel partners in China. So that allows us to even in a down market, increase our proposal activity and hopefully that means well for our orders to come.\nJudy Marks: Yeah and Steve, I'm sorry, Julian. Let me just add one item. We've really tried to take a hard look at the past few weeks or months or certainly starting into this quarter of with the rebound of COVID cases, are we seeing any changes? We're still continuing to see new starts in Europe. We're cautious in North America, especially on non-res. But the Asian economies have turned the corner and China is accelerating and we expect growth next year in the China segment.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you very much. And then maybe my second question around the cost and profit outlook. So looking at Slide 20, the standalone costs guidance for this year has come down about 20 million versus the prior guide, but the run rate on standalone costs is unchanged. So I was trying to understand, does that mean that we get a step up in those costs just in the P&L as we see it, of that sort of 40 millionish number into next year or am I misreading it? And then also the separation costs, I think those were close to $30 million in Q3. Did those separation costs abate in fourth quarter or do we still get some into next year? \nRahul Ghai: Yeah, no. All good questions Julian. So, on the sort of -- we have been like focused on reducing our SG&A, right. And we have said that right since Q1 and obviously driving the $60 million reduction year-over-year is fantastic. And you see some of that coming through lower public company cost. And that is a good sign. We don't have a 2021 number yet. We didn't want to update you guys on one number for 2021 versus providing the context and the framework for how everything else will be. So again, our goal is to not get to 175, but we will provide more color and more guidance as we talk about the rest of 2021. So, more to come on that. But good news that we are able to instead of being at 150 we are 130 for this year just shows you the focus and the discipline that we have inside the company. In terms of stamp on [ph] cost and separation cost I think our number is 140 to 170, that's the number we had said, and that's largely between this year and Q1 of next year. I think we will be tracking to that. I think the year-to-date numbers are around $85 million so that is between $80 million and $85 million. So far, the rest between Q4 and Q1 and that would be the end of that separation cost.\nJulian Mitchell: Perfect. Thank you. \nRahul Ghai: Thank you, Julian.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is now open.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I just wondered if we could focus a little bit more picks up on a couple of the earlier threads, but kind of how and where you're competing. And what I mean by that is, in addition to Kone and Schindler, which we can all see, right, there's probably another competitor that really matter but interestingly in the quarter, it does seem your orders did not grow nearly as much as they did, but your total orders on a global basis actually matched them. Obviously, there can be a lot of noise in a quarter, but are you purposely being more selective in China or are you pursuing kind of opportunities that are maybe further below the radar screen that are inherently more profitable or maybe it's all just a coincidence in the quarter? That's the first question.\nJudy Marks: Yes, so in China Jeff, our orders are up high single-digit, our book margin was up for the quarter in China, so we return to really getting price in China or new equipment, which was important to us. Our sales were up mid-single-digit. We also got price on service and grew our service portfolio 6% in China and grew our share year-to-date in China. So we think we've got a solid performance. We did well in the Tier One and Tier Two cities, and especially in some of our strategic verticals like infrastructure, where we've been spending a lot of time and investment. Rahul will share that, we've added over almost 750 agents and distributors in China this year, which has been an intense focus on us to have greater reach and greater capability to provide to see the different opportunities. And again, we return to profit -- to positive booked margin there and we're pleased with that. We continue to invest in China with our new factory, and we're going to continue to make investments in the sales channel in China in Q4, as Rahul mentioned in his remarks, to get us prepared for what we think is going to be a growth segment and growth for us significantly in 2021.\nJeffrey Sprague: Right, and then maybe just back to the backlog commentary, certainly understand the relationship and what you're alluding to is an exit backlog growth rate a pretty good indicator of what we should expect for new equipment growth, maybe you could give us just a little bit more color on kind of conversion cycles and Rahul, you made the comment about trying to accelerate conversion of the backlog, just a little more color on how the whole algorithm works, if you could?\nRahul Ghai: Yeah, so just typically what we see is we see in any given year, this is now I am going back a little bit to pre-COVID because what we typically used to see is about two thirds of our revenue, new equipment revenue in a given year coming from backlog. So that's what we would have typically seen. This year it has been a little bit lower just given all the disruptions that we've had, both in the field and in the factories. And our goal is, I think we said previously, our goal is not only to get back to 2019 levels, but drive it a little bit higher than that. And so we'll continue and provide more color and more guidance as we talk about 2021. But typically what you see is two thirds of the revenue for next year coming from backlog.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning. \nJudy Marks: Hey, John. \nJohn Walsh: Hey, I guess maybe just the first one following on a couple of the pricing questions and sorry to keep bringing up pricing, but when I look at your bridge on Slide 10 and then I just go through each of the last quarters, the new equipment commentary that was called out, we haven't seen pricing and bad debt yet. So I was just curious if that's some conservatism because we're still in COVID or once again, I think to an earlier question that, you know, something's actually going to hit in Q4, so it's just a timing related issue?\nRahul Ghai: We have had the bad debt is higher, a little bit year-over-year. It hasn't been material enough to call out, but you would expect that in an environment like this, in the credit environment, you would have incremental bad debt and we being appropriately cautious, I would say, on how we are reserving for stock. So if we are seeing things go in the wrong direction, we are providing adequate reserves for that. So bad debt has been with us through the first nine months. And again, it's not -- it hasn't been material enough to call out on each refinance but cumulatively kind of adds up. So it is okay. Pricing you are right, it hasn't been, we haven\u2019t called it out as we said our book margins are flat, kind of year-to-date they are flat. Backlog margins are flat. But again, we are expecting a little bit of conservatism for Q4 just in case things happen. So you're right, on pricing for new equipment that is a common mode for Q4 and this does affect a little bit of conservatism on our part.\nJohn Walsh: Great, now that's helpful clarification and then maybe just a question on understanding the business a little bit better, but as we think about when service pricing takes effect, I think there's some concern that depending on where vacancy rates are or building utilization rates, that we could see some pressure next year on service. But I think the way as I understand it, there's kind of like rolling waves and would only be a portion that might even be impacted. But can you help us understand how that repricing might work on parts of the service portfolio that on any given year just are kind of naturally rolling off contract?\nJudy Marks: So our service contracts are contracts that are multi-year in many parts of the world and annual in others. So each country is a little different. We tend to renew our service contracts in Europe early in the year and we do have price escalators there that are indexed to inflation. And we'll be watching that as we enter next year as well. In the North America where a lot of our service contracts are as well, we find that those are multi-year or the concessions we've given to date have been pretty limited to the hospitality and retail industry only. And as we've shared with our end market exposure, that's a little under 10% for us globally. And those concessions to date have lasted typically for about 90 days and they all came in at staggered times. But as long as a building is open and it's important to note, John, that we also match our cost when those concessions go in terms of the services we deliver. So we've been doing a good job in that. And that's why we've been able to maintain our service margins and our margin expansion. As these come up for renewal, every one of them we discuss with the customers exactly what types of services they need to receive, and then we adjust our costs accordingly. But we have not seen any unusual cancellations on either the new equipment side. Every now and then a job does cancel but on the new equipment side or even on the service side, we've not seen extreme cancellations happening. Right now everybody's kind of watching. And as long as a building is open or -- and minimal use and all the residential buildings are at significant use, we are out there providing maintenance. Our maintenance pricing has held up very resilient and our maintenance has also been very resilient. And really, it's the discretionary repair and modernization where we've had any of the decline in sales as people are making discretionary choices. I hope that was helpful.\nJohn Walsh: Yeah, no, that was very helpful. Appreciate all that color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. \nNigel Coe: Hi, good morning. \nRahul Ghai: Good morning. \nNigel Coe: Yeah, hi. So any -- I mean, there's a lot of depth in the churn of public sector and there are some government concerns around that. Are you seeing any kind of cooling down measures that maybe might impinge on 2021, I mean, are we seeing any RP activity started down a little bit, any concerns on China as it goes into 2021?\nJudy Marks: No, we have not seen -- these cooling measures have been in effect now for almost three years, I would say. And we've not seen any impact on the infrastructure segment, which is mainly public. But even in the private with the property developers, we have not seen any change in volumes or requests for proposals in China. And in China we expected as we started the year this segment to be flat, the segment is actually growing this year and we actually now we believe that the segment will grow again next year. We're looking for a very positive outcome in China next year in 2021.\nRahul Ghai: And Nigel, just to add a couple of just quick data points on that I mean, if you look at the domestic loan volume for the real estate developers, that's actually up year-over-year. I think the estimates are like it's up 4% to 5% and the land value that these developers have prepared is up 13%. So they continue to invest in the business.\nNigel Coe: That's great to hear. And then on the discretionary pay you mentioned, there's some weakness there, what is the nature of this repair that's being differed, is it -- I don't know some cracks in the facade or are we talking here about caps of not working and they're moving down from six to four. Does this create a significant sort of pent up demand as we go into next year? \nJudy Marks: We do believe this is a demand delay and it will create pent up demand on the repair side. On the modernization side, we believe it will occur. It's challenging to determine what quarter that's going to come back, since so much of the modernization is discretionary. But the repair we believe will happen. Some of it we need access to those buildings, some of it the buildings need more usage and the facility managers are just holding on some of those discretionary repairs. We expect it to bounce back and we think we'll see a little more of it in Q4 and as we go into 2021, we expect our bounce back.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, Judy. And then a quick one for Rahul, obviously a lot of cash in the balance sheets. You know, once we get into a more sort of normal environment, whatever that means, how much cash do you think Otis needs to maintain going forward?\nRahul Ghai: Yeah, it's a great question, Nigel, and that's something again we need to -- we need a few quarters under our belt to exactly figure that out. I mean, a lot of the cash is offshore. So that makes it a little bit harder to figure out exactly what that right number is. But safe to say it's not 1.7 billion. I mean, that's easy to say that it's not one. I think we have more cash than what we need, which is appropriate in an environment like this, because if you go back to March or April, when you couldn't borrow in CP market. So, you want to be prepared because life is going to be uncertain, at least for the next three to six months. But beyond that, we feel we don't need 1.7 and I think that's what our promises is to get back cash to shareholders, as and when things settle down a little bit. And we do feel that we should be in a position to accelerate our share buyback from 2022 into 2021. So that is -- again that is a stated objective. And we think we'll get there barring some really, really unforeseen events. So we'll keep watching it. But it's now 1.7 billion and it's lower than that. What exactly that number is, I think we need a few more quarters to know exactly what the right number is.\nNigel Coe: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Denise Molina of Morningstar. Your line is now open.\nDenise Molina: Hi, thanks. Thanks for the question. Denise Molina from Morningstar. I am just trying to go back to the comment you made about the 30% to 40% left on service revenue from the connected services. Are those contracts that you think are adding a couple of hundred basis points of margin on top of what you would normally get on a contract? And then is that level of revenue that's expected to carry across to a wider customer base because if you've got a budget for these kind of yearly contracts, just wondering if you're expecting that to be widely adopted for everyone to kind of have another 30% to 40% in their budgets for these services or do you think they're sort of going to be for a certain high tier of your segment, maybe high population building?\nRahul Ghai: Yeah Denise, so my comment on kind of 30% to 40% was more around the fact. So we have several connected solutions, in addition to Otis ONE. So we have a little bit of a management system. We provide the destination dispatch. We have eView systems that involves -- that are connected. So when you put all that together, that can add about 30% to 40% off the revenue that we get on that unit. And there is not a lot of incremental cost to support that. So you would expect margins to be higher in addition to almost close to -- as close to perfection retention rate as you can get. So the retention rates are very, very high. So there are lots of incremental benefits. And now those ae comments in response to Carter\u2019s question Otis ONE, do you expect incremental revenue from that? Yes, we do. It's not again 30% to 40% is cumulative. So it's not going to double from Otis ONE. But, we do expect incremental revenue because at the end of the day, the customer gets complete visibility on how the portfolio is performing to get higher uptime because as Judy responded earlier, we can dispatch a technician as soon as the unit breaks down. So we know before the customer calls us, we know the unit is down so we can dispatch technician. So the uptimes are higher. So we do expect over time we will get revenue from this. But that has not been our primary focus. We are investing this, we are installing these units at our own cost because we think the productivity benefits outweighs the cost. So that has been our primary focus but over time, we do expect revenue. \nJudy Marks: And Denise, our conversion rates and our retention rates on connected elevators beats our industry leading retention rates across the globe. So we have the ability to actually retain in our service portfolio those connected units at several hundred basis points above what we do with our normal retention rate globally. So that's another added benefit for us. It gives us more years on service and the ability to be with that customer over time, especially when they want additional upgrades over time.\nDenise Molina: Can I just ask one follow-up on that, because we've heard a lot from Kone and Schindler respond on the connected services and I think we're trying to figure out what the difference is amongst the players. But it sounds like the ISPs are the ones that or maybe not [indiscernible] as much as they don't have many elevators kind of feeding information to get those good kind of uptimes. Do you think that's right, do you think that if you were going up against and it's difficult to say that you are going up against another OEM that had the same number of elevators feeding those algorithms, do you think your services would be differentiated still?\nJudy Marks: 55% of the service market right now is controlled by ISPs. That's who are going to get share from to grow our service portfolio above our leading service portfolio of over 2 million units already. And we do believe that with scale and with differentiation comes incredible data and clarity in terms of being able to make decisions, having a data lake, being able to do predictive and transparent maintenance, and as Rahul said to get the -- to roll the trucks and to get our field professionals out there as quick as possible to drive up time. It\u2019s the value of that data and the analytics, that's going to make a difference and we are -- that's where we're going after share. The ISPs have more than half of the share globally and that's what we intend, especially to get our Otis units back.\nDenise Molina: Very helpful, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen. Your line is now open.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much. So backlog margin, you indicated that it's flat. Schindler on their call talked of pricing getting worse in the third quarter and therefore looking for backlog margin to be down in the fourth quarter. What are you looking for, can you hold that backlog margin in the fourth quarter? \nRahul Ghai: Cai, it is hard to comment on future of backlog margin. The good news is, listen, you look at the books margin that's up. You look at the backlog margin that's flat to last year and it's in and out. But generally what my takeaway from this is that the pricing environment in both new equipment and service is largely stable. There will be pressures as we've discussed previously, yes. But I think, the new equipment markets are behaving like China booking margins were up, North America was up, a little bit of pressure in Asia-Pacific, especially in India and Southeast Asia as you would expect, a couple of markets in EMEA as well. So all that, we put all that in and it's good to see the booking margin going up and the backlog margin being stable. I think Judy made the comment on service pricing as well and that's okay as well. I mean, outside of these temporary price concessions and these are temporary because they are for a limited period of time, outside of these temporary price concessions the overall service market is holding. Europe was a little bit -- Europe was up, North America was up -- pressure in Asia you would expect but so this pricing looks okay as well. So we feel good about where the environment is. Would there be pressure? Absolutely. If there is, we are ready for it, right. I mean, we're kind of ready for the pressure that may come but it has not manifested yet. And we feel okay where we are.\nJudy Marks: Yeah, and we have shown now for multiple straight quarters that we are yielding on the productivity, both on the material productivity side for new equipment and the service productivity side is continuing to yield. And I do credit that to our service business, which has remained resilient despite the discretionary challenges we've been facing. And that's 80% of our margins. And we shared our medium term outlook and basically said our future is based on growing our service portfolio, driving margins in both equipment and service, but in service that plus other actions driving high single-digit EPS. We are on track for our medium term outlook, our strategy is on track, and that's what we're executing. \nCai von Rumohr: Terrific and then your third quarter orders were bolstered by three very large wins that you had. Are you looking for large wins in the fourth quarter or are we looking at a tougher orders compare?\nRahul Ghai: They will probably [indiscernible] last quarter as well Cai. I think sure we had a few sizable wins in Q3 of last year so I don't know year-over-year these large wins necessarily made a difference. Listen, I think we've been talking about the things Cai that are driving our sales performance. I mean, if you look at our coverage in certain markets, whether it's China, whether it's the rest of the Asia-Pacific, whether it's markets in Europe, I mean our sales coverage in the markets that we have targeted are up anywhere between 7 to 10 points. So we are doing really well and just doing the basics right. We've added -- I mean, Judy and I both said we've added more than 700 channel partners in China. We've added more than 100 salespeople. So we're putting more feet on the ground, we are backing new segments, we didn't have a product in the entry tier market, we do now. We launched it in India, we are expanding to Southeast Asia. We are attacking the volume business in certain markets that we didn't play. So it's a pretty all out the front on making sure that we continue to gain share. And these large wins are a testament to the technology and the customer relationships. But, it's broader than that.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific, and then last one, so listening to your competitors, the three markets they've all been complaining about are the Americas, Asia, outside of China and Southern Europe, all markets where you have substantially greater percentage of revenues than they do. Can you maybe comment on is that just share gains on your part and you mentioned, 70 bps of share gains, where do you think you're gaining share and where are you may be losing share?\nJudy Marks: So, yeah, we have -- if you take our Asia world outside of China, we are very pleased to share with our results out of Korea and Japan where we are a major player. And that has happened in both new equipment and in service, especially in service in Japan. So our Asia Pacific, although impacted by India and Southeast Asia, like the rest of the world, we're really pleased with our share gain there. And we have put some of those sales investments in place there to deal with both the new regulations in Korea, but also just to get more share on the new equipment side. As we pivot to the Americas, I was really pleased with our performance in Latin America. We grew share in Brazil and we are continuing to perform well in Latin America. North America remains very competitive and we're going to continue to watch that closely. And we've looked -- we gained the same access to the Dodge and the ABI information and Dodge has marginal improvement but up for next year. And we just have to watch the pace of that deal with what we can control, work our backlog conversion quicker, and then drive productivity throughout, especially in North America and align our cost with that. In South Europe that is the heart of our maintenance portfolio and our teams have done a great job aligning cost with the service we're providing and really having minimal concessions. So on the new equipment side, we think we're seeing new starts in Europe, including in South Europe, and we're seeing it really across the board. New starts in EMEA, a little slower in the Middle East, but the Asian economies are turning the corner, led by China by far. But the rest of the Asian economies are starting to turn. The only place we've still have constraints in terms of job site access is really in India, which is less than 50% and parts of Southeast Asia. Everywhere else has been restored to the high 90% and we haven't seen any retreat from that due to the second rebound of COVID either in North America or EMEA.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Judy Marks for any closing remarks.\nJudy Marks: Well, let me thank you all again for joining the call this morning. I need and want so much to thank our colleagues for their dedication, as well as all of those on the front line fighting COVID-19. Please stay safe and well. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Judy Marks",
            "content": "Thank you, Stacy and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us and we hope that everyone listening is safe and well. To start, I want to thank each of our colleagues around the world for their unwavering dedication as we continue to deliver on our commitments to passengers, customers, and shareholders. Overall, as you'll see in our results, our business is trending back towards pre-COVID levels, improving sequentially across all metrics.  I'm pleased to share that we had a very strong quarter. We gained share in new equipment, paid down debt, and are raising our outlook with Rahul providing additional details. Our strategy is robust despite the unique environment we're in and as an example of our ability to continue to execute, this quarter we completed the acquisition of Bay State Elevator, expanding our scale and density in the Northeast United States. We're delighted to have the Bay State colleagues join the Otis team, and we remain focused on accelerating growth of the service portfolio, both organically and inorganically. Our bolt on M&A strategy is working and serves as an accretive source of growth.  Innovation is core to Otis. COVID accelerates the need for new health and safety solutions, which we expect to continue post COVID. Otis is a leader in this space, continuing to bring new products to market and during the quarter we commissioned an elevator airflow study examining the risk of airborne transmission in elevators and how to best mitigate those risks through science based safety protocols. This study is being led by a Purdue University expert in the spread and prevention of infectious diseases through indoor air systems. We look forward to sharing these findings in the coming months.  Furthering our ability to provide innovative cutting edge products, we opened a new industry 4.0 escalator factory in East China that incorporates intelligent manufacturing, advanced automation, and digital technologies such as 3-D modeling, custom engineering, and real time quality management. This move continues to rationalize our footprint and build on our legacy of excellence while upgrading our smart manufacturing capabilities for a new era. We continue to deploy iPhones to our field professionals, adding four more countries during this quarter, and the adoption of our suite of apps continues to expand driving service productivity within the organization. In addition, our IoT deployment continues to build momentum, and we have plans in place to enhance the capability of Otis ONE solutions over the next several months to drive productivity in our organization. Despite the challenges introduced by the pandemic, we continue to deploy these units in the U.S., Europe, and China during the first nine months and expect the pace of deployment to accelerate.  Otis also received several key orders across each of the regions, highlighted on Slide 3. In Chicago we received an order to outfit the new Salesforce Tower Chicago office building with over 30 sky rise and Gen 2 elevators. Each of the passenger elevators will have our new innovative Compass 360 dispatching system allowing for seamless travel in a 60 story building. In China Otis was selected to support Tianjin's Metro Expansion Project, we will add approximately 120 elevators to Line 6, bringing the total number of Otis elevators and escalators throughout the Tianjin Metro to approximately 1400 units. This award extends Otis's involvement in infrastructure development in the region, a key strategy for us. And in France, we're helping bring La De\u0301fense the business area of Paris to new heights with an order to deliver 60 elevators and several escalators to The Link, the next tallest building in France. This project will include CompassPlus, eCall, and OptiSense technologies, creating a faster, safer and more seamless trip for the passengers.  These are just a handful of examples that led to the approximate 70 basis points of new equipment share gain during the first nine months. In terms of liquidity we ended Q3 with $1.7 billion of cash and continue to maintain a revolving credit facility which serves as a backstop for our commercial paper issuances and an additional source of liquidity if needed. We also made progress on our debt repayment goal of $350 million in 2020, repaying $250 million in the quarter. And as we remain dedicated to delivering results for our customers and shareholders, our commitment to global corporate citizenship has not wavered.  Last quarter, I shared with you the launch of our commitment to change. In just three months we are going to make Otis a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture and identify and prioritize actions we need to take to get there. For example, in the quarter we enlisted an outside diversity equity and inclusion expert to independently assess our practices and provide recommendations to guide future decisions and programs. Later during the quarter, we launched Made to Move Communities, a CSR program focused on advancing youth STEM education and providing inclusive mobility solutions for communities in need. This extends Otis's ongoing commitment to the communities where we live and work and we look forward to providing the avenue and resources to help young minds explore new ways to give people freedom to connect and thrive in a taller, faster, smarter world.  Turning to Slide 4, Q3 results and 2020 outlook. New equipment orders were up slightly at constant currency with low single-digit growth in EMEA and Asia partially offset by low single-digit decline in the Americas. China orders were up high single-digits as the business continued its rapid recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. On a rolling 12 months, total Otis orders were down approximately 1%. New equipment backlog continued to grow up 3% versus the prior year at constant currency. In the third quarter, organic sales were down 1.2% with the new equipment segment down 1% and the service segment down 1.4%. Adjusted operating profit was up $33 million and margin expanded 120 basis points, driven by continued expansion in the service segment on strong contribution from productivity and the benefit from cost containment actions and favorable transactional foreign exchange.  Free cash flow was robust at $311 million, with 117% conversion of GAAP net income. While there remains uncertainty around the global recovery from the pandemic, we are encouraged by these strong year-to-date results and the trends we're experiencing, giving us confidence to revise our 2020 outlook. We are improving the organic sales range now expected to be down 2% to 3%. Adjusted operating profit is now expected to be in the range of up $30 million to $40 million, a $60 million improvement versus the prior outlook at the midpoint. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $2.42, up $0.17 versus the prior midpoint. This reflects our improved adjusted operating profit outlook, lower adjusted tax rate, and lower net interest costs. Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust at approximately $1.15 billion, with full year free cash flow conversion at approximately 135% of GAAP net income.  With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and outlook in more detail. Thanks Rahul. I'm pleased with our year-to-date performance navigating continued COVID challenges while continuing to drive our long-term strategy all in our first year as a standalone company. In early 2021, we'll provide an update on our 2021 and medium term outlook for we continue to expect sustainable growth and global share and are seeing traction with new equipment share of approximately 70 basis points year-to-date. This growth will continue to feed our leading service portfolio, where we remain focused on service transformation initiatives, deploying IoT and digital tools that drive value for our customers, productivity, and margin expansion. We remain committed to driving value for our shareholders, driving EPS growth and robust cash generation, all while investing at sustainable levels to position us to stay at the forefront of this industry. With that, I'd like Sonia to open up the line for questions. Good morning, Carter. You bet. So Bay State, again, pleased to have them join the Otis family, but that is not material in terms of what contributed to the portfolio growth in the Americas, specifically in North America for the quarter. In terms of Otis ONE, we are ramping up and accelerating our deployment. We've seen productivity gains but in terms of additional subscriptions or revenue, it's still early in terms of where we're able to gain traction on that. It's certainly adding value and productivity, we've seen that in China, we've seen it in Spain, and we're now seeing and hearing from our mechanics in North America in terms of how it's giving them the ability to show up quicker, to have less running on arrivals when they get there because they know it's already running on arrival and they don't have to actually make that service call. So we're pleased with the early results, but it's not anything that's really added to the top line in terms of subscription revenue yet. Hey, Steve. Yes. So, Steve in the third quarter, we saw better volumes, you know our productivity remains strong and our pricing held. Our orders were up slightly and you said it, we are up 20 basis points in both margin and really pleased with that improvement, especially coming after the second quarter where we had 70 basis points going the other way and we grew our backlog. So every 3%, where we're going with 3% up in backlog. So while we're seeing -- the market's competitive, pricing was competitive in the third quarter, we would tell you the place it was most competitive was in North America. And but we are seeing -- we had low single-digit gains in terms of EMEA and Asia, high single-digit gains in China, and low single-digit we were down in the Americas. So, so far we're dealing with what we can control, which is winning the business, growing the share. We grew at about 40 basis points and then executing on that backlog by driving as much productivity and cost control as we can. And this backlog, by growing is really going to feed our 2021 and put us in a pretty good position there. So we were pleased with what we saw Q3 versus Q2 and all the sequential improvements. But we would -- I would tell you, it is getting more competitive certainly in North America on pricing. And Steve we task every one of our countries to beat share, to grow share in their country and that's going to continue through 2021. So we do look at it at a pretty finite level. Yeah and Steve, I'm sorry, Julian. Let me just add one item. We've really tried to take a hard look at the past few weeks or months or certainly starting into this quarter of with the rebound of COVID cases, are we seeing any changes? We're still continuing to see new starts in Europe. We're cautious in North America, especially on non-res. But the Asian economies have turned the corner and China is accelerating and we expect growth next year in the China segment. Yes, so in China Jeff, our orders are up high single-digit, our book margin was up for the quarter in China, so we return to really getting price in China or new equipment, which was important to us. Our sales were up mid-single-digit. We also got price on service and grew our service portfolio 6% in China and grew our share year-to-date in China. So we think we've got a solid performance. We did well in the Tier One and Tier Two cities, and especially in some of our strategic verticals like infrastructure, where we've been spending a lot of time and investment. Rahul will share that, we've added over almost 750 agents and distributors in China this year, which has been an intense focus on us to have greater reach and greater capability to provide to see the different opportunities. And again, we return to profit -- to positive booked margin there and we're pleased with that. We continue to invest in China with our new factory, and we're going to continue to make investments in the sales channel in China in Q4, as Rahul mentioned in his remarks, to get us prepared for what we think is going to be a growth segment and growth for us significantly in 2021. Hey, John. So our service contracts are contracts that are multi-year in many parts of the world and annual in others. So each country is a little different. We tend to renew our service contracts in Europe early in the year and we do have price escalators there that are indexed to inflation. And we'll be watching that as we enter next year as well. In the North America where a lot of our service contracts are as well, we find that those are multi-year or the concessions we've given to date have been pretty limited to the hospitality and retail industry only. And as we've shared with our end market exposure, that's a little under 10% for us globally. And those concessions to date have lasted typically for about 90 days and they all came in at staggered times. But as long as a building is open and it's important to note, John, that we also match our cost when those concessions go in terms of the services we deliver. So we've been doing a good job in that. And that's why we've been able to maintain our service margins and our margin expansion. As these come up for renewal, every one of them we discuss with the customers exactly what types of services they need to receive, and then we adjust our costs accordingly. But we have not seen any unusual cancellations on either the new equipment side. Every now and then a job does cancel but on the new equipment side or even on the service side, we've not seen extreme cancellations happening. Right now everybody's kind of watching. And as long as a building is open or -- and minimal use and all the residential buildings are at significant use, we are out there providing maintenance. Our maintenance pricing has held up very resilient and our maintenance has also been very resilient. And really, it's the discretionary repair and modernization where we've had any of the decline in sales as people are making discretionary choices. I hope that was helpful. No, we have not seen -- these cooling measures have been in effect now for almost three years, I would say. And we've not seen any impact on the infrastructure segment, which is mainly public. But even in the private with the property developers, we have not seen any change in volumes or requests for proposals in China. And in China we expected as we started the year this segment to be flat, the segment is actually growing this year and we actually now we believe that the segment will grow again next year. We're looking for a very positive outcome in China next year in 2021. We do believe this is a demand delay and it will create pent up demand on the repair side. On the modernization side, we believe it will occur. It's challenging to determine what quarter that's going to come back, since so much of the modernization is discretionary. But the repair we believe will happen. Some of it we need access to those buildings, some of it the buildings need more usage and the facility managers are just holding on some of those discretionary repairs. We expect it to bounce back and we think we'll see a little more of it in Q4 and as we go into 2021, we expect our bounce back. And Denise, our conversion rates and our retention rates on connected elevators beats our industry leading retention rates across the globe. So we have the ability to actually retain in our service portfolio those connected units at several hundred basis points above what we do with our normal retention rate globally. So that's another added benefit for us. It gives us more years on service and the ability to be with that customer over time, especially when they want additional upgrades over time. 55% of the service market right now is controlled by ISPs. That's who are going to get share from to grow our service portfolio above our leading service portfolio of over 2 million units already. And we do believe that with scale and with differentiation comes incredible data and clarity in terms of being able to make decisions, having a data lake, being able to do predictive and transparent maintenance, and as Rahul said to get the -- to roll the trucks and to get our field professionals out there as quick as possible to drive up time. It's the value of that data and the analytics, that's going to make a difference and we are -- that's where we're going after share. The ISPs have more than half of the share globally and that's what we intend, especially to get our Otis units back. Yeah, and we have shown now for multiple straight quarters that we are yielding on the productivity, both on the material productivity side for new equipment and the service productivity side is continuing to yield. And I do credit that to our service business, which has remained resilient despite the discretionary challenges we've been facing. And that's 80% of our margins. And we shared our medium term outlook and basically said our future is based on growing our service portfolio, driving margins in both equipment and service, but in service that plus other actions driving high single-digit EPS. We are on track for our medium term outlook, our strategy is on track, and that's what we're executing. So, yeah, we have -- if you take our Asia world outside of China, we are very pleased to share with our results out of Korea and Japan where we are a major player. And that has happened in both new equipment and in service, especially in service in Japan. So our Asia Pacific, although impacted by India and Southeast Asia, like the rest of the world, we're really pleased with our share gain there. And we have put some of those sales investments in place there to deal with both the new regulations in Korea, but also just to get more share on the new equipment side. As we pivot to the Americas, I was really pleased with our performance in Latin America. We grew share in Brazil and we are continuing to perform well in Latin America. North America remains very competitive and we're going to continue to watch that closely. And we've looked -- we gained the same access to the Dodge and the ABI information and Dodge has marginal improvement but up for next year. And we just have to watch the pace of that deal with what we can control, work our backlog conversion quicker, and then drive productivity throughout, especially in North America and align our cost with that. In South Europe that is the heart of our maintenance portfolio and our teams have done a great job aligning cost with the service we're providing and really having minimal concessions. So on the new equipment side, we think we're seeing new starts in Europe, including in South Europe, and we're seeing it really across the board. New starts in EMEA, a little slower in the Middle East, but the Asian economies are turning the corner, led by China by far. But the rest of the Asian economies are starting to turn. The only place we've still have constraints in terms of job site access is really in India, which is less than 50% and parts of Southeast Asia. Everywhere else has been restored to the high 90% and we haven't seen any retreat from that due to the second rebound of COVID either in North America or EMEA. Well, let me thank you all again for joining the call this morning. I need and want so much to thank our colleagues for their dedication, as well as all of those on the front line fighting COVID-19. Please stay safe and well. Thank you."

            "name": "Rahul Ghai",
            "content": "Thank you, Judy and good morning everyone. Starting with third quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3.3 billion, down 1.4% with a 1.2% decline in organic sales. As anticipated, both the new equipment and service segments declined organically primarily from the impact of COVID-19. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was up approximately 7% or $33 million and up $30 million at constant currency, as the impact of lower volume, temporary price concessions, and field inefficiencies was more than offset by strong productivity, cost containment, and favorable transactional effects. Our focus on reducing material cost continues to yield results and maintenance hours per unit sustained a downward trajectory. Cost containment efforts that we launched in Q1 of 2020 also helped alleviate the pressure from lower volume and year-to-date SG&A expense was down by more than $60 million year-over-year.  At the same time, we continued to invest in the business and R&D expense as a percentage of sales was about flat versus the prior year. Our strong focus on operational execution drove 120 basis points of adjusted margin expansion with continued margin improvement in the service segment. Third quarter adjusted EPS was up 25% or $0.14 from $0.06 of operating profit growth and the balance from a lower adjusted tax rate and a drop in interest costs. These results were better than we had expected in the previous outlook, driven by the stability of the maintenance business, higher savings from service productivity, and progress on reducing the adjusted tax rate.  Moving to Slide 6, new equipment orders were up slightly at constant currency and were down approximately 1% on a rolling 12-month basis. Order intake continues to outperform the market and regained approximately 40 basis points of share in the third quarter in a market that was down low single-digits. Book margins were up slightly in the quarter and were flat year-to-date versus the prior year. In the quarter, book margin improvement in China and North America was partially offset by pressure in parts of Asia Pacific and EMEA. New equipment backlog was up 3% at constant currency driven by growth in the Americas, with overall backlog margin improving slightly from Q2 and remaining stable versus the prior year. New equipment organic sales were down 1% as mid-single-digit growth in China was more than offset by declines in Asia-Pacific and parts of EMEA. At constant currency, new equipment adjusted operating profit was down $9 million and margin contracted 50 basis points as strong material productivity and cost containment was more than offset by the impact of under absorption, field inefficiencies, and an unfavorable mix.  Service segment results on Slide 7 remained strong in the quarter. Number of units under maintenance contracts increased by over 1% with growth in all major regions and China up more than 6%. Modernization orders were down 7.3% at constant currency as double-digit growth in Asia, driven by the mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets was more than offset by lower order intake in the Americas and EMEA. Service organic sales were down 1.4% as maintenance demand remains strong while discretionary repair and modernization projects were pushed out. At constant, currency adjusted operating profit margin expanded 140 basis points and profit grew $19 million, a strong contribution from productivity and cost containment actions more than offset the impact from volume decline, temporary price concessions, and an increase in bad debt expense. The service pricing environment, excluding the impact of these price concessions was about flat.  Overall, year-to-date results reflect solid performance with $33 million of adjusted profit growth at constant currency and 90 basis points of margin expansion despite organic sales being down 3.3% versus the prior year. The service business was particularly resilient with adjusted operating profit growth of $47 million at constant currency on a slight decline in organic sales, in an extremely challenging market environment. Also, third quarter results reflect sequential improvement in both segments and steady progress towards returning to pre-COVID levels. Access to job sites and buildings has largely returned to normal outside of India and Southeast Asia, and the service call volume is back to 2019 levels in China and Asia-Pacific. And the trends are heading in the right direction in Europe and Americas. We are improving our 2020 outlook to reflect strong progress during the year and these encouraging trends.  Turning to Slide 8, we now expect overall organic sales to be down 2% to 3% for the year, up from prior expectations of down 2% to 4% with improvement in both new equipment and service segments. We now expect new equipment sales to be down mid-single-digits and service sales to be flat to down slightly. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $30 million to $40 million at constant currency for the year with 60 to 70 basis points of margin expansion. This is an improvement of $60 million versus the prior outlook at midpoint reflecting the strong year-to-date performance, benefit from an improved sales outlook, and higher service productivity. At actual currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $5 million to $15 million, reflecting favorable foreign exchange trends in addition to the operational improvement. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be up 8% versus the prior year to approximately $2.42 and up $0.17 versus the prior midpoint driven by an improved operating profit outlook, lower net interest cost, and a reduced tax rate. We now expect the adjusted tax rate for the year to be about 30.5% down one point versus the prior outlook.  Taking a further look at the organic growth assumptions on Slide 9, in the new equipment segment, Americas is now expected to be down mid-single-digits, reflecting strong recovery in the third quarter with sequential improvement and year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. EMEA is now expected to be down mid to high single-digits, reflecting a strong recovery in Northern and Eastern Europe. We are improving the Asia outlook driven by better than expected third quarter performance in China. However, we expect Asia to be down in the fourth quarter due to continuing challenges in India and Southeast Asia.  In the service segment, we expect the maintenance and repair business to be flat to down slightly with the maintenance sales remaining resilient and a slower recovery in discretionary repairs. We are raising the modernization outlook to be about flat for the year, driven by better than expected performance in Asia Pacific from an effective go to market strategy to tap into the demand created by regulatory requirements. Overall, the outlook of 2% to 3% organic sales decline reflects sequential improvement and return to pre-COVID levels in the fourth quarter at the midpoint.  Switching to operating profit on Slide 10, at constant currency operating profit is now expected to be up $30 million to $40 million versus the prior year, reflecting the benefit of solid contribution from materials and service productivity and cost containment actions that are more than offsetting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic, incremental under absorption of costs, and temporary price concessions in the service business. This represents a $60 million improvement versus the prior expectations with improvements in both new equipment and service segments. The fourth quarter outlook includes incremental investments in the new equipment and service sales channel in China, additional cost to complete the maintenance visits, sequentially higher R&D expense, and the expected step up in public company costs. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of approximately $25 million, an improvement from a headwind of $40 million to $50 million that we had expected in July, primarily due to the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar.  An update on capital deployment on Slide 11. We started 2020 with about $1.4 billion of cash and now expect to generate approximately $1.15 billion of free cash flow in 2020, an improvement of $100 million versus the prior midpoint from higher net income and an improved working capital performance. As Judy mentioned, we repaid $250 million of debt in the quarter with another $100 million of repayment planned for Q4. We also refinanced $500 million of the U.S. stone [ph] room towards Euro Commercial Paper Program, our first foreign currency denominated debt transaction, as we continued to evaluate our capital structure. We still expect to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in Q2 through Q4 and spent approximately $200 million between non-controlling interest and M&A. These actions will allow us to maintain sufficient liquidity and position us to increase cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year, giving us optionality depending on the overall liquidity conditions to start share buyback in 2021. After we complete the previously disclosed $500 million of debt repayment. With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for closing remarks. So just to add to that Carter, Otis ONE joins the suite of other connected applications that we have like destination dispatch system, elevator management system, and those applications combined add about 30% to 40% of the subscription revenue. So as Judy said our first focus on Otis ONE is productivity and we do feel the benefit to the customer, both in terms of visibility and better uptime that we can provide will start adding incremental and additional revenue over time. And we see that in Asia and other parts of Europe where we do have remote service capability that we provide through even the phone lines. We are able to get incremental price in those units. So it will help over time but our first focus has been productivity on Otis ONE as we previously stated. We -- Steve, you're right. I mean, we did kind of looked across all the regions and we did -- we have improved the bottom end of the range and down from mid to high single-digits to down mid-single-digits and keep in mind it was down 5% to 10% on the Q1 call. So continued movement in the right direction. And the outlook has improved kind of across all the regions. Strong performance in Q3 and especially in China and the Americas and at the mid and the high end, we have growth planned for Q4. So, there could be some rounding because we don't give specific ranges, so I think you can take that offline if there are certain questions. But overall we feel really good about the way the business is moving and we do expect growth in EMEA and Americas at the mid and the high end of the range. So that's -- we feel good about our guidance. And then to add, Steve just sort of -- just maybe a couple of points to add to what Judy said, our year-to-date booked margins are flat. So that's going to -- that's a good thing. First quarter was up, second quarter was down, third quarter was up. So year-to-date the booked margin are flat for the nine months of the year. And the other point is our backlog is up and the backlog margins are sequentially better than Q2 and flat to last year. So that goes back to the comment that you made on the pipeline, right. So our backlog margins, which would drive revenue for next year those margins are flat. And again, we do -- this is the story we've been saying since our kind of our Investor Day that we do expect tough pricing environment. We've expected it. Obviously, the macro economic conditions are not great, but the focus that we have on driving productivity and the fact that we've been hitting a 3% target now for nine months and we constantly are going to hit for 12 months and that is -- that focus is unwavering. So we'll continue to improve our execution installation, our maintenance productivity, and if there is pricing pressure, we'll find a way to offset that. Yeah, so when we talk about share Steve, we talk about how we have done versus the market. So again, I think Kone and Schindler report and the other companies that don't, so we don't know who exactly we're gaining share from. But the fact is, when we compare our orders, we know that we've outgrown the market and that's how we compare it. So if you look at, it's flat for the quarter, down 1% on a rolling 12-month basis and obviously in this environment, the market we know is down more than 1% on a rolling 12-month basis. And we are down about two points year-to-date. So that's a fairly strong performance given the environment. And so based on the analysis that we do, we believe, as Judy said in her prepared remarks, that we think we've gained about 70 basis points of share and that has allowed us to grow our backlog by about three points. Thanks, Steve. Yeah. So Julian, it's hard to comment, right, I mean it's hard to comment on the orders but we are pleased with the performance we have year-to-date. And, go back to what we said on the last call that for 2021 our priorities were that we wanted to end the year in a strong backlog position. And being up 3% year-to-date obviously gives us a lot of confidence. And what we want to -- to take it a step further, our next step obviously is the fact that we want to accelerate the backlog conversion for 2021 and that gives us confidence to grow our new equipment business and not have the volume related headwinds that we've had this year. So that's kind of our focus for driving new equipment revenue next year. In terms of market, I think Judy can comment as well but, the picture is mixed. I mean, the fact is we're seeing a pretty -- we are seeing a sharp bounce back in China. The other market is a little bit softer as you would expect. And, the projections are a little bit harder based on the data we are seeing, there's a little bit of a snap back in Asia and in China and then -- and Europe looks okay as well. North America is a little bit more mixed but we'll see where that goes. But what we're focused on is kind of driving what we can control. And the other point I want to make up is our proposal activity, our proposal activity year-to-date is up double-digits. And that goes to all the things that we've been saying we are going to do in terms of expanding our sales coverage, adding more salespeople. We've added more than 100 salespeople year-to-date. Added 700 more channel partners in China. So that allows us to even in a down market, increase our proposal activity and hopefully that means well for our orders to come. Yeah, no. All good questions Julian. So, on the sort of -- we have been like focused on reducing our SG&A, right. And we have said that right since Q1 and obviously driving the $60 million reduction year-over-year is fantastic. And you see some of that coming through lower public company cost. And that is a good sign. We don't have a 2021 number yet. We didn't want to update you guys on one number for 2021 versus providing the context and the framework for how everything else will be. So again, our goal is to not get to 175, but we will provide more color and more guidance as we talk about the rest of 2021. So, more to come on that. But good news that we are able to instead of being at 150 we are 130 for this year just shows you the focus and the discipline that we have inside the company. In terms of stamp on [ph] cost and separation cost I think our number is 140 to 170, that's the number we had said, and that's largely between this year and Q1 of next year. I think we will be tracking to that. I think the year-to-date numbers are around $85 million so that is between $80 million and $85 million. So far, the rest between Q4 and Q1 and that would be the end of that separation cost. Thank you, Julian. Yeah, so just typically what we see is we see in any given year, this is now I am going back a little bit to pre-COVID because what we typically used to see is about two thirds of our revenue, new equipment revenue in a given year coming from backlog. So that's what we would have typically seen. This year it has been a little bit lower just given all the disruptions that we've had, both in the field and in the factories. And our goal is, I think we said previously, our goal is not only to get back to 2019 levels, but drive it a little bit higher than that. And so we'll continue and provide more color and more guidance as we talk about 2021. But typically what you see is two thirds of the revenue for next year coming from backlog. We have had the bad debt is higher, a little bit year-over-year. It hasn't been material enough to call out, but you would expect that in an environment like this, in the credit environment, you would have incremental bad debt and we being appropriately cautious, I would say, on how we are reserving for stock. So if we are seeing things go in the wrong direction, we are providing adequate reserves for that. So bad debt has been with us through the first nine months. And again, it's not -- it hasn't been material enough to call out on each refinance but cumulatively kind of adds up. So it is okay. Pricing you are right, it hasn't been, we haven't called it out as we said our book margins are flat, kind of year-to-date they are flat. Backlog margins are flat. But again, we are expecting a little bit of conservatism for Q4 just in case things happen. So you're right, on pricing for new equipment that is a common mode for Q4 and this does affect a little bit of conservatism on our part. Good morning. And Nigel, just to add a couple of just quick data points on that I mean, if you look at the domestic loan volume for the real estate developers, that's actually up year-over-year. I think the estimates are like it's up 4% to 5% and the land value that these developers have prepared is up 13%. So they continue to invest in the business. Yeah, it's a great question, Nigel, and that's something again we need to -- we need a few quarters under our belt to exactly figure that out. I mean, a lot of the cash is offshore. So that makes it a little bit harder to figure out exactly what that right number is. But safe to say it's not 1.7 billion. I mean, that's easy to say that it's not one. I think we have more cash than what we need, which is appropriate in an environment like this, because if you go back to March or April, when you couldn't borrow in CP market. So, you want to be prepared because life is going to be uncertain, at least for the next three to six months. But beyond that, we feel we don't need 1.7 and I think that's what our promises is to get back cash to shareholders, as and when things settle down a little bit. And we do feel that we should be in a position to accelerate our share buyback from 2022 into 2021. So that is -- again that is a stated objective. And we think we'll get there barring some really, really unforeseen events. So we'll keep watching it. But it's now 1.7 billion and it's lower than that. What exactly that number is, I think we need a few more quarters to know exactly what the right number is. Yeah Denise, so my comment on kind of 30% to 40% was more around the fact. So we have several connected solutions, in addition to Otis ONE. So we have a little bit of a management system. We provide the destination dispatch. We have eView systems that involves -- that are connected. So when you put all that together, that can add about 30% to 40% off the revenue that we get on that unit. And there is not a lot of incremental cost to support that. So you would expect margins to be higher in addition to almost close to -- as close to perfection retention rate as you can get. So the retention rates are very, very high. So there are lots of incremental benefits. And now those ae comments in response to Carter's question Otis ONE, do you expect incremental revenue from that? Yes, we do. It's not again 30% to 40% is cumulative. So it's not going to double from Otis ONE. But, we do expect incremental revenue because at the end of the day, the customer gets complete visibility on how the portfolio is performing to get higher uptime because as Judy responded earlier, we can dispatch a technician as soon as the unit breaks down. So we know before the customer calls us, we know the unit is down so we can dispatch technician. So the uptimes are higher. So we do expect over time we will get revenue from this. But that has not been our primary focus. We are investing this, we are installing these units at our own cost because we think the productivity benefits outweighs the cost. So that has been our primary focus but over time, we do expect revenue. Cai, it is hard to comment on future of backlog margin. The good news is, listen, you look at the books margin that's up. You look at the backlog margin that's flat to last year and it's in and out. But generally what my takeaway from this is that the pricing environment in both new equipment and service is largely stable. There will be pressures as we've discussed previously, yes. But I think, the new equipment markets are behaving like China booking margins were up, North America was up, a little bit of pressure in Asia-Pacific, especially in India and Southeast Asia as you would expect, a couple of markets in EMEA as well. So all that, we put all that in and it's good to see the booking margin going up and the backlog margin being stable. I think Judy made the comment on service pricing as well and that's okay as well. I mean, outside of these temporary price concessions and these are temporary because they are for a limited period of time, outside of these temporary price concessions the overall service market is holding. Europe was a little bit -- Europe was up, North America was up -- pressure in Asia you would expect but so this pricing looks okay as well. So we feel good about where the environment is. Would there be pressure? Absolutely. If there is, we are ready for it, right. I mean, we're kind of ready for the pressure that may come but it has not manifested yet. And we feel okay where we are. They will probably [indiscernible] last quarter as well Cai. I think sure we had a few sizable wins in Q3 of last year so I don't know year-over-year these large wins necessarily made a difference. Listen, I think we've been talking about the things Cai that are driving our sales performance. I mean, if you look at our coverage in certain markets, whether it's China, whether it's the rest of the Asia-Pacific, whether it's markets in Europe, I mean our sales coverage in the markets that we have targeted are up anywhere between 7 to 10 points. So we are doing really well and just doing the basics right. We've added -- I mean, Judy and I both said we've added more than 700 channel partners in China. We've added more than 100 salespeople. So we're putting more feet on the ground, we are backing new segments, we didn't have a product in the entry tier market, we do now. We launched it in India, we are expanding to Southeast Asia. We are attacking the volume business in certain markets that we didn't play. So it's a pretty all out the front on making sure that we continue to gain share. And these large wins are a testament to the technology and the customer relationships. But, it's broader than that."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Otis' Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being carried live on the Internet and recorded for replay. Presentation materials are available for download from Otis' website at www.otis.com.  I will now turn the call over to Stacy Laszewski, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations.\nStacy Laszewski: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Otis' Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Judy Marks, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rahul Ghai, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and significant nonrecurring items. The company will also refer to adjusted results where adjustments were made as though Otis was a stand-alone company in the current period and prior year. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis' SEC filings, including our Form 10 and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy.\nJudith Marks: Thank you, Stacy, and good morning, everyone. We're glad that you could join us today and hope that everyone listening is safe and well. I'm very pleased with our results and grateful for the dedication of our colleagues who provided essential services and supported our customers in efforts to safely reopen job sites and buildings during these unprecedented times.  To briefly update you on the status of operations in this environment, today, all Otis factories are operating, and approximately 90% of New Equipment job sites are open, up from a low point of about 65%. In the quarter, Otis field professionals provided essential services and our maintenance business remained resilient. However, the shutdown of buildings put understandable pressure on our repair and modernization business. By June, we saw encouraging signs of improvement in many regions. In the New Equipment business, we experienced substantial recovery in China during the second quarter, while North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific continued to experience job site closures in certain areas. Our management team has done an excellent job to proactively contain costs and mitigate the impact from COVID-19. That was reflected in our results reported this morning, especially encouraging in our Service business.  In terms of liquidity, we ended Q2 with $1.9 billion of cash on hand and have a $1.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility, a strong position for us to run the business. This environment has not slowed our progress in executing on our strategies. We continue to introduce new and innovative products with our touchless elevator technologies, traffic flow solutions, purification products, or remote monitoring and predictive maintenance services. We are partnering and bringing solutions to our customers to promote and support the health and safety of their tenants and passengers. We continue to expand our product offerings, launching the Gen2 Prime in India, a low-rise entry-level elevator. This product brings a combination of safety, performance, themed aesthetics and price competitiveness to our India low-rise market with applicability to other developing markets. We continue to build momentum on the deployment of IoT, and we recently launched a new release that added several new features for our customers and to drive productivity in our organization. This new release also improves the scalability of our solution. We have a clear road map to continue to enhance the capability of our IoT solution over the next several months.  Despite the challenges introduced by the pandemic, we continue to deploy units in U.S., Europe and China in the first half and expect to place -- the pace of IoT deployment to increase substantially in the second half, and we've driven both service and material productivity through our continued IoT technology, our suite of mobility tools via iPhone apps for our field professionals and our global supply chain activities this quarter. These are just a handful of examples that led to 90 basis points of New Equipment share gains during the first half. This progress shows the strength of our strategy. As leaders here at Otis, we're proud of our company's long commitment to diversity and inclusion. Yet we also know there's more to be done if we are to become the company we want to be, an equal opportunity employer of choice for people of all cultures, genders, races and generations.  To ensure we live up to these aspirations, our leadership team and I launched our commitment to change, which is a framework to help us identify and prioritize the actions we need to take. We continue to demonstrate our commitment as Otis joined the Paradigm for Parity coalition and committed to closing our global leadership gender gap by 2030. People are at the heart of everything we do at Otis, and I'm proud of these important steps. Otis will lead our industry for inclusion and diversity.  Turning to Slide 4, Q2 results and 2020 outlook. New Equipment orders were down 6.8% at constant currency, with double-digit declines in the Americas and EMEA, partially offset by growth in Asia as China recovers from COVID-19. China orders were up high single digits, including several infrastructure awards. On a rolling 12 months, total Otis orders were flat. New Equipment backlog was up 2% versus the prior year. In the second quarter, organic sales were down 6.5%, driven by double-digit decline in the New Equipment segment and low single-digit decline in the Service segment. Adjusted operating profit was down $24 million at constant currency, and margin expanded 30 basis points, driven by continued expansion in the Service segment and the swift cost containment actions we implemented. Free cash flow was robust at $628 million, with 280% conversion of net income, reflecting strong working capital performance in the quarter. These swift cost actions and our organization's commitment to serving customers allowed us to mitigate the bottom line impact from a year-over-year decline in sales, and I'm pleased with the second quarter and first half performance despite the difficult environment we're operating in globally. We are encouraged by the recovery we've experienced in China, and are revising our 2020 outlook to reflect the solid first half performance and anticipated pace of recovery for our business in the second half across the world.  We are increasing the organic sales range, now expected to be down 2% to 4%. Adjusted operating profit is now expected in the range of flat to down $50 million at constant currency, a $75 million improvement versus the prior outlook at the midpoint, primarily from higher volume expectations. We now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range of $2.20 to $2.30, up $0.20 at the midpoint versus prior expectations. This reflects our improved operating profit outlook, lower tax rate and lower net interest costs.  Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust, between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, with full year free cash flow conversion levels between 130% and 140% of GAAP net income.  With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and the outlook in more detail.\nRahul Ghai: Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with second quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3 billion, down 9.6%, with a 6.5% decline in organic sales and the rest from foreign exchange and net divestitures in 2019. As we anticipated and communicated during the first quarter earnings call, both the New Equipment and Service segments declined organically in the second quarter, primarily from the impact of COVID-19. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was down approximately 8% or $39 million, and down $24 million at constant currency. Operating profit declined at constant currency from the impact of lower volume, temporary price concessions that we offered to our customers to support them during these difficult times and a small increase in year-over-year bad debt expense.  We were able to partially offset this by strong productivity in both New Equipment and Service segments. In the New Equipment segment, our material productivity in the factories fall of 3% for the second quarter in a row, and in the Service segment, maintenance hours per unit continued to trend down. Cost containment efforts that we launched in Q1 of 2020 also helped alleviate the pressure from lower volume and our adjusted SG&A expenses were down close to $40 million year-over-year. At the same time, we maintained the investment in the business and R&D expense as a percentage of sales was flat versus the prior year. Our strong focus on operational execution and a favorable segment mix drove 30 basis points of margin expansion with continued margin expansion in the service segment.  Second quarter adjusted EPS was down $0.03, as a $0.05 decline from operating profit was partially offset by a $0.02 increase primarily from favorable tax rate and lower interest costs. These results were better than we had expected in the previous outlook provided during Q1 earnings call, driven by the resiliency of our Service business model and our focus on productivity and proactive management of cost and customer concessions.  Moving to Slide 6. New Equipment orders were down 6.8% at constant currency and were flat on a rolling 12-month basis. Our order intake continues to outperform the market that was down high single-digit, resulting in a 110 basis point increase in global market share in the quarter. Booked margins were down 70 basis points in the quarter and were flat year-over-year for the first half. In the quarter, booked margins were down in Asia and parts of Europe, and were partially offset by improvement in the Americas and the Middle East. New Equipment backlog was up 2% at constant currency from growth in the Americas, and backlog margin was up slightly over prior year. Organic sales were down 10.4%, with double-digit declines in the Americas and EMEA, reflecting the impact of job site closures in April and May. Sales in Asia were up 1.6%, as decline in Asia Pacific was more than offset by strength in China. China new equipment sales were up high single digits as job sites reopened and business returned to pre-COVID levels. At constant currency, New Equipment adjusted operating profit was down $46 million, and margin contracted 230 basis points, as strong material productivity and cost containment in the field was more than offset by the impact from lower volume and underabsorption of costs.  Service segment results on Slide 7 remains strong in the quarter. Number of units under maintenance contracts increased by 1%, with units in China up more than 5%. Modernization orders were down 4% as strong orders growth in China, driven by mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets was offset by lower order intake in the Americas and EMEA. Organic sales were down 3.3%, as maintenance demand remained strong, while the building shutdowns impacted discretionary repair and modernization sales. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 170 basis points, and profit grew by $14 million at constant currency, a strong contribution from productivity and cost containment actions more than offset the impact from volume decline, temporary price concessions and an increase in bad debt. Pricing environment, excluding the impact of price concessions, was modestly favorable. Overall, we closed out a solid first half in which our organic sales were down slightly more than 4%, with flat year-over-year service revenue and a 70 basis point margin expansion.  We are maintaining the execution momentum in the business and continue to make progress on key strategic initiatives: gaining share in new equipment, driving material and service productivity and containing SG&A costs. And while a challenging -- while we face a challenging business and economic environment, our operational metrics are recovering from the lows of April and May.  Turning to Slide 8. China has shown a swift recovery as business returns to normal, and the rest of the world is following suit at varying paces. We have seen improvement in access to New Equipment job sites throughout Q2 in every region. Access has largely returned to normal in the Americas and EMEA, while Asia Pacific has shown improvement, but is still facing some challenges in India and Southeast Asia due to government-imposed measures. The maintenance business was resilient in the quarter and considered essential in most areas. Access, where it was limited, has returned to normal levels towards the end of June and early Q3. Lastly, overall repair volumes are still below last year and Q1, but trends are heading in the right direction, with a number of service requests from our customers continuing to increase, and we expect to see a recovery to pre-COVID levels in the balance of the year as buildings reopen.  We are improving our 2020 outlook to reflect strong progress in the first half and these encouraging trends. On Slide 9, we now expect overall organic sales to be down 2% to 4% for the year, up from prior expectations of down 3% to 7%, with improvement in both New Equipment and Service versus prior guidance. We now expect New Equipment sales to be down mid- to high single digits and service sales to be flat to down low single digits. In the New Equipment segment, we are assuming varying rates of recovery, with the high end reflecting a slight growth in the second half of the year. In the Service segment, maintenance business has proved to be resilient in this environment, and the range reflects differing degrees of delay in discretionary repair and modernization projects in the back half of the year depending on the overall macroeconomic environment and the occupancy level of buildings. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be flat to down $50 million at constant currency, and down $40 million to $100 million at actual currency. At constant currency, the outlook increased by $75 million at the midpoint, reflecting the higher revenue versus prior guidance, strong progress on cost containment actions and a small improvement in service pricing outlook. We expect operating margin expansion in a range of 10 to 30 basis points. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be in a range of $2.20 to $2.30, up $0.20 at the midpoint, driven by improved operating profit outlook, lower net interest costs, lower tax rate and a reduced share count. We are lowering our full year tax rate guidance to 31.5% from 32% in May, and down from 33% on Investor Day. We expect the tax planning work that we're doing to continue to yield benefits and the tax rate to trend down to between 25% to 28% over the medium term.  Taking a further look at our organic growth assumptions on Slide 10. In the New Equipment segment, Americas is expected to be down mid-single digits to 10%, reflecting the sharp decline we saw in Q2. The high end or a 5% decline contemplates a rapid recovery in Q3 and growth in the back half of the year, while the lower end reflects continuing challenges in accessing the job sites. The EMEA New Equipment business is expected to be down high single digits, reflecting business recovering to pre-COVID levels during Q3 in North Europe and a gradual recovery in South Europe and the Middle East. We are improving the Asia New Equipment outlook due to strong recovery we experienced in China during Q2, and now expect Asia to be down mid-single digits. This reflects the continuing recovery in China with varying pace of recovery across Asia Pacific, with challenges in India and Southeast Asia, while the rest of Asia holds up well. In the Service business, we anticipate the maintenance business to remain stable into the back half of the year, with continued pressure on discretionary repair early in Q3 and recovery in the later months of the year, and expect the overall maintenance and repair business to be flat to down slightly for the year. While our modernization sales grew in the first half, there is potential for modernization projects to push out into 2021. And we now expect modernization sales to be flat to down low single digits. Overall, the high end of the 2% to 4% organic sales decline reflects an early Q3 recovery globally, and the low end assumes first half conditions to continue into the second half of the year.  Switching to operating profit on Slide 11. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit improved by $75 million from the May guidance at the midpoint and is now expected to be flat to down $50 million versus the prior year, reflecting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic, incremental underabsorption of costs and an impact on pricing, including some temporary price concessions in our Service business. We will continue to offset these impacts through strong material and service productivity and cost containment actions that are tracking as per prior expectations. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of $40 million to $50 million for the year and an improvement from the $60 million of headwind that we had expected in May due to the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar.  An update on capital deployment on Slide 12. We started 2020 with about $1.4 billion of cash on hand and expect to generate between $1 billion to $1.1 billion of free cash flow in 2020 and now plan to pay down $350 million of debt instead of the original placeholder of $250 million in 2020. We still expect to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in Q2 through Q4 at about 40% of adjusted net income and spend approximately $200 million between noncontrolling interest and M&A. These actions will allow us to maintain sufficient liquidity and will enable us to increase the cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year, which depending on the overall liquidity conditions in the market, can potentially allow us to start share buyback in 2021 after we complete our previously disclosed $500 million of debt repayment.  With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for some closing remarks.\nJudith Marks: Thanks, Rahul. I'm pleased that Otis delivered a solid second quarter despite current COVID challenges, while driving our long-term strategy as the world begins to reopen. Over the medium term, we expect sustainable growth and global share gain in New Equipment up 90 basis points year-to-date to continue to expand on our leading Service portfolio. We'll continue to make progress on service transformation, deploying IoT and the digital tools that drive productivity and margin expansion. Although these are unusual times, we will continue to invest at a sustainable level to ensure we stay at the forefront of this industry and adjust our costs structurally to align with our medium-term sales outlook, and we will continue to drive EPS growth, use our robust cash generation and leverage our balance sheet to create shareholder value.  With that, I'd like Chris to open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: A couple of ground in the prepared remarks, but I just wanted just to go back to the pricing comments. One of your major competitors, I think, mentioned price pressure about 17 times on their call, not that I was counting. But maybe just comment on what you're seeing sort of right now in terms of the -- some of the bid pressure that they referred to. Would you agree with that comment? And then maybe touch on these price concessions you've been offering to customers on the Service side, kind of -- is that tracking in line with your expectations? And when would you expect that to taper off?\nJudith Marks: Sure. Thanks, Nigel. So we have seen about 70 basis points of booked margin impact in the second quarter. That was mainly in EMEA, in Asia Pacific. China itself was flattish, and the Americas actually had improved booked margin. And as you understand, this flows through to our revenue, primarily in 2021. We do expect some pressure. We expected it this quarter. We expect some in the remaining half of the year on pricing because pricing follows macroeconomic trends. And this is really why we have focused so hard on cost containment and our productivity initiatives. The only part we don't have in our outlook is any additional activities driven by stimulus, and that could also impact pricing probably favorably. Our Service pricing is holding up well. Outside of the price concessions, we did get our normal price increases throughout the first half of the year. The price concessions themselves were a little less than we anticipated, primarily in the hospitality space, hospitality and retail, and we have included those in our outlook for the remainder of this year. So Service pricing is holding up well. Booked margin is down 70 basis points on New Equipment. But again, China flattish, and we understand what we need to do to drive cost out and drive productivity up.\nNigel Coe: Great. And then on the tax rate, obviously, moving in the right direction, and I'm just curious if we have a line of sight on issuing the foreign debt to further maybe optimize that tax rate?\nRahul Ghai: Yes, Nigel. So we guided to -- in our prepared remarks, we kind of mentioned that we expect the medium-term tax outlook to be about 25% to 28%. So -- and that is over the next 3 to 4 years. It's not going to be all back end-loaded. We expect measured progress over this time period. We're working on several projects. We're evaluating our entire business and understanding, okay, where should things fit from a right business perspective? And what impact does that have at tax rate? So we're working extremely hard. And I think we've shown good progress since 2019. We are now expecting this year to be about 31.5%, so 3.5% decline over where we were in 2019. So that's really good progress. And then we see a path to between 25% to 28% over the next 3 to 4 years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Maybe a first question around the overall new install market. One of your peers had mentioned that market getting back to 2019 levels by 2022. Just wondered if you thought that was a realistic assessment? If it differs from your own perspectives at all? And also maybe how that sales outlook for the medium term, what's that informing your actions on the cost base in new equipment? What are you doing there?\nJudith Marks: Yes, Julian, let me try and talk to both of those, and I'm sure Rahul will add. We have seen the job sites reopening at a fairly strong pace. Globally, it's over 90%. In April, we were at about a 65% global. Again, the current restricted areas are more so in India and Southeast Asia. So the job sites are reopening. In North America, we are almost totally reopened. But as we reopen, we're seeing some different behaviors due to health and safety concerns. So we're making sure we do initial safety start-ups, and obviously, we have to separate some of the workforce in terms of how the construction crews are coming back as well. In terms of what we're seeing on buying behaviors, the orders in -- especially in North America, in this last quarter were down. And the reason there -- a lot of the reason they were down was that the decisions were just not being made and were being delayed. When we speak to the customers, they're optimistic, and they still plan on moving forward with their projects. Additionally, when you look at our end market exposure, we are -- and we shared this in the Appendix, we are far more than 50% driven by residential. And we're seeing residential projects grow strongly. So our outlook really does anticipate that we get back to New Equipment levels sometime in 2021, and that is -- that we will obviously modulate our costs based on what we see, both the orders coming in second half of this year and then as we see the New Equipment business coming back as well. Rahul?\nRahul Ghai: No, I think you covered it, Judy. It's -- overall, we've seen -- our proposals are kind of holding through the first half. It's been -- as you would expect, Q2 is a little bit softer. But over the first half, our proposal for holding China activities has been really, really strong, both across infrastructure and the other sectors. And if you look at the market in China, that was up in -- for the first half, it was pretty much up across all sectors, with Q2 being especially strong. So I mean, it's overall, it's an uncertain environment, definitely fluid. But so far, the business seems to be recovering well. And as Judy mentioned, the job sites are coming back, and that's what we're kind of focused on right now, it's just making sure that we are executing in the backlog that we have, and what will drive our revenue in the near term is obviously the backlog, which is good to see that our backlog is actually up 2% year-over-year through the second half. And then as we look forward into 2021, we'll stay focused on maintaining this backlog growth that you've seen, accelerating the pace of conversion from backlog into New Equipment revenue, driving cost out to ensure that we can stay competitive on margins and deliver strong margins. So that's what we are focused on internally.\nJulian Mitchell: And then my second question, just around maybe the revenue splits. Thank you for that split on Slide 18 on the end markets. But maybe geographically, 10 years ago -- 5 to 10 years ago in that European slump, there was a bifurcation between Southern European trends and the North. Perhaps we're seeing a similar bifurcation starting now. Just wondered if you could clarify how large is that Southern Europe exposure within the overall EMEA sales split? And how different you think the recovery slope might be between that Southern Europe piece and the rest of the EMEA region?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. Southern Europe is definitely doing -- as you know, Southern Europe is definitely a bigger market for us. We are -- we have a #1 positioning in France, Spain and Italy, so we have definitely a strong presence in Southern Europe. But -- and the recovery has been stronger in Northern Europe. Our business in Germany did really well in the second quarter, so that we are seeing the Nordics, the German markets come -- Switzerland, come back strongly, and Southern Europe is a little bit slower, as you would expect, given what you saw happen with the pandemic. So that is definitely the case. But even if you look -- we did provide some color on the overall industry. But if you look at our European business as well, Europe, especially, the fact is that close to 70% of our Europe business in Europe, cumulatively in the EMEA, is residential, so we are a little bit more heavily skewed on the residential side in EMEA versus the rest of the world. So that obviously helps the overall mix and how the various sectors recover. And the residential market matters more to us in Europe and probably in some other parts of the world.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. Thank you very much and good quarter. So going back to Nigel's question, I don't know whether it was 15x, but certainly, KONE hammered on pricing being an issue. Schindler sort of mentioned it, and you don't seem like it's a big, big issue. Is part of that because of the success? I think your target was to reduce material costs 3% per year. Is that part of it? And maybe give us some color on how you're doing in terms of those cost targets?\nRahul Ghai: No. So Cai, listen, we are -- again, we gave you the numbers that we are seeing. We saw our booked margin, and Judy repeated this in the response to Nigel's question. I mean, we've seen the pressure, right? It's like the booked margins were down 70 basis points. And you would expect that. I mean, Asia Pacific, given what's happening in India, given what's happening in Southeast Asia and the Indian economy still hasn't opened up. And in terms of units, that's the second largest economy in the world at the elevator market. So it's clearly an issue, right? And we are not hiding from that. And as Judy said, rightfully so, the pricing will depend on the overall macroeconomic environment. But if you go back to right from the Investor Day, what we're seeing and what we did not build into our medium-term outlook that we have provided at Investor Day, we did not build in any margin increase on the New Equipment side of the business. And the reason we did not is we expected the pricing pressures to manifest themselves over this time period.  We did not know that will be the second half of 2020 versus '21, but we knew that they were going to come at some point. And that's why starting last year, we have been so focused on driving material productivity. And we set a target for us for 3% over this medium term every year over the next 3 to 4 years. And if you look at the first half, it's great to see that we've done this now 2 quarters in a row. And that is helping. I mean if you look at our margin trajectory this quarter, and even for the first half, we're basically falling through -- our earnings are falling through at the contribution margin. That means we are able to absorb all the underabsorption, any pricing pressure, bad debt expense, all through our material productivity and cost containment. So we knew it's going to happen. We didn't know when. And I think internally, we were focused on taking costs out. So we'll be with pricing as it happens. And yes, is it worrying? Absolutely, it's worrying. But we are focused on things that we can control and making sure that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past when we gave up share because we didn't want to compete on price. So we'll keep dealing with the pressures as they come in the market.\nJudith Marks: Yes, Cai, the share is really, really important. And we prepared for this. All 4 of our regions went up in share and significantly up in the Americas and in China. And in general, we were up for the quarter, 110 basis points. And then for the half of the year, 90 basis points. So in a declining market, where the segment itself was going down last quarter high single digits, we took share everywhere.\nCai von Rumohr: And so a follow-up, everyone talks about share and -- how do you define share if you talk about ticking up 90 bps? What are you talking about? New elevators, organic, constant currency, sales? How are you defining share?\nRahul Ghai: Well, listen, with the way this industry tracks share, Cai, is based on the number of units in the market. So that's how it's done. And I think everybody pretty much does it the same way. So we define share based on the number of units we booked in the quarter versus what we estimated the markets to be in second quarter versus -- and the first half.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific. And last one, service units. You mentioned that you were up 1%, and yet you were around 1% in China. I think you lost 1% because of divestitures. Maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of how you're doing and how those numbers compare to the industry as a whole?\nJudith Marks: Yes. I can't report on the industry as a whole, certainly for this year. But I can tell you, we have an intense focus on growing our service portfolio. We understand that is the foundation of our business model, and we have -- we are focused on getting our Otis units back in addition to recapturing other units driving our conversion rates up, driving our cancellation rates down. So the biggest move we made in the portfolio this quarter was China, which went up over 5% in terms of units under maintenance. That's the largest growing market for the portfolio. So we've challenged the team to outgrow what they've done in the past in every region, but especially in China.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nCharles Tusa: Can you just clarify whether the interest expense guidance reflects all the kind of recent and planned moves on debt in the balance sheet and the capital structure?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. It does, Steve. So yes, I mean we increased the debt repayment from $250 million to $350 million this year, and we're still holding our long-term total debt repayment to around $500 million. So we did -- we plan to do $350 million this year and $150 million next year.\nCharles Tusa: Okay. Great. And is there anything in the second half when it comes to kind of the profit comps that we have to keep in mind from last year for kind of sequencing third quarter and fourth quarter? Or should things be kind of pretty smooth on a year-over-year basis?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. No, I think if you look at Q3 versus Q4, Steve, on the new equipment side, Q4 will be -- we expect Q4 to be marginally stronger than Q3. The activity is still a little bit slow in some of the larger markets in Asia Pac like you mentioned, India, Southeast Asia. And in the U.S., while the job sites are open, the number of COVID-19 cases are still rising, and that sometimes impacts the number of people we have available to a job site, on a job site or certain job sites shut down temporarily. So there's a little bit of still fluidity in the market, but this will be counterbalanced by China, to some extent, because we are catching up in certain areas in China, and we do expect China to be strong in Q3. So overall, maybe on the New Equipment side, slight skew towards Q4. And on the Service side, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, our repair activity is still subdued due to the lower building occupancy, some of the buildings are not fully opened yet, and we expect gradual improvement as we go through the year. So on the Service side, we'll definitely have a stronger Q4 than Q3, and that's the higher-margin business. So some of the profit will kind of follow similar trajectory.\nCharles Tusa: All right. And then one last quick one. I think you guys had some pretty good visibility into what's going on in the elevators that your buildings are installed in. You mentioned lower occupancy. Any early reads on kind of any surprising utilization trends of your assets within those buildings despite the lower occupancy due to social distancing? Like, for example, if you're fitting less people in the elevator, it's going to go up and down more times to carry the same amount of people. I mean, any read into kind of into that utilization dynamic there?\nJudith Marks: Yes. It's still early. But as you know, Steve, we had a tremendous amount of remote information from our remote monitoring systems. And these are early days. The residential elevators are getting tremendous usage because most elevators, people are only stepping in, if no one else is in that in condominiums and apartments throughout the world. So the residential usage, we know is up. In the more commercial space and office space, we're working with our customers to understand that. We're adjusting some traffic flow algorithms. Our destination dispatch system is being tuned based on customer requests. But as long as a building is open, it's certainly -- the elevator is getting used and maintained and eventually, will need repair work as well. So early days. Hopefully, we'll have some more data for you on the next call.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nJohn Walsh: Just wanted to dig a little bit into your comments around the modernization market, obviously, held in there better than we expected. You called out Asia Pacific. Just wanted to know if it was kind of a return to normal you were seeing with activity? Or if there was something else that was driving that expected growth in modernization on a regulatory front? Or anything else there?\nJudith Marks: Yes, John, the major regulatory front activity is a safety regulatory program that's driving significant modernization in South Korea. And it's going very well for us, but it is a regulatory program that's going to be multiple years. Our -- in Q1, our sales were up 7%, down 1.5% in Q2. But orders for the first half are only down 0.7 -- 70 basis points. So our modernization business is actually holding up better than we had anticipated through the first half. And we've tried to put some of that revision into our assumptions for our revised outlook. But in Asia Pac, between Japan and Korea, modernization is healthy. Korea is primarily regulatory.\nJohn Walsh: Great. And then I guess maybe going back to Steve's question. As you talk to your customers, what is the appetite for them to move to more of a touchless solution and actually upgrade? Is it -- are we still in kind of the early stages of having conversations with those facility managers? Or are you actually seeing them kind of pull the trigger and wanting to move forward with some of those kind of post COVID-19 investments as they prepare for people coming back?\nJudith Marks: So I think we're seeing -- and I'll start with China, where we've seen the biggest pull to start from purification fans and that's being ordered in the thousands, to touchless technologies, whether those are using our app for an iPhone or Android to be able to call the elevator or we are piloting some hand gesturing technology as well as just better traffic flow. So you see early adopters following both the technology early adopter curve, but also we're seeing it earlier in places that have recovered earlier. So China, it's already -- it's being installed. We're seeing good pickup. Where we're seeing on the early adopters in EMEA, the rest of Asia Pac and the Americas, are those building managers who really are trying to figure out how not to queue in the lobbies and how to really create a safe and healthy building environment. And it's early, but we're starting to see -- it's not material in terms of revenue yet, but a lot of people are interested. Some are doing short-term activities, but others are looking at major modernizations. And I think it's still to be determined if that modernization budget is going to replace some other modernization they were planning in their capital planners. I think we'll see that come out over the rest of '20 and into '21.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research.\nCarter Copeland: Great numbers. I wondered if you might expand a little bit, Judy. And maybe there's not enough passage of time and data here, but do you see any differences in service quality differentials across the market? And do you see that having an impact on retention and cancellation rates? I mean, it may be too early to say, but is there going to be any impact there that you think is measurable?\nJudith Marks: I think it will be, but I think it's early days, Carter. And the -- the reason is because as we look at a lot of our maintenance activities, we did not have all the same quantity of callbacks, as Rahul showed. It's growing again as we go month-to-month, but it's hard to find that kind of compare between '20 and '19 and '18 and before that. IoT is going to make a significant difference. Digital adoption is going to make a significant difference. And we're seeing customers now really having discussions with us on what can we know when from a data access from a remote from an API perspective. And so we see -- that's why we're running full steam on Otis ONE and really picking up the pace in the second half of the year to make up for the first half, where we didn't have access to all the buildings we needed to install the sensors and the gateway to our cloud. But you're going to see that pick up, and we're going to hit that 100,000 units on Otis ONE throughout the globe in the countries we've identified by year-end. And that is going to drive service quality, absolutely.\nCarter Copeland: And just as a follow-up, the demand on modernization and the flat to down there, does that represent sort of a step down that we stay there? Or is there a pent-up demand dynamic there as we look into '21 and '22?\nJudith Marks: I'm convinced there's pent-up demand. I mean, in the installed base in the segment itself, 5.5 million elevators are over 20 years old and are either in need of aesthetic upgrades or technology insertion and major upgrades and modernization. In EMEA alone, there's 3 million units that are over 20 years old. So every year, they age, they're all getting usage, especially the residential units. And the China modernization opportunity is emerging as well. So I think all of those converge and the challenge is going to be when can -- when does that budget reemerge for the customers to engage? And when do they see this not as discretionary, but really as mandatory for their own usage, for their own technology insertions.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeffrey Sprague: I wonder if we could come back to the booked margin discussion, kind of a two-pronged question around that. First of all, you responded, I think it was to Cai's question, and on your productivity and other actions that you're taking. So to be clear, is that booked margin kind of the gross booked margin? Or is that net of everything you're trying to do to counter pricing pressure?\nJudith Marks: No, it's clearly gross. It's the margin we take when we record the order. And then everything else we do is obviously to drive that down with productivity offsets and other cost actions.\nJeffrey Sprague: And then, obviously, you're just talking about the quarter with that number. Do you have a sense of kind of total margin in backlog? How that's sitting right now?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. The overall -- for the first half -- so thanks to a couple of points there, Jeff. On the second quarter, our booked margin was down 70 basis points. It's about flat for the first half because if you remember, first quarter, our booked margin was actually up. So if you average the two quarters, it's kind of flat, so on the booked margin side. On the backlog margin, our backlog margin was actually up slightly. So that was good to see that not only that is the backlog up 2%, but the margin in backlog is also up. So that's a good sign for us.\nJeffrey Sprague: Clearly. And then just on the -- back on the capital deployment. I guess kind of -- it almost looks like completing the debt reduction, you say 2021, it almost looks like it could be January of 2021. So given the kind of the exit cash balance you're going to have here, just maybe a little more color on what your appetite is to kind of institute share repurchase and/or step up kind of the M&A activity? And I guess on M&A, it's more of a question of kind of availability versus desire, but any other color you have there would be appreciated.\nJudith Marks: We have a desire for M&A, as we've always shared, and it's a matter of the right properties coming up especially to add to our service portfolio in regions where we can achieve the synergies and have the ability to integrate effectively and gain those units on the portfolio. And we continue to look at those niche properties. And as they come up, we've got a deal book that's live and always looking. We think that $50 million a year that we shared at Investor Day is still the right placeholder for us, and we continue to do very small ones that are obviously of some privately held companies that wouldn't show up. Rahul, do you want to...\nRahul Ghai: Yes. So our plan, Jeff, on the share buyback, our plan was always to start share buyback post-debt repayment. So if you accelerate the debt repayment, share buyback can also get potentially accelerated. But the situation is fluid. Obviously, we're going to watch the overall liquidity in the market. We don't want a repeat of what we saw back in March, April, when the access to CP markets got severely restricted. So we've got a strong credit rating. We're not expecting a repeat of that scenario. But to the extent that the liquidity markets -- the liquidity stays stable in the market and we accelerate our debt repayment, we're absolutely looking at accelerating the share buyback as well.\nJudith Marks: Yes. Great working capital this quarter. We're obviously going to keep driving the team to drive that free cash flow. Really pleased with that performance. And obviously, the more we generate in our liquidity situation, we will continue to focus on how we can benefit our shareholders.\nJeffrey Sprague: Sorry, maybe just one follow-up on that. Is the near-term tax rate reduction that you're seeing and realizing more a function of the delever? Or is it more kind of the structural things that you're working on?\nRahul Ghai: No, it's nothing -- it's not -- the deleverage part is not the reason why we took our tax rate down from 32% to 31.5%. Part of our reduction from 33% to 32% when we -- that we guided to in Q1 earnings call, that was related to reducing the rate of finding waste, reduce the tax that you need to pay on repatriation of cash. So we worked on that. That led to about a 1 point reduction back in Q1 on the Q1 earnings call. This reduction of 0.5 point has nothing to do with finding out ways to reduce the tax and repatriation of cash. This is more structural.\nJudith Marks: Yes. And we're going to continue that structural focus. As Rahul shared in the comments, we see a 25% to 28% effective tax rate in the midterm, lots of structural activities going on. And we view opportunities to get there over the midterm.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Judy Marks for closing remarks.\nJudith Marks: Well, thanks again, everyone, for joining the call this morning. We remain focused on executing our strategy, managing the risks and driving value for Otis shareholders while supporting our customers and efforts to safely reopen job sites and buildings. I want to once again thank our colleagues for their dedication as well as those on the front line fighting COVID-19. Stay safe and well. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Judith Marks",
            "content": "Thank you, Stacy, and good morning, everyone. We're glad that you could join us today and hope that everyone listening is safe and well. I'm very pleased with our results and grateful for the dedication of our colleagues who provided essential services and supported our customers in efforts to safely reopen job sites and buildings during these unprecedented times.  To briefly update you on the status of operations in this environment, today, all Otis factories are operating, and approximately 90% of New Equipment job sites are open, up from a low point of about 65%. In the quarter, Otis field professionals provided essential services and our maintenance business remained resilient. However, the shutdown of buildings put understandable pressure on our repair and modernization business. By June, we saw encouraging signs of improvement in many regions. In the New Equipment business, we experienced substantial recovery in China during the second quarter, while North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific continued to experience job site closures in certain areas. Our management team has done an excellent job to proactively contain costs and mitigate the impact from COVID-19. That was reflected in our results reported this morning, especially encouraging in our Service business.  In terms of liquidity, we ended Q2 with $1.9 billion of cash on hand and have a $1.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility, a strong position for us to run the business. This environment has not slowed our progress in executing on our strategies. We continue to introduce new and innovative products with our touchless elevator technologies, traffic flow solutions, purification products, or remote monitoring and predictive maintenance services. We are partnering and bringing solutions to our customers to promote and support the health and safety of their tenants and passengers. We continue to expand our product offerings, launching the Gen2 Prime in India, a low-rise entry-level elevator. This product brings a combination of safety, performance, themed aesthetics and price competitiveness to our India low-rise market with applicability to other developing markets. We continue to build momentum on the deployment of IoT, and we recently launched a new release that added several new features for our customers and to drive productivity in our organization. This new release also improves the scalability of our solution. We have a clear road map to continue to enhance the capability of our IoT solution over the next several months.  Despite the challenges introduced by the pandemic, we continue to deploy units in U.S., Europe and China in the first half and expect to place -- the pace of IoT deployment to increase substantially in the second half, and we've driven both service and material productivity through our continued IoT technology, our suite of mobility tools via iPhone apps for our field professionals and our global supply chain activities this quarter. These are just a handful of examples that led to 90 basis points of New Equipment share gains during the first half. This progress shows the strength of our strategy. As leaders here at Otis, we're proud of our company's long commitment to diversity and inclusion. Yet we also know there's more to be done if we are to become the company we want to be, an equal opportunity employer of choice for people of all cultures, genders, races and generations.  To ensure we live up to these aspirations, our leadership team and I launched our commitment to change, which is a framework to help us identify and prioritize the actions we need to take. We continue to demonstrate our commitment as Otis joined the Paradigm for Parity coalition and committed to closing our global leadership gender gap by 2030. People are at the heart of everything we do at Otis, and I'm proud of these important steps. Otis will lead our industry for inclusion and diversity.  Turning to Slide 4, Q2 results and 2020 outlook. New Equipment orders were down 6.8% at constant currency, with double-digit declines in the Americas and EMEA, partially offset by growth in Asia as China recovers from COVID-19. China orders were up high single digits, including several infrastructure awards. On a rolling 12 months, total Otis orders were flat. New Equipment backlog was up 2% versus the prior year. In the second quarter, organic sales were down 6.5%, driven by double-digit decline in the New Equipment segment and low single-digit decline in the Service segment. Adjusted operating profit was down $24 million at constant currency, and margin expanded 30 basis points, driven by continued expansion in the Service segment and the swift cost containment actions we implemented. Free cash flow was robust at $628 million, with 280% conversion of net income, reflecting strong working capital performance in the quarter. These swift cost actions and our organization's commitment to serving customers allowed us to mitigate the bottom line impact from a year-over-year decline in sales, and I'm pleased with the second quarter and first half performance despite the difficult environment we're operating in globally. We are encouraged by the recovery we've experienced in China, and are revising our 2020 outlook to reflect the solid first half performance and anticipated pace of recovery for our business in the second half across the world.  We are increasing the organic sales range, now expected to be down 2% to 4%. Adjusted operating profit is now expected in the range of flat to down $50 million at constant currency, a $75 million improvement versus the prior outlook at the midpoint, primarily from higher volume expectations. We now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range of $2.20 to $2.30, up $0.20 at the midpoint versus prior expectations. This reflects our improved operating profit outlook, lower tax rate and lower net interest costs.  Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust, between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, with full year free cash flow conversion levels between 130% and 140% of GAAP net income.  With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and the outlook in more detail. Thanks, Rahul. I'm pleased that Otis delivered a solid second quarter despite current COVID challenges, while driving our long-term strategy as the world begins to reopen. Over the medium term, we expect sustainable growth and global share gain in New Equipment up 90 basis points year-to-date to continue to expand on our leading Service portfolio. We'll continue to make progress on service transformation, deploying IoT and the digital tools that drive productivity and margin expansion. Although these are unusual times, we will continue to invest at a sustainable level to ensure we stay at the forefront of this industry and adjust our costs structurally to align with our medium-term sales outlook, and we will continue to drive EPS growth, use our robust cash generation and leverage our balance sheet to create shareholder value.  With that, I'd like Chris to open up the line for questions. Sure. Thanks, Nigel. So we have seen about 70 basis points of booked margin impact in the second quarter. That was mainly in EMEA, in Asia Pacific. China itself was flattish, and the Americas actually had improved booked margin. And as you understand, this flows through to our revenue, primarily in 2021. We do expect some pressure. We expected it this quarter. We expect some in the remaining half of the year on pricing because pricing follows macroeconomic trends. And this is really why we have focused so hard on cost containment and our productivity initiatives. The only part we don't have in our outlook is any additional activities driven by stimulus, and that could also impact pricing probably favorably. Our Service pricing is holding up well. Outside of the price concessions, we did get our normal price increases throughout the first half of the year. The price concessions themselves were a little less than we anticipated, primarily in the hospitality space, hospitality and retail, and we have included those in our outlook for the remainder of this year. So Service pricing is holding up well. Booked margin is down 70 basis points on New Equipment. But again, China flattish, and we understand what we need to do to drive cost out and drive productivity up. Yes, Julian, let me try and talk to both of those, and I'm sure Rahul will add. We have seen the job sites reopening at a fairly strong pace. Globally, it's over 90%. In April, we were at about a 65% global. Again, the current restricted areas are more so in India and Southeast Asia. So the job sites are reopening. In North America, we are almost totally reopened. But as we reopen, we're seeing some different behaviors due to health and safety concerns. So we're making sure we do initial safety start-ups, and obviously, we have to separate some of the workforce in terms of how the construction crews are coming back as well. In terms of what we're seeing on buying behaviors, the orders in -- especially in North America, in this last quarter were down. And the reason there -- a lot of the reason they were down was that the decisions were just not being made and were being delayed. When we speak to the customers, they're optimistic, and they still plan on moving forward with their projects. Additionally, when you look at our end market exposure, we are -- and we shared this in the Appendix, we are far more than 50% driven by residential. And we're seeing residential projects grow strongly. So our outlook really does anticipate that we get back to New Equipment levels sometime in 2021, and that is -- that we will obviously modulate our costs based on what we see, both the orders coming in second half of this year and then as we see the New Equipment business coming back as well. Rahul? Yes, Cai, the share is really, really important. And we prepared for this. All 4 of our regions went up in share and significantly up in the Americas and in China. And in general, we were up for the quarter, 110 basis points. And then for the half of the year, 90 basis points. So in a declining market, where the segment itself was going down last quarter high single digits, we took share everywhere. Yes. I can't report on the industry as a whole, certainly for this year. But I can tell you, we have an intense focus on growing our service portfolio. We understand that is the foundation of our business model, and we have -- we are focused on getting our Otis units back in addition to recapturing other units driving our conversion rates up, driving our cancellation rates down. So the biggest move we made in the portfolio this quarter was China, which went up over 5% in terms of units under maintenance. That's the largest growing market for the portfolio. So we've challenged the team to outgrow what they've done in the past in every region, but especially in China. Yes. It's still early. But as you know, Steve, we had a tremendous amount of remote information from our remote monitoring systems. And these are early days. The residential elevators are getting tremendous usage because most elevators, people are only stepping in, if no one else is in that in condominiums and apartments throughout the world. So the residential usage, we know is up. In the more commercial space and office space, we're working with our customers to understand that. We're adjusting some traffic flow algorithms. Our destination dispatch system is being tuned based on customer requests. But as long as a building is open, it's certainly -- the elevator is getting used and maintained and eventually, will need repair work as well. So early days. Hopefully, we'll have some more data for you on the next call. Yes, John, the major regulatory front activity is a safety regulatory program that's driving significant modernization in South Korea. And it's going very well for us, but it is a regulatory program that's going to be multiple years. Our -- in Q1, our sales were up 7%, down 1.5% in Q2. But orders for the first half are only down 0.7 -- 70 basis points. So our modernization business is actually holding up better than we had anticipated through the first half. And we've tried to put some of that revision into our assumptions for our revised outlook. But in Asia Pac, between Japan and Korea, modernization is healthy. Korea is primarily regulatory. So I think we're seeing -- and I'll start with China, where we've seen the biggest pull to start from purification fans and that's being ordered in the thousands, to touchless technologies, whether those are using our app for an iPhone or Android to be able to call the elevator or we are piloting some hand gesturing technology as well as just better traffic flow. So you see early adopters following both the technology early adopter curve, but also we're seeing it earlier in places that have recovered earlier. So China, it's already -- it's being installed. We're seeing good pickup. Where we're seeing on the early adopters in EMEA, the rest of Asia Pac and the Americas, are those building managers who really are trying to figure out how not to queue in the lobbies and how to really create a safe and healthy building environment. And it's early, but we're starting to see -- it's not material in terms of revenue yet, but a lot of people are interested. Some are doing short-term activities, but others are looking at major modernizations. And I think it's still to be determined if that modernization budget is going to replace some other modernization they were planning in their capital planners. I think we'll see that come out over the rest of '20 and into '21. I think it will be, but I think it's early days, Carter. And the -- the reason is because as we look at a lot of our maintenance activities, we did not have all the same quantity of callbacks, as Rahul showed. It's growing again as we go month-to-month, but it's hard to find that kind of compare between '20 and '19 and '18 and before that. IoT is going to make a significant difference. Digital adoption is going to make a significant difference. And we're seeing customers now really having discussions with us on what can we know when from a data access from a remote from an API perspective. And so we see -- that's why we're running full steam on Otis ONE and really picking up the pace in the second half of the year to make up for the first half, where we didn't have access to all the buildings we needed to install the sensors and the gateway to our cloud. But you're going to see that pick up, and we're going to hit that 100,000 units on Otis ONE throughout the globe in the countries we've identified by year-end. And that is going to drive service quality, absolutely. I'm convinced there's pent-up demand. I mean, in the installed base in the segment itself, 5.5 million elevators are over 20 years old and are either in need of aesthetic upgrades or technology insertion and major upgrades and modernization. In EMEA alone, there's 3 million units that are over 20 years old. So every year, they age, they're all getting usage, especially the residential units. And the China modernization opportunity is emerging as well. So I think all of those converge and the challenge is going to be when can -- when does that budget reemerge for the customers to engage? And when do they see this not as discretionary, but really as mandatory for their own usage, for their own technology insertions. No, it's clearly gross. It's the margin we take when we record the order. And then everything else we do is obviously to drive that down with productivity offsets and other cost actions. We have a desire for M&A, as we've always shared, and it's a matter of the right properties coming up especially to add to our service portfolio in regions where we can achieve the synergies and have the ability to integrate effectively and gain those units on the portfolio. And we continue to look at those niche properties. And as they come up, we've got a deal book that's live and always looking. We think that $50 million a year that we shared at Investor Day is still the right placeholder for us, and we continue to do very small ones that are obviously of some privately held companies that wouldn't show up. Rahul, do you want to... Yes. Great working capital this quarter. We're obviously going to keep driving the team to drive that free cash flow. Really pleased with that performance. And obviously, the more we generate in our liquidity situation, we will continue to focus on how we can benefit our shareholders. Yes. And we're going to continue that structural focus. As Rahul shared in the comments, we see a 25% to 28% effective tax rate in the midterm, lots of structural activities going on. And we view opportunities to get there over the midterm. Well, thanks again, everyone, for joining the call this morning. We remain focused on executing our strategy, managing the risks and driving value for Otis shareholders while supporting our customers and efforts to safely reopen job sites and buildings. I want to once again thank our colleagues for their dedication as well as those on the front line fighting COVID-19. Stay safe and well. Thank you."

            "name": "Rahul Ghai",
            "content": "Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with second quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3 billion, down 9.6%, with a 6.5% decline in organic sales and the rest from foreign exchange and net divestitures in 2019. As we anticipated and communicated during the first quarter earnings call, both the New Equipment and Service segments declined organically in the second quarter, primarily from the impact of COVID-19. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was down approximately 8% or $39 million, and down $24 million at constant currency. Operating profit declined at constant currency from the impact of lower volume, temporary price concessions that we offered to our customers to support them during these difficult times and a small increase in year-over-year bad debt expense.  We were able to partially offset this by strong productivity in both New Equipment and Service segments. In the New Equipment segment, our material productivity in the factories fall of 3% for the second quarter in a row, and in the Service segment, maintenance hours per unit continued to trend down. Cost containment efforts that we launched in Q1 of 2020 also helped alleviate the pressure from lower volume and our adjusted SG&A expenses were down close to $40 million year-over-year. At the same time, we maintained the investment in the business and R&D expense as a percentage of sales was flat versus the prior year. Our strong focus on operational execution and a favorable segment mix drove 30 basis points of margin expansion with continued margin expansion in the service segment.  Second quarter adjusted EPS was down $0.03, as a $0.05 decline from operating profit was partially offset by a $0.02 increase primarily from favorable tax rate and lower interest costs. These results were better than we had expected in the previous outlook provided during Q1 earnings call, driven by the resiliency of our Service business model and our focus on productivity and proactive management of cost and customer concessions.  Moving to Slide 6. New Equipment orders were down 6.8% at constant currency and were flat on a rolling 12-month basis. Our order intake continues to outperform the market that was down high single-digit, resulting in a 110 basis point increase in global market share in the quarter. Booked margins were down 70 basis points in the quarter and were flat year-over-year for the first half. In the quarter, booked margins were down in Asia and parts of Europe, and were partially offset by improvement in the Americas and the Middle East. New Equipment backlog was up 2% at constant currency from growth in the Americas, and backlog margin was up slightly over prior year. Organic sales were down 10.4%, with double-digit declines in the Americas and EMEA, reflecting the impact of job site closures in April and May. Sales in Asia were up 1.6%, as decline in Asia Pacific was more than offset by strength in China. China new equipment sales were up high single digits as job sites reopened and business returned to pre-COVID levels. At constant currency, New Equipment adjusted operating profit was down $46 million, and margin contracted 230 basis points, as strong material productivity and cost containment in the field was more than offset by the impact from lower volume and underabsorption of costs.  Service segment results on Slide 7 remains strong in the quarter. Number of units under maintenance contracts increased by 1%, with units in China up more than 5%. Modernization orders were down 4% as strong orders growth in China, driven by mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets was offset by lower order intake in the Americas and EMEA. Organic sales were down 3.3%, as maintenance demand remained strong, while the building shutdowns impacted discretionary repair and modernization sales. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 170 basis points, and profit grew by $14 million at constant currency, a strong contribution from productivity and cost containment actions more than offset the impact from volume decline, temporary price concessions and an increase in bad debt. Pricing environment, excluding the impact of price concessions, was modestly favorable. Overall, we closed out a solid first half in which our organic sales were down slightly more than 4%, with flat year-over-year service revenue and a 70 basis point margin expansion.  We are maintaining the execution momentum in the business and continue to make progress on key strategic initiatives: gaining share in new equipment, driving material and service productivity and containing SG&A costs. And while a challenging -- while we face a challenging business and economic environment, our operational metrics are recovering from the lows of April and May.  Turning to Slide 8. China has shown a swift recovery as business returns to normal, and the rest of the world is following suit at varying paces. We have seen improvement in access to New Equipment job sites throughout Q2 in every region. Access has largely returned to normal in the Americas and EMEA, while Asia Pacific has shown improvement, but is still facing some challenges in India and Southeast Asia due to government-imposed measures. The maintenance business was resilient in the quarter and considered essential in most areas. Access, where it was limited, has returned to normal levels towards the end of June and early Q3. Lastly, overall repair volumes are still below last year and Q1, but trends are heading in the right direction, with a number of service requests from our customers continuing to increase, and we expect to see a recovery to pre-COVID levels in the balance of the year as buildings reopen.  We are improving our 2020 outlook to reflect strong progress in the first half and these encouraging trends. On Slide 9, we now expect overall organic sales to be down 2% to 4% for the year, up from prior expectations of down 3% to 7%, with improvement in both New Equipment and Service versus prior guidance. We now expect New Equipment sales to be down mid- to high single digits and service sales to be flat to down low single digits. In the New Equipment segment, we are assuming varying rates of recovery, with the high end reflecting a slight growth in the second half of the year. In the Service segment, maintenance business has proved to be resilient in this environment, and the range reflects differing degrees of delay in discretionary repair and modernization projects in the back half of the year depending on the overall macroeconomic environment and the occupancy level of buildings. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be flat to down $50 million at constant currency, and down $40 million to $100 million at actual currency. At constant currency, the outlook increased by $75 million at the midpoint, reflecting the higher revenue versus prior guidance, strong progress on cost containment actions and a small improvement in service pricing outlook. We expect operating margin expansion in a range of 10 to 30 basis points. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be in a range of $2.20 to $2.30, up $0.20 at the midpoint, driven by improved operating profit outlook, lower net interest costs, lower tax rate and a reduced share count. We are lowering our full year tax rate guidance to 31.5% from 32% in May, and down from 33% on Investor Day. We expect the tax planning work that we're doing to continue to yield benefits and the tax rate to trend down to between 25% to 28% over the medium term.  Taking a further look at our organic growth assumptions on Slide 10. In the New Equipment segment, Americas is expected to be down mid-single digits to 10%, reflecting the sharp decline we saw in Q2. The high end or a 5% decline contemplates a rapid recovery in Q3 and growth in the back half of the year, while the lower end reflects continuing challenges in accessing the job sites. The EMEA New Equipment business is expected to be down high single digits, reflecting business recovering to pre-COVID levels during Q3 in North Europe and a gradual recovery in South Europe and the Middle East. We are improving the Asia New Equipment outlook due to strong recovery we experienced in China during Q2, and now expect Asia to be down mid-single digits. This reflects the continuing recovery in China with varying pace of recovery across Asia Pacific, with challenges in India and Southeast Asia, while the rest of Asia holds up well. In the Service business, we anticipate the maintenance business to remain stable into the back half of the year, with continued pressure on discretionary repair early in Q3 and recovery in the later months of the year, and expect the overall maintenance and repair business to be flat to down slightly for the year. While our modernization sales grew in the first half, there is potential for modernization projects to push out into 2021. And we now expect modernization sales to be flat to down low single digits. Overall, the high end of the 2% to 4% organic sales decline reflects an early Q3 recovery globally, and the low end assumes first half conditions to continue into the second half of the year.  Switching to operating profit on Slide 11. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit improved by $75 million from the May guidance at the midpoint and is now expected to be flat to down $50 million versus the prior year, reflecting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic, incremental underabsorption of costs and an impact on pricing, including some temporary price concessions in our Service business. We will continue to offset these impacts through strong material and service productivity and cost containment actions that are tracking as per prior expectations. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of $40 million to $50 million for the year and an improvement from the $60 million of headwind that we had expected in May due to the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar.  An update on capital deployment on Slide 12. We started 2020 with about $1.4 billion of cash on hand and expect to generate between $1 billion to $1.1 billion of free cash flow in 2020 and now plan to pay down $350 million of debt instead of the original placeholder of $250 million in 2020. We still expect to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in Q2 through Q4 at about 40% of adjusted net income and spend approximately $200 million between noncontrolling interest and M&A. These actions will allow us to maintain sufficient liquidity and will enable us to increase the cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year, which depending on the overall liquidity conditions in the market, can potentially allow us to start share buyback in 2021 after we complete our previously disclosed $500 million of debt repayment.  With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for some closing remarks. Yes, Nigel. So we guided to -- in our prepared remarks, we kind of mentioned that we expect the medium-term tax outlook to be about 25% to 28%. So -- and that is over the next 3 to 4 years. It's not going to be all back end-loaded. We expect measured progress over this time period. We're working on several projects. We're evaluating our entire business and understanding, okay, where should things fit from a right business perspective? And what impact does that have at tax rate? So we're working extremely hard. And I think we've shown good progress since 2019. We are now expecting this year to be about 31.5%, so 3.5% decline over where we were in 2019. So that's really good progress. And then we see a path to between 25% to 28% over the next 3 to 4 years. No, I think you covered it, Judy. It's -- overall, we've seen -- our proposals are kind of holding through the first half. It's been -- as you would expect, Q2 is a little bit softer. But over the first half, our proposal for holding China activities has been really, really strong, both across infrastructure and the other sectors. And if you look at the market in China, that was up in -- for the first half, it was pretty much up across all sectors, with Q2 being especially strong. So I mean, it's overall, it's an uncertain environment, definitely fluid. But so far, the business seems to be recovering well. And as Judy mentioned, the job sites are coming back, and that's what we're kind of focused on right now, it's just making sure that we are executing in the backlog that we have, and what will drive our revenue in the near term is obviously the backlog, which is good to see that our backlog is actually up 2% year-over-year through the second half. And then as we look forward into 2021, we'll stay focused on maintaining this backlog growth that you've seen, accelerating the pace of conversion from backlog into New Equipment revenue, driving cost out to ensure that we can stay competitive on margins and deliver strong margins. So that's what we are focused on internally. Yes. Southern Europe is definitely doing -- as you know, Southern Europe is definitely a bigger market for us. We are -- we have a #1 positioning in France, Spain and Italy, so we have definitely a strong presence in Southern Europe. But -- and the recovery has been stronger in Northern Europe. Our business in Germany did really well in the second quarter, so that we are seeing the Nordics, the German markets come -- Switzerland, come back strongly, and Southern Europe is a little bit slower, as you would expect, given what you saw happen with the pandemic. So that is definitely the case. But even if you look -- we did provide some color on the overall industry. But if you look at our European business as well, Europe, especially, the fact is that close to 70% of our Europe business in Europe, cumulatively in the EMEA, is residential, so we are a little bit more heavily skewed on the residential side in EMEA versus the rest of the world. So that obviously helps the overall mix and how the various sectors recover. And the residential market matters more to us in Europe and probably in some other parts of the world. No. So Cai, listen, we are -- again, we gave you the numbers that we are seeing. We saw our booked margin, and Judy repeated this in the response to Nigel's question. I mean, we've seen the pressure, right? It's like the booked margins were down 70 basis points. And you would expect that. I mean, Asia Pacific, given what's happening in India, given what's happening in Southeast Asia and the Indian economy still hasn't opened up. And in terms of units, that's the second largest economy in the world at the elevator market. So it's clearly an issue, right? And we are not hiding from that. And as Judy said, rightfully so, the pricing will depend on the overall macroeconomic environment. But if you go back to right from the Investor Day, what we're seeing and what we did not build into our medium-term outlook that we have provided at Investor Day, we did not build in any margin increase on the New Equipment side of the business. And the reason we did not is we expected the pricing pressures to manifest themselves over this time period.  We did not know that will be the second half of 2020 versus '21, but we knew that they were going to come at some point. And that's why starting last year, we have been so focused on driving material productivity. And we set a target for us for 3% over this medium term every year over the next 3 to 4 years. And if you look at the first half, it's great to see that we've done this now 2 quarters in a row. And that is helping. I mean if you look at our margin trajectory this quarter, and even for the first half, we're basically falling through -- our earnings are falling through at the contribution margin. That means we are able to absorb all the underabsorption, any pricing pressure, bad debt expense, all through our material productivity and cost containment. So we knew it's going to happen. We didn't know when. And I think internally, we were focused on taking costs out. So we'll be with pricing as it happens. And yes, is it worrying? Absolutely, it's worrying. But we are focused on things that we can control and making sure that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past when we gave up share because we didn't want to compete on price. So we'll keep dealing with the pressures as they come in the market. Well, listen, with the way this industry tracks share, Cai, is based on the number of units in the market. So that's how it's done. And I think everybody pretty much does it the same way. So we define share based on the number of units we booked in the quarter versus what we estimated the markets to be in second quarter versus -- and the first half. Yes. It does, Steve. So yes, I mean we increased the debt repayment from $250 million to $350 million this year, and we're still holding our long-term total debt repayment to around $500 million. So we did -- we plan to do $350 million this year and $150 million next year. Yes. No, I think if you look at Q3 versus Q4, Steve, on the new equipment side, Q4 will be -- we expect Q4 to be marginally stronger than Q3. The activity is still a little bit slow in some of the larger markets in Asia Pac like you mentioned, India, Southeast Asia. And in the U.S., while the job sites are open, the number of COVID-19 cases are still rising, and that sometimes impacts the number of people we have available to a job site, on a job site or certain job sites shut down temporarily. So there's a little bit of still fluidity in the market, but this will be counterbalanced by China, to some extent, because we are catching up in certain areas in China, and we do expect China to be strong in Q3. So overall, maybe on the New Equipment side, slight skew towards Q4. And on the Service side, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, our repair activity is still subdued due to the lower building occupancy, some of the buildings are not fully opened yet, and we expect gradual improvement as we go through the year. So on the Service side, we'll definitely have a stronger Q4 than Q3, and that's the higher-margin business. So some of the profit will kind of follow similar trajectory. Yes. The overall -- for the first half -- so thanks to a couple of points there, Jeff. On the second quarter, our booked margin was down 70 basis points. It's about flat for the first half because if you remember, first quarter, our booked margin was actually up. So if you average the two quarters, it's kind of flat, so on the booked margin side. On the backlog margin, our backlog margin was actually up slightly. So that was good to see that not only that is the backlog up 2%, but the margin in backlog is also up. So that's a good sign for us. Yes. So our plan, Jeff, on the share buyback, our plan was always to start share buyback post-debt repayment. So if you accelerate the debt repayment, share buyback can also get potentially accelerated. But the situation is fluid. Obviously, we're going to watch the overall liquidity in the market. We don't want a repeat of what we saw back in March, April, when the access to CP markets got severely restricted. So we've got a strong credit rating. We're not expecting a repeat of that scenario. But to the extent that the liquidity markets -- the liquidity stays stable in the market and we accelerate our debt repayment, we're absolutely looking at accelerating the share buyback as well. No, it's nothing -- it's not -- the deleverage part is not the reason why we took our tax rate down from 32% to 31.5%. Part of our reduction from 33% to 32% when we -- that we guided to in Q1 earnings call, that was related to reducing the rate of finding waste, reduce the tax that you need to pay on repatriation of cash. So we worked on that. That led to about a 1 point reduction back in Q1 on the Q1 earnings call. This reduction of 0.5 point has nothing to do with finding out ways to reduce the tax and repatriation of cash. This is more structural."

Otis' SEC filings, including its registration statements on Form 10 and Form S-3 and its Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy.\nJudith Marks: Thank you, Stacy, and good morning, everyone. We hope that everyone listening across all of our stakeholders is safe and well. We're glad that you could join us today on Otis' first earnings call post-spin, another important milestone for us in this new era as an independent company. Before I discuss our first quarter results and Otis' outlook, let me share some insights into our people, our business, our management through this crisis and more importantly, our commitment to our long-term strategy and values. Employee health and safety, a core value, is first and paramount to us. I am proud of our 69,000 colleagues who are supporting our customers and the riding public during these unprecedented times. Elevator maintenance and repair was deemed an essential service in most countries and cities. And we continue to service the largest global maintenance portfolio, including elevators in hospitals, critical infrastructure and residential buildings, and we're doing this while prioritizing and paying utmost attention to ensure the health and safety of our workforce around the world, allowing many employees to work from home and providing the proper PPE and guidelines for safe and hygienic working conditions for our colleagues in the field and our manufacturing operations. Early in Q1, we made critical decisions to ensure business continuity, and this helped us navigate the COVID-19 impacts, first in China and many countries throughout the world. Today, all 14 of our principal factories are open. Our supply chain team has done an excellent job locally and globally in minimizing disruptions to our factories and our field sites while meeting customer demands. Our decision to air ship critical parts early during this outbreak has enabled us to protect the supply chain, and we're confident that Otis factories around the world are ready to manufacture at full capacity as soon as job site demand resumes and businesses start to return to normal. During this time, we've extended support to our vendors where necessary, providing advances to limit supply disruptions. Let's discuss the new equipment segment by region. China has seen substantial recovery within the quarter. At this point, China factories have returned to full capacity, and access to China new equipment job sites is returning at varying pace by city to pre-COVID levels. In Asia Pacific, we're installing new equipment in several areas, including Japan, Korea and Hong Kong, while the currently hardest-hit areas are India and certain countries in Southeast Asia, where our access to job sites is limited and there are labor shortages due to government-imposed measures.  North America and EMEA continue to experience job site closures in certain areas and cities that are preventing the installation of new equipment, and we are monitoring the situation closely as job sites reopen. Moving to service. As I mentioned earlier, elevator maintenance and repair was deemed essential in most areas, allowing Otis' service professionals to provide critical maintenance for our customers. Maintenance and repair made up 80% of Otis' services sales in 2019, and our maintenance business remains resilient, while we are experiencing some pressure on our repair business, where buildings are shut down. Our field professionals continue to support round-the-clock service at hospitals across the globe. In North America and EMEA, we have seen a greater need to support a few limited customers within the hardest-hit verticals with delayed payment terms and concessions during building closures. We will continue to strengthen our long-term customer relationships. Modernization, the other 20% of our service business, is expected to see impacts from COVID-19 as discretionary projects are put on hold, especially in North America and Europe. However, some code-driven and technologically required modernizations are driving activity in Asia Pacific and other regions. Across our business, we responded with cost containment actions to address the evolving situation and associated sales declines. Our China team was focused on immediate actions, which did minimize the first quarter financial impact. Cost containment actions already underway include a global hiring freeze, reduction in travel and other discretionary costs, merit and salary deferrals, reducing executive pay and furloughs in certain locations. These are difficult but necessary actions, and our team continues to assess and adjust to address the evolving situation. This crisis has also shown us that our Otis absolutes, safety, ethics and quality, drive our commitment to each other, our customers, our passengers, our investors and to the communities where we live and work. In multiple countries across the world, we use 3D printing technology to manufacture face shields for use by our teams and by frontline workers in hospitals. In Wuhan, beyond providing uninterrupted elevator maintenance, we donated elevator cab air purifiers to several hospitals. And lastly, we pledged to match employee contributions to COVID-19 relief funds, and our colleagues continue to volunteer in local communities in many ways. As the world reopens, we will continue to innovate and lead our industry. We're leveraging technology to allow smartphones to interact with elevators for remote floor selection and providing disinfectants and fans to assist in a cleaner environment in services for elevators and escalators. We're working closely with many customers who requested elevator adaptations as their buildings reopen and people return to work locations, and we will do all of this while investing for the long term. Now let me turn to our first quarter results on Slide 4. As you've seen from our earnings release yesterday, the first quarter was a solid start for Otis in spite of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China and the subsequent global spread. On April 3, we successfully separated from United Technologies, returning to our roots as an independent company while exemplifying various elements of Otis' culture, our innovation, empowerment and collaboration. Over 200 IT systems were replicated, more than 600 procurement and IT contracts re-signed and almost 500 processes cut over. We created several new departments, including tax, treasury and investor relations and executed nearly 50 facility moves in 18 countries. I'd be remiss if I didn't once again thank our team for this historic undertaking, rising to the occasion and setting us off on the right foot as an independent Otis. In terms of liquidity, we had approximately $1.4 billion of cash at the time of separation and have an undrawn $1.5 billion revolver, which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. During the first quarter, we placed over $6 billion of debt at favorable rates. That led to a $30 million reduction in interest expense from our initial expectations. We announced a Q2 dividend yesterday of $0.20 per share and plan to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in the balance of the year. Q1 results continued the strong operational momentum that you saw during 2019. New equipment orders increased 5.6% at constant currency, excluding China, with double-digit growth in the Americas and mid-single-digit growth in EMEA. Organic sales declined slightly, excluding China, where top line growth was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Adjusted operating profit increased $17 million, and we achieved margin expansion in both the new equipment and service segments with 120 basis points of margin expansion overall. Free cash flow conversion was 73%, including the impact of spin-related tax prepayments. I'm pleased with the strong first quarter results despite the impact from COVID-19. However, we are not immune from the broader economic impact as this pandemic spreads across the globe. With this in mind, we are updating our 2020 outlook. We now expect organic sales to be down 3% to 7%, reflecting recovery beginning in early Q3 at the high end and a delayed second half recovery at the low end. Adjusted operating profit is expected to decline $25 million to $175 million at constant currency, reflecting volume declines, partially offset by cost containment actions I previously described. We expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $840 million to $940 million. This net income outlook reflects the reduction in interest expense and a 1 point adjusted tax rate improvement from our expectations in February. And lastly, we expect free cash flow conversion to remain strong between 110% and 120% of net income. With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and outlook in more detail.\nRahul Ghai: Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Q1 results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3 billion, down 4.4%, with slightly less than half of the decline coming from organic sales and the vast from the impact of foreign exchange and net divestitures in 2019. Strong organic sales growth of 3.3% in the service segment was more than offset by a 9.8% decline in new equipment due in part to COVID-19. Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 4% or $17 million and up $27 million at constant currency. Operating profit growth at constant currency was driven by approximately $45 million of operational improvement from higher service volume, strong material and service productivity, lower SG&A and transactional foreign exchange favorability. This was partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 that reduced operating profit by an estimated $17 million due to lower volume and underabsorption of costs. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 120 basis points to 15.2%, with margin expansion in both new equipment and service segments. R&D as a percentage of sales was flat versus prior year, and adjusted SG&A expense improved by about $30 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS was down $0.02 as the $0.04 improvement from operating profit and lower net interest cost was more than offset by $0.06 of headwind from tax due to an unfavorable year-over-year compare in the quarter and higher noncontrolling interest costs. Moving to Slide 6. New equipment orders grew 5.6% at constant currency, excluding China, and were flat overall for Otis. New equipment orders grew double digits in the Americas; mid-single digits in Europe and the Middle East; and declined low teens in Asia, including China. This strong order growth was delivered in a global market that was down mid-single digits excluding China and down mid-teens globally as the China market declined an estimated 20% in Q1. New equipment share continued to grow and was up an estimated 25 basis points in the quarter. While the overall bookings were down in Asia, we continued to see progress in the infrastructure segment and received several key orders, including for the Chongqing and Nantong metro projects in China. As we discussed on Investor Day, this is one of our key target segments, and our infrastructure bookings grew high teens in a segment that was down low double digits. We also saw pricing stability in most parts of the world with 80 basis points of booked margin expansion. Booked margin expanded in EMEA and China and was offset slightly by the pressure in Asia outside of China. America's booked margin was flat. Backlog was up 3% at constant currency in the quarter, with growth in Americas and EMEA offset by a low single-digit decline in China. Organic sales were down 9.8% with double-digit declines in Asia, including China, primarily from the impact of COVID-19. Sales in Americas declined 9%, reflecting a tough compare and the impact of lower order intake in Q1 of 2019. Sales in Europe were up low single digits, but this was more than offset by weak results in Middle East due to market softness. Overall, new equipment sales in EMEA were down 3%. New equipment adjusted operating profit margin expanded 80 basis points, a strong material productivity and a small benefit from lower commodity prices was more than offset the impact of volume decline. Material productivity in the quarter exceeded our long-term target of 3%, reflecting the benefit of the actions that we are taking. Service segment results on Slide 7 remain strong in the first quarter. Modernization orders grew 2.5% with high-teens growth in Asia, outside of China and Europe, primarily offset by a high single-digit decline in the Americas. Our maintenance portfolio grew by 1%. Organic sales increased 3.3%, with modernization sales up 6.8% and maintenance and repair sales up 2.5%. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 20 basis points, and profit grew by $14 million at constant currency as strong productivity, favorability in price and mix and lower SG&A expense was partially offset by higher labor costs. Service contribution expanded for the seventh straight quarter with growth in all major regions. As we close out the first quarter, our operational agenda remains on track, and we are pleased with the progress on key initiatives: driving share gain in new equipment, making continuous progress on service contributions, material cost productivity and containing SG&A costs. However, as the economic activity slows globally from the spread of COVID-19, we are seeing the impact on our business activity in the second quarter, which is highlighted on Slide 8, with the new equipment orders and factory shipments both down in April outside of China after a relatively strong start in the first couple of months of the year. We are also seeing a reduction in service sales in April due to the challenges created by closure of buildings impacting our modernization and repair business. While China activity is recovering, it is clear that the business in China will not be immune to the global slowdown. And as we look at the balance of the year, we need to adjust our revenue and earnings growth expectation that we had communicated in February while taking incremental cost actions to offset the impact to earnings from sales shortfall. Let me start with sales on Slide 9. We now expect overall organic sales to be down 3% to 7% for the year with a 5% to 10% decline in new equipment and a low to mid-single-digit decline in service. The low end or a 10% decline in new equipment reflects continuation of the first half trend into second half, while the high end or a 5% decline reflects a recovery in the second half of 2020 to 2019 levels. We do expect continued stability in our contractual maintenance business. However, the range of service sales outlook reflects varying degrees of delay and push out discretionary repair and modernization projects to continue in the back half of the year, depending on the overall macroeconomic environment and the occupancy level of buildings. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be down between $25 million and $175 million at constant currency and between $85 million and $235 million at actual currency. At the midpoint, this reflects nearly $300 million of cost containment actions that Judy alluded to earlier. Most of these actions are already announced and at varying stages of implementation. At the midpoint of our sales outlook, we would expect operating margins to be relatively flat. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $840 million to $940 million driven by reduced operating profit, partially offset by lower tax rate and noncontrolling interest costs. We are reducing our tax rate guidance for 2020 to approximately 32% from 33% at Investor Day and are working on additional projects to continue to reduce the rate over time. Free cash flow will remain strong between 110% and 120% of net income as reduction in profit and higher restructuring costs will be partially offset by reduced capital expenditures. Taking a further look at our organic growth assumptions on Slide 10. In the new equipment segment, Americas is expected to be down mid-single digits to 10%, reflecting the sharp decline we are seeing in Q2 with job site closures. The high end or a 5% decline contemplates work resuming in Q3 and growth in the back half of the year. In EMEA, there's significant delays and limited access to job sites in South Europe, the U.K., parts of Russia and the Middle East. The EMEA new equipment business has continued - is expected to be down high single digits to 10%, with the high end of the range reflecting job sites reopening in pre-COVID levels in Q3 in North Europe and a gradual recovery in South Europe and the Middle East. In China, the new equipment business is recovering in Q2. And in rest of Asia, activity in Japan and South Korea has held up relatively well. But we continue to face challenges in India and Southeast Asia from government-imposed lockdown measures. We expect the Asia new equipment business to be down mid- to high single digits depending on the pace of recovery in India and Southeast Asia and the extent of impact of the Japanese and South Korean economies from the pandemic. In the service segment, our contractual maintenance business has been resilient, and we anticipate this business to continue to be stable. However, there have been delays on discretionary repair and modernization projects as these projects push into 2021. and we now expect modernization sales to be down mid- to high single digits and maintenance and repair to be down low single digits for the year. Overall, the high end of the 3% to 7% organic sales decline reflects an early Q3 recovery globally, and the low end assumes first half conditions to continue into the second half of the year. Switching to profit outlook on Slide 11. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be down between $25 million and $175 million year-over-year, reflecting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic; incremental underabsorption of costs; higher bad debt expense due to deteriorating credit outlook; and an impact to pricing, especially at the higher end of the sales decline. This will be partially offset by the cost actions we have taken and will take in the balance of the year. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of $60 million for the year versus the $20 million that we were expecting in February due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Moving to 2020 capital deployment on Slide 12. At spin, our net debt-to-EBITDA was about 2.4x with $1.4 billion in cash. During 2020, we expect to generate between $925 million to $1.025 billion of cash and plan to pay down $250 million of debt and return $260 million to shareholders through dividends between Q2 and Q4 at about 40% of adjusted net income. Approximately $200 million will be spent between noncontrolling interest and M&A. We believe these capital deployment plans are prudent during these uncertain times as they allow us to increase the cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year and are consistent with what we announced in February, reflecting our confidence in the cash flow generation capacity of this business. With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for some closing remarks.\nJudith Marks: Thanks, Rahul. A great start to the year. And while the pace of recovery is not known yet, Q1 results illustrate that we are on track to support our investment thesis and long-term strategy. We're confident that Otis will endure and succeed despite today's current challenges. And I want to close by reminding you of the strong fundamentals behind this fantastic business. This is truly an iconic brand in this large industry, where we have been the leader. Over the medium term, we expect sustainable growth and global share gain and new equipment to continue to expand on our leading 2 million unit service portfolio, the heart of our recurring business model, where we'll continue to focus on margin expansion through productivity. And in these difficult times, we're going to continue to invest for growth, maintaining a sustainable level of R&D and capital expenditures to ensure that when we all return to our normal lives, we are still at the forefront of technology, driving digital innovations, providing new solutions for our customers and empowering our field professionals with tools to make them more effective. You have our commitment that we'll use our robust cash generation in excess of 100% of net income to create shareholder value, and you saw that with our dividend announcement yesterday. With that, I'd like Angela to open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeffrey Sprague: Congrats on a great start out of the gate. A couple from me, if I could, please. First, Judy or Rahul, could you comment a little bit more on what you're seeing on pricing and the potential pressure on bad debt? And is the pricing comment essentially a new equipment issue? Or are you seeing that across the service business also?\nRahul Ghai: All right, Jeff. So pricing, actually, we had a good start to the year. I mean, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the new equipment - the booked margin actually expanded. We saw that, and it was pretty strong across the globe with small - slight pressure in Asia. But outside of that, it was fairly good. So really, really good start to the year. In America, where we saw some pricing last year, the pricing was stable this year. Europe, we saw good pricing. And the same thing - even in China, where the markets were down, we were - our booked margins actually went up a little bit. So good start to the year on the new equipment side. And same thing on service pricing as well. And the service pricing held up really well in Q1. And we gained a little bit of price in Q1, and we implemented our regularly scheduled price increases that we had planned. Having said that, I mean, the situation in Q2 is different, and we're working with our customers in the hardest-hit sectors in hospitality, in retail, et cetera, that Judy mentioned a little bit in her prepared comments. These sectors make up about less than 10% of our service installed base. And - but these are temporary concessions and therefore, a very specific period of time, and we do not expect any long-term impact from these. Also, most of our customers do understand that we do have fixed costs like our Otis call center, and we need to maintain and address service issues and - even when the buildings are only partially occupied. So that is why the concession requests have been very limited, and we've addressed each one of them individually. But as we gave guidance, we obviously factored in that these concession requests might increase. Again, as I said, we have not seen a lot of these. There have been a few and - which we've addressed them at one at a time. But in our guidance, we've assumed some impact and - especially at the higher end of the range. And same thing on new equipment. We've assumed that there is a little bit of pricing pressure in the back end of the year, especially on the new orders. Now most of that will not impact this year. But on the service pricing, the concessions that we're talking about will come through our results this year. So that's what we've kind of guided to. Same thing on the bad debt. The results were okay in Q1. There was not a lot of incremental P&L expense. We did take not a lot of incremental P&L expense in Q1, but we have factored some in our outlook at the back end of the year.\nJudith Marks: Yes. Jeff, this is Judy. The long-term relationships we have with these customers are that we're there for them when times are challenging as well. And as Rahul said, the hospitality retail segment is just under 10% for us. I really was pleased, China price/mix up for the seventh straight quarter. So new equipment, again, although it was up - booked margin was up everywhere. China, again, delivering, especially in a COVID quarter. And then on our service pricing, our revenue per unit was up as well for another quarter. So those indications, again, strong performance in Q1, and we're going to continue to watch price in Q2 through 4.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great. And maybe just an unrelated second question just on tax. With a little bit more time under your belt, do you have a kind of better idea of what the - maybe the 2 or 3 year trajectory of the tax rate might be?\nRahul Ghai: Again, it's early days, Jeff, right? Overall, we feel that we're making progress. I mean our last year tax rate was 34%. We guided to 33% on Investor Day. Now we are at 32%. And the improvement that you're seeing between Investor Day and now is coming from reduction in the taxes that we have to pay on repatriation of cash. If you recall at Investor Day, we had mentioned that we had about 2 to 3 points of tax headwind because we needed to pay tax when we repatriate cash into the U.S. And that, we've been able to work on certain projects to reduce that, and we are taking incremental actions in early 2021 to maybe take some of our dollar-denominated debt and convert that into euro-denominated debt. So we're taking incremental actions. And beyond that, we are working on several initiatives to structure our business better and to reduce the tax that we pay on high-tax jurisdictions. We'll keep updating you as we learn more, but we are in early stages. But I'm confident that rate is going to come down over time.\nOperator: And your next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: And actually, congrats on getting a tricky first quarter out of the way. Maybe one thing that might be helpful is when we're thinking about the recovery slope is just a bit more color on the end market split, Judy, if you'd be willing to provide that. Understood that hospitality and retail is sub-10%, but perhaps if you could flesh out maybe some of the other splits. Or if not, at least give us some context as to how your split might differ from the one that KONE provided a couple of weeks ago just directionally.\nJudith Marks: Sure, Julian. So the residential market, which obviously is not single-family homes, the residential market is north of 50% for us in both of our segments, and that tracks the industry overall. That's really where the strength has been coming from and the usage has been coming from that we've been seeing the demand as well on repair is in the residential segment. Other than that, we really don't break these out below that. But as you can imagine, we are talking to a lot of customers as they do rebound and more importantly, reopen and come off pause as to how they want their buildings to be utilized, especially in the office and commercial space, whether that's malls or more importantly, office buildings. So we've got lots of requests to help with limited spacing. We've gotten helps - requests to help with additional products. But I think what it does is it reinforces our Compass product, our destination dispatch product, which does allow touch-free utilization as well as improved utilization of elevators. So it's early days to see where - when the recovery happens and how the world reopens, but we're in significant dialogue with lots of our customers across all segments on that.\nJulian Mitchell: And then maybe just a follow-up question for Rahul on the free cash flow. Maybe just help us understand that free cash flow pressure in the first quarter and how quickly the free cash flow recovers. And also, I guess, I was a bit confused, because if I look at the material, I think you have about $975 million of free cash flow guide at the midpoint. I guess excluding NCI, about $890 million of adjusted net income at the midpoint. So it's maybe about a 110% conversion on adjusted net. But I think the conversion you present is versus GAAP net income. So just wanted to check that. And does that mean that GAAP net income and adjusted net income are broadly similar for the year even with that big delta in Q1?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. Let's start with Q1 cash, Julian. So we feel we had a good start to the year despite the COVID-19 situation. So in our Q1 cash, we pulled forward about $70 million of tax payments from Q2 through Q4, and that was primarily due to the spin. So that's in our Q1 results. Again, Judy had it in the prepared remarks. Also, we did extend support to our vendors, especially in China. And you see that our payables were down about $200 million from December to March. So - and part of this decline was to support getting our supply chain up and ready in China, and this cash flow impact should get mitigated between Q2 and Q3. But despite the impact that we saw in China, our working capital actually came down by about $30 million in the quarter, and then we had about $47 million of separation costs. So overall, we feel that we had a very strong performance operationally given the pull forward of tax payments, the impact that we saw in China given the support that we had to extend to our vendors and then the separation costs. So working capital coming down. So overall, we feel really good about how our business performed on cash given the overall environment. Now what you will see - and going back to your second question on how this kind of translates into the rest of the year. Now Q2 is going to be a little bit challenging in Europe and China - Europe and the U.S. China is going to recover, but we will see some pressure in Q2 in Europe and the U.S. And then - so our cash flow will be a little bit more skewed towards Q3 and Q4 than it typically is, but you would expect that given the overall macroeconomic environment. But we feel good about our guidance. I think we've done - we've taken good steps to offset and mitigate some of the impact that is coming through from the drop in net income from our previous guide to this guide. I mean if you look at the guide-to-guide on our net income, probably down at the midpoint at AFX, about $150 million. And we've mitigated that through lower Capex. We've reduced our interest cost. There are some tax payments that we try to manage, some of that coming through the CARES Act. But we try to put all that in and yet drive $975 million of cash as kind of the midpoint. So it's - we feel good about our back-end recovery in cash flow. Now on the conversion question, you're right, Julian. It is about 110% on our reported net income basis. But the guide that we provided to - includes some of the cash that will outflow on the separation costs, the PSA payments that you'll have to make to UTC. So we factored that in. And some of the restructuring that we've taken - the restructuring has actually gone up year-over-year as well. So that reflects some of the impact on that. So adjusting for some of the onetime expenses we will have, the number is between $110 million to $120 million. And we've excluded any noncash onetimers. Like the asset write-off that we had in Q1, we've excluded that from the calculation. So it is purely on the GAAP net income adjusting for any noncash charges that we will have. So that's the guide. That's the range, $110 million to $120 million. And as adjusted net income, which we'll speak to, that's at 110% at the midpoint.\nOperator: And your next question is from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Just to clarify, that $70 million tax payment is kind of part of the - is that part of the separation and you're including that in the $975 million?\nRahul Ghai: No. It's not part of the separation, Steve. It is - it got pulled forward into Q1 because of sort of spin related - consequences of spin. Let me put it that way. So that's what - we're working on some things. It's complicated. But the reality is no impact to full year. It got pulled forward into Q1 due to the spin. So that's it.\nSteve Tusa: Right. So I guess, like your cash tax rate is kind of consistent this year with what you would expect going forward is the point absent any of the moves you're going to make strategically on your GAAP tax rate.\nRahul Ghai: For full year, it will have no impact to our cash taxes. Right. So that's right.\nSteve Tusa: Right. Right. So it won't be a tailwind next year is your point?\nRahul Ghai: No. It won't be a tailwind next year.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. When you talked about the pricing dynamics, so you kind of bounced back and forth between services and new equipment. How should we think about that breakout? Is there a heavier weighting to one or the other? I mean you talked about kind of helping some customers out. That seems like it would be more of a services dynamic. Maybe you could just, like, flesh out if there's more of a weighting to one or the other.\nJudith Marks: Yes. So in terms of the concessions we've made, those are 4 services mainly in the hospitality industry mainly in the U.S., Steve, just so you understand. Our China team was able to really work through this very rapidly. And obviously, these are long-term partnerships, and we're being a responsive partner and supplier. But as we look at booked margin on the service side, it was up fairly significantly, mainly in EMEA and China. And then it was up more significantly than the new equipment booked margin was up. But the new equipment book margin, obviously, it drives our $16.5 billion backlog fairly substantively over the ensuing 24 months. So any time we can get that booked margin up on orders, be it in China or anywhere else in the world, it's a nice rolling tailwind for us as we look into the next year's sales.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Got it. And then one just last question on the second quarter. If you look back to last year, pretty punchy number for new equipment margins. You had pretty significant, I think, mix kind of tailwind. Maybe that was China flowing through. So the year-over-year comp there looks kind of tough. Maybe if you could just give us some kind of sequential color on - to kind of calibrate everybody for what's coming here in the second quarter, acknowledging that things will kind of bounce back or bounce around in the second half. Are we - from an EPS perspective, could we be down as much as kind of 30% to 40% sequentially 1Q to 2Q?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. So we don't want to comment on specific numbers, Steve, but you're right. And Q2 is probably going to be our toughest quarter, without a doubt. I mean you see what's happened in April, and we've seen some recovery in May, obviously, as things begin to open up. But April was a really tough month for us, and you saw that - some of the data that we put out there. So we do expect a fairly sharp decline in organic revenue year-over-year, and it's going to be more so on the new equipment side for - and then less on the service - and then the service is going to be mainly on modernization and repair. But the new equipment side is going to be impacted substantially in Q2. So that is what we are expecting. So you're right in terms of modeling. Obviously, we had a good start to the year. Q2 should kind of maybe kind of offset some of that, and then we see recovery in - on the new equipment side starting to happen in the back half of the year.\nJudith Marks: So Steve, let me...\nSteve Tusa: Yes. So new equipment margins will be down quarter-to-quarter? Or can you hold those flat?\nRahul Ghai: New equipment margins could be down quarter-to-quarter. We're not going to give specific guidance, but yes, they could give what we're seeing. And it all depends on - the reason we're hesitating, Steve, a little bit is it all depends on how the recovery is in June. If we're coming out of the gate - if the job sites begin to open up and we are able to get quickly to work and we resume activity, it could be a little bit better. So that's where we're hesitating because it just is the near-term outlook is kind of not very clear at this point. So that's where we're kind of hedging ourselves a little bit.\nJudith Marks: Yes. And Steve, we really are watching open - how job sites - the pace at which job sites are opening very carefully. And we're monitoring it almost on a daily basis in the regions. But when you look at a company - a country that was in lockdown like Italy, the job sites are now almost 35% open. In Spain, they're almost 90% open. And so we're really seeing the construction part of the new - which is the main element of new equipment, obviously, other than the manufacturing is the installation and construction piece. It's that speed of recovery that we're trying to watch and calibrate and monitor for 2Q.\nOperator: And your next question is from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research.\nCarter Copeland: And welcome to the independent world and your first conference call. It's a great set of results.\nJudith Marks: Thanks, Carter.\nCarter Copeland: Just a couple of quick ones. One, Rahul, I wondered if you could give us a little bit more color on the cost-out actions and how much of that is temporary, things like furloughs versus anything that might be run rate as we look further into the future. And then one for Judy. Just wondering about the impact of this whole thing and the change that it may bring on the competitive landscape on the service side just given your scale benefits versus ISPs. I mean I would assume you can bring much more to bear in terms of service performance and reliability. I just wondered if you might give us some thoughts on that.\nRahul Ghai: Yes. So obviously, as you would expect, that at the midpoint of $300 million of cost takeout actions that we have planned for, it's a combination of both. I mean it's a combination of structural actions. It's also a lot of the short-term actions that we're taking, which Judy mentioned, including furlough, merit deferral. So it's a combination of the two and if you see our restructuring numbers, we upped that to $70 million to $80 million. We spent about $50 million to $60 million last year. So it's incrementally higher. We are looking at our structural cost at a very, very hard way, looking at where duplication of work is happening, pulling that out. So we are taking a lot of hard restructuring actions, as you would expect us do. So that's a piece of the cost takeout. But a lot of these actions may have a more limited impact in 2020 and probably help us in 2021 more than they help us in 2020. In 2020, a lot of the benefit that you will see come through is going to be from the short-term actions that we are taking. So that includes merit deferrals. That includes furloughs and executive pay reductions, all the things that you would expect us to do. And we're going to watch this thing very carefully, and it depends on whether - how it translates into 2021, depends on how the revenue comes back. And our goal will be to ensure that we take enough structural cost out to mitigate the impact of any onetime headwind that we will get from these actions that we're taking.\nJudith Marks: And let me address your second question, Carter, on impact to service. We've looked back and modeled the global financial crisis to understand what transpired there. And for those of you that covered Otis as part of UTC back then, you'll recall we had a 10 percentage point, not just 10 basis points, 10 percentage point higher ROS than our local nearest competitors. The two biggest differences that we're seeing coming with COVID-19 right now in 2020 are the precipitous building closures, which are having an impact, not just on the construction side but on our access for repairs, especially discretionary repairs. We did not see this during the global financial crisis. And the other key element is there's no oversupply right now of the skilled technicians and field professionals, which we did have back in the global financial crisis. So we have worked extremely hard to maintain - we have 40,000 service - field professionals, 33,000 service to make sure that, working with our workers' councils, our unions, that we have retained and are engaged with our field workforce because this is a labor business, and they're the strength of our company to drive all of our servicing globally. We have the liquidity as well, which some of the ISPs won't have. So we see the dynamic changing. We've started a recapture campaign while our sales forces are mainly working from home to be able to grow our portfolio and to get some of our customers back, who may have left us for ISPs over the years. And then we have sustained our investment in our Otis ONE IoT offering so that we'll continue to have both technological as well as transparent and predictive information to be able to provide service in a more productive way and a better way for our customers. So I actually see service coming out of this once we get through the discretionary delays. I don't think they're a demand issue. It's really a delay issue. And once we get through those, we see service having the potential to accelerate.\nOperator: And your next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific. So you mentioned the 60% of your base, resi and retail hospitality. What's the other 40%? How is it split between infrastructure, hospitals and commercial office? And are you seeing any weakness there, specifically commercial office?\nJudith Marks: Yes. Cai, this is Judy. We don't disclose the segments that way - the end markets that way. I can tell you, our infrastructure business is continuing. Obviously, it's a broad-based business, great success in China as well as the rest of the world. But obviously, linkage to what's happening in the aviation market because not only do we support metros and rail and stadiums, we also obviously support airports. All that maintenance work is continuing in our service business, but there are several large bids that are still underway for airport modernization that we think is going to be demand delay as well. But again, we don't break those out specifically.\nCai von Rumohr: Great. And then a second one on the concessions. I mean given that you're the strongest service population in the Americas, where there have been requests for concessions in the hospitality section and retail, are you seeing that trend getting worse? And what does that imply for service margins in the second quarter relative to the first?\nRahul Ghai: The trends are not getting worse, Cai. We did, as you would expect, that we've been working with our customers to make concessions where they're applicable, where the industries are hurting. Judy said we do believe in long-standing relationships with customers. So we have to react and share some of the pain that they are suffering. So that was where we came out, and we made certain concessions that are tied and limited to a certain price - certain time period. So that's where we worked. Now it's not getting worse. You will see some impact from that in Q2, and some of that may spill over into Q3 depending on when those concessions started. But it's for a very, very limited period of time, and it's going to be spread between Q2 and Q3.\nOperator: And your final question is from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Last question so I better make this a good one. So look, turning to the profit bridge, the - that COVID-19 bucket, the $260 million to $515 million buckets, I mean, obviously, that includes price, bad debts and absorption and of course, volumes. But when you think about the raw volumes, decremental margins we should expect for new equipment and for service, how do we think about that? I mean how does that break out between the 2 segments?\nRahul Ghai: So the way I would think about this, Nigel - and the question - your question is always good, right? So it doesn't matter whether it's the last one or the first one. So in terms - so if you look at our disclosures that we have made, our contribution margin on new equipment averages between, depending on the quarter, about 17% to 18%, right? So that's our overall contribution on new equipment. And the service side, it's obviously higher. And so we - overall, if you look across the entire business, that averages out about 25%, 26% contribution margin. But then there is some underabsorption of cost when the revenue decline is as sharp as what we're seeing this year, especially on the service side because the fact is in service, we primarily use our own technicians to service the elevators and modernize those elevators. So that's where we see some incremental pressure because of underabsorption of cost. So that's what we've kind of modeled in that bucket. It's that contribution margin, plus there's an incremental impact from underabsorption of cost. Now we are working to offset that and you see some of that on the - in the green bucket. As we spoke about, we have taken actions wherever we could to reduce the underabsorption through - whether it's through restructuring actions or through furlough. So we are taking actions to reduce the underabsorption. So we kind of - one is on the left, the other one is in the middle of the page. So that's what that is. So overall, you should think about 25% of our contribution margin plus an additional impact from underabsorption.\nNigel Coe: Great. That's good information. And then just a couple of quick ones here. So the outlook for the service outlook, the low to mid-single-digit declines, you've given some great regional flavor there. But should we expect that most of that, if not all of it, lands in 2Q? Or are you assuming that there could be some declines in 3Q as well?\nJudith Marks: Yes. I think it depends, Nigel, on whether we're going to see the high end or the low end. So on the high end, we think the majority of it is in Q2, but it will continue for the repairs depending on how the - our access to buildings are. And then obviously, on the low end, we do see, again, that whole - second half of the year being far more challenged and rolling out throughout the whole year.\nNigel Coe: Great. And then just a quick one on NCI. A bit stronger than expected, certainly in light of what's China - the performance in China in 1Q. So just wondering what drove that higher.\nRahul Ghai: In Q1, Nigel? Is that the question?\nNigel Coe: In Q1, yes.\nRahul Ghai: Q1, yes. Our profit with some of the JVs that we had in Spain and China was better. And we did better year-over-year in some of those businesses, and that drove a higher JV - payment to our JV partners.\nNigel Coe: So China JV income was actually higher year-over-year?\nRahul Ghai: Again, we don't talk about China specifically. But between China and Spain, that makes up about 75% of our overall income, and that's what's driving our incremental expense on NCI in Q1. But our China business did very, very well despite the challenges on volume.\nNigel Coe: Got it. Okay. And congratulations on getting the ship launched.\nOperator: Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Judy Marks for closing remarks.\nJudith Marks: Well, thanks again for joining the call this morning. During these uncertain times, we remain focused on executing our strategy, managing risks and driving value for Otis shareholders. I want to thank our colleagues for their dedication as well as those on the front-line fighting COVID-19. Please stay safe and well, and we hope to hear from you all soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Judith Marks",
            "content": "Thank you, Stacy, and good morning, everyone. We hope that everyone listening across all of our stakeholders is safe and well. We're glad that you could join us today on Otis' first earnings call post-spin, another important milestone for us in this new era as an independent company. Before I discuss our first quarter results and Otis' outlook, let me share some insights into our people, our business, our management through this crisis and more importantly, our commitment to our long-term strategy and values. Employee health and safety, a core value, is first and paramount to us. I am proud of our 69,000 colleagues who are supporting our customers and the riding public during these unprecedented times. Elevator maintenance and repair was deemed an essential service in most countries and cities. And we continue to service the largest global maintenance portfolio, including elevators in hospitals, critical infrastructure and residential buildings, and we're doing this while prioritizing and paying utmost attention to ensure the health and safety of our workforce around the world, allowing many employees to work from home and providing the proper PPE and guidelines for safe and hygienic working conditions for our colleagues in the field and our manufacturing operations. Early in Q1, we made critical decisions to ensure business continuity, and this helped us navigate the COVID-19 impacts, first in China and many countries throughout the world. Today, all 14 of our principal factories are open. Our supply chain team has done an excellent job locally and globally in minimizing disruptions to our factories and our field sites while meeting customer demands. Our decision to air ship critical parts early during this outbreak has enabled us to protect the supply chain, and we're confident that Otis factories around the world are ready to manufacture at full capacity as soon as job site demand resumes and businesses start to return to normal. During this time, we've extended support to our vendors where necessary, providing advances to limit supply disruptions. Let's discuss the new equipment segment by region. China has seen substantial recovery within the quarter. At this point, China factories have returned to full capacity, and access to China new equipment job sites is returning at varying pace by city to pre-COVID levels. In Asia Pacific, we're installing new equipment in several areas, including Japan, Korea and Hong Kong, while the currently hardest-hit areas are India and certain countries in Southeast Asia, where our access to job sites is limited and there are labor shortages due to government-imposed measures.  North America and EMEA continue to experience job site closures in certain areas and cities that are preventing the installation of new equipment, and we are monitoring the situation closely as job sites reopen. Moving to service. As I mentioned earlier, elevator maintenance and repair was deemed essential in most areas, allowing Otis' service professionals to provide critical maintenance for our customers. Maintenance and repair made up 80% of Otis' services sales in 2019, and our maintenance business remains resilient, while we are experiencing some pressure on our repair business, where buildings are shut down. Our field professionals continue to support round-the-clock service at hospitals across the globe. In North America and EMEA, we have seen a greater need to support a few limited customers within the hardest-hit verticals with delayed payment terms and concessions during building closures. We will continue to strengthen our long-term customer relationships. Modernization, the other 20% of our service business, is expected to see impacts from COVID-19 as discretionary projects are put on hold, especially in North America and Europe. However, some code-driven and technologically required modernizations are driving activity in Asia Pacific and other regions. Across our business, we responded with cost containment actions to address the evolving situation and associated sales declines. Our China team was focused on immediate actions, which did minimize the first quarter financial impact. Cost containment actions already underway include a global hiring freeze, reduction in travel and other discretionary costs, merit and salary deferrals, reducing executive pay and furloughs in certain locations. These are difficult but necessary actions, and our team continues to assess and adjust to address the evolving situation. This crisis has also shown us that our Otis absolutes, safety, ethics and quality, drive our commitment to each other, our customers, our passengers, our investors and to the communities where we live and work. In multiple countries across the world, we use 3D printing technology to manufacture face shields for use by our teams and by frontline workers in hospitals. In Wuhan, beyond providing uninterrupted elevator maintenance, we donated elevator cab air purifiers to several hospitals. And lastly, we pledged to match employee contributions to COVID-19 relief funds, and our colleagues continue to volunteer in local communities in many ways. As the world reopens, we will continue to innovate and lead our industry. We're leveraging technology to allow smartphones to interact with elevators for remote floor selection and providing disinfectants and fans to assist in a cleaner environment in services for elevators and escalators. We're working closely with many customers who requested elevator adaptations as their buildings reopen and people return to work locations, and we will do all of this while investing for the long term. Now let me turn to our first quarter results on Slide 4. As you've seen from our earnings release yesterday, the first quarter was a solid start for Otis in spite of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China and the subsequent global spread. On April 3, we successfully separated from United Technologies, returning to our roots as an independent company while exemplifying various elements of Otis' culture, our innovation, empowerment and collaboration. Over 200 IT systems were replicated, more than 600 procurement and IT contracts re-signed and almost 500 processes cut over. We created several new departments, including tax, treasury and investor relations and executed nearly 50 facility moves in 18 countries. I'd be remiss if I didn't once again thank our team for this historic undertaking, rising to the occasion and setting us off on the right foot as an independent Otis. In terms of liquidity, we had approximately $1.4 billion of cash at the time of separation and have an undrawn $1.5 billion revolver, which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. During the first quarter, we placed over $6 billion of debt at favorable rates. That led to a $30 million reduction in interest expense from our initial expectations. We announced a Q2 dividend yesterday of $0.20 per share and plan to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in the balance of the year. Q1 results continued the strong operational momentum that you saw during 2019. New equipment orders increased 5.6% at constant currency, excluding China, with double-digit growth in the Americas and mid-single-digit growth in EMEA. Organic sales declined slightly, excluding China, where top line growth was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Adjusted operating profit increased $17 million, and we achieved margin expansion in both the new equipment and service segments with 120 basis points of margin expansion overall. Free cash flow conversion was 73%, including the impact of spin-related tax prepayments. I'm pleased with the strong first quarter results despite the impact from COVID-19. However, we are not immune from the broader economic impact as this pandemic spreads across the globe. With this in mind, we are updating our 2020 outlook. We now expect organic sales to be down 3% to 7%, reflecting recovery beginning in early Q3 at the high end and a delayed second half recovery at the low end. Adjusted operating profit is expected to decline $25 million to $175 million at constant currency, reflecting volume declines, partially offset by cost containment actions I previously described. We expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $840 million to $940 million. This net income outlook reflects the reduction in interest expense and a 1 point adjusted tax rate improvement from our expectations in February. And lastly, we expect free cash flow conversion to remain strong between 110% and 120% of net income. With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and outlook in more detail. Thanks, Rahul. A great start to the year. And while the pace of recovery is not known yet, Q1 results illustrate that we are on track to support our investment thesis and long-term strategy. We're confident that Otis will endure and succeed despite today's current challenges. And I want to close by reminding you of the strong fundamentals behind this fantastic business. This is truly an iconic brand in this large industry, where we have been the leader. Over the medium term, we expect sustainable growth and global share gain and new equipment to continue to expand on our leading 2 million unit service portfolio, the heart of our recurring business model, where we'll continue to focus on margin expansion through productivity. And in these difficult times, we're going to continue to invest for growth, maintaining a sustainable level of R&D and capital expenditures to ensure that when we all return to our normal lives, we are still at the forefront of technology, driving digital innovations, providing new solutions for our customers and empowering our field professionals with tools to make them more effective. You have our commitment that we'll use our robust cash generation in excess of 100% of net income to create shareholder value, and you saw that with our dividend announcement yesterday. With that, I'd like Angela to open up the line for questions. Yes. Jeff, this is Judy. The long-term relationships we have with these customers are that we're there for them when times are challenging as well. And as Rahul said, the hospitality retail segment is just under 10% for us. I really was pleased, China price/mix up for the seventh straight quarter. So new equipment, again, although it was up - booked margin was up everywhere. China, again, delivering, especially in a COVID quarter. And then on our service pricing, our revenue per unit was up as well for another quarter. So those indications, again, strong performance in Q1, and we're going to continue to watch price in Q2 through 4. Sure, Julian. So the residential market, which obviously is not single-family homes, the residential market is north of 50% for us in both of our segments, and that tracks the industry overall. That's really where the strength has been coming from and the usage has been coming from that we've been seeing the demand as well on repair is in the residential segment. Other than that, we really don't break these out below that. But as you can imagine, we are talking to a lot of customers as they do rebound and more importantly, reopen and come off pause as to how they want their buildings to be utilized, especially in the office and commercial space, whether that's malls or more importantly, office buildings. So we've got lots of requests to help with limited spacing. We've gotten helps - requests to help with additional products. But I think what it does is it reinforces our Compass product, our destination dispatch product, which does allow touch-free utilization as well as improved utilization of elevators. So it's early days to see where - when the recovery happens and how the world reopens, but we're in significant dialogue with lots of our customers across all segments on that. Yes. So in terms of the concessions we've made, those are 4 services mainly in the hospitality industry mainly in the U.S., Steve, just so you understand. Our China team was able to really work through this very rapidly. And obviously, these are long-term partnerships, and we're being a responsive partner and supplier. But as we look at booked margin on the service side, it was up fairly significantly, mainly in EMEA and China. And then it was up more significantly than the new equipment booked margin was up. But the new equipment book margin, obviously, it drives our $16.5 billion backlog fairly substantively over the ensuing 24 months. So any time we can get that booked margin up on orders, be it in China or anywhere else in the world, it's a nice rolling tailwind for us as we look into the next year's sales. So Steve, let me... Yes. And Steve, we really are watching open - how job sites - the pace at which job sites are opening very carefully. And we're monitoring it almost on a daily basis in the regions. But when you look at a company - a country that was in lockdown like Italy, the job sites are now almost 35% open. In Spain, they're almost 90% open. And so we're really seeing the construction part of the new - which is the main element of new equipment, obviously, other than the manufacturing is the installation and construction piece. It's that speed of recovery that we're trying to watch and calibrate and monitor for 2Q. Thanks, Carter. And let me address your second question, Carter, on impact to service. We've looked back and modeled the global financial crisis to understand what transpired there. And for those of you that covered Otis as part of UTC back then, you'll recall we had a 10 percentage point, not just 10 basis points, 10 percentage point higher ROS than our local nearest competitors. The two biggest differences that we're seeing coming with COVID-19 right now in 2020 are the precipitous building closures, which are having an impact, not just on the construction side but on our access for repairs, especially discretionary repairs. We did not see this during the global financial crisis. And the other key element is there's no oversupply right now of the skilled technicians and field professionals, which we did have back in the global financial crisis. So we have worked extremely hard to maintain - we have 40,000 service - field professionals, 33,000 service to make sure that, working with our workers' councils, our unions, that we have retained and are engaged with our field workforce because this is a labor business, and they're the strength of our company to drive all of our servicing globally. We have the liquidity as well, which some of the ISPs won't have. So we see the dynamic changing. We've started a recapture campaign while our sales forces are mainly working from home to be able to grow our portfolio and to get some of our customers back, who may have left us for ISPs over the years. And then we have sustained our investment in our Otis ONE IoT offering so that we'll continue to have both technological as well as transparent and predictive information to be able to provide service in a more productive way and a better way for our customers. So I actually see service coming out of this once we get through the discretionary delays. I don't think they're a demand issue. It's really a delay issue. And once we get through those, we see service having the potential to accelerate. Yes. Cai, this is Judy. We don't disclose the segments that way - the end markets that way. I can tell you, our infrastructure business is continuing. Obviously, it's a broad-based business, great success in China as well as the rest of the world. But obviously, linkage to what's happening in the aviation market because not only do we support metros and rail and stadiums, we also obviously support airports. All that maintenance work is continuing in our service business, but there are several large bids that are still underway for airport modernization that we think is going to be demand delay as well. But again, we don't break those out specifically. Yes. I think it depends, Nigel, on whether we're going to see the high end or the low end.

            "name": "Rahul Ghai",
            "content": "Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Q1 results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3 billion, down 4.4%, with slightly less than half of the decline coming from organic sales and the vast from the impact of foreign exchange and net divestitures in 2019. Strong organic sales growth of 3.3% in the service segment was more than offset by a 9.8% decline in new equipment due in part to COVID-19. Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 4% or $17 million and up $27 million at constant currency. Operating profit growth at constant currency was driven by approximately $45 million of operational improvement from higher service volume, strong material and service productivity, lower SG&A and transactional foreign exchange favorability. This was partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 that reduced operating profit by an estimated $17 million due to lower volume and underabsorption of costs. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 120 basis points to 15.2%, with margin expansion in both new equipment and service segments. R&D as a percentage of sales was flat versus prior year, and adjusted SG&A expense improved by about $30 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS was down $0.02 as the $0.04 improvement from operating profit and lower net interest cost was more than offset by $0.06 of headwind from tax due to an unfavorable year-over-year compare in the quarter and higher noncontrolling interest costs. Moving to Slide 6. New equipment orders grew 5.6% at constant currency, excluding China, and were flat overall for Otis. New equipment orders grew double digits in the Americas; mid-single digits in Europe and the Middle East; and declined low teens in Asia, including China. This strong order growth was delivered in a global market that was down mid-single digits excluding China and down mid-teens globally as the China market declined an estimated 20% in Q1. New equipment share continued to grow and was up an estimated 25 basis points in the quarter. While the overall bookings were down in Asia, we continued to see progress in the infrastructure segment and received several key orders, including for the Chongqing and Nantong metro projects in China. As we discussed on Investor Day, this is one of our key target segments, and our infrastructure bookings grew high teens in a segment that was down low double digits. We also saw pricing stability in most parts of the world with 80 basis points of booked margin expansion. Booked margin expanded in EMEA and China and was offset slightly by the pressure in Asia outside of China. America's booked margin was flat. Backlog was up 3% at constant currency in the quarter, with growth in Americas and EMEA offset by a low single-digit decline in China. Organic sales were down 9.8% with double-digit declines in Asia, including China, primarily from the impact of COVID-19. Sales in Americas declined 9%, reflecting a tough compare and the impact of lower order intake in Q1 of 2019. Sales in Europe were up low single digits, but this was more than offset by weak results in Middle East due to market softness. Overall, new equipment sales in EMEA were down 3%. New equipment adjusted operating profit margin expanded 80 basis points, a strong material productivity and a small benefit from lower commodity prices was more than offset the impact of volume decline. Material productivity in the quarter exceeded our long-term target of 3%, reflecting the benefit of the actions that we are taking. Service segment results on Slide 7 remain strong in the first quarter. Modernization orders grew 2.5% with high-teens growth in Asia, outside of China and Europe, primarily offset by a high single-digit decline in the Americas. Our maintenance portfolio grew by 1%. Organic sales increased 3.3%, with modernization sales up 6.8% and maintenance and repair sales up 2.5%. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 20 basis points, and profit grew by $14 million at constant currency as strong productivity, favorability in price and mix and lower SG&A expense was partially offset by higher labor costs. Service contribution expanded for the seventh straight quarter with growth in all major regions. As we close out the first quarter, our operational agenda remains on track, and we are pleased with the progress on key initiatives: driving share gain in new equipment, making continuous progress on service contributions, material cost productivity and containing SG&A costs. However, as the economic activity slows globally from the spread of COVID-19, we are seeing the impact on our business activity in the second quarter, which is highlighted on Slide 8, with the new equipment orders and factory shipments both down in April outside of China after a relatively strong start in the first couple of months of the year. We are also seeing a reduction in service sales in April due to the challenges created by closure of buildings impacting our modernization and repair business. While China activity is recovering, it is clear that the business in China will not be immune to the global slowdown. And as we look at the balance of the year, we need to adjust our revenue and earnings growth expectation that we had communicated in February while taking incremental cost actions to offset the impact to earnings from sales shortfall. Let me start with sales on Slide 9. We now expect overall organic sales to be down 3% to 7% for the year with a 5% to 10% decline in new equipment and a low to mid-single-digit decline in service. The low end or a 10% decline in new equipment reflects continuation of the first half trend into second half, while the high end or a 5% decline reflects a recovery in the second half of 2020 to 2019 levels. We do expect continued stability in our contractual maintenance business. However, the range of service sales outlook reflects varying degrees of delay and push out discretionary repair and modernization projects to continue in the back half of the year, depending on the overall macroeconomic environment and the occupancy level of buildings. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be down between $25 million and $175 million at constant currency and between $85 million and $235 million at actual currency. At the midpoint, this reflects nearly $300 million of cost containment actions that Judy alluded to earlier. Most of these actions are already announced and at varying stages of implementation. At the midpoint of our sales outlook, we would expect operating margins to be relatively flat. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $840 million to $940 million driven by reduced operating profit, partially offset by lower tax rate and noncontrolling interest costs. We are reducing our tax rate guidance for 2020 to approximately 32% from 33% at Investor Day and are working on additional projects to continue to reduce the rate over time. Free cash flow will remain strong between 110% and 120% of net income as reduction in profit and higher restructuring costs will be partially offset by reduced capital expenditures. Taking a further look at our organic growth assumptions on Slide 10. In the new equipment segment, Americas is expected to be down mid-single digits to 10%, reflecting the sharp decline we are seeing in Q2 with job site closures. The high end or a 5% decline contemplates work resuming in Q3 and growth in the back half of the year. In EMEA, there's significant delays and limited access to job sites in South Europe, the U.K., parts of Russia and the Middle East. The EMEA new equipment business has continued - is expected to be down high single digits to 10%, with the high end of the range reflecting job sites reopening in pre-COVID levels in Q3 in North Europe and a gradual recovery in South Europe and the Middle East. In China, the new equipment business is recovering in Q2. And in rest of Asia, activity in Japan and South Korea has held up relatively well. But we continue to face challenges in India and Southeast Asia from government-imposed lockdown measures. We expect the Asia new equipment business to be down mid- to high single digits depending on the pace of recovery in India and Southeast Asia and the extent of impact of the Japanese and South Korean economies from the pandemic. In the service segment, our contractual maintenance business has been resilient, and we anticipate this business to continue to be stable. However, there have been delays on discretionary repair and modernization projects as these projects push into 2021. and we now expect modernization sales to be down mid- to high single digits and maintenance and repair to be down low single digits for the year. Overall, the high end of the 3% to 7% organic sales decline reflects an early Q3 recovery globally, and the low end assumes first half conditions to continue into the second half of the year. Switching to profit outlook on Slide 11. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be down between $25 million and $175 million year-over-year, reflecting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic; incremental underabsorption of costs; higher bad debt expense due to deteriorating credit outlook; and an impact to pricing, especially at the higher end of the sales decline. This will be partially offset by the cost actions we have taken and will take in the balance of the year. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of $60 million for the year versus the $20 million that we were expecting in February due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Moving to 2020 capital deployment on Slide 12. At spin, our net debt-to-EBITDA was about 2.4x with $1.4 billion in cash. During 2020, we expect to generate between $925 million to $1.025 billion of cash and plan to pay down $250 million of debt and return $260 million to shareholders through dividends between Q2 and Q4 at about 40% of adjusted net income. Approximately $200 million will be spent between noncontrolling interest and M&A. We believe these capital deployment plans are prudent during these uncertain times as they allow us to increase the cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year and are consistent with what we announced in February, reflecting our confidence in the cash flow generation capacity of this business. With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for some closing remarks. All right, Jeff. So pricing, actually, we had a good start to the year. I mean, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the new equipment - the booked margin actually expanded. We saw that, and it was pretty strong across the globe with small - slight pressure in Asia. But outside of that, it was fairly good. So really, really good start to the year. In America, where we saw some pricing last year, the pricing was stable this year. Europe, we saw good pricing. And the same thing - even in China, where the markets were down, we were - our booked margins actually went up a little bit. So good start to the year on the new equipment side. And same thing on service pricing as well. And the service pricing held up really well in Q1. And we gained a little bit of price in Q1, and we implemented our regularly scheduled price increases that we had planned. Having said that, I mean, the situation in Q2 is different, and we're working with our customers in the hardest-hit sectors in hospitality, in retail, et cetera, that Judy mentioned a little bit in her prepared comments. These sectors make up about less than 10% of our service installed base. And - but these are temporary concessions and therefore, a very specific period of time, and we do not expect any long-term impact from these. Also, most of our customers do understand that we do have fixed costs like our Otis call center, and we need to maintain and address service issues and - even when the buildings are only partially occupied. So that is why the concession requests have been very limited, and we've addressed each one of them individually. But as we gave guidance, we obviously factored in that these concession requests might increase. Again, as I said, we have not seen a lot of these. There have been a few and - which we've addressed them at one at a time. But in our guidance, we've assumed some impact and - especially at the higher end of the range. And same thing on new equipment. We've assumed that there is a little bit of pricing pressure in the back end of the year, especially on the new orders. Now most of that will not impact this year. But on the service pricing, the concessions that we're talking about will come through our results this year. So that's what we've kind of guided to. Same thing on the bad debt. The results were okay in Q1. There was not a lot of incremental P&L expense. We did take not a lot of incremental P&L expense in Q1, but we have factored some in our outlook at the back end of the year. Again, it's early days, Jeff, right? Overall, we feel that we're making progress. I mean our last year tax rate was 34%. We guided to 33% on Investor Day. Now we are at 32%. And the improvement that you're seeing between Investor Day and now is coming from reduction in the taxes that we have to pay on repatriation of cash. If you recall at Investor Day, we had mentioned that we had about 2 to 3 points of tax headwind because we needed to pay tax when we repatriate cash into the U.S. And that, we've been able to work on certain projects to reduce that, and we are taking incremental actions in early 2021 to maybe take some of our dollar-denominated debt and convert that into euro-denominated debt. So we're taking incremental actions. And beyond that, we are working on several initiatives to structure our business better and to reduce the tax that we pay on high-tax jurisdictions. We'll keep updating you as we learn more, but we are in early stages. But I'm confident that rate is going to come down over time. Yes. Let's start with Q1 cash, Julian. So we feel we had a good start to the year despite the COVID-19 situation. So in our Q1 cash, we pulled forward about $70 million of tax payments from Q2 through Q4, and that was primarily due to the spin. So that's in our Q1 results. Again, Judy had it in the prepared remarks. Also, we did extend support to our vendors, especially in China. And you see that our payables were down about $200 million from December to March. So - and part of this decline was to support getting our supply chain up and ready in China, and this cash flow impact should get mitigated between Q2 and Q3. But despite the impact that we saw in China, our working capital actually came down by about $30 million in the quarter, and then we had about $47 million of separation costs. So overall, we feel that we had a very strong performance operationally given the pull forward of tax payments, the impact that we saw in China given the support that we had to extend to our vendors and then the separation costs. So working capital coming down. So overall, we feel really good about how our business performed on cash given the overall environment. Now what you will see - and going back to your second question on how this kind of translates into the rest of the year. Now Q2 is going to be a little bit challenging in Europe and China - Europe and the U.S. China is going to recover, but we will see some pressure in Q2 in Europe and the U.S. And then - so our cash flow will be a little bit more skewed towards Q3 and Q4 than it typically is, but you would expect that given the overall macroeconomic environment. But we feel good about our guidance. I think we've done - we've taken good steps to offset and mitigate some of the impact that is coming through from the drop in net income from our previous guide to this guide. I mean if you look at the guide-to-guide on our net income, probably down at the midpoint at AFX, about $150 million. And we've mitigated that through lower Capex. We've reduced our interest cost. There are some tax payments that we try to manage, some of that coming through the CARES Act. But we try to put all that in and yet drive $975 million of cash as kind of the midpoint. So it's - we feel good about our back-end recovery in cash flow. Now on the conversion question, you're right, Julian. It is about 110% on our reported net income basis. But the guide that we provided to - includes some of the cash that will outflow on the separation costs, the PSA payments that you'll have to make to UTC. So we factored that in. And some of the restructuring that we've taken - the restructuring has actually gone up year-over-year as well. So that reflects some of the impact on that. So adjusting for some of the onetime expenses we will have, the number is between $110 million to $120 million. And we've excluded any noncash onetimers. Like the asset write-off that we had in Q1, we've excluded that from the calculation. So it is purely on the GAAP net income adjusting for any noncash charges that we will have. So that's the guide. That's the range, $110 million to $120 million. And as adjusted net income, which we'll speak to, that's at 110% at the midpoint. No. It's not part of the separation, Steve. It is - it got pulled forward into Q1 because of sort of spin related - consequences of spin. Let me put it that way. So that's what - we're working on some things. It's complicated. But the reality is no impact to full year. It got pulled forward into Q1 due to the spin. So that's it. For full year, it will have no impact to our cash taxes. Right. So that's right. No. It won't be a tailwind next year. Yes. So we don't want to comment on specific numbers, Steve, but you're right. And Q2 is probably going to be our toughest quarter, without a doubt. I mean you see what's happened in April, and we've seen some recovery in May, obviously, as things begin to open up. But April was a really tough month for us, and you saw that - some of the data that we put out there. So we do expect a fairly sharp decline in organic revenue year-over-year, and it's going to be more so on the new equipment side for - and then less on the service - and then the service is going to be mainly on modernization and repair. But the new equipment side is going to be impacted substantially in Q2. So that is what we are expecting. So you're right in terms of modeling. Obviously, we had a good start to the year. Q2 should kind of maybe kind of offset some of that, and then we see recovery in - on the new equipment side starting to happen in the back half of the year. New equipment margins could be down quarter-to-quarter. We're not going to give specific guidance, but yes, they could give what we're seeing. And it all depends on - the reason we're hesitating, Steve, a little bit is it all depends on how the recovery is in June. If we're coming out of the gate - if the job sites begin to open up and we are able to get quickly to work and we resume activity, it could be a little bit better. So that's where we're hesitating because it just is the near-term outlook is kind of not very clear at this point. So that's where we're kind of hedging ourselves a little bit. Yes. So obviously, as you would expect, that at the midpoint of $300 million of cost takeout actions that we have planned for, it's a combination of both. I mean it's a combination of structural actions. It's also a lot of the short-term actions that we're taking, which Judy mentioned, including furlough, merit deferral. So it's a combination of the two and if you see our restructuring numbers, we upped that to $70 million to $80 million. We spent about $50 million to $60 million last year. So it's incrementally higher. We are looking at our structural cost at a very, very hard way, looking at where duplication of work is happening, pulling that out. So we are taking a lot of hard restructuring actions, as you would expect us do. So that's a piece of the cost takeout. But a lot of these actions may have a more limited impact in 2020 and probably help us in 2021 more than they help us in 2020. In 2020, a lot of the benefit that you will see come through is going to be from the short-term actions that we are taking. So that includes merit deferrals. That includes furloughs and executive pay reductions, all the things that you would expect us to do. And we're going to watch this thing very carefully, and it depends on whether - how it translates into 2021, depends on how the revenue comes back. And our goal will be to ensure that we take enough structural cost out to mitigate the impact of any onetime headwind that we will get from these actions that we're taking. The trends are not getting worse, Cai. We did, as you would expect, that we've been working with our customers to make concessions where they're applicable, where the industries are hurting. Judy said we do believe in long-standing relationships with customers. So we have to react and share some of the pain that they are suffering. So that was where we came out, and we made certain concessions that are tied and limited to a certain price - certain time period. So that's where we worked. Now it's not getting worse. You will see some impact from that in Q2, and some of that may spill over into Q3 depending on when those concessions started. But it's for a very, very limited period of time, and it's going to be spread between Q2 and Q3. So the way I would think about this, Nigel - and the question - your question is always good, right? So it doesn't matter whether it's the last one or the first one. So in terms - so if you look at our disclosures that we have made, our contribution margin on new equipment averages between, depending on the quarter, about 17% to 18%, right? So that's our overall contribution on new equipment. And the service side, it's obviously higher. And so we - overall, if you look across the entire business, that averages out about 25%, 26% contribution margin. But then there is some underabsorption of cost when the revenue decline is as sharp as what we're seeing this year, especially on the service side because the fact is in service, we primarily use our own technicians to service the elevators and modernize those elevators. So that's where we see some incremental pressure because of underabsorption of cost. So that's what we've kind of modeled in that bucket. It's that contribution margin, plus there's an incremental impact from underabsorption of cost. Now we are working to offset that and you see some of that on the - in the green bucket. As we spoke about, we have taken actions wherever we could to reduce the underabsorption through - whether it's through restructuring actions or through furlough. So we are taking actions to reduce the underabsorption. So we kind of - one is on the left, the other one is in the middle of the page. So that's what that is. So overall, you should think about 25% of our contribution margin plus an additional impact from underabsorption. In Q1, Nigel? Is that the question? Q1, yes. Our profit with some of the JVs that we had in Spain and China was better. And we did better year-over-year in some of those businesses, and that drove a higher JV - payment to our JV partners. Again, we don't talk about China specifically. But between China and Spain, that makes up about 75% of our overall income, and that's what's driving our incremental expense on NCI in Q1. But our China business did very, very well despite the challenges on volume."

Presentation materials are available for download from Otis' website at www.otis.com. I'll now turn it over to Michael Rednor, Senior Director of Investor Relations.\nMichael Rednor: Thank you, Catherine. Welcome to Otis' Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Judy Marks, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rahul Ghai, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the Company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and significant nonrecurring items. The Company will also refer to adjusted results where adjustments were made as though Otis was a stand-alone company in the current period and prior year. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis' SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We hope everyone listening is safe and well. We delivered a strong close to an excellent year despite ongoing macro challenges. These results are a testament to the strength of our strategy and the dedication of our colleagues to execute and deliver results for our customers and shareholders. We achieved broad-based organic sales growth, grew adjusted operating profit for the third year in a row, delivered 19% adjusted EPS growth and generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow while introducing new innovative solutions for our customers and passengers. We remain committed to shareholder value creation and strategically deployed capital, completing $450 million in debt repayment, distributing over $390 million in dividends after raising the dividend 20% versus the prior year and repurchasing $725 million of Otis shares. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we also announced our tender offer for the remaining interest in Zardoya Otis an accretive transaction for Otis. New equipment orders were up 7.3% in the fourth quarter and up 13.2% for the year with broad-based growth. In Asia Pacific, we received an order for nearly 280 units supporting Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport's new Terminal 3 building and concourse. This includes 92 escalators, 60 moving walkways, and more than 120 Gen2 elevators equipped with ReGen drive technology that will support the terminal smart and green design. In November, we received an order for Sawyer's Landing in Miami, Florida. This project extends a decade-long relationship with the developer, and Otis will install over 20 elevator and escalator units. Additionally, Concord Pacific, one of the largest developers in Canada, has selected Otis to support its King Landing project in Toronto, Ontario, extending our nearly decade-long relationship. We'll provide more than a dozen elevators for this mixed-use high-rise. These orders demonstrate the power of long-lasting relationships and our continued investments in providing innovative solutions for our customers. Our strong orders momentum throughout the year led to approximately 115 basis points of new equipment share gain on top of 60 basis points in the prior year. In addition to executing on our financial priorities, we remain committed to advancing our ESG initiatives. Our Gen360 next-generation digitally native elevator platform was awarded two environmental product declarations. This platform is positioned to revolutionize our customer and passenger experience while providing energy efficiency benefits that help to reduce the impact on our planet. Gen360 joins our existing suite of energy-efficient products such as the ReGen drive, which can distribute power back into a building. Also in China, we received several awards that recognize our team's achievements in leadership, innovation and sustainability, including recognition as a 2022 top employer by the Top Employers Institute. And finally, last week, Otis was recognized for the second year in a row as the best place to work for LGBTQ equality by the Human Rights Campaign. This award demonstrates our leadership in creating an inclusive culture where all voices feel safe, welcomed and heard. Now moving to Slide 4. This year, we grew our industry-leading maintenance portfolio by 3%, our best portfolio growth rate in over a decade. This accelerated maintenance portfolio growth is a key part of our long-term strategy. Equally important is the digital connectivity of units in our service portfolio, and this year, we deployed approximately 100,000 Otis ONE units, bringing total portfolio connectivity to about one-third of our approximately 2.1 million units under our service. Over the medium-term, we plan to increase connectivity to approximately 60% of units, up from roughly 25% at the end of 2020. Our operational initiatives also progressed as we rationalized adjusted SG&A expense, down 40 basis points as a percentage of sales and reduced the adjusted effective tax rate by 190 basis points. This represents significant progress in rightsizing our costs and optimizing our tax structure as an independent company. I'm pleased with our performance in our second year as an independent company as we delivered strong financial results and advanced our ESG initiatives. You can expect to hear more in the coming months with the publishing of our first ESG report. Now turning to Slide 5 and starting with the 2022 industry outlook. While market dynamics remain fluid, the industry's long-term fundamentals are solid. We're encouraged by the strong recovery experienced during 2021 and have confidence this momentum will continue into 2022 in many regions. The new equipment market is expected to be up mid- to high-single digits in the Americas, low single digits in EMEA and down mid- to high single digits in Asia, driven by uncertainty in China, where we expect the market to be down 5% to 10%. While the China new equipment market faces headwinds, this will not detract from solid growth in the service installed base where approximately 1 million units are added each year to the global base, a mid-single-digit growth rate annually. Industry installed base in the Americas and EMEA are expected to grow low single digits, and in Asia, we're expecting high single-digit growth driven by China. Service is the foundation of our business, and we expect to grow our service units by more than 3% in 2022 and to eclipse 2.2 million units under maintenance, remaining the largest service portfolio in the industry. Here's our 2022 financial outlook. For the year, we expect organic sales growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. Net sales will be in a range of $14.4 billion to $14.7 billion, up 1% to 3%, accounting for FX headwinds. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be in the range of $2.24 billion to $2.3 billion, up $95 million to $165 million, excluding the expected impacts from foreign exchange. At actual currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $50 million to $120 million. Adjusted EPS is expected in the range of $3.20 to $3.30, up 6% to 10% versus the prior year and $0.24 at the midpoint. Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust at about $1.6 billion or approximately 115% to 120% conversion of GAAP net income. We remain highly disciplined in our capital allocation strategy, committed to meeting the needs of all stakeholders through dividends, debt paydown, bolt-on M&A and share repurchases once we complete our deleveraging plans associated with the acquisition of the remainder of Zardoya. With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our 2021 results and 2022 outlook in more detail.\nRahul Ghai: Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with fourth quarter results on Slide 6. Net sales were up 2.2% to $3.6 billion. Organic sales grew for the fifth consecutive quarter and were up 2.8% with growth in both segments. Adjusted operating profit was up $11 million and up $21 million at constant currency as higher volume, productivity in both segments and favorable service pricing was partially offset by commodity inflation and the absence of temporary cost actions taken in the prior year to alleviate the impact of COVID-19. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was up 9.1% or $0.06 driven by $0.02 of operating profit growth and $0.02 from a lower adjusted tax rate, benefit from share repurchases done earlier in the year and reduced interest expense from the repayment of debt contributed the balance. Adjusted EPS was $0.06 ahead of the prior outlook, including the favorability from better-than-expected operating profit growth and tax rate that ended at the low end of prior expectations. Moving to Slide 7. New equipment orders were up 7.3% at constant currency. Orders momentum remained strong in Asia, up mid-single digits, including the seventh consecutive quarter of growth in China. Orders were up high teens in the Americas, and awards which precede order booking were up mid-single digit in North America, signaling continued recovery in the booking trends heading into '22. EMEA was flat versus the prior year as mid-single-digit growth in Europe was offset by a decline in the Middle East, from a tough compare on major orders. Proposal volumes in the quarter also continued to show signs of robust demand globally, up double digits, driven by strength in China. Total company backlog increased 1% and 3% at constant currency with growth in all regions, including approximately 5% growth in Asia. Booked margin in the quarter was down slightly more than 0.5 point from a decline in the Americas partially due to customer mix, but the year-over-year trends in the region showed substantial improvement from Q3. This was partially offset by almost one point of improvement in booked margins in Asia with EMEA being about flat. Overall, our pricing on new orders was slightly better than our prior expectations. The backlog margin trend adjusted for mix was about flat sequentially and down about one point versus the prior year. Full year new recruitment orders were up 13.2% with growth in all regions with Americas up 14%, EMEA up 4% Asia up 17%, with high teens growth in China. In the fourth quarter, new equipment organic sales were up 1.2% from growth in Asia, up approximately 12%, including mid-teens growth in China. Growth in Asia was partially offset by a decline in the Americas and EMEA driven by tough compares from strong recovery from COVID-19 in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Adjusted operating profit was down $7 million. Commodity inflation of $35 million that was in line with our prior expectations was largely mitigated by installation productivity and favorable performance on projects. Service segment results on Slide 8. Maintenance portfolio was up 3% from broad-based improvements in retention, recaptured and conversion rates. Conversion rate in 2021 was up 3 points globally and up 5 points in China to 45%. This improvement in conversion contributed to high teens portfolio growth in China for the second consecutive quarter. In addition, our retention rate in 2021 continued to improve and is now above 94%. Modernization orders returned to growth in the quarter and were up 18.3% at constant currency with growth in EMEA and the Americas. Overall, modernization backlog was up 6% at constant currency. Service organic sales grew for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 4%, with growth in all lines of business. Maintenance and repair grew 4.3% with continued robust recovery in repair and low single-digit growth in the contractual maintenance sales. Modernization sales were up 2.2%, slightly below our expectations due to continued supply chain challenges. Service adjusted operating profit was up $20 million, with 50 basis points of margin expansion, the eighth consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Profit growth was driven by higher volume, favorable pricing and mix, partially offset by higher costs from the absence of COVID-19 cost containment actions taken in the prior year. Service portfolio pricing was up more than 1% mainly due to price increases in Americas and EMEA. Moving to Slide 9. Overall, for the full year, we carried the momentum from 2020 into 2021 and gained 115 basis points of new equipment share gain, accelerated the rate of maintenance portfolio growth. Organic sales were up almost 9%, with new equipment and service up 15.5% and 4.1%, respectively. This sales growth, our focus on execution, and FX tailwind resulted in $272 million of adjusted operating profit growth. New equipment operating profit was up $105 million versus the prior year at constant currency driven by higher volume and installation productivity. That was more than double what we achieved in 2020. This, combined with our ongoing focus on material productivity, more than offset the unfavorable price mix and headwinds from commodity price increases of approximately $90 million. Margins in the segment expanded 100 basis points, more than offsetting the decline in 2020 and are now above 2019 levels. Service adjusted operating profit was up $104 million versus the prior year at constant currency, driven by higher volume, productivity initiatives and favorable pricing that more than offset return of costs in the business to support higher activity. Service margins expanded 30 basis points, building on the expansion in 2020 and are now 140 basis points above 2019 levels. Corporate segment costs were about flat for the year despite the step-up in public company expenses from disciplined cost management. Adjusted EPS was up 19% for the year from operating profit increase and a reduction in the tax rate that was down 190 basis points for the year. Adjusted EPS was up about 35% from 2019 for a two-year CAGR of 16%, substantially ahead of our prior medium-term growth expectation. We generated close to $1.6 billion in free cash flow from earnings growth and a rigorous focus on working capital. Working capital is now down more than 50% from 2019 levels. As we look forward to 2022 on Slide 10, we expect service industry growth rates to be consistent with 2021 across all regions and new equipment end markets to show solid growth outside of China. This, combined with higher starting new equipment backlog, strength of the maintenance portfolio and our relentless focus on operational excellence, gives us the confidence to improve across all key metrics in 2022 with organic sales up 2.5% to 4.5% and overall margin expansion of approximately 30 basis points. We expect sales, operating profit and margins to improve in both segments at the midpoint. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $3.20 to $3.30, up 8% or $0.24 at the midpoint. We expect free cash flow of approximately $1.6 billion between 115% and 120% of GAAP net income. This free cash flow outlook reflects the strong earnings growth expectation, partially offset by an approximately $55 million headwind from a onetime tax-related payment that was previously expected in 2021 and $20 million in incremental capital expenditures to support digital connectivity initiatives. Our capital deployment plans remain on track, and we have already repaid $400 million of debt in January with the remaining deleveraging expected to be completed in the first half. Once our target leverage metrics are met, we plan to recommence share repurchases. Taking a closer look at our organic sales outlook on Slide 11. The new equipment business is projected to be up 0.5% to 3%, supported by the backlog that was up 3% at constant currency in 2021. Americas organic sales growth is expected to be up low single digits, EMEA up mid-single digits. Asia is expected to be up or down slightly with mid- to high single-digit growth in Asia Pacific. China is expected to be flat to down low single digits as growth from higher starting backlog is offset by decline in the book and ship business. Service segment growth is broad-based and is expected to be up in all regions with maintenance and repair up 4% to 6%, benefiting from a 3% higher starting portfolio, favorable service pricing environment and a continued recovery in repair. Modernization is expected to be up 4% to 6% on from 6% higher starting backlog and easing of 2021 supply chain challenges. Overall, organic sales are expected to be up 2.5% to 4.5% and building on the approximately 9% organic growth in 2021. Switching to EPS bridge on Slide 12. We expect EPS growth of 6% to 10% with operating profit growth of $95 million to $165 million at constant currency, contributing $0.16 to $0.27 to the EPS growth. Operating profit will benefit from increased volume in both segments, service pricing tailwinds and continued savings from material, installation and service productivity initiatives. This will be partially offset by commodity headwinds of approximately $90 million. Foreign exchange translation is expected to be a 7% EPS headwind and mainly from the strengthening of the euro and the yen against the U. S. dollar. Non-controlling interest expense from increased profit in China and other JVs will reduce EPS by $0.02 to $0.04. FX translation impact and increase in non-controlling interest expenses are mostly offset by accretion from the Zardoya transaction. We now have more visibility into the approval process and are increasingly optimistic in the timing of the delisting and expect the transaction to be about $0.10 accretive in 2022. Lastly, we expect to reduce our adjusted tax rate by an additional 50 to 100 basis points this year, adding $0.02 to $0.03 to the EPS. This outlook represents fourth consecutive year of strong earnings growth as we continue to build on strong execution, mitigate the macro challenges, leverage the investments that we have made and benefit from our continued end market recovery. And with that, I'll request Catherine to please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nRahul Ghai: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Good morning. Just a couple to start. Just first on the Americas. It looks like you're guiding Otis below your view of the market. Could you just explain what's going on there? I assume it's backlog conversion, but some color would be interesting.\nJudy Marks: Yes, Jeff, let me take that. So we're doing a low single-digit guide in the Americas, really strong performance this year in the Americas, up 14% in orders roughly and up 14% in sales. So we are capitalizing on the market as it's growing and the indices are all looking really positive, both multifamily, non-resi, whether it's Dodge or ABI, everything is looking good, really heading into '22. Our guide really reflects project timing on several major projects that don't drive revenue until very late in '22. It's going to help us in '23 for these large projects, but it really does drive the majority of the Americas guide.\nJeff Sprague: And Judy or Rahul, maybe you could just give us a little color on the complexion of the sequential patterns here this year. I would imagine China starts weaker and gets stronger, but would love to hear your view on that. And in terms of price coming through the backlog, counteracting the commodities headwinds, how does that play out? Anything you could share on how to think about the jumping off point and how we start here in Q1.\nRahul Ghai: Yes, absolutely. So Jeff, we expect to start the year strong on service growth. Compares are easier. I mean if you go back to Q1 of last year, Q1 was the lowest organic growth quarter in 2021. So compares are easier on service. And our Q1 growth should be more or less consistent with our full year guidance. Some headwinds from costs coming back since we were still dealing with the pandemic last year, but overall, it should be a really, really strong quarter on service. Given the tough organic growth compares on new equipment in the first half, with 25% growth last year in the first half of 2021, new equipment growth will be stronger in the second half. And also commodity headwinds will predominantly be a first half phenomenon. So, the first half of 2022, new equipment could look like Q4 of 2021 on a year-over-year basis. But sequentially, we do expect Q1 of '22 will be stronger than Q4 of '21 and on both profit and margin. And then, Q2 will show improvement over Q1. So, we expect continued sequential improvement in our new equipment business. The FX headwind will also be a first half issue. Keep in mind, euro was about 1.20 in the first half of '21 and is now trading at 1.11, 1.12 levels. Our guide for the year is 1.12. So, it's -- there's a headwind in the first half. And as we go into the second half on FX, the compares get much easier. So if we put all of this together, we faced some pressure on new equipment, organic growth, commodities, some FX headwinds. But the first half profit growth in Service segment should more or less offset that. And we expect to grow profit kind of in line with our revenue growth in the first half and EPS will improve year-over-year as well.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nRahul Ghai: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Miguel Borrega with BNP Paribas Exane. Your line is open.\nMiguel Borrega: Hi, good morning, everyone. I just have two questions, if I may. The first one, again, on your guidance for new equipment sales in 2022. You're saying in Asia, up or down slightly. But then if I look at your orders, you've had seven consecutive quarters of positive growth. And over 2021, growth has been above mid-teens, call it, mid-teens order growth in Asia. So can you tell us -- can you help us understand whether it's lead times or developers that are finding it more difficult to pay at delivery or the lead target that had gotten longer into 2022? Thank you.\nJudy Marks: Yes, Miguel, this is Judy. I don't -- it's not really a lead time issue. We entered the year with our backlog and our China -- it's really a China discussion here. Our China backlog is up entering '22, and that really supports about two-thirds of our backlog occurs in that next year. So, we're coming in with about two-thirds of the China backlog and the remaining third is book and ship. It's the book and ship where I think we're trying to be prudent, not really watching the trends, understanding whether it's SOE developers or private developers, what's happening. So, we feel that, that is what's going to really drive our '22 performance in China, which gets blended into our Asia number. Orders are really strong, but how that converts and especially the book and shift that is about third of our volume in any given year globally, but especially in China, is our watch item for next year.\nRahul Ghai: So let me just put a couple of numbers on this, Miguel, just to add to what Judy said. So if you start with our Asia backlog that we said is up 5%. And within that, Asia Pac backlog is up high single digit, and China, as Judy said, is up, call it, 3%. And just to reiterate what her point about 60% to 65% of our in-year business is driven by backlog. So for China, backlog is up 3%, and that's two-third of our revenue, that should drive about 2% growth in the China business. And if the in-year book and ship is flat, right, so that's the way to think about it, now our guidance for China is that China would be down -- it would be flat to down 3%. So despite the overall higher starting backlog, which implies the year book and ship to be down between 5% to 10%, right, on the remaining, that third to 40% of the revenue. And that's largely in line with what Judy commented on the prepared remarks on the China market. Now there's a chart in the appendix that has a 2021 orders in China versus the market and our orders out through the market by, call it 2x. And if you can replicate that performance in '22, that would be an upside to this outlook. But it's early in the year and the China market is very fluid. So, we are just being very appropriately prudent at this stage in our guidance.\nMiguel Borrega: That's great. Thank you. And then my second question is just coming back to your margin guidance and specifically for new equipment. And could you give us more color on the trajectory? Is this going to be perhaps a second half-weighted profit year for new installations?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. I think that's what I said kind of in response to Jeff's question. On new equipment, absolutely, I mean the commodity headwinds, we're calling for about $90 million. Most of that is going to be in the first half. We have some commodity headwind kind of dialed into the second half just given the volatility that was there last year. But if the commodity headwinds -- the commodity prices continue to go the way they're going, commodity could be a little bit less of a headwind. But right now, we've kind of dialed in $90 million. And again, that's -- given the fact that the growth is going to be a little slower in the first half versus the second half, commodity headwinds being a largely first half issue, we do expect our new equipment margins to be slightly challenged to the first half and then with the improvement in the second half of the year. And overall, as I said, to Jeff's question, we do expect that our profit growth will be in line with our revenue growth in the first half, right? So, we don't expect margins to shrink in the first half of the year because of the service growth.\nMiguel Borrega: Right. Thanks, Rahul. Correct. Yes. Got it. And then just one last question on your capital allocation strategy, you've suspended the share buyback because you're not focusing on deleveraging post the acquisition of Zardoya. If I'm correct, this would still imply below 2x net debt to EBITDA for next year for 2022. Can you remind us the normalized level that you're seeing the business operating from? Thanks.\nRahul Ghai: So, we'll be about -- we are not getting below two by the end of the year. I think we're getting to 2.1 by the end of the year. So -- but again, I think we are -- we feel very, very comfortable with our debt levels. We are -- of the $500 million of deleveraging, we've already done $400 million. We've got $100 million to go. And depending on when we can repatriate the cash back to the U.S. and we will start our share buyback. So that's what we've guided to is, the fact that we will recommence share buyback once our debt repayment is complete. So that's on track. And so, once we get a little bit more clarity on the repatriation of cash, we'll provide additional guidance on share buyback for the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe I just wanted to circle back, apologies to China new equipment revenues for a second. So I think you'd said, Rahul, those would be down flat to down low single digits in 2022 from a sort of a revenue standpoint. Just wanted to understand sort of, again, just how you're thinking about that sort of first half and second half, and how you'd expect your orders in China, new equipment to trend going through this year? Just trying to understand that sort of relationship between the orders booked in China and then when they're sort of being billed in the P&L?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. So Julian, good morning. And just to clarify what I said earlier, maybe we expect our China revenue -- new equipment revenue to be down to be flat to down 3%. So that's the revenue growth expectation on the new equipment side for China, so flat to down 3%. We're going with a higher starting backlog and the backlog is up about 3%. So that should support what my comment was that, that should -- if the book and ship business for the year is flat year-over-year, that will drive about a 2% growth, considering the backlog is about two-third of the revenue. Now if our guide is flat to down 3%, that would imply that the book and ship business is down kind of, call it, 5% to 10%, right, at the higher end or the lower end of the guidance, which is kind of in line with the overall market is what we are saying. Now again, just to repeat what I said earlier, we have done a lot better in China on orders in 2021. And we are almost at 2x the level of market growth. So, that -- we have not factored that in into this guide. So hopefully, if we can do a little bit better in orders than the market, that should drive some upside. In terms of the first half, second half, listen, the market is going to be a little bit softer in the first half. Again, part of that is just the compares, because the market was very, very strong in the first half. It was up about 16% through the first nine months of the year and ended about -- and was about flat for the fourth quarter. So the market is definitely stronger in the first half last year. So that should drive some tougher compares into '22. And I think our order trends are obviously going to mirror that a little bit.\nJudy Marks: Yes. Let me just add two things, Julian. If you context that the segment is about $650,000 for new equipment in China, even if that down 5% to 10% happens in the segment at the 10% level, we're back to 2020 levels for the China segment. So it's still healthy. We've gained share both for the last two years in China, and the team is performing incredibly well. We actually had record unit orders in 2021. So, we've got momentum with us, but we're trying to be prudent to watch some of the volatility that's happening.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much. And then maybe just step back from the quarterly moving parts. Two years ago, at the Investor Day, you talked about 20 to 30 basis points of sort of annual operating margin expansion medium term, definitely on track. With that, you're up 30 bps last year, you're guiding this year up 30 bps as well. And I suppose in the round, sort of should we think about 2021 and 2022 in aggregate being sort of fairly typical when we're looking at the sales trends? I understand you've got some price cost noise, but you've also had higher sales growth than you've guided medium term. So maybe they offset each other. Just trying to understand sort of any big levers, good or bad on the margins beyond this year when you think about the medium term or it's kind of steady as she goes and these years are fairly representative in total.\nJudy Marks: Yes. I think, Julian, it's an interesting compare when we think about kind of 2020 being a resiliency cost management time during the pandemic, '21 being a recovery year. And then '22, we believe growth will happen but it will be a lower rate than '21, which is really was at a much higher base. The big difference in '22, and we're not going to release our medium-term outlook until Investor Day on the 15th, the big difference in '22 is we are kind of back to our core service growth, 4% to 6% growth, which is supported by the portfolio growing 3%. And as you saw in our guide, that is -- obviously, with 80% of our profit, that's where we're going to have 50 basis points of margin expansion in the Service segment. So new equipment, a little more up and down over the different years, but service is what continues to sustain us and drive us and where we have productivity in both -- but that's really what you're going to see is a little bit of a preview to Investor Day.\nRahul Ghai: And keep in mind, Julian, we grew 50 -- 30 basis points of margin in '21 after absorbing 50 basis points of mix headwinds because new equipment grew much faster.\nJudy Marks: Faster than Service levels.\nRahul Ghai: Right. So that's where -- so adjusted for mix, margins were up kind of 80 basis points in the year. So definitely, we are tracking to that 30 basis points that we guided at Investor Day.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nStephen Tusa: Sorry, kind of on the road a little bit here. Just -- I guess a simple way to ask the question would be what do you guys think is going to be potentially kind of the toughest orders comp in 2022 for China. Should we be kind of ready for any given quarter just based on where the level is today and what the comps are for something that is down double digit at any given point for you guys specifically? And then as a follow-up to that, at what level of orders would you need to see this year, given your solid backlog, to have confidence that you can grow China or at least hold it flat in 2023?\nRahul Ghai: Yes, the quarterly order trend is just hard to predict, Steve. By just nature, the orders are lumpy, right? So, that's\u2026\nJudy Marks: We might need Steve to go mute.\nRahul Ghai: So the orders are lumpy. So it's hard to call out any given quarter. But clearly, as we said earlier, the orders grew really strongly throughout. And I think there's page in the back up that kind of -- that has the China orders. So if you go back and look at kind of our overall China goes up kind of 2x, and obviously with stronger growth, a much stronger growth in the first half. And Q4 was still up year-over-year not as strongly in the first half, but we still outgrew the market even in the fourth quarter. So the compares to the first half are definitely stronger. But as you project forward and you think about, okay, what do we need to drive sustainable growth, China is one factor, and that's clearly important. But keep in mind the rest of our business is growing is in very, very solid growth market. So, if you look at Americas, EMEA, Asia Pac and that is about two/third of our new equipment business. So that obviously is a very strong growth market. So that should help as we go beyond 2022. So, that's kind of one. And then obviously, the second part about this is that the point that Judy made earlier on the Americas backlog, that should help with '23 as well because some of the orders that we are not shipping in '22, those should ship in '23. So that should help '23 as well. So overall, we feel confident that we can continue to drive new equipment up kind of in that low single-digit growth range, which was kind of in line with the medium-term expectations. So that is -- we stand by that, and I think, obviously, more to come on Investor Day. And then obviously, to make the point further, with service growing kind of 4% to 6% this year and at a very sustainable level, that should continue to drive the profit growth into '23.\nJudy Marks: Yes. The other thing, Steve, we're seeing, and we'll show that you see this in our guide for service for '22, but it's going to keep growing as the modernization business. So we show that at 4% to 6% for '22, but we're going in with a 6% backlog there, great orders performance in the fourth quarter, especially in Europe and the Americas where the bulk of that is. So that's going to continue on into '23 as well.\nStephen Tusa: Got it. And then just one last one for you. In your guidance, how much of the year-over-year is driven by like some of the more Otis specific initiatives around productivity that you've been hitting on for the last couple of years since coming public?\nRahul Ghai: Yes, a lot of that, Steve. I mean if you look at kind of if you look at our profit guide, it's largely a volume story. But we have commodity headwinds of $90 million that we are largely offsetting through our productivity initiatives on the new equipment side. Overall, on the pricing side of new equipment, the margin drag that we have from backlog margins being down, is being offset by in-year pricing improvement. So that helps. But we offset the commodity headwinds by productivity actions on both material and installation. And on the Service side, we didn't -- we are not talking about wage inflation headwinds into our guide because the productivity that we are driving in the service side is offsetting that. And Service profit is driven by volume and pricing, right, which was up 1% last year and is obviously trending in our favor.\nJudy Marks: Yes. And on the service pricing, I'll just amplify a little, I mean, really good performance in Europe, which is where 1.1 million of our 2.1 million units are and the Americas. So, those two make up the bulk of the portfolio, we got a point in '21. We're expecting that much in '22 on price. And Steve, we'll know most of that in the first quarter because that's when most of our renewals happen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning. Maybe just a couple of quick clarifications for me. I just want to make sure I'm comparing things apples to apples here. But can you remind us what you're exactly forecasting on that industry new equipment growth slide there on Slide 5? Is that kind of a unit's number? Does that include price? Just would love to get a little more clarity on that.\nJudy Marks: Yes, that's a unit's number. That's the easiest way for us to make a global compare.\nJohn Walsh: Got you. Great. That's what I thought. Okay. And then maybe just on really strong share gains this year, 115 on top of the 60 you said there. We can see that chart in China where you're outgrowing the market. Can you give us a little bit more color on where some of the other market share gains are coming from broad-based or any geographies you'd call out?\nJudy Marks: Yes, there -- it's broad-based, John. Especially this year, we've seen Asia Pacific, especially in both the mature markets. But in India, which is really starting has come back strongly as a large segment. We've seen that come back very nicely in '21 in terms of share gain. And -- but it's broad-based. I would tell you that Europe, obviously, lots of different countries, but Western Europe, we did well. And again, I'd call out some of the ones in Asia-Pac, ex-China. China has done incredibly well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Your line is open.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes, thanks so much on good results. So, thank you for you've broke out, I guess, the China risk 10 customers, 2% to 3% of China sales. But what is the risk if they've crossed two to three red lines that basically they stop paying that, that morphs into a bad debt risk?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. No, it's a good question, Cai. And I mean if you look at our overall China business, we have done really well. I mean our cash flow in China was very strong. Open order was well above 2020 levels. We've been -- and a lot of that is working capital. I mean receivables are up, kind of, call it, less than 10% on 25% revenue growth in China. So, our China business did really, really well on cash management. But having said all that, obviously, the situation needs to be managed very carefully, and we're dealing with on a customer-by-customer basis. As the chart in the back says, only 2% of our customers in China that are in the orange or the red line category or other credit risk, and we've tightened the terms where the situation is warranted, but we don't feel we need to make any wholesale changes there. And if you look on a company overall for 2021, our bad debt expense in '21 was actually lower than our bad debt expense in 2020 despite 9% higher revenue. So we manage the situation well, and we'll definitely keep an eye out for '22.\nJudy Marks: Yes. The only other thing I'd add, Cai, is when we look at a broad-based group of developers inside China, we do a significant amount of business in our key accounts with the SOEs and the state-owned property developers who really have stronger financing advantages. They're gaining more share, and as Rahul said, we're managing this -- our China team is managing this on a daily basis with a lot of discipline and rigor. So, we're pleased with our bad debt, how we ended '21, as you said. But we're also understanding and watching closely where the market's going. And when needed, we're moving to all cash prepayments to protect our own balance sheet.\nCai von Rumohr: Thank you. And the second question, so you mentioned that you've installed 100,000 Otis ONE units last year. What is the plan for this year? And basically, as you install more units, I think you've made the point that because you have a bigger share of the overall service population of the world, your takeaway opportunity is greater than others. Talk to us a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of service takeaways, too?\nJudy Marks: Yes. So we did 100,000 in 2020. We added another 100,000 in 2021. It will be comparable in '22 as we get to that 60% coverage level in the medium term, and there's good reason for that. Some of it is our portfolio -- our service portfolio is not all Otis units, and we focused -- we started this by focusing on Otis controllers where we had the most knowledge and the best technical solution. We're now expanding that. But there's also some old controllers out there, as many of you know, and some very old elevators that don't make sense to connect. So we think we're on a good path because what it's doing, Cai, is it's driving that stickiness that we want with customers. So it's giving us more productivity, but it's giving our customers real value to be able to see the heartbeat of their elevator and their Otis ONE app, to understand if it's running or not, whether they're on site or not. And so, we think it's really helped our retention rates which now, as Rahul said in his remarks, are over 94%, which is leading in the industry. And it's also helping our conversion rates because -- last year, we entered -- in '21, we introduced our Gen3 portfolio across the globe and Gen360 in certain countries in Europe. And those all come pre-populated when we ship them with Otis ONE out of our factories now, depending on where you are in the world, certain factories. So it's already -- it's leaving the factory with Otis ONE installed. So, our customers are actually seeing the benefit of this during the warranty period, and that's, especially in China, helping us with on both the portfolio growth and the conversion that Rahul talked about, which is now at 45% for the year. So, we moved up 5 points in China on our conversion rate, and that's the stickiness we're getting everywhere in the world. Any time we're more connected with our customers, we get that stickiness, which will, again, have that compounding effort of growing our portfolio. So great productivity for us, which supports our margin drop-throughs and our incrementals, especially on volume and service this year that's driving the 50 basis points of margin expansion. But most importantly, it's getting that loyalty and stickiness.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Housden with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nNick Housden: Hi everyone. Thank you for taking my question. You mentioned that you grew at double the market rate in China in 2021, which is a really impressive result. I'm just wondering what the main drivers of this actually were and just how sustainable it is? I mean was it the case of just picking some low-hanging fruit? Or is this something that we can expect to continue for a few years? Thank you.\nJudy Marks: Nick, it's absolutely the execution of the strategy that we put in place just before and at spin for our growth in China. We expanded our agents and distributors to give us greater sales coverage and reach. We're now at 2,200. And for those of you who are kind of keeping count by quarter, that's because we're pruning the ones that aren't -- that weren't performing as well. But we think we're at a really good place. We've had growth in the quarter in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. Actually, we've seen it all year in China as well as weak growth in infrastructure and growth in the industrial segments in the fourth quarter, which was really strong. So, we grew sales coverage. That's one piece. The second is we continue to increase our focus on key accounts. And those key accounts want a national provider and they want to keep us for service. That's helping with our conversion rates and our retention rates. And a lot of those key accounts are state-owned enterprises. I know people don't typically think that way, but it's important as we watch what's happening in development in China right now, that we keep that balance between private and SOEs. So we've been able to do that. And then we've just really enhanced our relationships. We've continued to innovate. We brought Gen3 to market in China first in the middle of last year, and we were able to sell in the thousands there. And we expect Gen3 actually globally to be about 20% of our shipped units here in 2022. So, the combination of coverage, focus on key accounts, especially in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities because we were under share there and then bringing innovation and new product to market. And that's been the strategy our team is executing. And we expect continued share growth regardless of if there are headwinds or some fluid situations.\nNick Housden: That's very clear. And just kind of following on from that. So obviously, you're taking share in China, which is great. Are you taking it from the other global OEMs? Or is it more some of the local players who are losing out here?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. That's hard to say, I think exactly. I mean we'll have others report as well. What we really know well is how the market grew and how we grew against that. So that data is published. We have some external agencies that kind of track that. So, we know our performance well. I think as other companies reported, there will be a little bit more clarity on that, but it's hard to say exactly what's -- where the share gain is coming from.\nJudy Marks: Yes, same with service. It's just hard to say.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joel Spungin with Berenberg. Your line is open.\nJoel Spungin: I just want to pick up on something, I think, Rahul, you mentioned in your prepared remarks around pricing. I think you said that you thought in the quarter, it came out better than you had been expecting. I was just wondering, if you could maybe just elaborate a little bit on that, maybe what -- why that was? And if you have any sort of thoughts or remarks about sort of pricing in the wider industry that would also be helpful.\nRahul Ghai: Yes. My comment, Joel, was with regard to new equipment pricing. And it was marginally better than what we had expected. Asia, where the -- to the booking time frame is short, we saw a meaningful improvement on our booked margin trends, both versus last year, and we saw sequential improvement versus the last quarter as well. So that is where a lot of the improvement in the quarter came from. EMEA was largely flat over last year. Americas margins were down year-over-year. Part of that was mix in the orders. Well, we did not expect any improvement in Americas, so Q1 of next year, given the course to the order cycle. And -- but we did see sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4 and the year-over-year trends, and that's encouraging, and we expect additional improvements as we go into Q1 of '22. So, that is where -- that was the overall flavor on the books margin trends. And then service pricing, as you said, that was up a lot of point in the quarter largely driven by Americas and EMEA.\nJudy Marks: Yes. And Joel, the only place really we're seeing the intense competition is really in the infrastructure segment. And we get to see that more because most of those are public bids. But those are the volume infrastructure that people are looking at, both in Europe and in Asia. And that's really where we're seeing kind of the more competitive pricing. We're not -- we haven't seen any of the pricing in China to where it went after 2015 with precipitous drops haven't seen any of that yet. It's competitive, as you would expect but really mainly seeing it in the infrastructure segment.\nJoel Spungin: Okay. That's helpful. If I can just ask one more thing, which is just with regards to the comments that you made on the slide deck at the back about China pricing in -- sorry, the Chinese market in Q4 being a little bit better than perhaps you'd expected. I'm just trying to sort of marry that with your remarks about the outlook for China, which it sort of feels like, I think you were previously Q3 talking about a flattish market in China in '22. And I think you're now talking about down mid- to high-single digit. How do we reconcile those two things? Are you actually seeing in maybe some of your early indications for bids in China going into this year that there's already been some weakening in terms of the level of activity, I mean, even allowing obviously for harder comparative?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. So what we -- for China, China market was stronger than what we had anticipated all through '21. We started the year in '21 thinking the market's going to be up kind of mid-single digits. It was up 10% as now we're saying, even going into Q4, we thought the market would be down but it ended up being flat. So the market continued to surprise us on the upside. So -- and if you look at some of the underlying trends in the China market, the floor space under construction was up 5% in '21. It's about 8% above 2019. The real estate investment was up in the year as well in 2021. So that was up about 4%. And historically, these trends have a high degree of correlation. But where the weakness, it comes from, Joel, is if you look at the new starts, they were down about 11% in 2021. So that is where -- so the real estate investment is up. Floor space under construction is up but the bookings starts are lower. And that is where I think it's good to guide it, the fact like and that's what everything that we're reading in the market is the market could be down. So, I think we're guiding to 5% to 10% down. Obviously, that is still a fluid situation. We are seeing the support from government starting to kick in, both from the central government and from the local governments, central government in the form of mortgage losing, some flexibility around the three red line policy increase in money supply. So, all those things are happening, and even with the local governments that rely on land sales, for a big portion of the budgets, we're seeing some support from them as well. So, we're kind of seeing a mixed picture, but I think it's good to say it's down 5 to 10, calibrate our revenue accordingly. And then if it's better, that's a lot better situation to be and then be surprised on the downside.\nOperator: Thank you. And that's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Ms. Judy Marks for closing remarks.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Catherine. So to summarize, 2021 was an excellent year for Otis. We executed on our four strategic pillars, introduced innovative new products, made good progress on our ESG initiatives and demonstrated the strength of our capital management strategy. Our colleagues made all of this possible, delivering for our customers, passengers and communities globally. The fundamentals of Otis and our industry remains strong, and we're well positioned to deliver on our 2022 financial outlook, including high single-digit EPS growth and approximately $1.6 billion in free cash flow. We look forward to speaking with you at our Investor Day on February 15 to share more about our strategy and medium-term growth outlook. Thank you for joining us today. Stay safe and well.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Judy Marks",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We hope everyone listening is safe and well. We delivered a strong close to an excellent year despite ongoing macro challenges. These results are a testament to the strength of our strategy and the dedication of our colleagues to execute and deliver results for our customers and shareholders. We achieved broad-based organic sales growth, grew adjusted operating profit for the third year in a row, delivered 19% adjusted EPS growth and generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow while introducing new innovative solutions for our customers and passengers. We remain committed to shareholder value creation and strategically deployed capital, completing $450 million in debt repayment, distributing over $390 million in dividends after raising the dividend 20% versus the prior year and repurchasing $725 million of Otis shares. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we also announced our tender offer for the remaining interest in Zardoya Otis an accretive transaction for Otis. New equipment orders were up 7.3% in the fourth quarter and up 13.2% for the year with broad-based growth. In Asia Pacific, we received an order for nearly 280 units supporting Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport's new Terminal 3 building and concourse. This includes 92 escalators, 60 moving walkways, and more than 120 Gen2 elevators equipped with ReGen drive technology that will support the terminal smart and green design. In November, we received an order for Sawyer's Landing in Miami, Florida. This project extends a decade-long relationship with the developer, and Otis will install over 20 elevator and escalator units. Additionally, Concord Pacific, one of the largest developers in Canada, has selected Otis to support its King Landing project in Toronto, Ontario, extending our nearly decade-long relationship. We'll provide more than a dozen elevators for this mixed-use high-rise. These orders demonstrate the power of long-lasting relationships and our continued investments in providing innovative solutions for our customers. Our strong orders momentum throughout the year led to approximately 115 basis points of new equipment share gain on top of 60 basis points in the prior year. In addition to executing on our financial priorities, we remain committed to advancing our ESG initiatives. Our Gen360 next-generation digitally native elevator platform was awarded two environmental product declarations. This platform is positioned to revolutionize our customer and passenger experience while providing energy efficiency benefits that help to reduce the impact on our planet. Gen360 joins our existing suite of energy-efficient products such as the ReGen drive, which can distribute power back into a building. Also in China, we received several awards that recognize our team's achievements in leadership, innovation and sustainability, including recognition as a 2022 top employer by the Top Employers Institute. And finally, last week, Otis was recognized for the second year in a row as the best place to work for LGBTQ equality by the Human Rights Campaign. This award demonstrates our leadership in creating an inclusive culture where all voices feel safe, welcomed and heard. Now moving to Slide 4. This year, we grew our industry-leading maintenance portfolio by 3%, our best portfolio growth rate in over a decade. This accelerated maintenance portfolio growth is a key part of our long-term strategy. Equally important is the digital connectivity of units in our service portfolio, and this year, we deployed approximately 100,000 Otis ONE units, bringing total portfolio connectivity to about one-third of our approximately 2.1 million units under our service. Over the medium-term, we plan to increase connectivity to approximately 60% of units, up from roughly 25% at the end of 2020. Our operational initiatives also progressed as we rationalized adjusted SG&A expense, down 40 basis points as a percentage of sales and reduced the adjusted effective tax rate by 190 basis points. This represents significant progress in rightsizing our costs and optimizing our tax structure as an independent company. I'm pleased with our performance in our second year as an independent company as we delivered strong financial results and advanced our ESG initiatives. You can expect to hear more in the coming months with the publishing of our first ESG report. Now turning to Slide 5 and starting with the 2022 industry outlook. While market dynamics remain fluid, the industry's long-term fundamentals are solid. We're encouraged by the strong recovery experienced during 2021 and have confidence this momentum will continue into 2022 in many regions. The new equipment market is expected to be up mid- to high-single digits in the Americas, low single digits in EMEA and down mid- to high single digits in Asia, driven by uncertainty in China, where we expect the market to be down 5% to 10%. While the China new equipment market faces headwinds, this will not detract from solid growth in the service installed base where approximately 1 million units are added each year to the global base, a mid-single-digit growth rate annually. Industry installed base in the Americas and EMEA are expected to grow low single digits, and in Asia, we're expecting high single-digit growth driven by China. Service is the foundation of our business, and we expect to grow our service units by more than 3% in 2022 and to eclipse 2.2 million units under maintenance, remaining the largest service portfolio in the industry. Here's our 2022 financial outlook. For the year, we expect organic sales growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. Net sales will be in a range of $14.4 billion to $14.7 billion, up 1% to 3%, accounting for FX headwinds. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be in the range of $2.24 billion to $2.3 billion, up $95 million to $165 million, excluding the expected impacts from foreign exchange. At actual currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $50 million to $120 million. Adjusted EPS is expected in the range of $3.20 to $3.30, up 6% to 10% versus the prior year and $0.24 at the midpoint. Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust at about $1.6 billion or approximately 115% to 120% conversion of GAAP net income. We remain highly disciplined in our capital allocation strategy, committed to meeting the needs of all stakeholders through dividends, debt paydown, bolt-on M&A and share repurchases once we complete our deleveraging plans associated with the acquisition of the remainder of Zardoya. With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our 2021 results and 2022 outlook in more detail. Yes, Jeff, let me take that. So we're doing a low single-digit guide in the Americas, really strong performance this year in the Americas, up 14% in orders roughly and up 14% in sales. So we are capitalizing on the market as it's growing and the indices are all looking really positive, both multifamily, non-resi, whether it's Dodge or ABI, everything is looking good, really heading into '22. Our guide really reflects project timing on several major projects that don't drive revenue until very late in '22. It's going to help us in '23 for these large projects, but it really does drive the majority of the Americas guide. Yes, Miguel, this is Judy. I don't -- it's not really a lead time issue. We entered the year with our backlog and our China -- it's really a China discussion here. Our China backlog is up entering '22, and that really supports about two-thirds of our backlog occurs in that next year. So, we're coming in with about two-thirds of the China backlog and the remaining third is book and ship. It's the book and ship where I think we're trying to be prudent, not really watching the trends, understanding whether it's SOE developers or private developers, what's happening. So, we feel that, that is what's going to really drive our '22 performance in China, which gets blended into our Asia number. Orders are really strong, but how that converts and especially the book and shift that is about third of our volume in any given year globally, but especially in China, is our watch item for next year. Yes. Let me just add two things, Julian. If you context that the segment is about $650,000 for new equipment in China, even if that down 5% to 10% happens in the segment at the 10% level, we're back to 2020 levels for the China segment. So it's still healthy. We've gained share both for the last two years in China, and the team is performing incredibly well. We actually had record unit orders in 2021. So, we've got momentum with us, but we're trying to be prudent to watch some of the volatility that's happening. Yes. I think, Julian, it's an interesting compare when we think about kind of 2020 being a resiliency cost management time during the pandemic, '21 being a recovery year. And then '22, we believe growth will happen but it will be a lower rate than '21, which is really was at a much higher base. The big difference in '22, and we're not going to release our medium-term outlook until Investor Day on the 15th, the big difference in '22 is we are kind of back to our core service growth, 4% to 6% growth, which is supported by the portfolio growing 3%. And as you saw in our guide, that is -- obviously, with 80% of our profit, that's where we're going to have 50 basis points of margin expansion in the Service segment. So new equipment, a little more up and down over the different years, but service is what continues to sustain us and drive us and where we have productivity in both -- but that's really what you're going to see is a little bit of a preview to Investor Day. Faster than Service levels. We might need Steve to go mute. Yes. The other thing, Steve, we're seeing, and we'll show that you see this in our guide for service for '22, but it's going to keep growing as the modernization business. So we show that at 4% to 6% for '22, but we're going in with a 6% backlog there, great orders performance in the fourth quarter, especially in Europe and the Americas where the bulk of that is. So that's going to continue on into '23 as well. Yes. And on the service pricing, I'll just amplify a little, I mean, really good performance in Europe, which is where 1.1 million of our 2.1 million units are and the Americas. So, those two make up the bulk of the portfolio, we got a point in '21. We're expecting that much in '22 on price. And Steve, we'll know most of that in the first quarter because that's when most of our renewals happen. Yes, that's a unit's number. That's the easiest way for us to make a global compare. Yes, there -- it's broad-based, John. Especially this year, we've seen Asia Pacific, especially in both the mature markets. But in India, which is really starting has come back strongly as a large segment. We've seen that come back very nicely in '21 in terms of share gain. And -- but it's broad-based. I would tell you that Europe, obviously, lots of different countries, but Western Europe, we did well. And again, I'd call out some of the ones in Asia-Pac, ex-China. China has done incredibly well. Yes. The only other thing I'd add, Cai, is when we look at a broad-based group of developers inside China, we do a significant amount of business in our key accounts with the SOEs and the state-owned property developers who really have stronger financing advantages. They're gaining more share, and as Rahul said, we're managing this -- our China team is managing this on a daily basis with a lot of discipline and rigor. So, we're pleased with our bad debt, how we ended '21, as you said. But we're also understanding and watching closely where the market's going. And when needed, we're moving to all cash prepayments to protect our own balance sheet. Yes. So we did 100,000 in 2020. We added another 100,000 in 2021. It will be comparable in '22 as we get to that 60% coverage level in the medium term, and there's good reason for that. Some of it is our portfolio -- our service portfolio is not all Otis units, and we focused -- we started this by focusing on Otis controllers where we had the most knowledge and the best technical solution. We're now expanding that. But there's also some old controllers out there, as many of you know, and some very old elevators that don't make sense to connect. So we think we're on a good path because what it's doing, Cai, is it's driving that stickiness that we want with customers. So it's giving us more productivity, but it's giving our customers real value to be able to see the heartbeat of their elevator and their Otis ONE app, to understand if it's running or not, whether they're on site or not. And so, we think it's really helped our retention rates which now, as Rahul said in his remarks, are over 94%, which is leading in the industry. And it's also helping our conversion rates because -- last year, we entered -- in '21, we introduced our Gen3 portfolio across the globe and Gen360 in certain countries in Europe. And those all come pre-populated when we ship them with Otis ONE out of our factories now, depending on where you are in the world, certain factories. So it's already -- it's leaving the factory with Otis ONE installed. So, our customers are actually seeing the benefit of this during the warranty period, and that's, especially in China, helping us with on both the portfolio growth and the conversion that Rahul talked about, which is now at 45% for the year. So, we moved up 5 points in China on our conversion rate, and that's the stickiness we're getting everywhere in the world. Any time we're more connected with our customers, we get that stickiness, which will, again, have that compounding effort of growing our portfolio. So great productivity for us, which supports our margin drop-throughs and our incrementals, especially on volume and service this year that's driving the 50 basis points of margin expansion. But most importantly, it's getting that loyalty and stickiness. Nick, it's absolutely the execution of the strategy that we put in place just before and at spin for our growth in China. We expanded our agents and distributors to give us greater sales coverage and reach. We're now at 2,200. And for those of you who are kind of keeping count by quarter, that's because we're pruning the ones that aren't -- that weren't performing as well. But we think we're at a really good place. We've had growth in the quarter in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. Actually, we've seen it all year in China as well as weak growth in infrastructure and growth in the industrial segments in the fourth quarter, which was really strong. So, we grew sales coverage. That's one piece. The second is we continue to increase our focus on key accounts. And those key accounts want a national provider and they want to keep us for service. That's helping with our conversion rates and our retention rates. And a lot of those key accounts are state-owned enterprises. I know people don't typically think that way, but it's important as we watch what's happening in development in China right now, that we keep that balance between private and SOEs. So we've been able to do that. And then we've just really enhanced our relationships. We've continued to innovate. We brought Gen3 to market in China first in the middle of last year, and we were able to sell in the thousands there. And we expect Gen3 actually globally to be about 20% of our shipped units here in 2022. So, the combination of coverage, focus on key accounts, especially in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities because we were under share there and then bringing innovation and new product to market. And that's been the strategy our team is executing. And we expect continued share growth regardless of if there are headwinds or some fluid situations. Yes, same with service. It's just hard to say. Yes. And Joel, the only place really we're seeing the intense competition is really in the infrastructure segment. And we get to see that more because most of those are public bids. But those are the volume infrastructure that people are looking at, both in Europe and in Asia. And that's really where we're seeing kind of the more competitive pricing. We're not -- we haven't seen any of the pricing in China to where it went after 2015 with precipitous drops haven't seen any of that yet. It's competitive, as you would expect but really mainly seeing it in the infrastructure segment. Thank you, Catherine. So to summarize, 2021 was an excellent year for Otis. We executed on our four strategic pillars, introduced innovative new products, made good progress on our ESG initiatives and demonstrated the strength of our capital management strategy. Our colleagues made all of this possible, delivering for our customers, passengers and communities globally. The fundamentals of Otis and our industry remains strong, and we're well positioned to deliver on our 2022 financial outlook, including high single-digit EPS growth and approximately $1.6 billion in free cash flow. We look forward to speaking with you at our Investor Day on February 15 to share more about our strategy and medium-term growth outlook. Thank you for joining us today. Stay safe and well."

            "name": "Rahul Ghai",
            "content": "Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with fourth quarter results on Slide 6. Net sales were up 2.2% to $3.6 billion. Organic sales grew for the fifth consecutive quarter and were up 2.8% with growth in both segments. Adjusted operating profit was up $11 million and up $21 million at constant currency as higher volume, productivity in both segments and favorable service pricing was partially offset by commodity inflation and the absence of temporary cost actions taken in the prior year to alleviate the impact of COVID-19. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was up 9.1% or $0.06 driven by $0.02 of operating profit growth and $0.02 from a lower adjusted tax rate, benefit from share repurchases done earlier in the year and reduced interest expense from the repayment of debt contributed the balance. Adjusted EPS was $0.06 ahead of the prior outlook, including the favorability from better-than-expected operating profit growth and tax rate that ended at the low end of prior expectations. Moving to Slide 7. New equipment orders were up 7.3% at constant currency. Orders momentum remained strong in Asia, up mid-single digits, including the seventh consecutive quarter of growth in China. Orders were up high teens in the Americas, and awards which precede order booking were up mid-single digit in North America, signaling continued recovery in the booking trends heading into '22. EMEA was flat versus the prior year as mid-single-digit growth in Europe was offset by a decline in the Middle East, from a tough compare on major orders. Proposal volumes in the quarter also continued to show signs of robust demand globally, up double digits, driven by strength in China. Total company backlog increased 1% and 3% at constant currency with growth in all regions, including approximately 5% growth in Asia. Booked margin in the quarter was down slightly more than 0.5 point from a decline in the Americas partially due to customer mix, but the year-over-year trends in the region showed substantial improvement from Q3. This was partially offset by almost one point of improvement in booked margins in Asia with EMEA being about flat. Overall, our pricing on new orders was slightly better than our prior expectations. The backlog margin trend adjusted for mix was about flat sequentially and down about one point versus the prior year. Full year new recruitment orders were up 13.2% with growth in all regions with Americas up 14%, EMEA up 4% Asia up 17%, with high teens growth in China. In the fourth quarter, new equipment organic sales were up 1.2% from growth in Asia, up approximately 12%, including mid-teens growth in China. Growth in Asia was partially offset by a decline in the Americas and EMEA driven by tough compares from strong recovery from COVID-19 in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Adjusted operating profit was down $7 million. Commodity inflation of $35 million that was in line with our prior expectations was largely mitigated by installation productivity and favorable performance on projects. Service segment results on Slide 8. Maintenance portfolio was up 3% from broad-based improvements in retention, recaptured and conversion rates. Conversion rate in 2021 was up 3 points globally and up 5 points in China to 45%. This improvement in conversion contributed to high teens portfolio growth in China for the second consecutive quarter. In addition, our retention rate in 2021 continued to improve and is now above 94%. Modernization orders returned to growth in the quarter and were up 18.3% at constant currency with growth in EMEA and the Americas. Overall, modernization backlog was up 6% at constant currency. Service organic sales grew for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 4%, with growth in all lines of business. Maintenance and repair grew 4.3% with continued robust recovery in repair and low single-digit growth in the contractual maintenance sales. Modernization sales were up 2.2%, slightly below our expectations due to continued supply chain challenges. Service adjusted operating profit was up $20 million, with 50 basis points of margin expansion, the eighth consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Profit growth was driven by higher volume, favorable pricing and mix, partially offset by higher costs from the absence of COVID-19 cost containment actions taken in the prior year. Service portfolio pricing was up more than 1% mainly due to price increases in Americas and EMEA. Moving to Slide 9. Overall, for the full year, we carried the momentum from 2020 into 2021 and gained 115 basis points of new equipment share gain, accelerated the rate of maintenance portfolio growth. Organic sales were up almost 9%, with new equipment and service up 15.5% and 4.1%, respectively. This sales growth, our focus on execution, and FX tailwind resulted in $272 million of adjusted operating profit growth. New equipment operating profit was up $105 million versus the prior year at constant currency driven by higher volume and installation productivity. That was more than double what we achieved in 2020. This, combined with our ongoing focus on material productivity, more than offset the unfavorable price mix and headwinds from commodity price increases of approximately $90 million. Margins in the segment expanded 100 basis points, more than offsetting the decline in 2020 and are now above 2019 levels. Service adjusted operating profit was up $104 million versus the prior year at constant currency, driven by higher volume, productivity initiatives and favorable pricing that more than offset return of costs in the business to support higher activity. Service margins expanded 30 basis points, building on the expansion in 2020 and are now 140 basis points above 2019 levels. Corporate segment costs were about flat for the year despite the step-up in public company expenses from disciplined cost management. Adjusted EPS was up 19% for the year from operating profit increase and a reduction in the tax rate that was down 190 basis points for the year. Adjusted EPS was up about 35% from 2019 for a two-year CAGR of 16%, substantially ahead of our prior medium-term growth expectation. We generated close to $1.6 billion in free cash flow from earnings growth and a rigorous focus on working capital. Working capital is now down more than 50% from 2019 levels. As we look forward to 2022 on Slide 10, we expect service industry growth rates to be consistent with 2021 across all regions and new equipment end markets to show solid growth outside of China. This, combined with higher starting new equipment backlog, strength of the maintenance portfolio and our relentless focus on operational excellence, gives us the confidence to improve across all key metrics in 2022 with organic sales up 2.5% to 4.5% and overall margin expansion of approximately 30 basis points. We expect sales, operating profit and margins to improve in both segments at the midpoint. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $3.20 to $3.30, up 8% or $0.24 at the midpoint. We expect free cash flow of approximately $1.6 billion between 115% and 120% of GAAP net income. This free cash flow outlook reflects the strong earnings growth expectation, partially offset by an approximately $55 million headwind from a onetime tax-related payment that was previously expected in 2021 and $20 million in incremental capital expenditures to support digital connectivity initiatives. Our capital deployment plans remain on track, and we have already repaid $400 million of debt in January with the remaining deleveraging expected to be completed in the first half. Once our target leverage metrics are met, we plan to recommence share repurchases. Taking a closer look at our organic sales outlook on Slide 11. The new equipment business is projected to be up 0.5% to 3%, supported by the backlog that was up 3% at constant currency in 2021. Americas organic sales growth is expected to be up low single digits, EMEA up mid-single digits. Asia is expected to be up or down slightly with mid- to high single-digit growth in Asia Pacific. China is expected to be flat to down low single digits as growth from higher starting backlog is offset by decline in the book and ship business. Service segment growth is broad-based and is expected to be up in all regions with maintenance and repair up 4% to 6%, benefiting from a 3% higher starting portfolio, favorable service pricing environment and a continued recovery in repair. Modernization is expected to be up 4% to 6% on from 6% higher starting backlog and easing of 2021 supply chain challenges. Overall, organic sales are expected to be up 2.5% to 4.5% and building on the approximately 9% organic growth in 2021. Switching to EPS bridge on Slide 12. We expect EPS growth of 6% to 10% with operating profit growth of $95 million to $165 million at constant currency, contributing $0.16 to $0.27 to the EPS growth. Operating profit will benefit from increased volume in both segments, service pricing tailwinds and continued savings from material, installation and service productivity initiatives. This will be partially offset by commodity headwinds of approximately $90 million. Foreign exchange translation is expected to be a 7% EPS headwind and mainly from the strengthening of the euro and the yen against the U. S. dollar. Non-controlling interest expense from increased profit in China and other JVs will reduce EPS by $0.02 to $0.04. FX translation impact and increase in non-controlling interest expenses are mostly offset by accretion from the Zardoya transaction. We now have more visibility into the approval process and are increasingly optimistic in the timing of the delisting and expect the transaction to be about $0.10 accretive in 2022. Lastly, we expect to reduce our adjusted tax rate by an additional 50 to 100 basis points this year, adding $0.02 to $0.03 to the EPS. This outlook represents fourth consecutive year of strong earnings growth as we continue to build on strong execution, mitigate the macro challenges, leverage the investments that we have made and benefit from our continued end market recovery. And with that, I'll request Catherine to please open the line for questions. Good morning, Jeff. Yes, absolutely. So Jeff, we expect to start the year strong on service growth. Compares are easier. I mean if you go back to Q1 of last year, Q1 was the lowest organic growth quarter in 2021. So compares are easier on service. And our Q1 growth should be more or less consistent with our full year guidance. Some headwinds from costs coming back since we were still dealing with the pandemic last year, but overall, it should be a really, really strong quarter on service. Given the tough organic growth compares on new equipment in the first half, with 25% growth last year in the first half of 2021, new equipment growth will be stronger in the second half. And also commodity headwinds will predominantly be a first half phenomenon. So, the first half of 2022, new equipment could look like Q4 of 2021 on a year-over-year basis. But sequentially, we do expect Q1 of '22 will be stronger than Q4 of '21 and on both profit and margin. And then, Q2 will show improvement over Q1. So, we expect continued sequential improvement in our new equipment business. The FX headwind will also be a first half issue. Keep in mind, euro was about 1.20 in the first half of '21 and is now trading at 1.11, 1.12 levels. Our guide for the year is 1.12. So, it's -- there's a headwind in the first half. And as we go into the second half on FX, the compares get much easier. So if we put all of this together, we faced some pressure on new equipment, organic growth, commodities, some FX headwinds. But the first half profit growth in Service segment should more or less offset that. And we expect to grow profit kind of in line with our revenue growth in the first half and EPS will improve year-over-year as well. Thank you, Jeff. So let me just put a couple of numbers on this, Miguel, just to add to what Judy said. So if you start with our Asia backlog that we said is up 5%. And within that, Asia Pac backlog is up high single digit, and China, as Judy said, is up, call it, 3%. And just to reiterate what her point about 60% to 65% of our in-year business is driven by backlog. So for China, backlog is up 3%, and that's two-third of our revenue, that should drive about 2% growth in the China business. And if the in-year book and ship is flat, right, so that's the way to think about it, now our guidance for China is that China would be down -- it would be flat to down 3%. So despite the overall higher starting backlog, which implies the year book and ship to be down between 5% to 10%, right, on the remaining, that third to 40% of the revenue. And that's largely in line with what Judy commented on the prepared remarks on the China market. Now there's a chart in the appendix that has a 2021 orders in China versus the market and our orders out through the market by, call it 2x. And if you can replicate that performance in '22, that would be an upside to this outlook. But it's early in the year and the China market is very fluid. So, we are just being very appropriately prudent at this stage in our guidance. Yes. I think that's what I said kind of in response to Jeff's question. On new equipment, absolutely, I mean the commodity headwinds, we're calling for about $90 million. Most of that is going to be in the first half. We have some commodity headwind kind of dialed into the second half just given the volatility that was there last year. But if the commodity headwinds -- the commodity prices continue to go the way they're going, commodity could be a little bit less of a headwind. But right now, we've kind of dialed in $90 million. And again, that's -- given the fact that the growth is going to be a little slower in the first half versus the second half, commodity headwinds being a largely first half issue, we do expect our new equipment margins to be slightly challenged to the first half and then with the improvement in the second half of the year. And overall, as I said, to Jeff's question, we do expect that our profit growth will be in line with our revenue growth in the first half, right? So, we don't expect margins to shrink in the first half of the year because of the service growth. So, we'll be about -- we are not getting below two by the end of the year. I think we're getting to 2.1 by the end of the year. So -- but again, I think we are -- we feel very, very comfortable with our debt levels. We are -- of the $500 million of deleveraging, we've already done $400 million. We've got $100 million to go. And depending on when we can repatriate the cash back to the U.S. and we will start our share buyback. So that's what we've guided to is, the fact that we will recommence share buyback once our debt repayment is complete. So that's on track. And so, once we get a little bit more clarity on the repatriation of cash, we'll provide additional guidance on share buyback for the year. Yes. So Julian, good morning. And just to clarify what I said earlier, maybe we expect our China revenue -- new equipment revenue to be down to be flat to down 3%. So that's the revenue growth expectation on the new equipment side for China, so flat to down 3%. We're going with a higher starting backlog and the backlog is up about 3%. So that should support what my comment was that, that should -- if the book and ship business for the year is flat year-over-year, that will drive about a 2% growth, considering the backlog is about two-third of the revenue. Now if our guide is flat to down 3%, that would imply that the book and ship business is down kind of, call it, 5% to 10%, right, at the higher end or the lower end of the guidance, which is kind of in line with the overall market is what we are saying. Now again, just to repeat what I said earlier, we have done a lot better in China on orders in 2021. And we are almost at 2x the level of market growth. So, that -- we have not factored that in into this guide. So hopefully, if we can do a little bit better in orders than the market, that should drive some upside. In terms of the first half, second half, listen, the market is going to be a little bit softer in the first half. Again, part of that is just the compares, because the market was very, very strong in the first half. It was up about 16% through the first nine months of the year and ended about -- and was about flat for the fourth quarter. So the market is definitely stronger in the first half last year. So that should drive some tougher compares into '22. And I think our order trends are obviously going to mirror that a little bit. And keep in mind, Julian, we grew 50 -- 30 basis points of margin in '21 after absorbing 50 basis points of mix headwinds because new equipment grew much faster. Right. So that's where -- so adjusted for mix, margins were up kind of 80 basis points in the year. So definitely, we are tracking to that 30 basis points that we guided at Investor Day. Yes, the quarterly order trend is just hard to predict, Steve. By just nature, the orders are lumpy, right? So, that's... So the orders are lumpy. So it's hard to call out any given quarter. But clearly, as we said earlier, the orders grew really strongly throughout. And I think there's page in the back up that kind of -- that has the China orders. So if you go back and look at kind of our overall China goes up kind of 2x, and obviously with stronger growth, a much stronger growth in the first half. And Q4 was still up year-over-year not as strongly in the first half, but we still outgrew the market even in the fourth quarter. So the compares to the first half are definitely stronger. But as you project forward and you think about, okay, what do we need to drive sustainable growth, China is one factor, and that's clearly important. But keep in mind the rest of our business is growing is in very, very solid growth market. So, if you look at Americas, EMEA, Asia Pac and that is about two/third of our new equipment business. So that obviously is a very strong growth market. So that should help as we go beyond 2022. So, that's kind of one. And then obviously, the second part about this is that the point that Judy made earlier on the Americas backlog, that should help with '23 as well because some of the orders that we are not shipping in '22, those should ship in '23. So that should help '23 as well. So overall, we feel confident that we can continue to drive new equipment up kind of in that low single-digit growth range, which was kind of in line with the medium-term expectations. So that is -- we stand by that, and I think, obviously, more to come on Investor Day. And then obviously, to make the point further, with service growing kind of 4% to 6% this year and at a very sustainable level, that should continue to drive the profit growth into '23. Yes, a lot of that, Steve. I mean if you look at kind of if you look at our profit guide, it's largely a volume story. But we have commodity headwinds of $90 million that we are largely offsetting through our productivity initiatives on the new equipment side. Overall, on the pricing side of new equipment, the margin drag that we have from backlog margins being down, is being offset by in-year pricing improvement. So that helps. But we offset the commodity headwinds by productivity actions on both material and installation. And on the Service side, we didn't -- we are not talking about wage inflation headwinds into our guide because the productivity that we are driving in the service side is offsetting that. And Service profit is driven by volume and pricing, right, which was up 1% last year and is obviously trending in our favor. Yes. No, it's a good question, Cai. And I mean if you look at our overall China business, we have done really well. I mean our cash flow in China was very strong. Open order was well above 2020 levels. We've been -- and a lot of that is working capital. I mean receivables are up, kind of, call it, less than 10% on 25% revenue growth in China. So, our China business did really, really well on cash management. But having said all that, obviously, the situation needs to be managed very carefully, and we're dealing with on a customer-by-customer basis. As the chart in the back says, only 2% of our customers in China that are in the orange or the red line category or other credit risk, and we've tightened the terms where the situation is warranted, but we don't feel we need to make any wholesale changes there. And if you look on a company overall for 2021, our bad debt expense in '21 was actually lower than our bad debt expense in 2020 despite 9% higher revenue. So we manage the situation well, and we'll definitely keep an eye out for '22. Yes. That's hard to say, I think exactly. I mean we'll have others report as well. What we really know well is how the market grew and how we grew against that. So that data is published. We have some external agencies that kind of track that. So, we know our performance well. I think as other companies reported, there will be a little bit more clarity on that, but it's hard to say exactly what's -- where the share gain is coming from. Yes. My comment, Joel, was with regard to new equipment pricing. And it was marginally better than what we had expected. Asia, where the -- to the booking time frame is short, we saw a meaningful improvement on our booked margin trends, both versus last year, and we saw sequential improvement versus the last quarter as well. So that is where a lot of the improvement in the quarter came from. EMEA was largely flat over last year. Americas margins were down year-over-year. Part of that was mix in the orders. Well, we did not expect any improvement in Americas, so Q1 of next year, given the course to the order cycle. And -- but we did see sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4 and the year-over-year trends, and that's encouraging, and we expect additional improvements as we go into Q1 of '22. So, that is where -- that was the overall flavor on the books margin trends. And then service pricing, as you said, that was up a lot of point in the quarter largely driven by Americas and EMEA. Yes. So what we -- for China, China market was stronger than what we had anticipated all through '21. We started the year in '21 thinking the market's going to be up kind of mid-single digits. It was up 10% as now we're saying, even going into Q4, we thought the market would be down but it ended up being flat. So the market continued to surprise us on the upside. So -- and if you look at some of the underlying trends in the China market, the floor space under construction was up 5% in '21. It's about 8% above 2019. The real estate investment was up in the year as well in 2021. So that was up about 4%. And historically, these trends have a high degree of correlation. But where the weakness, it comes from, Joel, is if you look at the new starts, they were down about 11% in 2021. So that is where -- so the real estate investment is up. Floor space under construction is up but the bookings starts are lower. And that is where I think it's good to guide it, the fact like and that's what everything that we're reading in the market is the market could be down. So, I think we're guiding to 5% to 10% down. Obviously, that is still a fluid situation. We are seeing the support from government starting to kick in, both from the central government and from the local governments, central government in the form of mortgage losing, some flexibility around the three red line policy increase in money supply. So, all those things are happening, and even with the local governments that rely on land sales, for a big portion of the budgets, we're seeing some support from them as well. So, we're kind of seeing a mixed picture, but I think it's good to say it's down 5 to 10, calibrate our revenue accordingly. And then if it's better, that's a lot better situation to be and then be surprised on the downside."

Presentation materials are available for download at Otis website at www.otis.com. I will now turn over to Michael Rednor, Senior Director and Investor Relations.\nMichael Rednor: Thank you, Michelle. Welcome to Otis' third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Judy Marks, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Raul Guy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the Company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and significant non-recurring items. The Company will also refer to adjusted results, where adjustments were made as though Otis was a standalone Company in the current period and prior year. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy.\nJudith Marks: Thank you, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We hope that everyone listening is safe and well. Otis continued to make significant progress driving our long-term strategic priorities as reflected in the strong financial performance year-to-date. In the third quarter, we grew organic sales and expanded margins in both segments. We gained approximately 1.5 points of new equipment share this quarter and year-to-date on top of 60 basis points in the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, new equipment orders were up mid-teens with growth in all regions reflecting our continued focus on providing value for our customers and the recovery in our end markets throughout the year. In the quarter, new equipment orders were particularly strong in Asia up mid-teens, where we secured an order for the Hong Kong International Airport, extending an over 20-year relationship with this customer. We will install over 100 escalators and moving walkways to keep passengers moving across the concourse. This is further progress of our sub-strategy to win in infrastructure. In China, we're seeing traction on our new Gen3 connected elevators reaffirming our investment in the innovation that Otis ONE provides to our customers and passengers. Just a few months after officially launching our Gen3 elevator, we secured our first repeat customer in China for the new platform. Jilin Longcheng property developer Company ordered an additional 123 Gen3 elevator systems for four more commercial and residential projects in Northeast China. We're also making progress on deploying our Gen360 connected elevator platform in EMEA. In the first few months after launch, we received several Gen360 awards, adding more than 50% to the pilot phase volumes. Moving to Service. In the quarter, we grew our industry-leading maintenance portfolio by 3%, a goal we set for ourselves entering the year and grew organic service sales for the third consecutive quarter. In the Americas, Otis was selected to continue a 35-year partnership with One Commerce Square in downtown Philadelphia. Otis installed the building\u2019s original elevators in the 1980s and has been maintaining the units since then. Otis will now modernize the building's elevators, including the introduction of our Compass 360 destination dispatching system. On portfolio modernization awards are a testament to Otis service excellence and long-standing customer relationships. This strong year-to-date Company performance and robust cash flow generation in excess of 140% of net income enabled us to complete $725 million in share repurchases. In September, we announced the tender offer for the remaining interest in Zardoya Otis, a premier elevator business in Spain, Portugal, and Morocco with a strong service presence. The transaction will simplify our corporate structure and operations while optimizing alignment of assets and debt financing in Europe. We expect this transaction to be mid-single-digit percentage accretive in 2023. In parallel with the strong financial performance, we made additional progress on our ESG initiatives, focusing on sustainability has always been an integral part of our operations culture. And achieving ISO 14001 certification for all of our factories is an important part of our existing efforts. We're pleased that this quarter we achieved this goal years ahead of schedule, adding our factories in Korea, and Florence, South Carolina. We're proud to see several programs recognize that these two factories, including power consumption reduction programs, robust package recycling processes, and lubricant leakage prevention measures. In addition, in Florence, we launched a pilot for 0 waste-to-landfill program that will scale to other manufacturing sites next year as we work towards our goal of having all factories eligible for 0 waste-to-landfill certification by 2025. We also made progress on our social initiatives, launching the second year of our made-to-move communities signature CSR program. Participating colleagues will guide 200 student participants from 20 schools across 12 countries and territories to develop creative mobility solutions, while also helping to close the stem skills gap. This year, we aim to make a difference by helping communities adapt and leverage better design and newer technologies to address the mobility, health, and safety concerns of older populations. We look forward to sharing these solutions and highlight the program with you during our Lift Our Communities month in April of next year. Now, turning to Slide 4. Q3 results in 2021 outlook. New Equipment orders were up 3.8% in Q3 and up 10.3% on a rolling 12-month basis. Organic sales were up 8.1% in the third quarter, with 14.1% organic growth in the New Equipment segment and 3.6% organic growth in the Service segment. Adjusted operating profit was up $63 million and margin expanded 20 basis points, despite a 50-basis point impact from segment mix as the new equipment business grew faster than the service business. Year-to-date, we generated robust free cash flow of $1.4 billion or 141% conversion of GAAP net income. This positive momentum and our progress on our long-term strategy gives us the confidence to improve our 2021 outlook and positions us well to build upon this strong performance in 2022. We now expect sales for the year to be approximately $14.3 billion, up 11.8% to 12.3% versus the prior year, and up 8.5% to 9% organically. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be in the range of $2.18 billion to $2.19 billion, up $260 to $270 million at actual currency, and up a $195 million to $205 million at constant currency. We're improving adjusted EPS from the prior outlook by $0.04 at the midpoint and $0.06 from the low-end and now expect it to be approximately $2.95, a 17% increase versus the prior year. Lastly, we're improving our free cash flow outlook to approximately $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion with a 125% conversion of GAAP net income. With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our Q3 results and 2021 outlook in more detail.\nRahul Ghai: Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with third quarter results on Slide 5, Net sales grew 10.8% to $3.6 billion as the strong growth momentum continued in new equipment and service grew for the third consecutive quarter. Adjusted operating profit was up 12.5% or $63 million and up $52 million at constant currency, primarily from the benefit of higher volume in both segments. Installation productivity initiatives in new equipment and favorable service pricing, and productivity helps to offset the headwinds from commodity inflation and the absence of temporary cost actions taken last year to alleviate the impact from COVID-19. We maintained the focus on cost containment while continuing to invest in the business. Adjusted SG&A was down 70 basis points as a percentage of sales, despite the step-up in public Company expenses. R&D and other strategic investments were up slightly versus prior year and were about flat as a percentage of sales. This strong focus on execution resulted in 20 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter and 70 basis points of margin expansion at constant segment mix. Third quarter adjusted EPS was up 11.6% or $0.08. Driven by $0.11 of operating profit growth, partially offset by $0.04 from a higher adjusted tax rate due to the absence of a cumulative year-to-date tax benefit in the third quarter of 2020. On a year-to-date basis, the adjusted tax rate is down by a 180 basis points. Moving to Slide 6, new equipment orders were up 3.8% at constant currency. Otis' momentum remains strong in Asia, up mid-teens, including sixth consecutive quarter of growth in China. As expected, after 47% growth in the second quarter, orders declined year-over-year in the Americas, primarily due to timing as awards which proceed order bookings in North America were up approximately 24% versus the prior year. EMEA was down 1.8% from the timing of major project orders. Proposal volumes in the quarter also continued to show signs of strong demand globally, up double-digits. Total Company backlog increased 4% and 1% at constant currency from strong growth in China. Pricing on new orders declined by over 1 point and backlog margin was down about a point versus prior year. Both pricing on new orders and backlog margin with about flat sequentially. Year-to-date, new equipment orders were up 15%, including 13% growth in the Americas, mid-single-digit growth in the EMEA, and approximately 20% growth in Asia. Organic sales were up 14.1% with growth in all regions. Americas was up mid-teens, driven by strong backlog execution as the business surpassed pre - COVID levels. EMEA was up low single digits and Asia grew high teens driven by China where organic sales were up double digits. New equipment adjusted operating profit was up $33 million from higher volume. Pricing was marginally unfavorable in the quarter and higher commodity prices were a headwind of $35 million. But we more than mitigated these impacts through strong installation execution, including favorable project closeouts, leading to 80 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. Service segment results on slide 7, maintains portfolio units were up 3% versus the prior year with global improvements in retention, recapture, and conversion rates. The number of units increased in all regions, and China was up high-teens accelerating from the mid-teen\u2019s growth in the second quarter. There was pressure on modernization demand in the third quarter, and modernization orders were down 4.1% at constant currency as growth in EMEA and Asia was offset by decline in the Americas, primarily driven by timing of orders as the market is recovering strongly in 2021. Overall, modernization backlog was up 2% at constant currency. Service organic sales were up 3.6% with growth for the third consecutive quarter as the business continues to recover from the impact of COVID. Maintenance and repair grew 4.7%, with strong recovery in repair and low single-digit growth in contractual maintenance sales. Modernization sales were down 1.2% as growth in Europe and China was more than offset a decline in Asia Pacific from lingering COVID-related [Indiscernible] and in the Americas from supply chain shortages. Adjusted operating profit grew $27 million as higher volume, productivity initiatives, and improved pricing and mix more than offset the absence of favorability from COVID-related cost containment actions. taken in the prior year. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded for the seventh consecutive quarter and was up 30 basis points. Overall year-to-date results reflect solid performance with approximately 1.5 points of new equipment share gain, our best portfolio growth in the last decade, 11% organic sales growth, and $261 million of adjusted operating profit growth, with margin expansion in both segments. We also generated close to $1.4 billion in free cash flow, enabling us to complete $725 million in share repurchases, raised dividends earlier this year, continue with [Indiscernible] acquisitions and announced a tender offer for the remaining stay in Zardoya Otis. Looking forward for the balance of the year on Slide 8. We feel confident about strong growth across all key metrics for the year. We now expect organic sales to be up 8.5% to 9%, up 1 point from the prior outlook with improvement in new equipment segment. We now expect operating profit to grow between $260 to $270 million, up $15 million from prior outlook at the midpoint with sales growth, operating profit growth, and margin expansion in both segments. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be approximately $2.95, $0.04 higher than prior outlook at the midpoint, and up 17% versus the prior year. The year-over-year EPS increase is driven a strong operating profit growth, a reduction in the adjusted tax rate, and a reduced share count. The adjusted tax rate is now expected to be in a range of 28.5% to 29%, more than a 150 - basis point reduction versus the prior year and a 25-basis point improvement from the prior outlook at the midpoint. Following strong year-to-date cash generation from net income growth and over $300 million reduction in working capital from the end of last year, we now expect free cash flow for the year to be between $1.5 to $1.55 billion. This is up $50 million from the prior outlook from improved net income and reduced working capital. Seeking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9. New equipment is now projected to be up 15% to 15.5% driven by accelerated backlog conversion and a 15% year-to-date orders growth. This is an increase of more than 250 basis points from the prior outlook and over 11 improvements from our expectations at the beginning of the year. This broad-based improvement in expectations is supported by robust market growth in all regions, strong year-to-date performance, and continued backlog growth. Americas is now up high-teens -- sorry, up mid-teens, EMEA up high-single-digits, and Asia up high-teens driven by China. In service, we are adjusting our outlook to approximately 4% growth. The lower end of the prior range, reflecting slower-than-expected recovery on modernization in the second half of the year. Modernization is now expected to be up approximately 4% for the year from up mid-single-digit previously driven by COVID related jobsite restrictions in Asia-Pacific, slower decision making in EMEA, and some part shortages in the Americas. Despite the resurgence of COVID in Asia-Pacific, there is no change to the maintenance and repair outlook that is still expected to be up approximately 4% for the year, driven by continued maintenance portfolio growth and recovery in discretionary repair. Overall, the organic sales growth outlook of 8.5% to 9% reflects a strong year-to-date performance and good momentum. Positioning us well to deliver growth across all regions and all lines of business while building backlog to support continued growth in 2022. Switching to operating profit on Slide 10, we now expect operating profit to be up between 260 to $270 million or so of the prior year with margin expansion of 20 basis points. At constant currency, operating profit is expected to be up between a $195 to $205 million. This represents an improvement of $15 million versus the prior outlook from the impact of updated volume expectations in both segments and actions taken to reduce the corporate expenses. FX tailwind is now expected to be approximately $65 million from $70 million that you were expecting previously, primarily due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, impacting the profit growth in the service business. The year-over-year growth in operating profit reflects the benefits of higher volume, service productivity initiatives, favorable service pricing, and strong installation execution. It is partially offset by unfavorable new equipment price mix, headwind from the absence of prior year cost containment actions related to COVID-19, and higher commodity prices. The headwind from commodities is now expected to be between $80 to $90 million for the year. At the higher end of what we communicated in July, driven partially by higher new equipment volume in the year. The broader price increases announced last quarter have been rolled out and will help to alleviate the impact on higher commodity prices in 2022. Overall, this strong outlook puts us more than $1 billion ahead of our 2019 reported revenue, with a 100 basis points of margin expansion. 2021 sales, earnings, and margin in both segments are expected to be higher than 2019. And adjusted EPS is expected to be up more than 30% versus 2019, reflecting broad-based improvement in performance driven by our ability to execute implementation of the long-term strategy and the benefits of a solid end-market recovery. And with that, I'll request Michelle to please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. Hope everyone's well. So, I hate to start off with the obvious question, but maybe we just talk about China. Obviously, a lot of noise in that country. I notice there\u2019s a -- in your appendix, there's a useful chart around risky developers. But just curious what you're seeing on the ground real-time and then maybe just how share price and mix is evolving in China?\nJudith Marks: Sure. Good morning, Nigel. Good to hear from you. So let me try to put China into context and we hope that chart was helpful. As we entered this year, we were expecting mid-single-digit growth in China. We have actually seen stronger growth year-to-date and the segment itself, we believe will end the year at high single digits. Through the first nine months, all sectors in China have been strong, residential, commercial, and infrastructure we've seen increased activity in Tier 1 and 2 cities, as well as in infrastructure and with our key accounts. The third quarter segment, we believe grew mid-single-digit and we anticipate and have planned for the fourth quarter to be down correspondingly mid-single-digit. So, if we go back to '20, we thought it was going to be mid-single-digit growth. We've seen that. '21, we've seen high single-digit growth. We're still seeing healthy demand. This is the sixth quarter in a row that we've had New Equipment growth in China. But we're trying to be prudent for 2022 and we've actually planned for a flattish market there, and we're going to control what we can and what we know how to control. There\u2019s clearly heightened possibilities. There could be declines next year given the macro environment in the property sector. But we believe that the strategy we've put in place and the initiatives we've put for sales coverage, for share gain, and for price are really all paying off. We've added agents and distributors, so now we're at 2,300. We've added another 150 A&Ds in the third quarter. As Rahul shared in his opening comments, our portfolio growth is in the high teens, so our service strategy is paying off with more coverage and more service depots and our proposal volume was up significantly this quarter. So, again, we're being prudent. We're watching what's going on, but we have put in place price increases. Those will yield in '22. They won't yield quicker than that because of our long-cycle business, but we're managing that as well. And I just will call your attention to that chart in the appendix and just put that as well in the context. We did tens of millions of dollars of revenue across approximately 10 customers that had breached either the two or three red lines with their liquidity issues. And we share that those 10 customers are less than 3% of our China sales through the third quarter and less than 1% of Otis sales through the third quarter. And - but we've been mitigating this since the three red line policy has come into play. And for any of these customers that cross these red lines, we've moved to cash - advanced cash basis. So, we're working this on an account-by-account basis. We do not believe, and we've shared that the exposure is not large and we're going to continue to managing this effectively and executing our strategy.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, Judy. That's really helpful. And then obviously supply chain is another key issue. One of your competitors called out some impacts from that, but also called out some product delays, which beat behind some of the new equipment\u2019s weakness that they saw. I'm just curious, are you seeing any -- it doesn't seem like it, but are you seeing any weaknesses caused by delays on the construction projects? And are we seeing inflationary impact on steel causing some delays to tendering activities out there?\nJudith Marks: Let me start with the steel and rural, please add. We are not seeing delays due to steel. Obviously, steel, and again, it's in our new equipment business, about $300 million a year of commodities that we purchased. We've been able to purchase it, but obviously with the steel prices, it fairly escalated prices. And Rahul shared, we've increased $80 million to $90 million. Our impact on commodities this year -- primarily driven by our volumes being up versus what we shared with you in July. So steel is not causing delays. We're not seeing significant delays on jobsites in terms of labor. We're all watching installation subcontract labor, especially in Europe, but in terms of Otis labor, we have not had any delays in any of our job sites, and we've put plans in place. Our supply chain team has been dealing with this extremely effectively now for almost two years, whether it's semiconductors, ocean freight, we have not had delays in delivering to job sites from our New Equipment. Some of that's the benefit of our factories being local and our supply chains being local with global agreements. But we have done everything from spot buys and redesigning some of our chip sets from an engineering perspective to use more common chips to make sure there was no impact to our customers. So, we've not seen that but Rahul, I\u2019ll let you add.\nRahul Ghai: No. The only place and I'm sure we'll get there during the call, Nigel, is on modernization. It does impact our revenue because as Judy said, on new equipment, we can manage the shortages wherever we see them because we can have multiple shipments for the job site. Elevator doesn't go in one box, or as a completed unit. We actually assemble the elevator as you guys know, on the job site. So, it goes in a couple of dozen crates, right? So whatever parts are short, we can ship them later. But on modernization jobs, it's a little bit harder, because they're shorter in duration. So, on modernization, we've seen some impact from raw material shortages, and there's a little bit of a construction delay. It's not -- as Judy said, we are not experiencing delays from our factories, we can manage that, but there's a little bit of a construction slowdown for other shortages and that's impacting some revenue on the new equipment side, especially here in the U.S. But other than that, I think we are okay, overall.\nNigel Coe: Perfect. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.\nRahul Ghai: Thanks, Nigel.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nJudith Marks: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Good morning. Could we just talk about price a little bit first, I guess? Rahul, I think that price was down one, but also flat sequentially. Is that correct? But really, the larger question is a little bit of color on kind of the competitive environment as you see it. It does appear you're taking some share, is there a competitive price response that you're dealing with there? And maybe a little bit of color on the price that you do have in the market currently when you do expect it to show up in the P&L.\nRahul Ghai: Yes. Let me start with the pricing and I'll hand it to Judy to add some color on the competitive dynamics here. So overall, I think the numbers you quoted, Jeff, are exactly right. Pricing out -- overall pricing was down maybe slightly more than a point in Q3 here and was consistent with the booked margins in Q2. And on a regional basis, EMEA was better year-over-year, and pricing trends in both Asia-Pacific and China were largely consistent with first half. And America 's pricing was slightly worse than first half and it's more the mix of customers as where we saw the pressure. The distribution was a smaller share of orders and that comes at a little bit better pricing. But pricing in Americas in the volume business was consistent with first half. So, you put all that in context. The fact that the pricing trends, basically what we saw in first half, is continuing into Q3. So, no sequential change from the first half into Q3. And the price increases that we put in place, we've rolled them out pretty much across the board at this point. And where you will see that impact is those quotes have not yet converted to orders, which is fairly typical because that's the cycle from quotation to orders. And they'll probably start up maybe showing up in late Q4 or early Q1. And the benefit of that, as Judy said in response to Nigel's question, will probably show up in 2022. Let me pause there, see -- and Judy, if you want to add something on competitive dynamics. \nJudith Marks: Hey, listen, Jeff, we're seeing strong competition I think across the board, and we're seeing varying levels of price increase, and we have rolled out. We shared with you in our second quarter earnings that we had rolled out some limited price increases early in the year, and then we went right after our second quarter earnings call ended, global price increases at varying levels to understand and see what we could get in the market because we have, obviously, cost increases in terms of inflationary labor costs as well as input costs and commodities. We all hit it right on. And the only thing I would tell you is we are seeing some headwinds on pricing, but we're up -- our New Equipment margins are up a 150 basis points year-to-date. So, we're able to as -- we've always said, try to get it with price, but we understand the lag time, increase our installation efficiency, which we did very well in the third quarter globally, as well as continue to control what we can in terms of productivity in our factories, material productivity and every lever we have. So, it's going to be competitive, it's going to continue to be, but the end markets are growing across the globe. So strong demand and we're going to continue to try and get price everywhere we can.\nJeff Sprague: Great. And then just a follow-up on China for me. Maybe just a little bit more color on what you're seeing on bid and proposal and forward pipeline. And then really the nature of my question is it seems like there's some government pressure on these developers to complete projects, right? Which may give us some forward momentum. But in terms of the way you can see on the horizon, the visibility that you have. Just any other color there, I think would be interesting.\nRahul Ghai: Yes. So, Jeff, what [Indiscernible] here is [Indiscernible] I think I've said in my prepared remarks, our proposal volume was up very strongly across-the-board and it was very, very strong in China. Our proposal volume was up close to 40% in China. I think that goes back to what Judy said earlier, it's driven by all the things that we have done. Our increase in our channel partners, increase in our sales force. Our sales force is up by more than 10% in relation to the growth in the channel partners, so we have invested a ton to increase our reach in China which is up close to 10 points as well. So, all the things that we are doing is driving incremental activity on our side. But if you step back and even look at the market overall, if you look at the flow space under construction, is up 8% year-to-date and 10+% over 2019, the real estate investment is up 9% year-over-year so -- and historically, there has been a very, very strong correlation between these two metrics and the EBITDA growth. But the reality is, the situation is fluid today. And after a very strong start, the first half, the stocks have slowed down in the last couple of months. So, we're watching it very, very carefully. But again, I think if you want to grow the overall economy next year, even if you say that the Chinese government doesn't set a target of 6, but it set a target of 5. With 30% off the GDP coming from the property market, it will be hard for them to achieve 5% to 6% growth next year with the property market being down. So, this is where I think, going back to what Judy said earlier, we expect the market to be more stable for next year. But again, we'll keep watching it and keep doing what we can control, which is driving incremental effort on our side, and the healthy proposal activity is a good sign for us to come.\nJudith Marks: Hey, Jeff, let me just add one or two other things. As we said, our share gain on new equipment shares for the quarter and for the year so far is 150 basis points. It's at least that in China including in the third quarter. So, we're -- our strategy really is working there. Second, we've already been approached by people other than these developers in local governments to finish some job sites on an advanced cash basis. So, we believe the work in progress is going to continue even with the developers that are experiencing 2 or 3 red lines. And so, we're -- but again, we're being prudent. We're planning for a flattish '22, and we're going to continue to execute our strategies to gain share in that flattish '22.\nJeff Sprague: Great, thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the backlog margin because I'd thought that maybe pricing would be filtering through more quickly, but I think the backlog margins down 100 points and it was down I think 50 points in Q2. How should we think about the backlog margin, sort of, from here looking out over the next 2 or 3 quarters?\nRahul Ghai: No. I think, Judy, you're exactly right. The numbers you quoted exact rate backlog margin was down about a point and last quarter we did say 0.5 point, so you are exactly right. So, it got slightly worse. And again, I think going back to what we said earlier, what you will see is that the pricing that we have put out in the market, that should start showing up in late Q4 or early Q1 and that is where you'll see starts getting improvement in both our books margin and backlog margin. So that is when we expect the trends to turn, but in the meanwhile, going back to our earlier response, we are just continuing to execute really well on the installation side. And that is what's driving our increase in year-to-date margin. So that is offsetting both the pricing pressure and the commodity headwinds. I mean, despite both those headwinds between incremental volumes that drives higher absorption and the installation execution, which we've said was always our priority between those two things. That's what's helping us continue to grow our new equipment margin. And if you look at even the full-year guide, last quarter we said maybe it's 90. In this quarter, it's up 90 basis points for the year, margin expansion. And this guide we think we can get to between 90 basis points to 100 basis points. So, despite everything, we are actually improving our margin outlook on the new equipment segment for the year.\nJudith Marks: Yeah, Julian, we've really pivoted to grow off our service productivity, process changes, technology changes to really, we've always believed there was opportunity on installation. And that's where we've been focused again, especially with trying to overcome, but the backlog margin and the commodity pressures in new equipment. And that's what you're seeing come through.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. And then maybe just on the new equipment orders by region. So clearly people are very focused on the China and Asia numbers, but in Q3, those were very good still. So, what was more interesting for me was Americas and EMEA, I realize it's lumpy, but you had the down orders there on new equipment. I just wonder, when you compare this up cycle in non-residential with the one 12 years ago, this up-cycle has recovered far more quickly out of the recession than coming out of 2009. So, the slope of it from here, you are thinking that we had an exceptionally strong V-shape and now the growth from here is fairly muted. Again, this is ex-Asia and ex-China.\nJudith Marks: Let me talk to the Americans first. If you look at our guide, first of all, we've seen a faster sustained recovery in the Americas. Whether you go back to the GFC or 12 years ago, Julian, it's at the end of the GFC which is really when we felt it more in the Americas and our guide has us going up mid-teens from the low teens. We've got a strong backlog execution, and year-to-date in the Americas. If you take out the lumpiness and just go year-to-date, we're at 13.3% growth in the Americas and a 12-month roll of a healthy number as well. So, we see the America is doing -- coming back strong. The Dodge Momentum Index was up 164.9 and the Architecture Billings Index was at 56.6. So, the indices are trending the right way and we're doing well. Again, it's -- and no one quarter makes an orders book. We don't control all the timing on those orders, but year-to-date, the Americas has done tremendously incredible second quarter, and now again, in the third quarter. EMEA 6.3% year-to-date down a little in the third quarter, but that's kind of timing and we think we'll see both of those nicely accelerate in Q4. And that's important for us. We want to end the year with higher than the 1% backlog we're sitting at today and our entire team understands that. We believe we can do that in the Americas because their awards are up as Rahul said in his opening remarks and that is a leading indicator where we've got the awards already and we've got the LOIs and now we have to move it to a booking and get everything finished but we expect a strong fourth quarter and plan to end the year with a backlog that all -- of 2 plus percent hopefully closer to 3, we'll have to see where that comes out so that we start '22 strong.\nJeff Sprague: That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next que -- our next question comes from the line of Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nPatrick Baumann: All right. Good morning, Judy. Good morning [Indiscernible] thanks for taking my questions. First one, just on the China exposure you detailed in the appendix, just wanted to test the sensitivity on that versus the macro stats. So, I mean, you said planning for a flattish market? Does the assumption for a flattish market there embed any decline in floor starts? Just trying to understand how much your initiatives there and your exposures there could help mitigate and a decline in floor starts.\nRahul Ghai: It's an interesting question, Patrick. Again, it's hard to draw a direct correlation between any of these metrics into an exact elevated market because it depends on what's going on in the market, how many buildings under construction; we're obviously declining. And the floor stars have been down just Last couple of months after a very, very strong first half. So, it's been -- you've seen them in the last couple of months, but again, the first half was very strong. So that is very few come back and if you look at the other metrics, which I won't repeat because you've gone through those, like the construction and the real estate investment. And historically, they've had a pretty high correlation with the elevated market. So that is where we saw the market is going to be more flattish for next year and keep in mind that that level is at more than 600,000 units and comes after two very strong years of growth, high-single digits this year and mid-single-digits last year. So, we think that the market stabilizes at this level, that's a very healthy demand for the market and driven by all this health hope initiative that we're driving gives us an opportunity to continue to drive gains in our China business.\nPatrick Baumann: Okay. So, it's not as simple as taking 20% of sales in, saying, okay, for a start to down 10, that's what we should attribute to Otis, it's more complex to them.\nRahul Ghai: For sure. Yes.\nPatrick Baumann: And then, if you could -- Just as a follow-up, can you help bridge that 20% of sales from China downturn to earnings? How big a percentage of earnings is that when we take into account like the impacts from joint ventures, etc.? And then, within that, how much of that earnings are aftermarket or service versus direct residential OE exposure?\nRahul Ghai: Well, we haven't -- we typically do not report that way, Patrick, but let me see what we can do here on the call. So, if you take our China business and our year-to-date sales of $2.1 billion, so that's our revenue for China year-to-date. Now, it's typically 80-20; 80% new equipment and 20% service. And the service businesses are accelerating very, very nicely as well driven by the portfolio growth that we've been talking about. And what we've said historically, is that because China is one of our more profitable new equipment businesses. In fact, the most profitable of all regions in terms of how we report. And on the service side, it is the least profitable of our regions. And then you put the mix on top of it, so that the mix -- the new equipment service mix also works against the overall growth in China. So that's where we'll take put all that together, the China profit abilities maybe overall lower than where Otis reports. So that's kind of where we are. And then obviously, the JV shares, we've got two JVs in China. And we've not disclosed our ownership, but obviously, at some kind of between 50% to 100%. So it's in somebody in there, but you're right. I mean, obviously, the profit that we earn in China gets shared with our JV partners.\nPatrick Baumann: Right. So without giving a specific number on that obviously, plus to 20% of earnings. But is it less than 10% earnings? I don't want an exact number, just kind of curious, as a follow-up.\nRahul Ghai: Patrick, I just want to stay away from that on the call. I think that's -- we report via segments. I think I've provided enough color here, and I think you guys can -- you're more, than smart for all of you guys you do the math and we will leave it there. Thank you.\nPatrick Baumann: Thanks so much. I appreciate the time.\nRahul Ghai: Thanks, Patrick.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nCai von Rumohr: Yeah.\nRahul Ghai: Morning, Cai.\nCai von Rumohr: Thanks so much for taking -- yes. Good morning, Rahul. So in the first Q4 cash flow, it looks like you're guiding to 170 million. Maybe refresh my memory in terms of what you have that kind of depresses that number?\nRahul Ghai: So first, Cai, really great year on cash. I mean, if you think about the working capital reduction that we've been able to drive, we've had occurred consecutive quarter of negative working capital. It's down, as I said in my prepared remarks, more than $300 million from where we ended the year. So very, very strong performance on cash. Now, the two things that -- I would say, three things that work as you go from sequentially from 3Q to 4Q. The first is that there is historically a buildup of working capital between third quarter and fourth quarter. So if you look at the last couple of years where the cash flow is available, you will see an increase in working capital from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So that's one driver. The second is based on the guide that you provided. There's lower net income in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. So that's the second piece. And we still have that tax payment in one of the European countries that we've alluded to before. That's a long-standing tax matter that predates spin, that we still need to make in the fourth quarter here, and that we've cited previously between -- at tens of millions of dollars. So those are kind of the three big levels, I would say as you go from third quarter to fourth quarter cash flow. That is why fourth quarter cash flow is less, but still $50 million higher than where we were three months ago and it's driven by improvement in net income and better working capital performance and a very healthy number for the year. I think it's close to 125%.\nJudith Marks: Yeah. And we're going to be past our mid-term guidance we gave at Investor Day in terms of cash flow for the second year.\nCai von Rumohr: So the main area -- the big abnormal thing is the tax payment. And then on the Zardoya purchase -- I mean if you took that cash and bought back stock it looks like Zardoya is modestly maybe 1% accretive to full-year basis and you already control it. So maybe walk us through some of the potential opportunities. For example, I think we've discussed this offline, but Spain has a tax rate of 25%. I mean do you -- and I assume you're going to issue Euro bond debt. And so are you able to expand that at a higher tax rate? What are some of the benefits from the consolidation?\nRahul Ghai: Well, let me talk about the financial and --\nJudith Marks: That's operation al.\nRahul Ghai: -- Yeah. Then I'll hand it over to Judy to talk about the operational opportunities that we have. So from a financial standpoint, Cai, it's very, very straightforward. I mean, you look at our -- and I think we said that in our press release of our $80 million of net cash outflow that we made to our JV partners there, both minority and the family. The small individual share-owners and institutional share-owners, and the family combined. So that's about 80 million out. So that, obviously, that's something that we don't have to make once we have full control ownership of Zardoya. And then we will borrow, as you said, our intention is to borrow in Europe. So we'll do the borrowing in Europe. And so that is where you net the two out. We expect mid-single-digit percentage accretion in 2023. Now, in 2022, it's going to be less than that, because the fact is it's going to take us a few months here. We just filed a prospectus, it\u2019s going to take 3 to 4 months for that filing to get improved then we launch the tender, then there is a divesting period and it may take us time to ramp up to the full ownership. So there's going to be a staggered increase in our ownership and that is where I think we said in the press release, we expect maybe 0.04 to $0.05 of accretion in 2022, just given the timing of the close and the timing of acquisition of shares. So those two things that get us to, I think we said $0.04 to $0.06 in the press release. So somewhere in that range for '22 and then mid-single-digit percentage accretion in 2023. Hopefully that answers the question, Cai. And then I'll -- maybe Judy, you want to talk about [Indiscernible].\nJudith Marks: Yeah. I'll just make it simple because of the time. I mean, first, Cai, this is going to simplify our corporate structure. It allow us to eliminate the only remaining listed subsidiary we have and will save the public Company costs that go with that as well. But it really will allow us to streamline our operations in Europe, which gives us the launching point in the future for some strategic growth opportunities. It's a great service portfolio, we have three factories there. We love this business and we think it just -- yes, we control it, which is why we're not worried about any implementation risks because we have operational control right now. But as we think about some future strategic growth opportunities across the continent, this is going to give us just that full capability to optimize everything from our talent to our operations in our facilities.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific. Thank you very much.\nRahul Ghai: Thanks, Cai.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Walsh: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nJudith Marks: Good morning, John.\nJohn Walsh: Hi. So a lot of ground covered around pricing and commodities, but I'm just curious if you can help us think about maybe 2022 or maybe I'll even broaden it and just say a deflationary environment if we start to get some relief around commodities, if we've hit the peak pain, so to say, this year. How do we think about your ability to capture positive price cost spread? Are there certain things in your contracts or do some of those escalators maybe go away just trying to understand the price cost dynamic as we think into next year, if we are starting to see some relief in commodities.\nJudith Marks: Yeah, that's a great question, John. And we have escalation capabilities in our service contracts in most of Europe and the Americas that are primarily index to labor and most of those tend to renew the majority in the first quarter of the year. So we believe that will be to our benefit. Those clauses are resident in those contracts and have been there for many, many years. We just haven't been able to exercise them. So we will certainly try to flow through service price increases and we'll see what the market will bear there. But we have the ability to do that. And the majority of them are indexed to labor. But there's some small portion that are indexed to material or commodities. Again, we haven't had that opportunity. It is a customer negotiation point, but we think that will at least start off '22 stronger in terms of service pricing.\nRahul Ghai: Yeah, and on new equipment, again, I think we've said that before; we expect some commodity headwinds next year, John, on the new equipment side we do given where the commodity prices were in the first half of this year we expect first half of next year to be in the same range as where we were in the second half of this year, so call it $30 to $35 million a quarter. So maybe 70 million for the first half and then beyond that, if you look at the commodity forwards today, they start going the other way starting May, June of 2022, and we start -- Right now, the forwards would project that there will be deals in the second half of next year, but it's too early to call that. But again, go back to our pieces is going to be that for next year, we can continue driving earnings expansion in both segments, new equipment coming from higher volume, given where Judy said that are planned to ending the backlog, it have that low-single-digit growth range. So we will continue to drive revenue growth in the new equipment segment with incremental home-health from pricing that we've already put in place and our continued execution installation. We think we can use all that to offset any commodity headwinds in the first half and drive earnings expansion. And on service, I think our pricing should be a tailwind for next year, given where prices are. And the volume should accelerate to more mid-single-digit growth, which is what we expect.\nJudith Marks: Yeah. We've seen really good year-to-date snap back on repair, John, and we expect that to continue in fourth quarter and into next year, globally. And then, if we can get some of these maintenance escalators, but Service pricing has been held up really strong.\nJohn Walsh: No. I appreciate the details there and then maybe just a follow-up here on China. A lot of ground covered already but as I think about Otis' opportunity within China, there's the market piece, but also the share gains. And was just curious as you look in a flat market, if that does prove to be the case, how should we think about Otis visibility to gain share in a flat market? Is this 1.5 points the right bogey? Could it be better? Should we temper ourselves a little bit? Just would love to get your thoughts on that.\nJudith Marks: Yeah. We'll share more, obviously, as we give guidance in '22. But our China team has taken on the challenge to grow share and grow portfolio and they've done both robustly this year. And we've lived through declining markets, you go back to '15, to '18; we were first to emerge really 18, '19 and enter drive price increases there even when others didn't want to follow. And now we've really, I think, proven share gain for 2 straight years and again, 6 consecutive quarter of new equipment growth while we're getting that share gain and driving profitability. So whether it's flat or up, we intend to gain share.\nJohn Walsh: Great, thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Miguel Beauregard with BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMiguel Beauregard: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I've got a couple of questions, if I may. The first one, again, coming back on China. Can you comment on how are your clients reacting to these prepayments that you're asking for? That would be mentioned on Slide 16. Is this something you just started asking or are you now rolling over to all new orders instead of to select few?\nJudith Marks: So we have been -- the three red lines came into effect, if I get the month right, August of '20, but certainly sometime during the 23rd quarter. And we've been we've been monitoring this closely and if we have clients who are not going to go to this cash payment, then we've stopped taking orders from them to be candid. We're managing it effectively. And what we think is prudently in a risk mitigation perspective so that we don't get out ahead of their liquidity issues or become the holder of their liquidity issues. So they understand it. We've been very upfront with them. Again, we go account by account. That's why you have these relationships and we have these open discussions.\nMiguel Beauregard: Thank you. And I would be interested in understanding the 10% increase that you mentioned on your sales force in China. Can you shed some color on when -- where are you investing? Are these tier one cities or are you expanding more into tier three cities? And can you remind us your exposure in terms of segments in China, or as commercial and infrastructure?\nRahul Ghai: Yeah. So our sales force, I mean, obviously it's pretty broad-based, Miguel, and it's both in Tier 1 and Tier 2 [Indiscernible] and that it is something we've done so that as we are adding more channel partners, we need our sales force to support the channel partners that we are hiring and gain our fair share of wallet from those agents and distributors. So that is where our incremental sales force is going, and it's split between both New Equipment and Service because that's what we need to do to drive our Service portfolio growth. And in terms of our overall make, I think we are -- we do fairly well in every segment, both residential, commercial infrastructures so we have a fairly strong presence across all verticals. Now, obviously, it depends on where the market is and we been focused a lot more on the infrastructure recently, and that is where -- if you look back at what we shared on our Investor day, that is where we've gained a few points of share. So we continue do well across all segments and I think our share base -- share gain is fairly broad-based.\nMiguel Beauregard: Thank you very much.\nJudith Marks: Thanks, Miguel.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nick Housden with RBC Capital. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nNick Housden: Yes. Hi, everyone. Thanks you for taking my questions, just a couple of quick ones from me. You've mentioned productivity gain a few times as a driver of the pretty good margin results. I'm just wondering if you can maybe quantify that a little bit more, and also tell us to what extent that's still potential here going forward in the next few quarters?\nRahul Ghai: So our productivity gain is coming from both segments. Nick, it's coming from new equipment. We spoke about the material productivity, starting right when we did the first Investor Day. We've been talking about it. That's a key driver for us so we continue to push really, really hard on that. Innovation, we've been driving installation efficiency so that means the better project closeouts and ending the project at a higher margin than what we booked at. And that includes both using fewer hours to install the product and taking costs out of the material because not the entire material cost comes from the factory. There is an incremental material procurement that happens in the field. So we've been spending a lot of time and effort to understand where the supply basis and how we can take costs out of that. So that has been the major push share and that is where you're seeing. And again, we had an early stages of that. We just started it. We saw good results in Q2. We saw good results in Q3. So we're in early stages of that and we need that installation efficiency to continue to get better as we get into '22. So that will be a push for us. And on service productivity, which again has been a tailwind for us despite [Indiscernible] maintenance hours and all the COVID -related headwinds that we're absorbing, our Q3 hours are still down year-over-year to maintain an elevator. So that comes from pushed that we have on Otis ONE and some of the other productivity things that we're doing. So that is what is driving our service productivity, which continues to be -- which continued to be strong in Q2.\nJudith Marks: And that's obviously what drives profitability.\nNick Housden: That's correct. And then just very quickly on the tax rate. You mentioned 28.5% to 29% this year. Is that about the right number going forward or should we expect something a bit different?\nJudith Marks: We guided an Investor Day, and after that, actually that we expect that to continue to go down and to get to about 26.5% at really, that's what we're expecting over the mid-term. Really, 2 strong years in a row, Nick, we have brought it down to about 30.4 last year from over 34 in our first year. And then another as we said, a 180 basis points this year to get us to the midpoint between [Indiscernible] and 29. So really good focus and it's now what we have to do is operationalize a lot of it. But we know the path, we know that trajectory, and we're going to continue down that path to get us closer to that 26.5.\nNick Housden: That's great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Joel Spungin with Berenberg, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJoel Spungin: Hi. Good morning. A couple of lots to just quickly, maybe you can just start with China again on all your Slide 16, just to help me understand when you talk about the 3% of China sales, is that both your direct and indirect of the total exposure to those property to benefit intriguing sales last third-party distributors, whatever it might be, I guess the reason I'm asking just ready to open up some -- just to hear you thoughts? And is that the risk care might not just be with potentially in Ever Grand or whoever going bust, but actually, that it causes distress in the distribution network in China and that you have exposed the distributors who might be at risk if some of these guys go under. So yeah, just wonder if you could talk a little bit more about that in terms of what this 3% number is and just to clarify that.\nRahul Ghai: So the 3% represents our sales to these customers, both direct and indirect. Yes, so that's a total exposure to these customers. I think your question, Joel, is right if -- and I think it goes to a broader contagion issue, which obviously is not represented on this chart. And again, that goes back in [Indiscernible] discussion that [Indiscernible] Joel that you've had on this call around our expectations for the China market. So not to rehash all of that but we do expect that this is going to be -- we do expect the China elevator in [Indiscernible] market to be more flattish next year. So that's our current expectation. And but this 3% is our total exposure to these customers.\nJudith Marks: [Indiscernible]\nRahul Ghai: [Indiscernible]\nJoel Spungin: Okay. Thank you. And then maybe just one final quickly, which was just on your comments around modernization, which I thought were interesting and it sounds like you will slightly temper your expectations for the fourth quarter in terms of modernization. Do you think that there is -- there's a [Indiscernible] like some of these issues are likely to result in some pent-up demand being released in 2022. I'm just interested, for example, your comments about EMEA bidding through late decision-making, whether or not that's likely to come through fall maybe next year.\nJudith Marks: And MOD Joel, we think it really is demand delay versus disruption, versus elimination actually or destruction. The challenge on MOD is it is somewhat more bespoke. The new equipment and custom. And that at least, in the Americas, has created a little bit of a supply chain challenge for us. So we were dealing with it. I think we've appropriately tempered the fourth quarter to the low end of the set service guidance for that reason but we don't see this or the EMEA demand or the Asia-Pacific demand going away by any point. Modernization is going to continue to grow and we know, what we need to do. If you look all in year-to-date, our orders were up 4.3% and our sales were up 2.7%. So we think the fourth quarter reflects that kind of knowledge as well as what we're experiencing and '22 should be stronger.\nJoel Spungin: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Judy Marks for any further remarks.\nJudith Marks: Yes. Thanks, Michelle. This solid year-to-date performance, positive momentum, and our ability to execute on our long-term strategy gives us confidence. We'll deliver a strong close to 2021 with high single-digit Organic sales growth, $260 to $270 million in operating profit growth and high teens EPS growth. While the external environment remains fluid, I'm confident the investments we've made over the last few years and our progress as an independent Company have set a new path and will position us well for 2022. As always, we remain focused on driving value for our customers, our colleagues, our communities, and our shareholders. Thank you for joining us today and stay safe and well.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Otis continued to make significant progress driving our long-term strategic priorities as reflected in the strong financial performance year-to-date. In the third quarter, we grew organic sales and expanded margins in both segments. We gained approximately 1.5 points of new equipment share this quarter and year-to-date on top of 60 basis points in the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, new equipment orders were up mid-teens with growth in all regions reflecting our continued focus on providing value for our customers and the recovery in our end markets throughout the year. In the quarter, new equipment orders were particularly strong in Asia up mid-teens, where we secured an order for the Hong Kong International Airport, extending an over 20-year relationship with this customer. We will install over 100 escalators and moving walkways to keep passengers moving across the concourse. This is further progress of our sub-strategy to win in infrastructure. In China, we're seeing traction on our new Gen3 connected elevators reaffirming our investment in the innovation that Otis ONE provides to our customers and passengers. Just a few months after officially launching our Gen3 elevator, we secured our first repeat customer in China for the new platform. Jilin Longcheng property developer Company ordered an additional 123 Gen3 elevator systems for four more commercial and residential projects in Northeast China. We're also making progress on deploying our Gen360 connected elevator platform in EMEA. In the first few months after launch, we received several Gen360 awards, adding more than 50% to the pilot phase volumes. Moving to Service. In the quarter, we grew our industry-leading maintenance portfolio by 3%, a goal we set for ourselves entering the year and grew organic service sales for the third consecutive quarter. In the Americas, Otis was selected to continue a 35-year partnership with One Commerce Square in downtown Philadelphia. Otis installed the building's original elevators in the 1980s and has been maintaining the units since then. Otis will now modernize the building's elevators, including the introduction of our Compass 360 destination dispatching system. On portfolio modernization awards are a testament to Otis service excellence and long-standing customer relationships. This strong year-to-date Company performance and robust cash flow generation in excess of 140% of net income enabled us to complete $725 million in share repurchases. In September, we announced the tender offer for the remaining interest in Zardoya Otis, a premier elevator business in Spain, Portugal, and Morocco with a strong service presence. The transaction will simplify our corporate structure and operations while optimizing alignment of assets and debt financing in Europe. We expect this transaction to be mid-single-digit percentage accretive in 2023. In parallel with the strong financial performance, we made additional progress on our ESG initiatives, focusing on sustainability has always been an integral part of our operations culture. And achieving ISO 14001 certification for all of our factories is an important part of our existing efforts. We're pleased that this quarter we achieved this goal years ahead of schedule, adding our factories in Korea, and Florence, South Carolina. We're proud to see several programs recognize that these two factories, including power consumption reduction programs, robust package recycling processes, and lubricant leakage prevention measures. In addition, in Florence, we launched a pilot for 0 waste-to-landfill program that will scale to other manufacturing sites next year as we work towards our goal of having all factories eligible for 0 waste-to-landfill certification by 2025. We also made progress on our social initiatives, launching the second year of our made-to-move communities signature CSR program. Participating colleagues will guide 200 student participants from 20 schools across 12 countries and territories to develop creative mobility solutions, while also helping to close the stem skills gap. This year, we aim to make a difference by helping communities adapt and leverage better design and newer technologies to address the mobility, health, and safety concerns of older populations. We look forward to sharing these solutions and highlight the program with you during our Lift Our Communities month in April of next year. Now, turning to Slide 4. Q3 results in 2021 outlook. New Equipment orders were up 3.8% in Q3 and up 10.3% on a rolling 12-month basis. Organic sales were up 8.1% in the third quarter, with 14.1% organic growth in the New Equipment segment and 3.6% organic growth in the Service segment. Adjusted operating profit was up $63 million and margin expanded 20 basis points, despite a 50-basis point impact from segment mix as the new equipment business grew faster than the service business. Year-to-date, we generated robust free cash flow of $1.4 billion or 141% conversion of GAAP net income. This positive momentum and our progress on our long-term strategy gives us the confidence to improve our 2021 outlook and positions us well to build upon this strong performance in 2022. We now expect sales for the year to be approximately $14.3 billion, up 11.8% to 12.3% versus the prior year, and up 8.5% to 9% organically. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be in the range of $2.18 billion to $2.19 billion, up $260 to $270 million at actual currency, and up a $195 million to $205 million at constant currency. We're improving adjusted EPS from the prior outlook by $0.04 at the midpoint and $0.06 from the low-end and now expect it to be approximately $2.95, a 17% increase versus the prior year. Lastly, we're improving our free cash flow outlook to approximately $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion with a 125% conversion of GAAP net income. With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our Q3 results and 2021 outlook in more detail. Sure. Good morning, Nigel. Good to hear from you. So let me try to put China into context and we hope that chart was helpful. As we entered this year, we were expecting mid-single-digit growth in China. We have actually seen stronger growth year-to-date and the segment itself, we believe will end the year at high single digits. Through the first nine months, all sectors in China have been strong, residential, commercial, and infrastructure we've seen increased activity in Tier 1 and 2 cities, as well as in infrastructure and with our key accounts. The third quarter segment, we believe grew mid-single-digit and we anticipate and have planned for the fourth quarter to be down correspondingly mid-single-digit. So, if we go back to '20, we thought it was going to be mid-single-digit growth. We've seen that. '21, we've seen high single-digit growth. We're still seeing healthy demand. This is the sixth quarter in a row that we've had New Equipment growth in China. But we're trying to be prudent for 2022 and we've actually planned for a flattish market there, and we're going to control what we can and what we know how to control. There's clearly heightened possibilities. There could be declines next year given the macro environment in the property sector. But we believe that the strategy we've put in place and the initiatives we've put for sales coverage, for share gain, and for price are really all paying off. We've added agents and distributors, so now we're at 2,300. We've added another 150 A&Ds in the third quarter. As Rahul shared in his opening comments, our portfolio growth is in the high teens, so our service strategy is paying off with more coverage and more service depots and our proposal volume was up significantly this quarter. So, again, we're being prudent. We're watching what's going on, but we have put in place price increases. Those will yield in '22. They won't yield quicker than that because of our long-cycle business, but we're managing that as well. And I just will call your attention to that chart in the appendix and just put that as well in the context. We did tens of millions of dollars of revenue across approximately 10 customers that had breached either the two or three red lines with their liquidity issues. And we share that those 10 customers are less than 3% of our China sales through the third quarter and less than 1% of Otis sales through the third quarter. And - but we've been mitigating this since the three red line policy has come into play. And for any of these customers that cross these red lines, we've moved to cash - advanced cash basis. So, we're working this on an account-by-account basis. We do not believe, and we've shared that the exposure is not large and we're going to continue to managing this effectively and executing our strategy. Let me start with the steel and rural, please add. We are not seeing delays due to steel. Obviously, steel, and again, it's in our new equipment business, about $300 million a year of commodities that we purchased. We've been able to purchase it, but obviously with the steel prices, it fairly escalated prices. And Rahul shared, we've increased $80 million to $90 million. Our impact on commodities this year -- primarily driven by our volumes being up versus what we shared with you in July. So steel is not causing delays. We're not seeing significant delays on jobsites in terms of labor. We're all watching installation subcontract labor, especially in Europe, but in terms of Otis labor, we have not had any delays in any of our job sites, and we've put plans in place. Our supply chain team has been dealing with this extremely effectively now for almost two years, whether it's semiconductors, ocean freight, we have not had delays in delivering to job sites from our New Equipment. Some of that's the benefit of our factories being local and our supply chains being local with global agreements. But we have done everything from spot buys and redesigning some of our chip sets from an engineering perspective to use more common chips to make sure there was no impact to our customers. So, we've not seen that but Rahul, I'll let you add. Good morning, Jeff. Hey, listen, Jeff, we're seeing strong competition I think across the board, and we're seeing varying levels of price increase, and we have rolled out. We shared with you in our second quarter earnings that we had rolled out some limited price increases early in the year, and then we went right after our second quarter earnings call ended, global price increases at varying levels to understand and see what we could get in the market because we have, obviously, cost increases in terms of inflationary labor costs as well as input costs and commodities. We all hit it right on. And the only thing I would tell you is we are seeing some headwinds on pricing, but we're up -- our New Equipment margins are up a 150 basis points year-to-date. So, we're able to as -- we've always said, try to get it with price, but we understand the lag time, increase our installation efficiency, which we did very well in the third quarter globally, as well as continue to control what we can in terms of productivity in our factories, material productivity and every lever we have. So, it's going to be competitive, it's going to continue to be, but the end markets are growing across the globe. So strong demand and we're going to continue to try and get price everywhere we can. Hey, Jeff, let me just add one or two other things. As we said, our share gain on new equipment shares for the quarter and for the year so far is 150 basis points. It's at least that in China including in the third quarter. So, we're -- our strategy really is working there. Second, we've already been approached by people other than these developers in local governments to finish some job sites on an advanced cash basis. So, we believe the work in progress is going to continue even with the developers that are experiencing 2 or 3 red lines. And so, we're -- but again, we're being prudent. We're planning for a flattish '22, and we're going to continue to execute our strategies to gain share in that flattish '22. Yeah, Julian, we've really pivoted to grow off our service productivity, process changes, technology changes to really, we've always believed there was opportunity on installation. And that's where we've been focused again, especially with trying to overcome, but the backlog margin and the commodity pressures in new equipment. And that's what you're seeing come through. Let me talk to the Americans first. If you look at our guide, first of all, we've seen a faster sustained recovery in the Americas. Whether you go back to the GFC or 12 years ago, Julian, it's at the end of the GFC which is really when we felt it more in the Americas and our guide has us going up mid-teens from the low teens. We've got a strong backlog execution, and year-to-date in the Americas. If you take out the lumpiness and just go year-to-date, we're at 13.3% growth in the Americas and a 12-month roll of a healthy number as well. So, we see the America is doing -- coming back strong. The Dodge Momentum Index was up 164.9 and the Architecture Billings Index was at 56.6. So, the indices are trending the right way and we're doing well. Again, it's -- and no one quarter makes an orders book. We don't control all the timing on those orders, but year-to-date, the Americas has done tremendously incredible second quarter, and now again, in the third quarter. EMEA 6.3% year-to-date down a little in the third quarter, but that's kind of timing and we think we'll see both of those nicely accelerate in Q4. And that's important for us. We want to end the year with higher than the 1% backlog we're sitting at today and our entire team understands that. We believe we can do that in the Americas because their awards are up as Rahul said in his opening remarks and that is a leading indicator where we've got the awards already and we've got the LOIs and now we have to move it to a booking and get everything finished but we expect a strong fourth quarter and plan to end the year with a backlog that all -- of 2 plus percent hopefully closer to 3, we'll have to see where that comes out so that we start '22 strong. Yeah. And we're going to be past our mid-term guidance we gave at Investor Day in terms of cash flow for the second year. That's operation al. Yeah. I'll just make it simple because of the time. I mean, first, Cai, this is going to simplify our corporate structure. It allow us to eliminate the only remaining listed subsidiary we have and will save the public Company costs that go with that as well. But it really will allow us to streamline our operations in Europe, which gives us the launching point in the future for some strategic growth opportunities. It's a great service portfolio, we have three factories there. We love this business and we think it just -- yes, we control it, which is why we're not worried about any implementation risks because we have operational control right now. But as we think about some future strategic growth opportunities across the continent, this is going to give us just that full capability to optimize everything from our talent to our operations in our facilities. Good morning, John. Yeah, that's a great question, John. And we have escalation capabilities in our service contracts in most of Europe and the Americas that are primarily index to labor and most of those tend to renew the majority in the first quarter of the year. So we believe that will be to our benefit. Those clauses are resident in those contracts and have been there for many, many years. We just haven't been able to exercise them. So we will certainly try to flow through service price increases and we'll see what the market will bear there. But we have the ability to do that. And the majority of them are indexed to labor. But there's some small portion that are indexed to material or commodities. Again, we haven't had that opportunity. It is a customer negotiation point, but we think that will at least start off '22 stronger in terms of service pricing. Yeah. We've seen really good year-to-date snap back on repair, John, and we expect that to continue in fourth quarter and into next year, globally. And then, if we can get some of these maintenance escalators, but Service pricing has been held up really strong. Yeah. We'll share more, obviously, as we give guidance in '22. But our China team has taken on the challenge to grow share and grow portfolio and they've done both robustly this year. And we've lived through declining markets, you go back to '15, to '18; we were first to emerge really 18, '19 and enter drive price increases there even when others didn't want to follow. And now we've really, I think, proven share gain for 2 straight years and again, 6 consecutive quarter of new equipment growth while we're getting that share gain and driving profitability. So whether it's flat or up, we intend to gain share. So we have been -- the three red lines came into effect, if I get the month right, August of '20, but certainly sometime during the 23rd quarter. And we've been we've been monitoring this closely and if we have clients who are not going to go to this cash payment, then we've stopped taking orders from them to be candid. We're managing it effectively. And what we think is prudently in a risk mitigation perspective so that we don't get out ahead of their liquidity issues or become the holder of their liquidity issues. So they understand it. We've been very upfront with them. Again, we go account by account. That's why you have these relationships and we have these open discussions. Thanks, Miguel. And that's obviously what drives profitability. We guided an Investor Day, and after that, actually that we expect that to continue to go down and to get to about 26.5% at really, that's what we're expecting over the mid-term. Really, 2 strong years in a row, Nick, we have brought it down to about 30.4 last year from over 34 in our first year. And then another as we said, a 180 basis points this year to get us to the midpoint between [Indiscernible] and 29. So really good focus and it's now what we have to do is operationalize a lot of it. But we know the path, we know that trajectory, and we're going to continue down that path to get us closer to that 26.5. [Indiscernible] And MOD Joel, we think it really is demand delay versus disruption, versus elimination actually or destruction. The challenge on MOD is it is somewhat more bespoke. The new equipment and custom. And that at least, in the Americas, has created a little bit of a supply chain challenge for us. So we were dealing with it. I think we've appropriately tempered the fourth quarter to the low end of the set service guidance for that reason but we don't see this or the EMEA demand or the Asia-Pacific demand going away by any point. Modernization is going to continue to grow and we know, what we need to do. If you look all in year-to-date, our orders were up 4.3% and our sales were up 2.7%. So we think the fourth quarter reflects that kind of knowledge as well as what we're experiencing and '22 should be stronger. Yes. Thanks, Michelle. This solid year-to-date performance, positive momentum, and our ability to execute on our long-term strategy gives us confidence. We'll deliver a strong close to 2021 with high single-digit Organic sales growth, $260 to $270 million in operating profit growth and high teens EPS growth. While the external environment remains fluid, I'm confident the investments we've made over the last few years and our progress as an independent Company have set a new path and will position us well for 2022. As always, we remain focused on driving value for our customers, our colleagues, our communities, and our shareholders. Thank you for joining us today and stay safe and well."

            "name": "Rahul Ghai",
            "content": "Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with third quarter results on Slide 5, Net sales grew 10.8% to $3.6 billion as the strong growth momentum continued in new equipment and service grew for the third consecutive quarter. Adjusted operating profit was up 12.5% or $63 million and up $52 million at constant currency, primarily from the benefit of higher volume in both segments. Installation productivity initiatives in new equipment and favorable service pricing, and productivity helps to offset the headwinds from commodity inflation and the absence of temporary cost actions taken last year to alleviate the impact from COVID-19. We maintained the focus on cost containment while continuing to invest in the business. Adjusted SG&A was down 70 basis points as a percentage of sales, despite the step-up in public Company expenses. R&D and other strategic investments were up slightly versus prior year and were about flat as a percentage of sales. This strong focus on execution resulted in 20 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter and 70 basis points of margin expansion at constant segment mix. Third quarter adjusted EPS was up 11.6% or $0.08. Driven by $0.11 of operating profit growth, partially offset by $0.04 from a higher adjusted tax rate due to the absence of a cumulative year-to-date tax benefit in the third quarter of 2020. On a year-to-date basis, the adjusted tax rate is down by a 180 basis points. Moving to Slide 6, new equipment orders were up 3.8% at constant currency. Otis' momentum remains strong in Asia, up mid-teens, including sixth consecutive quarter of growth in China. As expected, after 47% growth in the second quarter, orders declined year-over-year in the Americas, primarily due to timing as awards which proceed order bookings in North America were up approximately 24% versus the prior year. EMEA was down 1.8% from the timing of major project orders. Proposal volumes in the quarter also continued to show signs of strong demand globally, up double-digits. Total Company backlog increased 4% and 1% at constant currency from strong growth in China. Pricing on new orders declined by over 1 point and backlog margin was down about a point versus prior year. Both pricing on new orders and backlog margin with about flat sequentially. Year-to-date, new equipment orders were up 15%, including 13% growth in the Americas, mid-single-digit growth in the EMEA, and approximately 20% growth in Asia. Organic sales were up 14.1% with growth in all regions. Americas was up mid-teens, driven by strong backlog execution as the business surpassed pre - COVID levels. EMEA was up low single digits and Asia grew high teens driven by China where organic sales were up double digits. New equipment adjusted operating profit was up $33 million from higher volume. Pricing was marginally unfavorable in the quarter and higher commodity prices were a headwind of $35 million. But we more than mitigated these impacts through strong installation execution, including favorable project closeouts, leading to 80 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. Service segment results on slide 7, maintains portfolio units were up 3% versus the prior year with global improvements in retention, recapture, and conversion rates. The number of units increased in all regions, and China was up high-teens accelerating from the mid-teen's growth in the second quarter. There was pressure on modernization demand in the third quarter, and modernization orders were down 4.1% at constant currency as growth in EMEA and Asia was offset by decline in the Americas, primarily driven by timing of orders as the market is recovering strongly in 2021. Overall, modernization backlog was up 2% at constant currency. Service organic sales were up 3.6% with growth for the third consecutive quarter as the business continues to recover from the impact of COVID. Maintenance and repair grew 4.7%, with strong recovery in repair and low single-digit growth in contractual maintenance sales. Modernization sales were down 1.2% as growth in Europe and China was more than offset a decline in Asia Pacific from lingering COVID-related [Indiscernible] and in the Americas from supply chain shortages. Adjusted operating profit grew $27 million as higher volume, productivity initiatives, and improved pricing and mix more than offset the absence of favorability from COVID-related cost containment actions. taken in the prior year. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded for the seventh consecutive quarter and was up 30 basis points. Overall year-to-date results reflect solid performance with approximately 1.5 points of new equipment share gain, our best portfolio growth in the last decade, 11% organic sales growth, and $261 million of adjusted operating profit growth, with margin expansion in both segments. We also generated close to $1.4 billion in free cash flow, enabling us to complete $725 million in share repurchases, raised dividends earlier this year, continue with [Indiscernible] acquisitions and announced a tender offer for the remaining stay in Zardoya Otis. Looking forward for the balance of the year on Slide 8. We feel confident about strong growth across all key metrics for the year. We now expect organic sales to be up 8.5% to 9%, up 1 point from the prior outlook with improvement in new equipment segment. We now expect operating profit to grow between $260 to $270 million, up $15 million from prior outlook at the midpoint with sales growth, operating profit growth, and margin expansion in both segments. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be approximately $2.95, $0.04 higher than prior outlook at the midpoint, and up 17% versus the prior year. The year-over-year EPS increase is driven a strong operating profit growth, a reduction in the adjusted tax rate, and a reduced share count. The adjusted tax rate is now expected to be in a range of 28.5% to 29%, more than a 150 - basis point reduction versus the prior year and a 25-basis point improvement from the prior outlook at the midpoint. Following strong year-to-date cash generation from net income growth and over $300 million reduction in working capital from the end of last year, we now expect free cash flow for the year to be between $1.5 to $1.55 billion. This is up $50 million from the prior outlook from improved net income and reduced working capital. Seeking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9. New equipment is now projected to be up 15% to 15.5% driven by accelerated backlog conversion and a 15% year-to-date orders growth. This is an increase of more than 250 basis points from the prior outlook and over 11 improvements from our expectations at the beginning of the year. This broad-based improvement in expectations is supported by robust market growth in all regions, strong year-to-date performance, and continued backlog growth. Americas is now up high-teens -- sorry, up mid-teens, EMEA up high-single-digits, and Asia up high-teens driven by China. In service, we are adjusting our outlook to approximately 4% growth. The lower end of the prior range, reflecting slower-than-expected recovery on modernization in the second half of the year. Modernization is now expected to be up approximately 4% for the year from up mid-single-digit previously driven by COVID related jobsite restrictions in Asia-Pacific, slower decision making in EMEA, and some part shortages in the Americas. Despite the resurgence of COVID in Asia-Pacific, there is no change to the maintenance and repair outlook that is still expected to be up approximately 4% for the year, driven by continued maintenance portfolio growth and recovery in discretionary repair. Overall, the organic sales growth outlook of 8.5% to 9% reflects a strong year-to-date performance and good momentum. Positioning us well to deliver growth across all regions and all lines of business while building backlog to support continued growth in 2022. Switching to operating profit on Slide 10, we now expect operating profit to be up between 260 to $270 million or so of the prior year with margin expansion of 20 basis points. At constant currency, operating profit is expected to be up between a $195 to $205 million. This represents an improvement of $15 million versus the prior outlook from the impact of updated volume expectations in both segments and actions taken to reduce the corporate expenses. FX tailwind is now expected to be approximately $65 million from $70 million that you were expecting previously, primarily due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, impacting the profit growth in the service business. The year-over-year growth in operating profit reflects the benefits of higher volume, service productivity initiatives, favorable service pricing, and strong installation execution. It is partially offset by unfavorable new equipment price mix, headwind from the absence of prior year cost containment actions related to COVID-19, and higher commodity prices. The headwind from commodities is now expected to be between $80 to $90 million for the year. At the higher end of what we communicated in July, driven partially by higher new equipment volume in the year. The broader price increases announced last quarter have been rolled out and will help to alleviate the impact on higher commodity prices in 2022. Overall, this strong outlook puts us more than $1 billion ahead of our 2019 reported revenue, with a 100 basis points of margin expansion. 2021 sales, earnings, and margin in both segments are expected to be higher than 2019. And adjusted EPS is expected to be up more than 30% versus 2019, reflecting broad-based improvement in performance driven by our ability to execute implementation of the long-term strategy and the benefits of a solid end-market recovery. And with that, I'll request Michelle to please open the line for questions. No. The only place and I'm sure we'll get there during the call, Nigel, is on modernization. It does impact our revenue because as Judy said, on new equipment, we can manage the shortages wherever we see them because we can have multiple shipments for the job site. Elevator doesn't go in one box, or as a completed unit. We actually assemble the elevator as you guys know, on the job site. So, it goes in a couple of dozen crates, right? So whatever parts are short, we can ship them later. But on modernization jobs, it's a little bit harder, because they're shorter in duration. So, on modernization, we've seen some impact from raw material shortages, and there's a little bit of a construction delay. It's not -- as Judy said, we are not experiencing delays from our factories, we can manage that, but there's a little bit of a construction slowdown for other shortages and that's impacting some revenue on the new equipment side, especially here in the U.S. But other than that, I think we are okay, overall. Thanks, Nigel. Yes. Let me start with the pricing and I'll hand it to Judy to add some color on the competitive dynamics here. So overall, I think the numbers you quoted, Jeff, are exactly right. Pricing out -- overall pricing was down maybe slightly more than a point in Q3 here and was consistent with the booked margins in Q2. And on a regional basis, EMEA was better year-over-year, and pricing trends in both Asia-Pacific and China were largely consistent with first half. And America 's pricing was slightly worse than first half and it's more the mix of customers as where we saw the pressure. The distribution was a smaller share of orders and that comes at a little bit better pricing. But pricing in Americas in the volume business was consistent with first half. So, you put all that in context. The fact that the pricing trends, basically what we saw in first half, is continuing into Q3. So, no sequential change from the first half into Q3. And the price increases that we put in place, we've rolled them out pretty much across the board at this point. And where you will see that impact is those quotes have not yet converted to orders, which is fairly typical because that's the cycle from quotation to orders. And they'll probably start up maybe showing up in late Q4 or early Q1. And the benefit of that, as Judy said in response to Nigel's question, will probably show up in 2022. Let me pause there, see -- and Judy, if you want to add something on competitive dynamics. Yes. So, Jeff, what [Indiscernible] here is [Indiscernible] I think I've said in my prepared remarks, our proposal volume was up very strongly across-the-board and it was very, very strong in China. Our proposal volume was up close to 40% in China. I think that goes back to what Judy said earlier, it's driven by all the things that we have done. Our increase in our channel partners, increase in our sales force. Our sales force is up by more than 10% in relation to the growth in the channel partners, so we have invested a ton to increase our reach in China which is up close to 10 points as well. So, all the things that we are doing is driving incremental activity on our side. But if you step back and even look at the market overall, if you look at the flow space under construction, is up 8% year-to-date and 10+% over 2019, the real estate investment is up 9% year-over-year so -- and historically, there has been a very, very strong correlation between these two metrics and the EBITDA growth. But the reality is, the situation is fluid today. And after a very strong start, the first half, the stocks have slowed down in the last couple of months. So, we're watching it very, very carefully. But again, I think if you want to grow the overall economy next year, even if you say that the Chinese government doesn't set a target of 6, but it set a target of 5. With 30% off the GDP coming from the property market, it will be hard for them to achieve 5% to 6% growth next year with the property market being down. So, this is where I think, going back to what Judy said earlier, we expect the market to be more stable for next year. But again, we'll keep watching it and keep doing what we can control, which is driving incremental effort on our side, and the healthy proposal activity is a good sign for us to come. No. I think, Judy, you're exactly right. The numbers you quoted exact rate backlog margin was down about a point and last quarter we did say 0.5 point, so you are exactly right. So, it got slightly worse. And again, I think going back to what we said earlier, what you will see is that the pricing that we have put out in the market, that should start showing up in late Q4 or early Q1 and that is where you'll see starts getting improvement in both our books margin and backlog margin. So that is when we expect the trends to turn, but in the meanwhile, going back to our earlier response, we are just continuing to execute really well on the installation side. And that is what's driving our increase in year-to-date margin. So that is offsetting both the pricing pressure and the commodity headwinds. I mean, despite both those headwinds between incremental volumes that drives higher absorption and the installation execution, which we've said was always our priority between those two things. That's what's helping us continue to grow our new equipment margin. And if you look at even the full-year guide, last quarter we said maybe it's 90. In this quarter, it's up 90 basis points for the year, margin expansion. And this guide we think we can get to between 90 basis points to 100 basis points. So, despite everything, we are actually improving our margin outlook on the new equipment segment for the year. It's an interesting question, Patrick. Again, it's hard to draw a direct correlation between any of these metrics into an exact elevated market because it depends on what's going on in the market, how many buildings under construction; we're obviously declining. And the floor stars have been down just Last couple of months after a very, very strong first half. So, it's been -- you've seen them in the last couple of months, but again, the first half was very strong. So that is very few come back and if you look at the other metrics, which I won't repeat because you've gone through those, like the construction and the real estate investment. And historically, they've had a pretty high correlation with the elevated market. So that is where we saw the market is going to be more flattish for next year and keep in mind that that level is at more than 600,000 units and comes after two very strong years of growth, high-single digits this year and mid-single-digits last year. So, we think that the market stabilizes at this level, that's a very healthy demand for the market and driven by all this health hope initiative that we're driving gives us an opportunity to continue to drive gains in our China business. For sure. Yes. Well, we haven't -- we typically do not report that way, Patrick, but let me see what we can do here on the call. So, if you take our China business and our year-to-date sales of $2.1 billion, so that's our revenue for China year-to-date. Now, it's typically 80-20; 80% new equipment and 20% service. And the service businesses are accelerating very, very nicely as well driven by the portfolio growth that we've been talking about. And what we've said historically, is that because China is one of our more profitable new equipment businesses. In fact, the most profitable of all regions in terms of how we report. And on the service side, it is the least profitable of our regions. And then you put the mix on top of it, so that the mix -- the new equipment service mix also works against the overall growth in China. So that's where we'll take put all that together, the China profit abilities maybe overall lower than where Otis reports. So that's kind of where we are. And then obviously, the JV shares, we've got two JVs in China. And we've not disclosed our ownership, but obviously, at some kind of between 50% to 100%. So it's in somebody in there, but you're right. I mean, obviously, the profit that we earn in China gets shared with our JV partners. Patrick, I just want to stay away from that on the call. I think that's -- we report via segments. I think I've provided enough color here, and I think you guys can -- you're more, than smart for all of you guys you do the math and we will leave it there. Thank you. Thanks, Patrick. Morning, Cai. So first, Cai, really great year on cash. I mean, if you think about the working capital reduction that we've been able to drive, we've had occurred consecutive quarter of negative working capital. It's down, as I said in my prepared remarks, more than $300 million from where we ended the year. So very, very strong performance on cash. Now, the two things that -- I would say, three things that work as you go from sequentially from 3Q to 4Q. The first is that there is historically a buildup of working capital between third quarter and fourth quarter. So if you look at the last couple of years where the cash flow is available, you will see an increase in working capital from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So that's one driver. The second is based on the guide that you provided. There's lower net income in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. So that's the second piece. And we still have that tax payment in one of the European countries that we've alluded to before. That's a long-standing tax matter that predates spin, that we still need to make in the fourth quarter here, and that we've cited previously between -- at tens of millions of dollars. So those are kind of the three big levels, I would say as you go from third quarter to fourth quarter cash flow. That is why fourth quarter cash flow is less, but still $50 million higher than where we were three months ago and it's driven by improvement in net income and better working capital performance and a very healthy number for the year. I think it's close to 125%. Well, let me talk about the financial and -- -- Yeah. Then I'll hand it over to Judy to talk about the operational opportunities that we have. So from a financial standpoint, Cai, it's very, very straightforward. I mean, you look at our -- and I think we said that in our press release of our $80 million of net cash outflow that we made to our JV partners there, both minority and the family. The small individual share-owners and institutional share-owners, and the family combined. So that's about 80 million out. So that, obviously, that's something that we don't have to make once we have full control ownership of Zardoya. And then we will borrow, as you said, our intention is to borrow in Europe. So we'll do the borrowing in Europe. And so that is where you net the two out. We expect mid-single-digit percentage accretion in 2023. Now, in 2022, it's going to be less than that, because the fact is it's going to take us a few months here. We just filed a prospectus, it's going to take 3 to 4 months for that filing to get improved then we launch the tender, then there is a divesting period and it may take us time to ramp up to the full ownership. So there's going to be a staggered increase in our ownership and that is where I think we said in the press release, we expect maybe 0.04 to $0.05 of accretion in 2022, just given the timing of the close and the timing of acquisition of shares. So those two things that get us to, I think we said $0.04 to $0.06 in the press release. So somewhere in that range for '22 and then mid-single-digit percentage accretion in 2023. Hopefully that answers the question, Cai. And then I'll -- maybe Judy, you want to talk about [Indiscernible]. Thanks, Cai. Yeah, and on new equipment, again, I think we've said that before; we expect some commodity headwinds next year, John, on the new equipment side we do given where the commodity prices were in the first half of this year we expect first half of next year to be in the same range as where we were in the second half of this year, so call it $30 to $35 million a quarter. So maybe 70 million for the first half and then beyond that, if you look at the commodity forwards today, they start going the other way starting May, June of 2022, and we start -- Right now, the forwards would project that there will be deals in the second half of next year, but it's too early to call that. But again, go back to our pieces is going to be that for next year, we can continue driving earnings expansion in both segments, new equipment coming from higher volume, given where Judy said that are planned to ending the backlog, it have that low-single-digit growth range. So we will continue to drive revenue growth in the new equipment segment with incremental home-health from pricing that we've already put in place and our continued execution installation. We think we can use all that to offset any commodity headwinds in the first half and drive earnings expansion. And on service, I think our pricing should be a tailwind for next year, given where prices are. And the volume should accelerate to more mid-single-digit growth, which is what we expect. Yeah. So our sales force, I mean, obviously it's pretty broad-based, Miguel, and it's both in Tier 1 and Tier 2 [Indiscernible] and that it is something we've done so that as we are adding more channel partners, we need our sales force to support the channel partners that we are hiring and gain our fair share of wallet from those agents and distributors. So that is where our incremental sales force is going, and it's split between both New Equipment and Service because that's what we need to do to drive our Service portfolio growth. And in terms of our overall make, I think we are -- we do fairly well in every segment, both residential, commercial infrastructures so we have a fairly strong presence across all verticals. Now, obviously, it depends on where the market is and we been focused a lot more on the infrastructure recently, and that is where -- if you look back at what we shared on our Investor day, that is where we've gained a few points of share. So we continue do well across all segments and I think our share base -- share gain is fairly broad-based. So our productivity gain is coming from both segments. Nick, it's coming from new equipment. We spoke about the material productivity, starting right when we did the first Investor Day. We've been talking about it. That's a key driver for us so we continue to push really, really hard on that. Innovation, we've been driving installation efficiency so that means the better project closeouts and ending the project at a higher margin than what we booked at. And that includes both using fewer hours to install the product and taking costs out of the material because not the entire material cost comes from the factory. There is an incremental material procurement that happens in the field. So we've been spending a lot of time and effort to understand where the supply basis and how we can take costs out of that. So that has been the major push share and that is where you're seeing. And again, we had an early stages of that. We just started it. We saw good results in Q2. We saw good results in Q3. So we're in early stages of that and we need that installation efficiency to continue to get better as we get into '22. So that will be a push for us. And on service productivity, which again has been a tailwind for us despite [Indiscernible] maintenance hours and all the COVID -related headwinds that we're absorbing, our Q3 hours are still down year-over-year to maintain an elevator. So that comes from pushed that we have on Otis ONE and some of the other productivity things that we're doing. So that is what is driving our service productivity, which continues to be -- which continued to be strong in Q2. So the 3% represents our sales to these customers, both direct and indirect. Yes, so that's a total exposure to these customers. I think your question, Joel, is right if -- and I think it goes to a broader contagion issue, which obviously is not represented on this chart. And again, that goes back in [Indiscernible] discussion that [Indiscernible] Joel that you've had on this call around our expectations for the China market. So not to rehash all of that but we do expect that this is going to be -- we do expect the China elevator in [Indiscernible] market to be more flattish next year. So that's our current expectation. And but this 3% is our total exposure to these customers. [Indiscernible]"

Presentation materials are available for download from Otis website, at www.otis.com. I will now turn the call over to Michael Rednor, Senior Director of Investor Relations.\nMichael Rednor: Thank you, Angie,. Welcome to Otis\u2019 Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today, are Judy Marks, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Rahul Ghai, Executive Vice -President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the Company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and significant non-recurring items. The Company will also refer to adjusted results where adjustments were made as though Otis was a standalone Company in the current period and prior year. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis\u2019 SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy.\nJudith Marks: Thank you, Mike, and thank you everyone for joining us. We hope that everyone listening is safe and well. Before we get into the quarter, I'd like to congratulate Mike on his new role, leading Investor Relations, and thanks Stacy for all the great work getting us to this point. We look forward to seeing you both excel in your new positions. Otis delivered an excellent second quarter closing out a strong first half. This included mid-teens organic sales growth, demonstrating the resiliency of our colleagues and business, and our ability to execute on our long-term strategy. Overall, demand in the New Equipment segment was strong. We gained about 1 point of New Equipment share with orders up approximately 24%, in a market that was up low-teens. New Equipment orders grew in all regions and were particularly strong in the Americas, up nearly 50%, with an over four times increase in major project bookings versus the prior year. These orders will support customer projects throughout North America. For example, in Canada, Otis secured an order to outfit a luxury high-rise condominium building in the M City community with several elevators, including custom cab interiors that fit the buildings\u2019 upscale design.  Moving to service, we grew sales in all lines of business, including repair and modernization. Modernization demand was strong with orders up mid-teens versus the prior year. This includes another Otis partnership with Silverstein Properties in the Americas, where we will modernize more than 40 elevators in the U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles and integrate Compass 360 and Otis\u2019 eCall app to allow for more seamless customer and tenant access to the building services. The demonstrated strength of the Maintenance business continues, and we achieved 3% growth year-over-year on our industry-leading service portfolio, a key goal we set for ourselves entering this year. We drove profit growth and margin expansion in both segments, largely from the benefit of higher volume as New Equipment and service organic sales grew about 25% and 8% respectively. Since spin, our consistent performance reflects the power of our strategy and its implementation. I hope many of you were able to join us for, \"Welcome To Tomorrow,\" where we shared our Gen3 and Gen360 highly innovative platforms that meet the current and future needs of our customers in an increasingly connected world. Gen3 builds upon the proven flat belt technology of Otis\u2019 best selling Gen2 platform, while adding built-in Otis ONE IoT connectivity and a variety of options such as eCall, eView, Compass dispatching systems, health solutions, and updated aesthetics. APIs allow us to access and leverage data with analytics that drive value for our customers. Upon release, Otis secured an order for more than 100 Gen3 elevators for a new residential project in the Jilin Province in Northeast China. In EMEA, after successful pilots in several countries, Otis officially launched Gen360, a next-generation, digitally native platform that includes all the features of the Gen3 elevator, built around an all-new electronic architecture in a more compact design. Gen360 is enabled with IoT capabilities and online tools; a connected passenger experience, and additional safety features to help limit entrapments and enable maintenance from inside the elevator cab. In France, Otis was selected to outfit a future aquatic center in the Paris suburbs, with the Gen 360 ecosystem. In addition to its many digital, safety and passenger benefits, this platform has a decisive advantage. For the first time, we can eliminate the need to accommodate hoistway projection onto the roof, avoiding interfering with the building's architectural lines, a feature desirable to architects and building owners. All of this strong first half performance, including robust free cash flow generation in excess of 150% of net income enables us to return additional cash to shareholders. In the second quarter, we completed the previously planned $0.5 billion in share repurchases ahead of schedule and are now in a position to increase our 2021 target to $750 million. In parallel with a strong financial performance, we continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives that are integral to bringing our vision to life. In May, we released additional long-term ESG goals aligning with our four ESG commitments: health and safety, people and communities, environment and impact, and governance and accountability. During the quarter, we made progress on our goal to meet ISO 14001 certification standards in all of our factories. Otis\u2019 manufacturing facility in Brazil became the latest to achieve this certification, meaning nearly 90% of our factories are now ISO 14001 certified. This is part of our ongoing work to operate more sustainably. Initiatives in the factory include implementation of rainwater and water reuse systems, LED lighting to reduce energy consumption by more than two-thirds, and improvements to shipping and packaging materials to reduce waste by approximately 800 tons annually. In Paris, we introduced electric vehicles into our fleet and we'll be expanding this pilot over the coming months. Early feedback from our field professionals has been positive and the program will continue to contribute to our CO2 emission reduction targets. Moving to Social. One year ago, in response to the urgent problems of social unrest and entrenched racism, we announced our commitment to change, a framework to ensure all colleagues feel safe, welcome, and heard. While there's still work to be done, I'm proud of the progress we've made on this initiative over the past year. Actions taken include engaging all supervisors worldwide in a training program designed to help them mitigate unconscious bias, increasing access to employee assistance and wellness programs globally, launching our Made to Move Communities signature STEM education program, and awarding not-for-profit grants to communities in each region that support diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. And in June, we began our second annual Season of Safety, reinforcing Otis' strong safety culture, recommitting to our life-saving cardinal rules and prioritizing ongoing training on safety procedures and protocols. We remain committed to a zero-harm workplace. Now, turning to Slide 4, second quarter results and 2021 outlook. In addition to record new equipment bookings in the second quarter, total Otis orders were up 9.4% on a rolling 12-month basis. Organic sales were up 15.4% in the second quarter with 25.4% organic growth in the New Equipment segment and 7.8% organic growth in the Service segment. Adjusted operating profit was up $115 million and margin expanded 40 basis points despite a 60 basis point impact from segment mix, as the New Equipment business grew faster than the higher-margin Service business. Free cash flow was robust at $493 million, with 151% conversion of GAAP net income. This positive momentum, our continued progress on our long-term strategy, and the pace of recovery in our end markets gives us confidence to improve our 2021 outlook across all key metrics. We now expect sales to be in a range of $14.1 billion to $14.2 billion, up 10.5% to 11% versus the prior year, and up 7.5% to 8% organically. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be in a range of $2.16 billion to $2.18 billion, up $240 million to $260 million at actual currency, and up $170 million to $190 million at constant currency. We're improving adjusted EPS by $0.10 at the midpoint versus the prior outlook and now expect it to be in a range of $2.89 to $2.93, a 15% to 16% increase versus the prior year. Lastly, we're improving our free cash flow outlook to a range of $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion, with about a 120% conversion of GAAP net income. With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our Q2 results and 2021 outlook in more detail.\nRahul Ghai: Thank you, Judy. And good morning, everyone. Starting with second quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales grew 22.2% to $3.7 billion as the strong growth momentum continued in New Equipment and Service grew for the second consecutive quarter. Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 25% or $115 million, and up $80 million at constant currency, primarily from the benefit of higher volume in both segments. Favorable service pricing and productivity initiatives in both New Equipment and Service helped offset the headwinds from commodity inflation and the absence of temporary cost actions taken last year to absorb the impact from COVID-19. We maintained the focus on cost containment, while continuing to invest in the business, and adjusted SG&A was down 60 basis points as a percentage of sales despite the step-up in public Company expenses. R&D spend and other strategic investments were up approximately $8 million versus prior -year, and were about flat as a percentage of sales. This strong focus on execution resulted in 40 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, and a full point of margin expansion at constant segment mix. Second quarter adjusted EPS was up 41%, or $0.23, driven primarily from $0.18 of operating profit growth and $0.06 from a lower adjusted tax rate. Moving to Slide 6. New Equipment orders were up 23.9% at constant currency with growth in all regions. Orders momentum continued in the Americas and EMEA, up approximately 47% and 19% respectively, as the markets recovered and the investments made by Otis continued to deliver. Orders in Asia were up approximately 17%. And we're up for the fifth consecutive quarter, including strength in China, where the orders were up mid-teens with record bookings during the quarter. Pricing was down 60 basis points, similar to the first quarter. Organic sales were up 25.4%, with Americas and EMEA up mid 30s, driven by strong backlog execution, as the business continues to progress towards pre-COVID levels. Asia was up mid-teens, driven by China where organic sales are up double-digits. Despite strong sales, there was broad-based growth in backlog that was up 10% and up 5% at constant currency. With backlog margin down about half a point, versus prior year including any adverse product mix impact. New Equipment adjusted operating profit was up $64 million primarily driven by higher volume. The strong year-over-year improvement in installation execution and continued focus on material productivity helped offset the unfavorable impact from price mix and commodity inflation. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 2 percentage points. Service segment results on Slide 7. Year-over-year growth in the number of units under maintenance contract accelerated to 3%, reflecting strong global improvement in retention, recapture, and conversion rates versus prior -year. Number of units increased in all regions, and China was up mid-teens after a high single-digit growth in 2020. Modernization orders was strong in the quarter, up 16.8% at constant currency as North America and Europe grew double-digits, a sharp rebound after a decline in 2020. Modernization backlog was up 4% at constant currency, providing a foundation for sales growth in the subsequent quarters. Service organic sales were up 7.8%, with growth in all lines of business. Growth accelerated in Maintenance and Repair to 7.5% from a strong recovery in repair, due to contractual maintainance remaining resilient. Modernization sales were up 9.3% from continued momentum in Asia Pacific and China, and pick up of activity in EMEA. Adjusted operating profit grew $55 million from higher volume and improved pricing, including favorability from the absence of price concessions made last year. Translational FX benefit of $24 million was more than offset by incremental public Company expenses and and the snapback of COVID related cost containment actions taken in the prior year. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded for the sixth consecutive quarter and was up 10 basis points. Overall, the first-half results reflect solid performance across all metrics, with 1.5 percentage points of New Equipment share gain, 13% Organic Sales growth, and close to $200 million of adjusted operating profit growth. First-half New Equipment and Service organic sales were up 25.3% and 4.5% respectively, with margin expansion in both segments. Free cash flow generation was robust at $1 billion, enabling us to raise dividends and complete a debt repayment and previously announced $500 million of share buyback. As we look forward to the second half of 2021 on Slide 8, we feel confident about growth across all key metrics, given higher backlog, growth momentum in all lines of business, and our focus on operational excellence. This, combined with strengthening demand in our end market s and strong first half results, gives us confidence to raise organic sales outlook to be up 7.5% to 8% for the year, up 275 basis points versus prior outlook. We now expect adjusted operating profit to grow $240 million to $260 million, up from $55 million in the prior outlook at the midpoint, with sales growth, operating profit growth, and margin expansion in both segments. Adjusted EPS is expected in a range of $2.89 to $2.93, $0.10 higher than prior outlook, and up 15% versus the prior year at the midpoint. The year-over-year EPS increase is driven by strong operating profit growth, a 140 basis point reduction in that adjusted tax rate that is now expected to be 29% for the year, from 29.5% in the prior outlook and a reduced share count.  Following the strong cash generation in the first half from net income growth and close to $300 million of reduction in working capital from the end of the year, we now expect free cash flow for the year to be in the range of $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion. This is $75 million higher than prior outlook at the midpoint, from improved net income and better working capital performance. Given the improved free cash flow outlook and the success in repatriation of foreign cash, we are increasing the share buyback target for 2021 to $750 million. In addition, we will continue our bolt-on M&A activities and are always open to other opportunistic investments that can create value for our customers and shareholders. Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9, the New Equipment business is projected to be up 12% to 13%, from 7.5% to 8.5% previously, driven by accelerated backlog conversion and continued recovery in the construction activity in several countries. This 450-basis-point increase from prior outlook includes improved expectations in all regions. EMEA is now expected to be up high single-digits, and we expect low-teens growth in the Americas and Asia driven by China. We're also improving our service outlook by 125 basis points at the midpoint, now expected to be up 4% to 4.5%. This reflects improvement in maintenance and repair, that is now expected to be up 3.5% to 4.5% from maintenance portfolio growth and stronger discretionary repair demand. Modernization business is now expected to be up mid-single-digits, driven by higher Q2 ending backlog. Overall, the Organic Sales outlook of 7.5% to 8%, reflects growth across all regions and all lines of business. Switching to operating profit on Slide 10. We now expect operating profits to be up $240 to $260 million versus prior year, including FX tailwind of approximately $70 million from strengthening of their MB, and other currencies against the U.S. dollar. At constant currency, operating profit is expected to be up a $170 to $190 million. Total Company margin is projected to improve by 30 basis points. This outlook reflects the benefits of higher volume, service, material and installation productivity initiatives, and favorable service pricing. It is partially offset by unfavorable New Equipment price mix, headwinds from incremental standalone expenses, and higher commodity prices. The commodity headwind for the year is now expected to be $70 to $80 million for the year, approximately $35 million to $40 million higher than what we communicated in April as metal prices have stayed at an elevated level. Despite this incremental headwind, we are improving our earnings outlook for the business by approximately $55 million with the improvement in both segments. And to help alleviate the incremental commodity cost impact this year and in 2022, we are broadening the price increases announced last quarter to include additional markets.  his outlook is not only a sharp turnaround from 2020, but also puts us more than $1 billion ahead of 2019 reported revenue, with 100 basis points of margin expansion. 2021 revenue, earnings, and margins in both New Equipment and Service segments are expected to be higher than 2019. This improvement reflects our confidence in long-term strategy, ability to execute, and the benefits of a solid end market recovery. And with that, may I request Angie to please open the line for questions.\nMichael Rednor: Angie can we take the first question?\nOperator: Jeff, your line is open. Please state your question.\nJeff Sprague: Hi. It's Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research.\nJudith Marks: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: I have two questions -- good morning, everyone. Just first on the revenue outlook, Judy or Rahul. You did mention accelerated backlog conversion. I am just wondering how that's playing into the top-line insomuch as the guide would suggest revenues in absolute terms stepped down a bit in the back half relative to this Q2 level. So could you give us a little color on that just kind of what's going on with the backlog and what you're thinking about conversion?\nJudith Marks: Yeah, Jeff, good morning. Listen, we're really pleased with the backlog conversion we've seen through the first half of the year. It was obviously slower through '20, and the compares certainly for this quarter were favorable and our team performed very well. The compares do get a bit tougher, but we, with our orders up so significantly 23.9%, our backlog is up 5%, so we're not burning -- we didn't pull ahead and not replenish. We're actually delivering more for our customers and driving more backlog there, but the compares do get tougher. If you recall second half of last year, both Americas and EMEA grew stronger, especially in the fourth quarter. So we think we're going to still see about the same momentum, but the compares do get tougher.\nJeff Sprague: Sure. And then as you noted in your fits [ph] up and down the line, things are just better than you are expecting and better than certainly the initial Analyst Day early last year. Maybe you can give us some thoughts, an updated outlook and longer range plans. I wonder if you could give us a sneak peek on what you're thinking about in terms of timing or magnitude and on any of these particular metrics, particularly around margins and growth?\nJudith Marks: Yes. So Jeff, we've been -- and when we did Investor Day in February of '20, standing up as a new independent Company and then faced -- we had already been experiencing the early days of COVID in China. We weren't quite sure what the mid-term outlook that we shared, where that would come out. Again, strong performance through '20 and '21. And if you really look at EPS itself, almost up 13% in '20, and our new guide at the midpoint really has it up 15% this year. We had been talking about high single-digits at the midterm outlook, so we\u2019re going to revisit that as we go into the second half of this year. And we'll share more with you, we believe early in '22, with probably a revised mid-term outlook on all the metrics. Again, the end markets are far more positive, and if you have a chance and look at Slide 19 in the backup, you'll see for adjusted operating profit, for organic revenue, we did a compare that takes us to '19, '20, and '21, and the '21 outlook beats every metric fairly significantly even from '19. So, Rahul and I have some work to do there and we will get back to you in early '22.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Housden with RBC Capital Markets.\nNicholas Housden: Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. My first one, excuse me, is just looking at the guidance upgrades. And my sense is that the underlying assumptions for H2 haven't really changed. The raise is more just a reflection of the strong Q2 results. Is that a fair assessment of the situation?\nRahul Ghai: I think that's fair. Nick, good morning first by the way, no that's a fair assessment. I think as you look at, and Judith kind of alluded to that a little bit in her response to Jeff. I mean, if you look at between first half and second half, there's definitely -- more difficult compare both on New Equipment and on Service. We were down about 10% in the first half of last year in New Equipment, up a couple of points in the second half on New Equipment in 2020, so the compares get tougher. Service Q2 last year was the weakest quarter, I would say. And then Q3 and Q4 were down, but not as down as Q2. So definitely tougher compares getting into the second half. So that -- as we look at first half and second half compares for 2021, New Equipment growth definitely slows down, but Service is about flat in both, up 4%, 4.5% both first half and second half. So, that growth looks consistent. And then, if you look at on the Earnings side, obviously, second half reflects the change in volume growth assumptions, but also incremental commodity headwinds that we are seeing in the business, which is going to be a little bit more back-half loaded. So you're seeing that. And \u2013 but, I mean our productivity initiatives continue to deliver. We've seen good improvement in our installation execution out in the field, so that is covering a lot of issues that we're dealing with, especially on the commodity side. And if you look at first half and second half, in the second half our earnings continue to grow. Our margins continue to expand in both segments and there\u2019s a decent drop through coming on the volume growth that we're seeing. So, we\u2019re seeing about a 10 basis points expansion on the New Equipment margin in the second half, and 90 basis points overall for the year. And on Service, we're seeing about a 40 basis point, 50 basis point expansion in the second half and about 40 basis points for the full year. So, we think it's a solid second half, recognizing a slightly different environment and a bit more difficult compare.\nJudith Marks: Yeah, Nick. It's Judith. Let me just add on to Rahul. We also have some one-off support that we're trying to offset, including some government help that helped us in 2020 that's going to come through in the second half of the year. But we have seen, again, for the second quarter, with Repair and Modernization revenues up and orders up in both. That gives us comfort on the Service side and a 40 basis point margin expansion full-year for Service. We will, when you think -- when you look at the new guide, even with that second half as we've contacted it, even with all of our abilities to offset the now 70 million to 80 million of raw materials, the commodity headwinds, there's really a good outcome here. Our profit is going to be up 240 million, our EPS is going to be up 15% even accounting for all that, and the higher stand-alone costs, and an extra quarter of interest expense. And that's coming off a strong '20, where we grew operating profit and grew EPS as well. So, for us it's growth on growth, which we believe all of our colleagues listening understand that is our mantra, that is our strategy.\nNicholas Housden: Thanks. And then if I can just add on to that, I mean listening both to your results today and to your competitive last week, it almost feels like you've been taken by surprise by the strength that we've seen in Q2. I'm just wondering when you look at this strength, are there any areas where you feel like it's unsustainable either in particular business lines or particular geographies or anything that should give us a reason to think that that maybe a bit more risk in H2 and into 2022?\nJudith Marks: Not really, Nick. I mean, the Americas got off to a better start than we expected. The market's up mid-single-digits. EMEA was stable in '20, and we expect low-to-mid single-digit growth in '21, and we're seeing that. We still are watching Asia Pacific, ex-China, because there are still, obviously, India is coming back, but Singapore is in lockdown and several other Southeast Asian countries are in lockdown. So, we\u2019re watching that with caution, and thinking about our colleagues and customers there, but you really know no surprises. The second half on Service, EMEA and Americas are going to continue on a low-single digit. And the New Equipment market is going to continue to feed our Service market. Having the portfolio where we did for the first time at 3% and the backlog up 5% on New Equipment is really what gives us the confidence to drive the sales, and then the orders execution, we haven't seen real drastic changes in the end markets that would give us pause.\nNicholas Housden: Okay. Great. Thanks very much, guys.\nJudith Marks: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning.\nJudith Marks: Morning, John.\nJohn Walsh: Maybe a question as it relates to price cost. Appreciate all the color earlier around that equation. Wanted to dive a little bit into China. One of the things that we had picked up is, it seems like there are several OEMs trying to get a price in China as we look forward in the back half of the year.  Is that something you're seeing? Do you have any plans, any color you can give there on the pricing dynamic on the ground in China?\nJudith Marks: Yeah. Sure, John. As Rahul mentioned, one of the 3 strategies we have to offset the commodity headwinds we're facing is a more broad-based price increase. We started this last quarter very focused in a few countries, and now it will be more broad-based and go across all of our regions.  We are -- we always look at this in terms of what the market can bear and how the competitors respond. In China, the top 10 OEM s have 90% of the market segment. We heard the same thing you did last week about people raising prices.  We are doing similar, but obviously we'll tailor it to the segments in China where we think we can get price and not give up share as well. Our -- we're really pleased China results so far as we came through the quarter.  Record orders in the mid-teens, so very pleased with that. Double-digit sales, and the team grew our portfolio mid-teens. We gained share. We think we grew faster than the market. And even if China get -- becomes more stable versus the high single-digit growth we saw in the segment in the first half, it will still be a growth segment. Not on -- the segment will be a growth for the year, and it will certainly be growth for Otis.\nRahul Ghai: And just to add to that, John, part of the reason why we feel okay about our situation in China is if you look at the flows rate under construction, that's up more than 10% over last year and 13% over 2019. And the real estate investment in China is up 15%, so there's a lot of activity happening in China.  We feel that the overall market growth in China has gone up from mid-single digits what -- when we've started the year to maybe mid-single digits plus. And now we think it's high single-digit. The market's definitely growing, and that gives us incremental ability to pass on a little bit of price in China.\nJohn Walsh: Thank you for that. And then maybe just a question around digital. I think a lot of the -- Well, I'll just ask the question here. If you're seeing customers really increase their take-up of paid digital services, or if this is really still an opportunity more around the cost-driven payback of upgrading to a digital service? Just curious what you're seeing there from customers' acceptance and willingness to actually take these services.\nJudith Marks: Yeah. John, our strategy was to control and drive productivity first with giving customers value, whereby we control the deployment of the Otis ONE units so that we had -- and we're able to take advantage of route density as well as other productivity measures for us. Obviously, our customers get visibility into this.  We've started seeing uptake on our Otis ONE subscription services but it's early days. But we believe in it and that's why, as we've rolled out our Gen3 and Gen360, they are Otis ONE digitally enabled.  The IoT is built in. We're now shipping units with Otis ONE already built in so that we have the foundation, we have the ability to do over-the-air updates to add features, to add value. Still early days, but we have seen the customer uptake not to where it's material yet in the revenue.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, guys, good morning.\nRahul Ghai: Good morning, Steve.\nJudith Marks: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Just a question on the margins again. What do you expect the price to be for this year, and that lever to offset the commodity costs? And then when you look out to the next couple of years, is there any bump in the road when it comes to margins?  And, ultimately, you guys are performing well here. Is there a potential for a higher entitlement back to where you were before, way back when, in the good old days?\nJudith Marks: Steve, let me start and then I'll let Rahul add to it. But -- so with these price increases, the order to revenue cycle is variable throughout the globe. And some countries drive an earlier benefit from the price increases than others.  The price increases that we started last quarter will start flowing through later this year. The price increases we started in July, we'll see some of that the end of this year. But the majority of that we put in place to, again, have protection through first half and more importantly, second half of '22.  It's been targeted, but the real actions to drive the offset beyond price that we're going to see quickly are the productivity we've gotten in installation, which as any of you who follow us know, we've had all these service productivity initiatives.  We've invested in technology there. There is ripe opportunity for us to continue to yield installation productivity. And then our material productivity has not stopped in the factories. And we were yielding 3% every quarter.  That we anticipate material productivity to continue to help us offset this, and it's included in our outlook. But I'll let Rahul add there and see what he wants to say about returning to the days of old.\nRahul Ghai: Listen, it's early days, Steve. Again, I think Judith alluded to it in a response to an earlier question. Clearly, we are very, very pleased with the progress we've made over the last couple of years since Investor Day between what we were able to do in 2020 and now '21. Between the 2 years, we have more than 100 basis points of margin expansion. it is very, very good progress, good return to growth. The numbers are above 2019 levels.  And if you look at the absolute profit dollars, I feel that is, the margins may not be, but I think if you definitely feel really good about delivering the absolute profit dollars. And maybe at that point I don't know what the peak was, but our revenue was probably $3 to $4 billion higher than where it was back in 2010, 2011.  And even if the margins are lower, I think in absolute profit dollars we may be kind of getting there. I don't know, I haven't gone back and checked the AFX numbers for 2010, 2011, but it feels like -- and that's an important metric for us.  But listen, we will continue to work it. You know we're clearly doing everything that we should be doing in the business, and we feel we've got good traction. And as Judy said earlier, we'll come back and kind of update our medium-term guidance early next year. More comes --\nSteve Tusa: It was 20%. I can send you the number just in case you don't have it there. And then just one last question on the 3% maintenance -- units under maintenance number. What was the biggest lever on that? You guys had some good, obviously, new unit deliveries. Could you just give us a bit of an update on attrition and recapture?\nRahul Ghai: The numbers continue to improve in all metrics, Steve. Conversion rates are better, including conversion rates in China. I think there were -- they maintained their merging towards our 60% target that we've set for ourselves. And there'll be -- and, again, as we've said before, we expect a meaningful improvement this year in China on the conversion rates.  And we are getting there. The recapture rates are better as well in China where we have the biggest opportunity, and the retention rates continue to improve as well. I think we are making good improvements across all 3 metrics.  And like we always do, we'll update you guys annually on where we end for the year. But it was an improvement across all 3 metrics for Otis overall. And obviously, in China, you're seeing some really good traction on the portfolio growth, and the units were up in all regions. We're seeing some good traction overall in the Service portfolio.\nSteve Tusa: Right. And that --\nJudith Marks: Our retention rate is still at 94% at the round. We can't go up and we certainly, with those actions, wouldn't go down.\nSteve Tusa: And that 3% unit growth can translate into something a bit higher on the revenue side, right? That's my last question.\nRahul Ghai: Yeah, absolutely. And if you look at the Service pricing overall, Service pricing has continued to track well. In a part of that, we reflected that in our guide as well. Service pricing continues to track well.  The concessions have come down to terminal levels overall. And this high inflationary environment that we're seeing should help us on service pricing. Because most of our contracts in Europe and Americas, have price escalators built in.  They're largely tied to labor inflation. And historically, we've always had that lever, but given low inflationary environment in the macro market, the price s don't always stick. And now with this inflationary environment, we should have a greater ability to stick to those prices. That should help next year.\nSteve Tusa: Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much. To follow up on Steve's question, maybe give us a little bit more color on the 3% service growth. You mentioned China mid-teens, but where was it elsewhere? And give us maybe a little more color also in terms of the conversion and the recapture rates.\nRahul Ghai: It was a broad-based growth, Cai. I mean, Asia Pacific, that's our next biggest opportunity in terms of portfolio growth because [Indiscernible] that had some developing markets, So that clearly continues to add to our portfolio count as well.  Asia Pacific, I would say would be number 2. And then Americas and Europe are obviously more mature market, so the portfolio growth is lower compared to the other two regions. But again, all regions grew their portfolio.  Cai, so that is obviously very, very good. And you see the overall growth accelerated. And as I said in response to an earlier question, I think that all three metrics improved. So we've seen good, good improvement. Our recapture rates are better, conversion rates continue to edge up. And obviously, China is the [Indiscernible] there.  We made a meaningful step in the right direction. And retention rates have, again, I'm repeating myself, but it just continues to improve. And every little bit helps because we've got, obviously, on 2.1 million units, every 10 basis points helps. And that was up year-over-year, the retention was up year-over-year.\nJudith Marks: Cai, the other element that most people -- it's a little bit of a nuance, but I want to make sure everyone understands is as we do modernizations, a lot of those are off portfolio that we then bring back through the Modernization and it becomes part of our portfolio going forward.  Modernization orders were up double-digit in the Americas, EMEA, and China that led us to this 17% across the board. The Mod business is coming back nicely, especially post-pandemic. Some of it's pent up demand, but a lot of it is just -- elevators are now a year, a year-and-a-half older. And so there's almost 6 million elevators over -- out there that are over 20 years old. They're not all in our service portfolio, but modernization gives us an opportunity, not just to recapture them, but to recapture them, do a modernization and then start the service cycle and put them in our portfolio.\nCai von Rumohr: Great, thanks. And then, in terms of rollout of IoT and connectivity, I think your target was 100,000 units. Can you maybe update us there?\nJudith Marks: Yeah. We're on track for the year. We'll finish with another at least 100,000 units this year. We are shipping from the factories as well, as we've now started shipping. Obviously, we have new orders on Gen3, which is our IoT -enabled platform everywhere but EMEA, which has the Gen360 rolling out, which is also IoT -enabled. We're going all in.  We believe it makes sense for us as we're going through the change management with our field professionals. They have been embracing Otis ONE, and I've heard some personal stories in Chicago -- in the Chicago suburbs and other locations, where it's just -- it's amazing how this is driving less entrapment, as well as customer satisfaction, because we are actually proactively repairing parts of the elevator before the customer even has a shutdown.  It's being viewed well internally, which is important to get that ground swell. Our field professionals really are appreciating it. We've gotten the installation time down to very small minutes, in terms of installing a unit.  And this is our future. The Connected Elevator is here and Otis ONE helps us start that and becomes that foundational platform.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific. Last one. You added to your sales force last year and you added agents in China. Can you maybe update us in terms of what you're doing there?\nJudith Marks: Sure. In this quarter we added another 150 net, so we're up to 2150. That's -- we continue to tune it. You won't see the same acceleration, but we're also appropriately doing some assessments on who should be in, who should be out, so that we have the yield. What we're seeing for the second quarter in a row is we gained share in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, which is where we were not performing as well as we needed to, and we're gaining share with the key accounts in China.  The agent distributor network is working for us. And I'll just -- Rahul spoke in his remarks about SG &A and us driving that down 60 basis points this quarter. Our SG &A and the dollar amount actually grew because we are investing in the S part of it.  We're continuing to add sales resources in focused markets where we were focusing on key segments and underserved markets in specific countries throughout the globe.  And our teams executing very well on that while we're trying to obviously drive the G&A piece down on increasing revenue. So we are committed to sales coverage, whether that's through direct sales people in certain parts of the world, or our agents and distributors.\nCai von Rumohr: Thank you very much.\nRahul Ghai: We've added about 100 agents -- to add a little bit more color, Cai, we've added about 100 salespeople this year. Between last year and through the first half, our sales force is up about 6%. That is -- that's a step in the right direction.  And the digital marketing efforts are also using a lot of results. Our digital sales, our bookings are up 2X where we were in the first half last year. So it's just not feet on the ground, but also the digital strategy that's paying off.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.\nRahul Ghai: Good morning, Julian.\nJudith Marks: Hi, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: Good morning. Maybe you just want to clarify on the pricing commentary, because you talked about prices going up more recently, prices going up into next year as well. But there was a comment at the beginning of the prepared remarks about the pricing down 60 bps.  So maybe I misheard that, but just wanted to sort of try and square. Was the down 60 a sort of lagging backlog number net or something? And then when we're looking forward to the gross and net price that starts to swing more positively?\nRahul Ghai: No, Julian. You heard it exactly right. I think both the statements are accurate. Pricing was down in the quarter, similar to the levels that we saw in Q1. The price increases that we put in place in Q2, that we spoke about earlier, they were in -- they were in targeted countries.  And indeed, we were very, very careful because, again, it was early in the year, we were not sure how the markets were recovering. We were very targeted in those price increases.  Obviously, that is still going through the course to the order cycle. Hopefully, we will see the benefit of that in the second half of this year. We do expect pricing headwinds in terms of absolute dollar terms to be lower in the second half than we had in the first half, so that should start to help. And then we put in prices -- incremental price increases in additional markets across the world.  This is a far more broader price increase, and this is because the markets are recovering better than what we thought. Americas, I think Judy said it earlier. Americas is now expected to be up maybe mid-to-high single-digits versus up slightly at the beginning of the year. China is going to be up more high versus mid. So markets are trending in the right direction.  That gives us confidence. Okay, market has the ability to absorb these price increases. We are -- there's a much broader price increase. And that should show up into our numbers and more in '22. And maybe some in the first-half, but maybe more in the second half in terms of absolute dollar benefit. So I think both those statements are absolutely accurate because this 60 basis points of bright decline that we saw in the quarter was more in response to the quotes that we've issued last year.\nJudith Marks: And Julian, of our 17 billion of RPO, 89% of that we recognized as sales in the following 24 months, which gives us time for productivity initiatives, gives us time for learning curves on all of that backlog, and as Rahul said, that backlog margin.  And when you look at the performance this quarter to be up 2 points in New Equipment from that which we bid within the -- 6-20 months ago, I think shows that we know how to drive those learning curves and the productivity.\nJulian Mitchell: Very helpful. Thank you. And just my second question around capital deployment, and I don't know if that's come up yet in the Q&A. I noticed the decent share buyback increase. Clearly, the very high and stable cash flow levels mean you have a lot of scope for capital deployment beyond this year. Just wondered how you're seeing the M&A environment right now.  There is an opportunity to go out there and buy up a lot of service providers locally in different regions, for example. Just wondered how appealing doing that systematically on a large scale would be?\nJudith Marks: We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And we clearly don't require that much cash to operate this business. Second Quarter of negative net working capital. So, everyone was very focused -- remains very focused on that.  We've continued our small service Company acquisitions. We've targeted and we shared this in Investor Day, $50 million to $70 million a year in doing that. And the challenges is their readiness. We've got a good book of potential targets that we continue to look at, but the owners have to be willing to sell, and then it has to has to meet our model in terms of being accretive, and as well as being on the right place for us to add to our routes and to our locations from a density standpoint.  We do many of these. Most of those are private transactions with private companies, so you don't hear about all of them. But it's robust and it's continuing. We remain open to all opportunities from an M&A perspective. And we don't know when generational opportunities will come around, but we remain open and evaluate all opportunities.  A year and a half ago, we needed to repay debt. We needed to start our dividend. We had no cash -- no stock buybacks. We've repaid the debt we thought was at the appropriate level now, so that our net debt EBITDA is about 1.7 kind of level, which we think is very healthy with the debt we're holding.  We increased our dividend last quarter. and we've increased share buybacks we weren't originally planning to do any this year. We announced $300 million in the first quarter or at the beginning of the year, $500 million last quarter, and now we're upping it to 750. So we will continue to drive shareholder value and remain open to M&A opportunities as they arise.\nJulian Mitchell: Fantastic. Thanks very much.\nMichael Rednor: Thanks, Julian.\nJudith Marks: Thanks, Julian.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the question. We've covered a lot of ground already, but I want to go back to the 3% unit growth in maintenance units. That's a pretty big number. Do you think you can maintain that level of growth in units?  And what I'm trying to drive at here is, if you do volume growth of that level with price, maybe an acquisition or two, and then maybe if digital starts hitting and getting traction, then we could be looking at well north of 5% service growth. I'm just wondering if that is how you view the world as well. But the main question is, do you think 3% can be sustained?\nJudith Marks: Yeah, Nigel, I think you've got a fairly accurate assessment, as usual, about our business. We do think it's sustainable now that we've achieved it. We set it as an internal target as we started the year. We've never hit 3% in the last decade. And so to us, this was important because as you know, our service drives 80% of our profits.  And then this has that knock on effect obviously of the 5% you were talking about. So we set the target ourselves. We knew we needed to grow our portfolio in China, where the service market is growing faster than anywhere else, as well as in the emerging markets, including India, Southeast Asia, and other emerging markets. Our team has taken that onboard.  And this quarter was the first time we hit 3%, last year we were at 2%. I believe in 2019, we rounded to 1%. We have a strategy in place to execute to do this. And a lot of it is basic block and tackling, perform, drive the conversions, drive the retention, stop the cancellations, delight the customer, and then add that digital layer, that foundational layer of IoT that gives us more stickiness.  And it's not just IoT, it's our eView. It's any of our -- any time we're connected to the customer, all of our retention rate goes up, our conversion rates go up.  And so whether it's eCall, our Compass Dispatch System, everything we're doing now with our -- I'm just so excited about Gen3 and Gen360 And having now that architecture out there that will give us that foundation to continue to grow. And it's all about growing the service portfolio. So I think you've got it accurate and I think it's sustainable.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, Judy. It was great. And then on the buyback uplift. I know that's Rahul, that the cash flow around the organization hasn't been -- wasn't optimized. Far from it that the time has been -- are we now in a position where we've greased the wheels and we now have more fluid cash-flow globally? And just any kind of thoughts on tax optimization strategies.\nRahul Ghai: On tax, Nigel, we keep making progress. We obviously lowered our tax rate to 29% from 29.5% previously, 30.4% last year, so a 140 basis point reduction in the year. I think it's moving in the right direction. Our long-term guide or medium-term guide is still in the 25% to 28% range. We continue to move towards that number.  Obviously, there's incremental improvements that you will see in '22 and then '23. And then on repatriation, listen, this -- the incremental 250 that we're able to do speaks well to the work that our teams are doing just to continue to look at different strategies to bring cash back to the U.S. where we can put it to work.  Not to rehash the stuff that you just mentioned, but it it's -- clearly shows that we are doing our job, but -- and that is something we will need to continue working on. It's not a one-and-done thing. This is something that we need to keep pushing because [Indiscernible] keep building our cash offshore, and we'll have to keep thinking of how do we bring it back to the U.S.  That has to be an ongoing activity. But really good progress. Our repatriation's probably going to be maybe 1.5-2X what we did last year. Clearly, a lot better this year. And then we'll need to think what we can do next year. That's an ongoing activity for us.\nNigel Coe: All right. Thanks very much.\nRahul Ghai: Thanks, Nigel.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back to Ms. Marks for any additional or closing remarks.\nJudith Marks: Thanks, Angie. This solid first half of 2021 demonstrates the resiliency of our business, the strength of our strategy, and our ability to execute and innovate. I'm confident that this positive momentum, the dedication of our colleagues, and the pace of recovery in our end markets positions us well to deliver on the improved 2021 outlook.  Looking forward to the second half of the year, we'll remain focused on driving value for our customers, colleagues, communities, and shareholders. Thank you for joining us today, and please stay safe and well.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "name": "Judith Marks",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and thank you everyone for joining us. We hope that everyone listening is safe and well. Before we get into the quarter, I'd like to congratulate Mike on his new role, leading Investor Relations, and thanks Stacy for all the great work getting us to this point. We look forward to seeing you both excel in your new positions. Otis delivered an excellent second quarter closing out a strong first half. This included mid-teens organic sales growth, demonstrating the resiliency of our colleagues and business, and our ability to execute on our long-term strategy. Overall, demand in the New Equipment segment was strong. We gained about 1 point of New Equipment share with orders up approximately 24%, in a market that was up low-teens. New Equipment orders grew in all regions and were particularly strong in the Americas, up nearly 50%, with an over four times increase in major project bookings versus the prior year. These orders will support customer projects throughout North America. For example, in Canada, Otis secured an order to outfit a luxury high-rise condominium building in the M City community with several elevators, including custom cab interiors that fit the buildings' upscale design.  Moving to service, we grew sales in all lines of business, including repair and modernization. Modernization demand was strong with orders up mid-teens versus the prior year. This includes another Otis partnership with Silverstein Properties in the Americas, where we will modernize more than 40 elevators in the U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles and integrate Compass 360 and Otis' eCall app to allow for more seamless customer and tenant access to the building services. The demonstrated strength of the Maintenance business continues, and we achieved 3% growth year-over-year on our industry-leading service portfolio, a key goal we set for ourselves entering this year. We drove profit growth and margin expansion in both segments, largely from the benefit of higher volume as New Equipment and service organic sales grew about 25% and 8% respectively. Since spin, our consistent performance reflects the power of our strategy and its implementation. I hope many of you were able to join us for, \"Welcome To Tomorrow,\" where we shared our Gen3 and Gen360 highly innovative platforms that meet the current and future needs of our customers in an increasingly connected world. Gen3 builds upon the proven flat belt technology of Otis' best selling Gen2 platform, while adding built-in Otis ONE IoT connectivity and a variety of options such as eCall, eView, Compass dispatching systems, health solutions, and updated aesthetics. APIs allow us to access and leverage data with analytics that drive value for our customers. Upon release, Otis secured an order for more than 100 Gen3 elevators for a new residential project in the Jilin Province in Northeast China. In EMEA, after successful pilots in several countries, Otis officially launched Gen360, a next-generation, digitally native platform that includes all the features of the Gen3 elevator, built around an all-new electronic architecture in a more compact design. Gen360 is enabled with IoT capabilities and online tools; a connected passenger experience, and additional safety features to help limit entrapments and enable maintenance from inside the elevator cab. In France, Otis was selected to outfit a future aquatic center in the Paris suburbs, with the Gen 360 ecosystem. In addition to its many digital, safety and passenger benefits, this platform has a decisive advantage. For the first time, we can eliminate the need to accommodate hoistway projection onto the roof, avoiding interfering with the building's architectural lines, a feature desirable to architects and building owners. All of this strong first half performance, including robust free cash flow generation in excess of 150% of net income enables us to return additional cash to shareholders. In the second quarter, we completed the previously planned $0.5 billion in share repurchases ahead of schedule and are now in a position to increase our 2021 target to $750 million. In parallel with a strong financial performance, we continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives that are integral to bringing our vision to life. In May, we released additional long-term ESG goals aligning with our four ESG commitments: health and safety, people and communities, environment and impact, and governance and accountability. During the quarter, we made progress on our goal to meet ISO 14001 certification standards in all of our factories. Otis' manufacturing facility in Brazil became the latest to achieve this certification, meaning nearly 90% of our factories are now ISO 14001 certified. This is part of our ongoing work to operate more sustainably. Initiatives in the factory include implementation of rainwater and water reuse systems, LED lighting to reduce energy consumption by more than two-thirds, and improvements to shipping and packaging materials to reduce waste by approximately 800 tons annually. In Paris, we introduced electric vehicles into our fleet and we'll be expanding this pilot over the coming months. Early feedback from our field professionals has been positive and the program will continue to contribute to our CO2 emission reduction targets. Moving to Social. One year ago, in response to the urgent problems of social unrest and entrenched racism, we announced our commitment to change, a framework to ensure all colleagues feel safe, welcome, and heard. While there's still work to be done, I'm proud of the progress we've made on this initiative over the past year. Actions taken include engaging all supervisors worldwide in a training program designed to help them mitigate unconscious bias, increasing access to employee assistance and wellness programs globally, launching our Made to Move Communities signature STEM education program, and awarding not-for-profit grants to communities in each region that support diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. And in June, we began our second annual Season of Safety, reinforcing Otis' strong safety culture, recommitting to our life-saving cardinal rules and prioritizing ongoing training on safety procedures and protocols. We remain committed to a zero-harm workplace. Now, turning to Slide 4, second quarter results and 2021 outlook. In addition to record new equipment bookings in the second quarter, total Otis orders were up 9.4% on a rolling 12-month basis. Organic sales were up 15.4% in the second quarter with 25.4% organic growth in the New Equipment segment and 7.8% organic growth in the Service segment. Adjusted operating profit was up $115 million and margin expanded 40 basis points despite a 60 basis point impact from segment mix, as the New Equipment business grew faster than the higher-margin Service business. Free cash flow was robust at $493 million, with 151% conversion of GAAP net income. This positive momentum, our continued progress on our long-term strategy, and the pace of recovery in our end markets gives us confidence to improve our 2021 outlook across all key metrics. We now expect sales to be in a range of $14.1 billion to $14.2 billion, up 10.5% to 11% versus the prior year, and up 7.5% to 8% organically. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be in a range of $2.16 billion to $2.18 billion, up $240 million to $260 million at actual currency, and up $170 million to $190 million at constant currency. We're improving adjusted EPS by $0.10 at the midpoint versus the prior outlook and now expect it to be in a range of $2.89 to $2.93, a 15% to 16% increase versus the prior year. Lastly, we're improving our free cash flow outlook to a range of $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion, with about a 120% conversion of GAAP net income. With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our Q2 results and 2021 outlook in more detail. Good morning, Jeff. Yeah, Jeff, good morning. Listen, we're really pleased with the backlog conversion we've seen through the first half of the year. It was obviously slower through '20, and the compares certainly for this quarter were favorable and our team performed very well. The compares do get a bit tougher, but we, with our orders up so significantly 23.9%, our backlog is up 5%, so we're not burning -- we didn't pull ahead and not replenish. We're actually delivering more for our customers and driving more backlog there, but the compares do get tougher. If you recall second half of last year, both Americas and EMEA grew stronger, especially in the fourth quarter. So we think we're going to still see about the same momentum, but the compares do get tougher. Yes. So Jeff, we've been -- and when we did Investor Day in February of '20, standing up as a new independent Company and then faced -- we had already been experiencing the early days of COVID in China. We weren't quite sure what the mid-term outlook that we shared, where that would come out. Again, strong performance through '20 and '21. And if you really look at EPS itself, almost up 13% in '20, and our new guide at the midpoint really has it up 15% this year. We had been talking about high single-digits at the midterm outlook, so we're going to revisit that as we go into the second half of this year. And we'll share more with you, we believe early in '22, with probably a revised mid-term outlook on all the metrics. Again, the end markets are far more positive, and if you have a chance and look at Slide 19 in the backup, you'll see for adjusted operating profit, for organic revenue, we did a compare that takes us to '19, '20, and '21, and the '21 outlook beats every metric fairly significantly even from '19. So, Rahul and I have some work to do there and we will get back to you in early '22. Yeah, Nick. It's Judith. Let me just add on to Rahul. We also have some one-off support that we're trying to offset, including some government help that helped us in 2020 that's going to come through in the second half of the year. But we have seen, again, for the second quarter, with Repair and Modernization revenues up and orders up in both. That gives us comfort on the Service side and a 40 basis point margin expansion full-year for Service. We will, when you think -- when you look at the new guide, even with that second half as we've contacted it, even with all of our abilities to offset the now 70 million to 80 million of raw materials, the commodity headwinds, there's really a good outcome here. Our profit is going to be up 240 million, our EPS is going to be up 15% even accounting for all that, and the higher stand-alone costs, and an extra quarter of interest expense. And that's coming off a strong '20, where we grew operating profit and grew EPS as well. So, for us it's growth on growth, which we believe all of our colleagues listening understand that is our mantra, that is our strategy. Not really, Nick. I mean, the Americas got off to a better start than we expected. The market's up mid-single-digits. EMEA was stable in '20, and we expect low-to-mid single-digit growth in '21, and we're seeing that. We still are watching Asia Pacific, ex-China, because there are still, obviously, India is coming back, but Singapore is in lockdown and several other Southeast Asian countries are in lockdown. So, we're watching that with caution, and thinking about our colleagues and customers there, but you really know no surprises. The second half on Service, EMEA and Americas are going to continue on a low-single digit. And the New Equipment market is going to continue to feed our Service market. Having the portfolio where we did for the first time at 3% and the backlog up 5% on New Equipment is really what gives us the confidence to drive the sales, and then the orders execution, we haven't seen real drastic changes in the end markets that would give us pause. Thank you. Morning, John. Yeah. Sure, John. As Rahul mentioned, one of the 3 strategies we have to offset the commodity headwinds we're facing is a more broad-based price increase. We started this last quarter very focused in a few countries, and now it will be more broad-based and go across all of our regions.  We are -- we always look at this in terms of what the market can bear and how the competitors respond. In China, the top 10 OEM s have 90% of the market segment. We heard the same thing you did last week about people raising prices.  We are doing similar, but obviously we'll tailor it to the segments in China where we think we can get price and not give up share as well. Our -- we're really pleased China results so far as we came through the quarter.  Record orders in the mid-teens, so very pleased with that. Double-digit sales, and the team grew our portfolio mid-teens. We gained share. We think we grew faster than the market. And even if China get -- becomes more stable versus the high single-digit growth we saw in the segment in the first half, it will still be a growth segment. Not on -- the segment will be a growth for the year, and it will certainly be growth for Otis. Yeah. John, our strategy was to control and drive productivity first with giving customers value, whereby we control the deployment of the Otis ONE units so that we had -- and we're able to take advantage of route density as well as other productivity measures for us. Obviously, our customers get visibility into this.  We've started seeing uptake on our Otis ONE subscription services but it's early days. But we believe in it and that's why, as we've rolled out our Gen3 and Gen360, they are Otis ONE digitally enabled.  The IoT is built in. We're now shipping units with Otis ONE already built in so that we have the foundation, we have the ability to do over-the-air updates to add features, to add value. Still early days, but we have seen the customer uptake not to where it's material yet in the revenue. Hi, Steve. Steve, let me start and then I'll let Rahul add to it. But -- so with these price increases, the order to revenue cycle is variable throughout the globe. And some countries drive an earlier benefit from the price increases than others.  The price increases that we started last quarter will start flowing through later this year. The price increases we started in July, we'll see some of that the end of this year. But the majority of that we put in place to, again, have protection through first half and more importantly, second half of '22.  It's been targeted, but the real actions to drive the offset beyond price that we're going to see quickly are the productivity we've gotten in installation, which as any of you who follow us know, we've had all these service productivity initiatives.  We've invested in technology there. There is ripe opportunity for us to continue to yield installation productivity. And then our material productivity has not stopped in the factories. And we were yielding 3% every quarter.  That we anticipate material productivity to continue to help us offset this, and it's included in our outlook. But I'll let Rahul add there and see what he wants to say about returning to the days of old. Our retention rate is still at 94% at the round. We can't go up and we certainly, with those actions, wouldn't go down. Cai, the other element that most people -- it's a little bit of a nuance, but I want to make sure everyone understands is as we do modernizations, a lot of those are off portfolio that we then bring back through the Modernization and it becomes part of our portfolio going forward.  Modernization orders were up double-digit in the Americas, EMEA, and China that led us to this 17% across the board. The Mod business is coming back nicely, especially post-pandemic. Some of it's pent up demand, but a lot of it is just -- elevators are now a year, a year-and-a-half older. And so there's almost 6 million elevators over -- out there that are over 20 years old. They're not all in our service portfolio, but modernization gives us an opportunity, not just to recapture them, but to recapture them, do a modernization and then start the service cycle and put them in our portfolio. Yeah. We're on track for the year. We'll finish with another at least 100,000 units this year. We are shipping from the factories as well, as we've now started shipping. Obviously, we have new orders on Gen3, which is our IoT -enabled platform everywhere but EMEA, which has the Gen360 rolling out, which is also IoT -enabled. We're going all in.  We believe it makes sense for us as we're going through the change management with our field professionals. They have been embracing Otis ONE, and I've heard some personal stories in Chicago -- in the Chicago suburbs and other locations, where it's just -- it's amazing how this is driving less entrapment, as well as customer satisfaction, because we are actually proactively repairing parts of the elevator before the customer even has a shutdown.  It's being viewed well internally, which is important to get that ground swell. Our field professionals really are appreciating it. We've gotten the installation time down to very small minutes, in terms of installing a unit.  And this is our future. The Connected Elevator is here and Otis ONE helps us start that and becomes that foundational platform. Sure. In this quarter we added another 150 net, so we're up to 2150. That's -- we continue to tune it. You won't see the same acceleration, but we're also appropriately doing some assessments on who should be in, who should be out, so that we have the yield. What we're seeing for the second quarter in a row is we gained share in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, which is where we were not performing as well as we needed to, and we're gaining share with the key accounts in China.  The agent distributor network is working for us. And I'll just -- Rahul spoke in his remarks about SG &A and us driving that down 60 basis points this quarter. Our SG &A and the dollar amount actually grew because we are investing in the S part of it.  We're continuing to add sales resources in focused markets where we were focusing on key segments and underserved markets in specific countries throughout the globe.  And our teams executing very well on that while we're trying to obviously drive the G&A piece down on increasing revenue. So we are committed to sales coverage, whether that's through direct sales people in certain parts of the world, or our agents and distributors. Hi, Julian. And Julian, of our 17 billion of RPO, 89% of that we recognized as sales in the following 24 months, which gives us time for productivity initiatives, gives us time for learning curves on all of that backlog, and as Rahul said, that backlog margin.  And when you look at the performance this quarter to be up 2 points in New Equipment from that which we bid within the -- 6-20 months ago, I think shows that we know how to drive those learning curves and the productivity. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And we clearly don't require that much cash to operate this business. Second Quarter of negative net working capital. So, everyone was very focused -- remains very focused on that.  We've continued our small service Company acquisitions. We've targeted and we shared this in Investor Day, $50 million to $70 million a year in doing that. And the challenges is their readiness. We've got a good book of potential targets that we continue to look at, but the owners have to be willing to sell, and then it has to has to meet our model in terms of being accretive, and as well as being on the right place for us to add to our routes and to our locations from a density standpoint.  We do many of these. Most of those are private transactions with private companies, so you don't hear about all of them. But it's robust and it's continuing. We remain open to all opportunities from an M&A perspective. And we don't know when generational opportunities will come around, but we remain open and evaluate all opportunities.  A year and a half ago, we needed to repay debt. We needed to start our dividend. We had no cash -- no stock buybacks. We've repaid the debt we thought was at the appropriate level now, so that our net debt EBITDA is about 1.7 kind of level, which we think is very healthy with the debt we're holding.  We increased our dividend last quarter. and we've increased share buybacks we weren't originally planning to do any this year. We announced $300 million in the first quarter or at the beginning of the year, $500 million last quarter, and now we're upping it to 750. So we will continue to drive shareholder value and remain open to M&A opportunities as they arise. Thanks, Julian. Yeah, Nigel, I think you've got a fairly accurate assessment, as usual, about our business. We do think it's sustainable now that we've achieved it. We set it as an internal target as we started the year. We've never hit 3% in the last decade. And so to us, this was important because as you know, our service drives 80% of our profits.  And then this has that knock on effect obviously of the 5% you were talking about. So we set the target ourselves. We knew we needed to grow our portfolio in China, where the service market is growing faster than anywhere else, as well as in the emerging markets, including India, Southeast Asia, and other emerging markets. Our team has taken that onboard.  And this quarter was the first time we hit 3%, last year we were at 2%. I believe in 2019, we rounded to 1%. We have a strategy in place to execute to do this. And a lot of it is basic block and tackling, perform, drive the conversions, drive the retention, stop the cancellations, delight the customer, and then add that digital layer, that foundational layer of IoT that gives us more stickiness.  And it's not just IoT, it's our eView. It's any of our -- any time we're connected to the customer, all of our retention rate goes up, our conversion rates go up.  And so whether it's eCall, our Compass Dispatch System, everything we're doing now with our -- I'm just so excited about Gen3 and Gen360 And having now that architecture out there that will give us that foundation to continue to grow. And it's all about growing the service portfolio. So I think you've got it accurate and I think it's sustainable. Thanks, Angie. This solid first half of 2021 demonstrates the resiliency of our business, the strength of our strategy, and our ability to execute and innovate. I'm confident that this positive momentum, the dedication of our colleagues, and the pace of recovery in our end markets positions us well to deliver on the improved 2021 outlook.  Looking forward to the second half of the year, we'll remain focused on driving value for our customers, colleagues, communities, and shareholders. Thank you for joining us today, and please stay safe and well."

            "name": "Rahul Ghai",
            "content": "Thank you, Judy. And good morning, everyone. Starting with second quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales grew 22.2% to $3.7 billion as the strong growth momentum continued in New Equipment and Service grew for the second consecutive quarter. Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 25% or $115 million, and up $80 million at constant currency, primarily from the benefit of higher volume in both segments. Favorable service pricing and productivity initiatives in both New Equipment and Service helped offset the headwinds from commodity inflation and the absence of temporary cost actions taken last year to absorb the impact from COVID-19. We maintained the focus on cost containment, while continuing to invest in the business, and adjusted SG&A was down 60 basis points as a percentage of sales despite the step-up in public Company expenses. R&D spend and other strategic investments were up approximately $8 million versus prior -year, and were about flat as a percentage of sales. This strong focus on execution resulted in 40 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, and a full point of margin expansion at constant segment mix. Second quarter adjusted EPS was up 41%, or $0.23, driven primarily from $0.18 of operating profit growth and $0.06 from a lower adjusted tax rate. Moving to Slide 6. New Equipment orders were up 23.9% at constant currency with growth in all regions. Orders momentum continued in the Americas and EMEA, up approximately 47% and 19% respectively, as the markets recovered and the investments made by Otis continued to deliver. Orders in Asia were up approximately 17%. And we're up for the fifth consecutive quarter, including strength in China, where the orders were up mid-teens with record bookings during the quarter. Pricing was down 60 basis points, similar to the first quarter. Organic sales were up 25.4%, with Americas and EMEA up mid 30s, driven by strong backlog execution, as the business continues to progress towards pre-COVID levels. Asia was up mid-teens, driven by China where organic sales are up double-digits. Despite strong sales, there was broad-based growth in backlog that was up 10% and up 5% at constant currency. With backlog margin down about half a point, versus prior year including any adverse product mix impact. New Equipment adjusted operating profit was up $64 million primarily driven by higher volume. The strong year-over-year improvement in installation execution and continued focus on material productivity helped offset the unfavorable impact from price mix and commodity inflation. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 2 percentage points. Service segment results on Slide 7. Year-over-year growth in the number of units under maintenance contract accelerated to 3%, reflecting strong global improvement in retention, recapture, and conversion rates versus prior -year. Number of units increased in all regions, and China was up mid-teens after a high single-digit growth in 2020. Modernization orders was strong in the quarter, up 16.8% at constant currency as North America and Europe grew double-digits, a sharp rebound after a decline in 2020. Modernization backlog was up 4% at constant currency, providing a foundation for sales growth in the subsequent quarters. Service organic sales were up 7.8%, with growth in all lines of business. Growth accelerated in Maintenance and Repair to 7.5% from a strong recovery in repair, due to contractual maintainance remaining resilient. Modernization sales were up 9.3% from continued momentum in Asia Pacific and China, and pick up of activity in EMEA. Adjusted operating profit grew $55 million from higher volume and improved pricing, including favorability from the absence of price concessions made last year. Translational FX benefit of $24 million was more than offset by incremental public Company expenses and and the snapback of COVID related cost containment actions taken in the prior year. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded for the sixth consecutive quarter and was up 10 basis points. Overall, the first-half results reflect solid performance across all metrics, with 1.5 percentage points of New Equipment share gain, 13% Organic Sales growth, and close to $200 million of adjusted operating profit growth. First-half New Equipment and Service organic sales were up 25.3% and 4.5% respectively, with margin expansion in both segments. Free cash flow generation was robust at $1 billion, enabling us to raise dividends and complete a debt repayment and previously announced $500 million of share buyback. As we look forward to the second half of 2021 on Slide 8, we feel confident about growth across all key metrics, given higher backlog, growth momentum in all lines of business, and our focus on operational excellence. This, combined with strengthening demand in our end market s and strong first half results, gives us confidence to raise organic sales outlook to be up 7.5% to 8% for the year, up 275 basis points versus prior outlook. We now expect adjusted operating profit to grow $240 million to $260 million, up from $55 million in the prior outlook at the midpoint, with sales growth, operating profit growth, and margin expansion in both segments. Adjusted EPS is expected in a range of $2.89 to $2.93, $0.10 higher than prior outlook, and up 15% versus the prior year at the midpoint. The year-over-year EPS increase is driven by strong operating profit growth, a 140 basis point reduction in that adjusted tax rate that is now expected to be 29% for the year, from 29.5% in the prior outlook and a reduced share count.  Following the strong cash generation in the first half from net income growth and close to $300 million of reduction in working capital from the end of the year, we now expect free cash flow for the year to be in the range of $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion. This is $75 million higher than prior outlook at the midpoint, from improved net income and better working capital performance. Given the improved free cash flow outlook and the success in repatriation of foreign cash, we are increasing the share buyback target for 2021 to $750 million. In addition, we will continue our bolt-on M&A activities and are always open to other opportunistic investments that can create value for our customers and shareholders. Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9, the New Equipment business is projected to be up 12% to 13%, from 7.5% to 8.5% previously, driven by accelerated backlog conversion and continued recovery in the construction activity in several countries. This 450-basis-point increase from prior outlook includes improved expectations in all regions. EMEA is now expected to be up high single-digits, and we expect low-teens growth in the Americas and Asia driven by China. We're also improving our service outlook by 125 basis points at the midpoint, now expected to be up 4% to 4.5%. This reflects improvement in maintenance and repair, that is now expected to be up 3.5% to 4.5% from maintenance portfolio growth and stronger discretionary repair demand. Modernization business is now expected to be up mid-single-digits, driven by higher Q2 ending backlog. Overall, the Organic Sales outlook of 7.5% to 8%, reflects growth across all regions and all lines of business. Switching to operating profit on Slide 10. We now expect operating profits to be up $240 to $260 million versus prior year, including FX tailwind of approximately $70 million from strengthening of their MB, and other currencies against the U.S. dollar. At constant currency, operating profit is expected to be up a $170 to $190 million. Total Company margin is projected to improve by 30 basis points. This outlook reflects the benefits of higher volume, service, material and installation productivity initiatives, and favorable service pricing. It is partially offset by unfavorable New Equipment price mix, headwinds from incremental standalone expenses, and higher commodity prices. The commodity headwind for the year is now expected to be $70 to $80 million for the year, approximately $35 million to $40 million higher than what we communicated in April as metal prices have stayed at an elevated level. Despite this incremental headwind, we are improving our earnings outlook for the business by approximately $55 million with the improvement in both segments. And to help alleviate the incremental commodity cost impact this year and in 2022, we are broadening the price increases announced last quarter to include additional markets.  his outlook is not only a sharp turnaround from 2020, but also puts us more than $1 billion ahead of 2019 reported revenue, with 100 basis points of margin expansion. 2021 revenue, earnings, and margins in both New Equipment and Service segments are expected to be higher than 2019. This improvement reflects our confidence in long-term strategy, ability to execute, and the benefits of a solid end market recovery. And with that, may I request Angie to please open the line for questions. I think that's fair. Nick, good morning first by the way, no that's a fair assessment. I think as you look at, and Judith kind of alluded to that a little bit in her response to Jeff. I mean, if you look at between first half and second half, there's definitely -- more difficult compare both on New Equipment and on Service. We were down about 10% in the first half of last year in New Equipment, up a couple of points in the second half on New Equipment in 2020, so the compares get tougher. Service Q2 last year was the weakest quarter, I would say. And then Q3 and Q4 were down, but not as down as Q2. So definitely tougher compares getting into the second half. So that -- as we look at first half and second half compares for 2021, New Equipment growth definitely slows down, but Service is about flat in both, up 4%, 4.5% both first half and second half. So, that growth looks consistent. And then, if you look at on the Earnings side, obviously, second half reflects the change in volume growth assumptions, but also incremental commodity headwinds that we are seeing in the business, which is going to be a little bit more back-half loaded. So you're seeing that. And \u2013 but, I mean our productivity initiatives continue to deliver. We've seen good improvement in our installation execution out in the field, so that is covering a lot of issues that we're dealing with, especially on the commodity side. And if you look at first half and second half, in the second half our earnings continue to grow. Our margins continue to expand in both segments and there's a decent drop through coming on the volume growth that we're seeing. So, we're seeing about a 10 basis points expansion on the New Equipment margin in the second half, and 90 basis points overall for the year. And on Service, we're seeing about a 40 basis point, 50 basis point expansion in the second half and about 40 basis points for the full year. So, we think it's a solid second half, recognizing a slightly different environment and a bit more difficult compare. And just to add to that, John, part of the reason why we feel okay about our situation in China is if you look at the flows rate under construction, that's up more than 10% over last year and 13% over 2019. And the real estate investment in China is up 15%, so there's a lot of activity happening in China.  We feel that the overall market growth in China has gone up from mid-single digits what -- when we've started the year to maybe mid-single digits plus. And now we think it's high single-digit. The market's definitely growing, and that gives us incremental ability to pass on a little bit of price in China. Good morning, Steve. Listen, it's early days, Steve. Again, I think Judith alluded to it in a response to an earlier question. Clearly, we are very, very pleased with the progress we've made over the last couple of years since Investor Day between what we were able to do in 2020 and now '21. Between the 2 years, we have more than 100 basis points of margin expansion. it is very, very good progress, good return to growth. The numbers are above 2019 levels.  And if you look at the absolute profit dollars, I feel that is, the margins may not be, but I think if you definitely feel really good about delivering the absolute profit dollars. And maybe at that point I don't know what the peak was, but our revenue was probably $3 to $4 billion higher than where it was back in 2010, 2011.  And even if the margins are lower, I think in absolute profit dollars we may be kind of getting there. I don't know, I haven't gone back and checked the AFX numbers for 2010, 2011, but it feels like -- and that's an important metric for us.  But listen, we will continue to work it. You know we're clearly doing everything that we should be doing in the business, and we feel we've got good traction. And as Judy said earlier, we'll come back and kind of update our medium-term guidance early next year. More comes -- The numbers continue to improve in all metrics, Steve. Conversion rates are better, including conversion rates in China. I think there were -- they maintained their merging towards our 60% target that we've set for ourselves. And there'll be -- and, again, as we've said before, we expect a meaningful improvement this year in China on the conversion rates.  And we are getting there. The recapture rates are better as well in China where we have the biggest opportunity, and the retention rates continue to improve as well. I think we are making good improvements across all 3 metrics.  And like we always do, we'll update you guys annually on where we end for the year. But it was an improvement across all 3 metrics for Otis overall. And obviously, in China, you're seeing some really good traction on the portfolio growth, and the units were up in all regions. We're seeing some good traction overall in the Service portfolio. Yeah, absolutely. And if you look at the Service pricing overall, Service pricing has continued to track well. In a part of that, we reflected that in our guide as well. Service pricing continues to track well.  The concessions have come down to terminal levels overall. And this high inflationary environment that we're seeing should help us on service pricing. Because most of our contracts in Europe and Americas, have price escalators built in.  They're largely tied to labor inflation. And historically, we've always had that lever, but given low inflationary environment in the macro market, the price s don't always stick. And now with this inflationary environment, we should have a greater ability to stick to those prices. That should help next year. It was a broad-based growth, Cai. I mean, Asia Pacific, that's our next biggest opportunity in terms of portfolio growth because [Indiscernible] that had some developing markets, So that clearly continues to add to our portfolio count as well.  Asia Pacific, I would say would be number 2. And then Americas and Europe are obviously more mature market, so the portfolio growth is lower compared to the other two regions. But again, all regions grew their portfolio.  Cai, so that is obviously very, very good. And you see the overall growth accelerated. And as I said in response to an earlier question, I think that all three metrics improved. So we've seen good, good improvement. Our recapture rates are better, conversion rates continue to edge up. And obviously, China is the [Indiscernible] there.  We made a meaningful step in the right direction. And retention rates have, again, I'm repeating myself, but it just continues to improve. And every little bit helps because we've got, obviously, on 2.1 million units, every 10 basis points helps. And that was up year-over-year, the retention was up year-over-year. We've added about 100 agents -- to add a little bit more color, Cai, we've added about 100 salespeople this year. Between last year and through the first half, our sales force is up about 6%. That is -- that's a step in the right direction.  And the digital marketing efforts are also using a lot of results. Our digital sales, our bookings are up 2X where we were in the first half last year. So it's just not feet on the ground, but also the digital strategy that's paying off. Good morning, Julian. No, Julian. You heard it exactly right. I think both the statements are accurate. Pricing was down in the quarter, similar to the levels that we saw in Q1. The price increases that we put in place in Q2, that we spoke about earlier, they were in -- they were in targeted countries.  And indeed, we were very, very careful because, again, it was early in the year, we were not sure how the markets were recovering. We were very targeted in those price increases.  Obviously, that is still going through the course to the order cycle. Hopefully, we will see the benefit of that in the second half of this year. We do expect pricing headwinds in terms of absolute dollar terms to be lower in the second half than we had in the first half, so that should start to help. And then we put in prices -- incremental price increases in additional markets across the world.  This is a far more broader price increase, and this is because the markets are recovering better than what we thought. Americas, I think Judy said it earlier. Americas is now expected to be up maybe mid-to-high single-digits versus up slightly at the beginning of the year. China is going to be up more high versus mid. So markets are trending in the right direction.  That gives us confidence. Okay, market has the ability to absorb these price increases. We are -- there's a much broader price increase. And that should show up into our numbers and more in '22. And maybe some in the first-half, but maybe more in the second half in terms of absolute dollar benefit. So I think both those statements are absolutely accurate because this 60 basis points of bright decline that we saw in the quarter was more in response to the quotes that we've issued last year. On tax, Nigel, we keep making progress. We obviously lowered our tax rate to 29% from 29.5% previously, 30.4% last year, so a 140 basis point reduction in the year. I think it's moving in the right direction. Our long-term guide or medium-term guide is still in the 25% to 28% range. We continue to move towards that number.  Obviously, there's incremental improvements that you will see in '22 and then '23. And then on repatriation, listen, this -- the incremental 250 that we're able to do speaks well to the work that our teams are doing just to continue to look at different strategies to bring cash back to the U.S. where we can put it to work.  Not to rehash the stuff that you just mentioned, but it it's -- clearly shows that we are doing our job, but -- and that is something we will need to continue working on. It's not a one-and-done thing. This is something that we need to keep pushing because [Indiscernible] keep building our cash offshore, and we'll have to keep thinking of how do we bring it back to the U.S.  That has to be an ongoing activity. But really good progress. Our repatriation's probably going to be maybe 1.5-2X what we did last year. Clearly, a lot better this year. And then we'll need to think what we can do next year. That's an ongoing activity for us. Thanks, Nigel."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Otis' First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being carried live on the Internet and recorded for replay. Presentation materials are available for download from Otis' website at www.otis.com. I will now turn it over to Stacy Laszewski, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nStacy Laszewski: Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Otis' first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Judy Marks, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rahul Ghai, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note, except for otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and significant nonrecurring items. The company will also refer to adjusted results where adjustments were made as though Otis was a stand-alone company in the current period and prior year. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis' SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Stacy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us, and we hope that everyone listening is safe and well. I'm pleased to share that Otis had an outstanding first quarter, demonstrating the power of our strategy, the global execution strength of our company and the capability of all our colleagues. Our New Equipment business was robust, and we gained close to 2 points of New Equipment share with orders up high-teens globally in a market that was up mid-teens. In Korea, Otis was selected to provide approximately 170 elevators, escalators and moving walkways to support the fourth phase of the Incheon International Airport project. This addition will expand Otis' presence at the airport to over 650 units. In China, we continue to support key infrastructure projects throughout the country, including in Chang'an New Area, a new metropolis being built near Beijing. More than 1,000 Otis elevators and escalators have already been ordered in support of projects in the area that will be a new home to administrative services and residential communities being relocated from Beijing. In Munich, we're continuing an over 35-year relationship with Stadtwerke M\u00fcnchen. We have been selected to install 92 escalators for the Munich Metro's modernization project, bringing the total number of Otis escalators provided to the metro system to over 500 units, Using custom-made controllers, these escalators will seamlessly integrate with the Stadtwerke mobility app to provide passengers and maintenance crews with real-time data on escalator operational status. And finally, in New York City, we received an order to modernize 3 Times Square, the Thomson Reuters building. We'll provide new controls, drives and Compass 360 destination dispatching on several units. This extends our long-term relationship with the building. We installed the original equipment nearly 20 years ago, and have been providing maintenance services ever since. Our high-margin recurring service business also grew in all lines of business including modernization, while achieving adjusted operating profit margins of 22.6%. Our strategy is based on our Service model, which drives approximately 80% of our profit. This is the model that proves our resilience year after year, including during COVID. The global service market grows faster than the global New Equipment market, and pricing tends to be more consistent in service. Data and technology-based innovations help us attract and retain customers. And in Q1, we continued to deploy Otis ONE units in the field and are shipping IoT-enabled units in both China and North America. We drove profit growth in both segments, largely from the drop-through benefit of higher volume, with organic growth in both segments and continued benefits from our material and service productivity initiatives. Our strong performance allows us to create more value for our shareholders. In January, we completed the remaining $150 million of debt repayment we had committed to ahead of schedule. And just last week, we announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. In addition, we're now in a position to increase our planned share repurchases for the year to $0.5 billion after completing $300 million in the first quarter. And we're equally dedicated to delivering on our commitments as a global corporate citizen. In March, we share additional details with you on our important ESG initiatives, including becoming a signatory of the UN Global Compact, and we continue to make progress towards our goals. Our ESG programs are integral to bringing our vision to life. This month, we completed the inaugural year of made-to-move communities, our signature global corporate social responsibility initiative. This pioneering program focuses on two principal goals: advancing STEM education and supporting young innovators in the development of inclusive mobility solutions for underrepresented communities. Students from around the world put their knowledge and skills to work alongside Otis mentors to come up with many creative solutions. The winners were announced in April. We look forward to extending this program geographically and to more students and mentors in the coming years. Turning to Slide 4, Q1 results and 2021 outlook. First quarter new equipment orders were up high teens at constant currency, with mid-teens growth in the Americas, low single-digit growth in EMEA and double-digit growth in Asia, driven by China. On a rolling 12 months, total Otis orders were up 1.4%. This strong order performance led to continued growth in New Equipment backlog of 8% and 2% at constant currency versus the prior year. Organic sales were up 10.3% in the first quarter, with 25.1% organic growth in the New Equipment segment and 1.3% organic growth in the Service segment. Adjusted operating profit was up $83 million and margin expanded 40 basis points. Overall margin expansion was impacted by segment mix as the New Equipment business grew faster than the Service business. Free cash flow was robust at $541 million, with 176% conversion of GAAP net income. I'm encouraged by this positive momentum, and we're confident in our revised 2021 outlook improving across all key metrics. We now expect net sales to be in the range of $13.6 billion to $13.8 billion, up 6.5% to 8.5% versus prior year and up 4% to 6% organically. This is a 2-point improvement from the prior outlook at the midpoint, driven by faster-than-expected recovery in the New Equipment segment. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $170 million to $210 million of actual currency and up $120 million to $160 million at constant currency, with adjusted EPS in a range of $2.78 to $2.84, a 10% to 13% increase versus the prior year and a $0.09 improvement from the prior outlook at the midpoint. Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust in a range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, with approximately 120% conversion of GAAP net income. With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our Q1 results and 2021 outlook in more detail.\nRahul Ghai: Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with first quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales grew 14.9% to $3.4 billion, with organic sales up 10.3% as the growth momentum continued in New Equipment and Service returns to growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 18% or $83 million and up $57 million at constant currency as the drop-through in higher volume, strong material and service productivity and favorable service pricing more than offset the headwinds from New Equipment mix and pricing as well as incremental public company expenses. We maintained the focus on cost containment, while continuing to invest in the business. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A was down 20 basis points despite the step-up in public company expenses. And R&D spend and other strategic investments were about flat versus prior year. This strong focus on execution drove 40 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. First quarter adjusted EPS was up 20% or $0.12, driven by $0.13 of operating profit growth and $0.05 from a lower adjusted tax rate. This was partially offset by incremental interest cost from the full quarter impact of our external debt. Moving to Slide 6. New Equipment orders were up 18.4% at constant currency with growth in all regions. Orders rebounded strongly in Americas, up mid-teens and were up for the fourth straight quarter in Asia, including strength in China, where the orders were up double digits. Booked margin in the quarter was down 60 basis points year-over-year but improved sequentially. Organic sales were up 25.1%, with Americas and Asia up about 22% and 46%, respectively, driven by strong backlog execution. EMEA was up low single digits, sustaining the turnaround that started in Q4 of 2020. Despite the strong sales, there was broad-based growth in backlog, that was up 8% and up 2% at constant currency, with backlog margin down slightly versus prior year and up 20 basis points sequentially from prior quarter. New Equipment adjusted operating profit was up $44 million, and margin expanded 170 basis points as higher volume and strong material productivity that met our 3% target more than offset the impact of unfavorable mix and pricing. Service segment results on Slide 7. The number of units under maintenance contract increased by 2%, with growth in all regions and China up low teens after high single-digit growth in 2020 from strong improvement in underlying operational metrics. Modernization orders were up slightly at constant currency as double-digit growth in Asia, driven by successful go-to-market strategy to leverage the mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets and low single-digit growth in the Americas was partially offset by lower order intake in EMEA. Service organic sales were up 1.3% in the first quarter, with continued resiliency of the contractual maintenance business and discretionary repair and modernization sales returning to growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 60 basis points, and profit grew $35 million from the benefit of higher volume, strong contribution from productivity initiatives and favorable pricing. Translational FX benefit of $20 million was mostly offset by higher SG&A, including incremental public company expenses. As we look forward to the remainder of 2021, on Slide 8, we feel confident about growth across all key metrics, given the higher backlog, strength of the maintenance business and our focus on operational excellence. Service callbacks, our proxy for repair volume, is also showing continued sequential improvement and contributed to the growth of the repair business in the first quarter after three quarters of year-over-year decline. These encouraging trends, combined with the strong Q1 results, gives us confidence to raise the organic sales outlook to be up 4% to 6% for the year, up 2 points versus prior outlook driven by accelerated recovery in the New Equipment business. We now expect adjusted operating profit to grow $175 million to $215 million at actual currency, up $45 million from prior outlook at the midpoint, with sales growth, operating profit growth and margin expansion in both segments. Adjusted EPS is expected in a range of $2.78 to $2.84, $0.09 higher than prior outlook and up 12% versus prior year at the midpoint. The year-over-year increase is driven by strong operating profit growth, a 90 basis point reduction in the adjusted tax rate to 29.5% and reduced share count. This EPS outlook is ahead of the high single-digit medium-term growth target that we had provided at Investor Day. Following the strong cash generation in Q1 from higher net income and more than $300 million reduction in working capital, we now expect free cash flow for the year to be in a range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, $50 million higher than prior outlook at the midpoint, reflecting the improvement in net income and better working capital performance. Given the strong Q1 free cash flow and success in repatriation of foreign cash, we raised our dividend 20% last week and are increasing the share buyback target for 2021 to $500 million. Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9. The new equipment business is projected to be up between 7.5% to 8.5%, driven by accelerated backlog conversion and continued recovery in the market. This 4.5% improvement at the midpoint is driven by increased expectations in all regions and is supported by strong order intake in Q1 and demand signals from the market. Americas is now expected to be up high single digits, EMEA up low to mid-single digits and Asia up approximately 10% from improved outlook in China, and other markets in Asia Pacific returning to growth. Consistent with our prior outlook, we expect service sales to be up 2% to 4%, with maintenance and repair sales up 2% to 4% as well and modernization sales up low to mid-single digits, as maintenance remains resilient and we see continued recovery in the repair and modernization businesses. In addition to our success in Asia Pacific, modernization growth is also driven by market growth in China and conversion of backlog in the Americas and EMEA. Overall, the organic sales growth outlook of 5% at the midpoint represents a solid turnaround after a difficult 2020, with growth across all regions and all lines of business and puts us above 2019 levels in both segments on a reported basis. Switching to operating profit on Slide 10. We now expect operating profit to be up $175 million to $215 million and up $120 million to $160 million at constant currency, reflecting the benefits of higher volume, service and material productivity initiatives and favorable service pricing environment, partially offset by unfavorable mix and pricing in the New Equipment segment, headwinds from commodities and incremental stand-alone expenses. This represents a $45 million increase versus prior expectations, driven by the improvement of outlook in both segments, lower corporate expenses and higher translational FX benefit. New Equipment margins at the midpoint are now expected to be up 80 basis points for the year versus prior expectations of 50 basis points and above 2019 levels. Service margins are now expected to be up 40 basis points from 30 basis points previously, building on the 110 basis point improvement in 2020. We expect overall margin expansion of approximately 40 basis points for the year. Overall, we believe that this strong outlook for the business on sales growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation reflects our focus on execution and the benefits of a solid market recovery. And with that, I will request Stephanie to please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning everyone.\nRahul Ghai: Good morning, Nigel\nJudy Marks: Good morning. \nNigel Coe: So the New Equipment growth in the quarter was sort of like took me by surprise, especially in the Americas, we're not seeing too many signs of clear strength in many of your end markets. So I'm just wondering if you could maybe just focus perhaps a bit more in the Americas. And what's driving that strength by vertical? And then on top of that, the same question really is, are we seeing a higher mix of megaprojects in the mix is driving that growth?\nJudy Marks: Yes. Nigel, great to hear from you this morning. We were very pleased with the Americas performance quarter. And I think it goes beyond just our performance. I think we're seeing all the indicators now starting to turn, whether that's the ABI, the Architect Billing Index, which is in March was at a record since the 2007 time frame, The Dodge momentum has turned positive as well. We're seeing that \u2013 we're experiencing that in Americas. Our New Equipment organic sales were up almost 22%, and our orders were up over 14%. We're seeing that across the volume business as well as in some major projects. So there continues to be recovery, especially in North America. Brazil is still suffering some of the COVID impacts. But North America, between the U.S. and Canada, is back very strong, again, a volume type business as well as major projects. In terms of verticals, the commercial business, that commercial non-res in North America turned positive for us this quarter, and actually did a little better than residential for us in North America. So, it was a little different than we saw in 2019. But again, with the indicators and the indices heading in the right direction and this really strong performance by our Americas team, we had growth in New Equipment orders significant, but we also had growth in [mod] [ph] orders in the Americas. So, the team is executing well in local markets and then as well in national accounts.\nRahul Ghai: Yes. And the only other thing, Nigel, that I will add is the accelerated backlog. We have been talking about it that we had substantial disruption in 2020, both because of the COVID related issues in the factory and lack of access to job sites. And with those things not being as much of an issue in Q1, we saw really good field execution in the Americas specifically. So, that is where you saw the America sales being up. And the other point, just to go back to your question on large orders, if you look at the mega orders, which is like we define those as $10 million above, that\u2019s less than 10% of our volume in any given quarter. While those were up in the quarter, we saw really strong-double digit plus increase in the ongoing volume business as well. So, it was a good performance across both the Mega Project and the volume business.\nNigel Coe: Great, that\u2019s great color. Thank you very much. I will leave with that. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nJudy Marks: Good morning Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Can you just talk about what you are seeing in China, Tier 1 and Tier 2 versus some of the other tiered cities?\nJudy Marks: Yes. Steve, so we had this quarter, our best progress in a long time in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. Our strategy is working, and we increased our agents and distributors significantly in 2020. We added another 200 in the first quarter. But the ones we brought on in 2020 are really helped yielding that access that we were looking for to grow in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. The other 2 places we saw improvements were in our key accounts and in the Infrastructure segment. They had the 2 largest areas of growth for us in the 1Q in China. And that\u2019s important on the New Equipment side, but for us, it\u2019s even more important because our conversion rates for key accounts and infrastructure allow us to grow our service portfolio. Our service portfolio grew in the low-teens in China in the quarter, which beat the high-single digits from last year. So Tier 1 and Tier 2 positive, more positive than we saw in 2020.\nSteve Tusa: And then I guess just thinking about the back half there and into next year, I mean what are some of the signs you are seeing fundamentally and how do you think the trends play out in that time period?\nJudy Marks: Yes. For China specifically, Steve?\nSteve Tusa: Yes.\nJudy Marks: Yes. So it\u2019s \u2013 listen, it\u2019s a competitive market in China, and we know that. We are also watching really the credit and liquidity situation of the major developers. We are managing effectively through that. Perry and the team are doing a really good job there. And we are deploying IoT and Otis ONE there significantly, again to help us on conversions. Second half is going to be a little tougher compare for us in China, because China came back so quickly post-COVID in the second half of \u201820. So we are going to watch all those factors, but the segment in China, the New Equipment segment, is going to grow mid-single digits. It\u2019s the largest market in the world, even despite some of the cooling measures that are still in place. We think the market is more balanced, and we are going to continue to perform there.\nRahul Ghai: Yes. Steve, just a couple of other things to add related to China. Really strong start to the year in the market, as Judy said, we expected kind of mid-single digit growing into the year. And we think that market growth could be a little bit north of that. So, a little bit positive on China than we were at the beginning of the year. And the other thing is that despite all the conversations around property market cooling down the area under construction in China, the construction area is actually up 11%. So, we are seeing strong momentum in the market in China.\nSteve Tusa: Right. Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, two questions from me, if I could. First, totally understand on kind of the accelerated execution out of the backlog. Although the backlog managed to grow despite that, I just wonder if you could speak a little bit, since you don\u2019t have a ton of history to go on. Your backlog currently, relative to your forward sales expectation, is it on the low, medium or kind of about right relative to what you would expect as you kind of projected existing backlog in the future revenue conversion?\nRahul Ghai: So good morning Jeff, so is your question that is our backlog sufficient to drive growth sales in the back half, is that \u2013 you are trying to go?\nJeff Sprague: Well, yes. I mean, clearly, in dollars, it is. I am just thinking about the conversion of backlog to revenues, right, it\u2019s going to be all over the map. I would say, right, depending on the type of the project and the like. So, just when you think about your revenue guidance for the year, would you say this backlog gives you kind of above or below average comfort in that revenue forecast?\nJudy Marks: Yes. Listen, Jeff, this gives us, I would say, above average confidence. When we met you and everyone last February at our Investor Day, Rahul and I and the team said our goal was to end \u201820 with a stronger backlog than we came in, and we did that. We have now obviously grown that backlog in \u201821 in the first quarter, and we have got sufficient backlog now to see us through our \u2013 and that\u2019s what gives us confidence in our outlook. What we need to do is keep growing that backlog as we end \u201821 to position us for \u201822, and that\u2019s where we already have the team focused.\nRahul Ghai: Yes. And typically, we expect our backlog to drive maybe two-thirds of the revenue in the year. Jeff, that\u2019s kind of our typical standard. And this year, it\u2019s going to be north of that. And that\u2019s part of the accelerated backlog conversion that we have been talking about is that this year, we expect that revenue conversion to be higher. So \u2013 and that is where it is really positive to see backlog growing in the first quarter, because we did have accelerated backlog conversion over Q1 of last year, driven by better execution in the field, to Nigel\u2019s question, and higher shipments out of China. So despite that, it was really good to see the backlog growing because we did have accelerated conversion in Q1.\nJeff Sprague: And maybe just a follow-on on that, I know you probably don\u2019t want to get into detailed quarterly guidance, but given all kind of the crazy COVID comps, right, it would seem that you would have very good New Equipment growth again in the second quarter, despite the fact that you pulled forward some stuff in Q1. Can you maybe just give us a little color on kind of the magnitude of revenue conversion you are thinking about for Q2 on the new equipment side?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. So Jeff, we have always expected a strong start to the year in New Equipment because, as you pointed out, easier compares in China, but even in the Americas, because Americas revenue was down in Q1 of 2020, and yet a relatively slow start here. But as we look forward to Q2, China recovered strongly and was up high-single digits last year. But the rest of the world was still weak. So, we expect New Equipment will still be strong in the second quarter, but maybe not as strong as Q1. So, that\u2019s where we think. Then Q3 should be up as well, and then compares get up in Q4 because Americas and the EMEA market recovered very strongly last year. So on the service side, the flip side is true because we got out of the gate marginally stronger than we had expected, with the recovery of the repair business. But the impact to that full year is marginal. And so we didn\u2019t change the guide there. But the fact is that we do expect service to be up really strongly in Q2, just given the year-over-year compares were weak last year. So, that\u2019s the reason we expect service to be really strong in Q2 and then Q3 as well.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks. I will leave it there.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning.\nRahul Ghai: Good morning John.\nJohn Walsh: Two questions, if I may, as well. One, just curious when some of these property developers are going in and looking at upgrading HVAC or indoor air quality, just curious if that\u2019s an opportunity for you to have a modernization conversation with them or if they are also looking to maybe put some IoT? And just curious if those are actually pulling in some conversations with your product portfolio?\nJudy Marks: Yes, there is a correlation. And it is helpful, but it\u2019s not something we depend on. And we have a modernization sales force that are specifically focused on modernization of both equipment in our portfolio, where we have existing customer relationships as well as modernizing any equipment, but specifically Otis equipment that\u2019s not on our portfolio. There is \u2013 when someone is ready to make an investment with one of these developers, usually, it\u2019s not the developer, though, it\u2019s more the building owner now or the building manager, or the condominium association that are looking for these upgrades than the original developer. And so our sales force is very focused on that. We expect modernization to pick up. I was pleased to see modernization up in terms of orders. We were up this quarter, and we saw a nice turn there. And we are going to see that pick up, especially in EMEA. Our Europe performance and we don\u2019t talk a lot about this because the Americas and China were so strong. But our EMEA performance, New Equipment sales were up over 3%, orders were up over 3% and they had really good portfolio growth, but we see there is a pent-up demand, especially in EMEA for modernization because these customers really couldn\u2019t get to us or couldn\u2019t meet to approve mod. So whether it\u2019s health solutions, where we get integrated or standard modernization for technology, for aesthetics, or for connections with Otis ONE or our eView product, we are expecting that to pick up, especially in the second half of the year.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thank you. And then maybe a question around the Gen2 prime product offering, any update there on kind of contributions to orders growth or how the market is receiving that product?\nJudy Marks: Well, we launched Gen2 Prime in India out of our Bangalore factory. And as you can imagine, there are some challenges in India, not so much with our supply chain. We have mitigated that. And you can see based on the performance in Asia, we have mitigated supply chain challenges and had material productivity throughout over 3%. But \u2013 so we are surprised, pleasantly surprised by the number of orders we have received in India considering the current COVID and economic challenges. We have exported to Southeast Asia, the Gen2 Prime already from our Bangalore factory and are getting ready to bring it to market in the Middle East as well as Africa will be after that. So, very pleased with that product reception. It\u2019s at a great price point, entry-level point for us. And I think we are going to see that continue to make a difference for us addressing what was an area where we needed a product to bring to market. And that\u2019s where we are as an innovator.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thank you for the color.\nRahul Ghai: Thanks John.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Joel Spungin of Berenberg.\nJoel Spungin: Good morning, I was just wondering if I could pick up on your comments around the books margin being down in the quarter at 60 basis points, but improving sequentially in New Equipment. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that. Do you \u2013 is that being driven by \u2013 was the fact that it was down year-on-year being driven by pricing pressure per se in the market or is it due to changes in road mix. And if we think about why it\u2019s improved sequentially, maybe you could just elaborate, is that because there\u2019s been an easing in some of those pressures, maybe you could just give a little bit of color on that would be helpful? Thank you.\nRahul Ghai: Yes. Good afternoon. So yes, there was pricing pressure in the first quarter. And as we have said in our prepared remarks, there were headwinds from both mix and pricing. But the pricing pressure was really no surprise. I mean, we have been talking about it given the macro environment, we did expect pricing requirement to be challenges. As you said previously, we focused on taking cost out of the business. And even on the field side, we are focusing on reducing the number of installation hours. So, that\u2019s been our focus and that\u2019s where you saw a substantial improvement in the margins in the New Equipment segment. The positive that we did see was that both the backlog and the book margins improved versus Q4. And that\u2019s a positive sign because if this improvement holds through the year, that should be positive for 2022. And this is different than the trends, especially on the backlog margin. This improvement, sequential improvement is different than the trends that we were seeing last year. So, that is a positive development. And if it holds, that should be a positive for 2022.\nJoel Spungin: Okay. Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Maybe I can just take one more quickly, which is I was wondering if you had any remarks or observations around raw material costs and logistics costs? Obviously, something we discussed in the past that you didn\u2019t really talk about it too much today. Is that something that you are able to pass on without too many challenges at the moment? Do you expect it to intensify as the year goes on? Maybe you could just provide a bit of additional color.\nJudy Marks: Yes. Thanks Joel. It\u2019s Judy and good afternoon. Listen, we are, as you can see from our New Equipment, 160 basis points growth. You are seeing the drop-through and you are seeing the margin expansion offsetting competitive pricing. We have always said we will control what we can control. We can\u2019t really predict market driven pricing, but we will control what we can. And so when we started the year and in our fourth quarter and it\u2019s our first guide, we said we had accounted in our guide for about $20 million of commodity headwinds. We are seeing about $15 million to $20 million higher than that original thought than what we originally built into the guide. So, we are doing a few things about that. We are driving material productivity, even more, again 3% in the \u2013 a little over 3% in the first quarter, net of inflation, our New Equipment margins are rising. We are also targeting some pricing. Pricing is very competitive globally, but there are certain markets where we believe we can have some targeted pricing increase to offset that additional $15 million to $20 million of headwinds in a few countries not to be named, but where we think that price will come through and we will be able to offset that.\nRahul Ghai: And that is where we see \u2013 if you look at our full year guide, that is \u2013 as Judy said, we have offset the incremental commodity through pricing in these countries, so we have been able to address that. And that is where you see \u2013 if you look at our full year guide, we have now increased the margin expansion of the New Equipment segment from 50 basis points in our previous guide to 80 basis points. So, that\u2019s a good sign. And also, if you look at the remaining 3 quarters of the year, our drop through on the higher volume at constant FX is close to 20%, so good, which is above our contribution margin of 18%. So clearly, the fact is we are getting the benefit from volume and even a little bit from productivity that we are able to see in the 20% drop through for the remaining 3 quarters of the year.\nJoel Spungin: Great. Many thanks.\nRahul Ghai: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just wanted to circle back on the New Equipment profit guide. So, I think your New Equipment profits are up just under $40 million in Q1 at constant currency, and the year at the high end Q2 is guided plus $80 million, so suppose if we assume that Q2 is up decently off the easy comp, as you mentioned, very little or no profit growth in New Equipment in the second half. Maybe just help me understand, is it the weighting of that extra cost headwind you just alluded to, the tougher comp on the top line? Kind of what are those main moving pieces that mean there is very little New Equipment profit growth in the second half?\nRahul Ghai: Well, let\u2019s just kind of take away the pieces, Julian. So, in the New Equipment segment, the biggest driver for the earnings growth is going to be the 8% organic sales growth that we are talking about at midpoint and the drop through from that, along with material productivity that is offsetting the commodity headwinds. The savings that we are getting from restructuring actions that we have taken in 2020, that will help us to offset the incremental standalone cost and headwinds from some of the actions that we took last year. So \u2013 and we have raised the New Equipment earnings outlook, primarily from the higher revenue. But based on the drop through again, just to repeat what we said earlier, but based on the drop through on incremental volume for the year is close to 20%. So, we are seeing and it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s just the fact is we are seeing the drop when you see about 30% \u2013 $30 million improvement in earnings. So, it\u2019s early in the year. So it\u2019s good to be prudent, but we are seeing good drop through and good continued improvement in the New Equipment profit for us through the year.\nJulian Mitchell: I see. Is there any color on the weighting of that cost headwind you mentioned through the year, is it fairly even?\nRahul Ghai: Well, when we started the year, we expected the commodity headwinds to be more skewed towards the first half, given we were expecting prices to come down. But as we \u2013 as the prices are sitting right now, I think that commodity headwind is probably evenly spread out throughout the year, just given that commodity prices are hanging a little bit longer. So, we are expecting that to continue throughout the year. So, that is where \u2013 but it\u2019s good to see, Julian, despite that, I mean if you look at our profit guide, even for balance of the year, we are expecting close to $40 million improvement in our New Equipment earnings. So we are absorbing that. You are seeing the benefit from volume. So, we see continued improvement on the New Equipment profitability. The margins are higher in the second half. I mean based on the guide that we provided, our margins for the remaining 3 quarters of the year, up 50 basis points year-over-year. So, not only we saw very strong margin expansion in first quarter given the volume increase, but even as we go through the rest of the year, second half compares do get tougher just given the strong growth that we had in New Equipment segment, especially in the fourth quarter. But despite that, we are seeing a 50 basis point improvement in the margins in the remaining 3 quarters of the year with continued profit growth.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And maybe just a very quick one on service, you added in your profit bridge pricing as a tailwind for 2021, which wasn\u2019t there at the Q4 earnings, but you left the revenue guide for service organically unchanged. So, I just wondered, does that mean that the pricing tailwind is very small or there is some slight reduction in the volume outlook offsetting it? Just wanted to try and understand that service pricing driver a little bit better.\nJudy Marks: Yes. I think it\u2019s still early in the year. We were \u2013 we saw both repair and modernization turned positive in terms of growth first quarter, which was better than we had seen in the former 3 quarters. Julian, we use revenue per unit as our proxy for pricing and service. And the revenue per unit was up about 50 basis points. So to us, that was a very positive, and that\u2019s a global number. So, even in places that are \u2013 we can\u2019t even get to certain customers due to COVID still in a few markets, we were \u2013 really service pricing held very nicely. We are going to continue to monitor this. And obviously, we will be back to you next quarter with what we know. We do expect the second half service growth to be stronger. It\u2019s almost the counter to the New Equipment growth. And as we continue to see that trend, we will continue to evaluate what our outlook should be and share that with you.\nRahul Ghai: The other good thing that happened in the service Julian, in the first quarter was our pricing concessions that we have been providing to our customers, they continue to come down. We have seen that number continue to come down over the last 4 quarters. So that \u2013 Q2 last year was the peak, and they have been sequentially coming down. So, that was another part because it\u2019s less than $5 million for the quarter, so it\u2019s insignificant. So, that was another really positive development. And as Judy said, the pricing \u2013 overall service pricing was favorable. And that is where you saw us increase the guide. But that part, the concessions, just given the overall COVID environment, that part, we have been very careful right now just because we are not through COVID, especially if you see certain parts of the world, we are seeing some resurgence. So that part, we baked in some improvement in service pricing. We reflected that in our guide, but we were careful not to bake in the sequential reduction of service concessions in our outlook, just given the uncertainty being driver. So, we have been prudent on the absence of pricing concessions in our guide.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s good to hear. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen.\nCai von Rumohr: Thank you very much. So, help me a little bit with the quarterly pattern. If I look back at 2018, \u201819, the second quarter was on average, up 21%, 22% from the first quarter. And then obviously, normally, the third and the fourth would be down sequentially, but you were so strong in this quarter is like if you are up close to 20%. And even last year, you were up 15% sequentially. You have almost a fall off the cliff. So, I mean kind of just looking at this, the constant currency organic growth in new elevators, looks like it has opportunity, am I correct?\nRahul Ghai: So, let\u2019s just talk about the quarterly trend first, Cai. So, the difference between 2021 and maybe some of the prior years is the COVID impact. So, this year is a little bit different than the prior years. Just given the slowdown in China in Q1 of last year, so we expected and China rebounded very strongly in Q2 of 2020 just because it was a snapback. So, that is where you see. The historical trends that you mentioned, they are primarily driven by the Chinese New Year holiday. So, Q1 is typically a lighter quarter in China. And then you see an improvement in Q2. So, that\u2019s what a typical year is. But last year, that trend got magnified because of COVID. So therefore, we saw a really strong snapback in Q1 of this year. And I think the improvement in China, well, we are still going to see the sequential improvement in China that we always do, but it\u2019s not going to be to the same extent. I think that\u2019s what \u2013 in response to Jeff\u2019s question, I think that\u2019s what I was trying to say earlier. So, that\u2019s what you will see. So this year, the trends are going to look a little bit different than the prior year trends, just given that. So, we expect Q2 to be strong. We expect Q2 New Equipment sales to still be up strongly, just given Americas and EMEA compares. And again, as we said earlier, the service compares should be easy as well. So, we expect snapback in service, compares are easy, our repair and modernization revenues coming back. And the snapback of the repair revenue in Q1, that was a positive that we have not seen that year-over-year growth in the repair revenue since Q1 of 2020. So, that was a positive, and we expect that trend to accelerate in Q2 of 2020 \u2013 Q2 of 2021. So, that\u2019s the positive that we see. So, Q2 will be higher than Q1, but not to the same extent as the prior years, just given the COVID impact last year.\nJudy Marks: Yes. Cai, just a little more color. I mean we are seeing, especially in the U.S. nonresidential segment in Q1, we saw a really good snapback on the commercial side and saw a tougher residential compare. So, it actually flipped what a lot of other markets are seeing. So, we are seeing this turn in non-res. We experienced it both on the order side, but the residential was a little tougher for us in the Americas.\nCai von Rumohr: Very helpful. And then on Otis ONE rollouts, I think you did 100,000, and I think that\u2019s the target for this year. Can you update us, can you do a little better than that, what are the main countries you expect to roll out?\nJudy Marks: We anticipate doing a lot better. Otis ONE is a key element of our strategy for portfolio growth anytime we are connected whether it\u2019s Otis ONE or our Compass destination dispatch system, eView, anytime we are connected, we get better conversions where people come to us for service. And then we also get improved retention. And our retention rate did maintain at 94%, which we believe is the best in the industry. We will at least deliver as many as in 2020, which was 100,000 in \u201821. We have started shipping all units out of our China factories, in our North America factories already Otis ONE IoT enabled. And we will, beyond the 6 countries last year, which were China, the U.S and 4 in Europe, we are going to be adding some in Asia Pacific as well this year. There is great pull. We just \u2013 again, this is about a focused strategy on density. So, we don\u2019t want to send Otis ONE to every country simultaneously, we want to have the ability to define where we are going to put it because it\u2019s on our capital investment, so that we can yield the productivity we expect from it and then obviously, also give our customers some additional insight beyond the productivity and the information for our mechanics to perform even better. So again, it\u2019s a logical strategic rollout, and we will be adding some countries in Asia Pacific as well as potentially another few in EMEA.\nCai von Rumohr: Very helpful. Thanks so much.\nRahul Ghai: Thanks, Cai.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Carter Copeland of Melius Research.\nCarter Copeland: Just a couple of points of quick clarification. First, on the revenue per unit, the 60 bps that you mentioned, Judy, any color you can help us understand there on regional differences in that number that you are seeing? And then just on the service portfolio growth, I know you highlighted the China number versus the 2% overall. But I wonder if you can tell us if there is any ISP share in there, if you are having any success in that front that\u2019s measurable that\u2019s worth talking about? Thanks.\nJudy Marks: So great to hear from you, Carter. It was 50 basis points on revenue per unit. So let me make sure I said that correctly. We saw that up everywhere, except one major country in Asia Pacific, where we had some very challenging service pricing, but not enough to obviously be material. So China was up, EMEA was up, Americas was up and the majority of challenging service pricing, but not exception of one kind of mature country. So those results really stand tall. It's important for us that, that happens in first quarter because that's when so many of the maintenance contracts get resigned. That's \u2013 if we have a sense of seasonality, that's where it happens. So that's why that was so important for us. In terms of portfolio in China, we are taking it away from the ISPs. There's no doubt now with the pace and the rate that we're securing that portfolio growth in China, that's exactly who we're taking it away from. And we've shared our strategy where we've expanded Service depots. We've added our reach in the Tier 5 and on cities, and it's paying off. And so again, double-digit teens in China in the first quarter, and they just have sequentially now for the past three or four quarters, continue to improve their portfolio attachment rate. Everywhere else, In terms of portfolio, we had EMEA had good growth. We had growth in the Americas. And again, the Asia growth was more driven by China.\nCarter Copeland: Great. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: At this time, we have no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to Judy Marks for any closing remarks.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Stephanie. On April 3, we celebrated our 1-year anniversary as a stand-alone public company. I am proud of what our 69,000 colleagues accomplished in every corner of the globe, serving our customers, keeping passengers moving and building our company at a time of global crisis. We had a very strong start to 2021, and I'm confident that our positive momentum and the continued recovery in our end markets positions us well to deliver our improved 2021 outlook. We'll remain focused on driving value for our customers, colleagues, communities and shareholders. Everyone, stay safe and well. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Judy Marks",
            "content": "Thank you, Stacy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us, and we hope that everyone listening is safe and well. I'm pleased to share that Otis had an outstanding first quarter, demonstrating the power of our strategy, the global execution strength of our company and the capability of all our colleagues. Our New Equipment business was robust, and we gained close to 2 points of New Equipment share with orders up high-teens globally in a market that was up mid-teens. In Korea, Otis was selected to provide approximately 170 elevators, escalators and moving walkways to support the fourth phase of the Incheon International Airport project. This addition will expand Otis' presence at the airport to over 650 units. In China, we continue to support key infrastructure projects throughout the country, including in Chang'an New Area, a new metropolis being built near Beijing. More than 1,000 Otis elevators and escalators have already been ordered in support of projects in the area that will be a new home to administrative services and residential communities being relocated from Beijing. In Munich, we're continuing an over 35-year relationship with Stadtwerke Mu\u0308nchen. We have been selected to install 92 escalators for the Munich Metro's modernization project, bringing the total number of Otis escalators provided to the metro system to over 500 units, Using custom-made controllers, these escalators will seamlessly integrate with the Stadtwerke mobility app to provide passengers and maintenance crews with real-time data on escalator operational status. And finally, in New York City, we received an order to modernize 3 Times Square, the Thomson Reuters building. We'll provide new controls, drives and Compass 360 destination dispatching on several units. This extends our long-term relationship with the building. We installed the original equipment nearly 20 years ago, and have been providing maintenance services ever since. Our high-margin recurring service business also grew in all lines of business including modernization, while achieving adjusted operating profit margins of 22.6%. Our strategy is based on our Service model, which drives approximately 80% of our profit. This is the model that proves our resilience year after year, including during COVID. The global service market grows faster than the global New Equipment market, and pricing tends to be more consistent in service. Data and technology-based innovations help us attract and retain customers. And in Q1, we continued to deploy Otis ONE units in the field and are shipping IoT-enabled units in both China and North America. We drove profit growth in both segments, largely from the drop-through benefit of higher volume, with organic growth in both segments and continued benefits from our material and service productivity initiatives. Our strong performance allows us to create more value for our shareholders. In January, we completed the remaining $150 million of debt repayment we had committed to ahead of schedule. And just last week, we announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. In addition, we're now in a position to increase our planned share repurchases for the year to $0.5 billion after completing $300 million in the first quarter. And we're equally dedicated to delivering on our commitments as a global corporate citizen. In March, we share additional details with you on our important ESG initiatives, including becoming a signatory of the UN Global Compact, and we continue to make progress towards our goals. Our ESG programs are integral to bringing our vision to life. This month, we completed the inaugural year of made-to-move communities, our signature global corporate social responsibility initiative. This pioneering program focuses on two principal goals: advancing STEM education and supporting young innovators in the development of inclusive mobility solutions for underrepresented communities. Students from around the world put their knowledge and skills to work alongside Otis mentors to come up with many creative solutions. The winners were announced in April. We look forward to extending this program geographically and to more students and mentors in the coming years. Turning to Slide 4, Q1 results and 2021 outlook. First quarter new equipment orders were up high teens at constant currency, with mid-teens growth in the Americas, low single-digit growth in EMEA and double-digit growth in Asia, driven by China. On a rolling 12 months, total Otis orders were up 1.4%. This strong order performance led to continued growth in New Equipment backlog of 8% and 2% at constant currency versus the prior year. Organic sales were up 10.3% in the first quarter, with 25.1% organic growth in the New Equipment segment and 1.3% organic growth in the Service segment. Adjusted operating profit was up $83 million and margin expanded 40 basis points. Overall margin expansion was impacted by segment mix as the New Equipment business grew faster than the Service business. Free cash flow was robust at $541 million, with 176% conversion of GAAP net income. I'm encouraged by this positive momentum, and we're confident in our revised 2021 outlook improving across all key metrics. We now expect net sales to be in the range of $13.6 billion to $13.8 billion, up 6.5% to 8.5% versus prior year and up 4% to 6% organically. This is a 2-point improvement from the prior outlook at the midpoint, driven by faster-than-expected recovery in the New Equipment segment. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $170 million to $210 million of actual currency and up $120 million to $160 million at constant currency, with adjusted EPS in a range of $2.78 to $2.84, a 10% to 13% increase versus the prior year and a $0.09 improvement from the prior outlook at the midpoint. Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust in a range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, with approximately 120% conversion of GAAP net income. With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our Q1 results and 2021 outlook in more detail. Good morning. Yes. Nigel, great to hear from you this morning. We were very pleased with the Americas performance quarter. And I think it goes beyond just our performance. I think we're seeing all the indicators now starting to turn, whether that's the ABI, the Architect Billing Index, which is in March was at a record since the 2007 time frame, The Dodge momentum has turned positive as well. We're seeing that \u2013 we're experiencing that in Americas. Our New Equipment organic sales were up almost 22%, and our orders were up over 14%. We're seeing that across the volume business as well as in some major projects. So there continues to be recovery, especially in North America. Brazil is still suffering some of the COVID impacts. But North America, between the U.S. and Canada, is back very strong, again, a volume type business as well as major projects. In terms of verticals, the commercial business, that commercial non-res in North America turned positive for us this quarter, and actually did a little better than residential for us in North America. So, it was a little different than we saw in 2019. But again, with the indicators and the indices heading in the right direction and this really strong performance by our Americas team, we had growth in New Equipment orders significant, but we also had growth in [mod] [ph] orders in the Americas. So, the team is executing well in local markets and then as well in national accounts. Good morning Steve. Yes. Steve, so we had this quarter, our best progress in a long time in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. Our strategy is working, and we increased our agents and distributors significantly in 2020. We added another 200 in the first quarter. But the ones we brought on in 2020 are really helped yielding that access that we were looking for to grow in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. The other 2 places we saw improvements were in our key accounts and in the Infrastructure segment. They had the 2 largest areas of growth for us in the 1Q in China. And that's important on the New Equipment side, but for us, it's even more important because our conversion rates for key accounts and infrastructure allow us to grow our service portfolio. Our service portfolio grew in the low-teens in China in the quarter, which beat the high-single digits from last year. So Tier 1 and Tier 2 positive, more positive than we saw in 2020. Yes. For China specifically, Steve? Yes. So it's \u2013 listen, it's a competitive market in China, and we know that. We are also watching really the credit and liquidity situation of the major developers. We are managing effectively through that. Perry and the team are doing a really good job there. And we are deploying IoT and Otis ONE there significantly, again to help us on conversions. Second half is going to be a little tougher compare for us in China, because China came back so quickly post-COVID in the second half of \u201820. So we are going to watch all those factors, but the segment in China, the New Equipment segment, is going to grow mid-single digits. It's the largest market in the world, even despite some of the cooling measures that are still in place. We think the market is more balanced, and we are going to continue to perform there. Yes. Listen, Jeff, this gives us, I would say, above average confidence. When we met you and everyone last February at our Investor Day, Rahul and I and the team said our goal was to end \u201820 with a stronger backlog than we came in, and we did that. We have now obviously grown that backlog in \u201821 in the first quarter, and we have got sufficient backlog now to see us through our \u2013 and that's what gives us confidence in our outlook. What we need to do is keep growing that backlog as we end \u201821 to position us for \u201822, and that's where we already have the team focused. Yes, there is a correlation. And it is helpful, but it's not something we depend on. And we have a modernization sales force that are specifically focused on modernization of both equipment in our portfolio, where we have existing customer relationships as well as modernizing any equipment, but specifically Otis equipment that's not on our portfolio. There is \u2013 when someone is ready to make an investment with one of these developers, usually, it's not the developer, though, it's more the building owner now or the building manager, or the condominium association that are looking for these upgrades than the original developer. And so our sales force is very focused on that. We expect modernization to pick up. I was pleased to see modernization up in terms of orders. We were up this quarter, and we saw a nice turn there. And we are going to see that pick up, especially in EMEA. Our Europe performance and we don't talk a lot about this because the Americas and China were so strong. But our EMEA performance, New Equipment sales were up over 3%, orders were up over 3% and they had really good portfolio growth, but we see there is a pent-up demand, especially in EMEA for modernization because these customers really couldn't get to us or couldn't meet to approve mod. So whether it's health solutions, where we get integrated or standard modernization for technology, for aesthetics, or for connections with Otis ONE or our eView product, we are expecting that to pick up, especially in the second half of the year. Well, we launched Gen2 Prime in India out of our Bangalore factory. And as you can imagine, there are some challenges in India, not so much with our supply chain. We have mitigated that. And you can see based on the performance in Asia, we have mitigated supply chain challenges and had material productivity throughout over 3%. But \u2013 so we are surprised, pleasantly surprised by the number of orders we have received in India considering the current COVID and economic challenges. We have exported to Southeast Asia, the Gen2 Prime already from our Bangalore factory and are getting ready to bring it to market in the Middle East as well as Africa will be after that. So, very pleased with that product reception. It's at a great price point, entry-level point for us. And I think we are going to see that continue to make a difference for us addressing what was an area where we needed a product to bring to market. And that's where we are as an innovator. Yes. Thanks Joel. It's Judy and good afternoon. Listen, we are, as you can see from our New Equipment, 160 basis points growth. You are seeing the drop-through and you are seeing the margin expansion offsetting competitive pricing. We have always said we will control what we can control. We can't really predict market driven pricing, but we will control what we can. And so when we started the year and in our fourth quarter and it's our first guide, we said we had accounted in our guide for about $20 million of commodity headwinds. We are seeing about $15 million to $20 million higher than that original thought than what we originally built into the guide. So, we are doing a few things about that. We are driving material productivity, even more, again 3% in the \u2013 a little over 3% in the first quarter, net of inflation, our New Equipment margins are rising. We are also targeting some pricing. Pricing is very competitive globally, but there are certain markets where we believe we can have some targeted pricing increase to offset that additional $15 million to $20 million of headwinds in a few countries not to be named, but where we think that price will come through and we will be able to offset that. Yes. I think it's still early in the year. We were \u2013 we saw both repair and modernization turned positive in terms of growth first quarter, which was better than we had seen in the former 3 quarters. Julian, we use revenue per unit as our proxy for pricing and service. And the revenue per unit was up about 50 basis points. So to us, that was a very positive, and that's a global number. So, even in places that are \u2013 we can't even get to certain customers due to COVID still in a few markets, we were \u2013 really service pricing held very nicely. We are going to continue to monitor this. And obviously, we will be back to you next quarter with what we know. We do expect the second half service growth to be stronger. It's almost the counter to the New Equipment growth. And as we continue to see that trend, we will continue to evaluate what our outlook should be and share that with you. Yes. Cai, just a little more color. I mean we are seeing, especially in the U.S. nonresidential segment in Q1, we saw a really good snapback on the commercial side and saw a tougher residential compare. So, it actually flipped what a lot of other markets are seeing. So, we are seeing this turn in non-res. We experienced it both on the order side, but the residential was a little tougher for us in the Americas. We anticipate doing a lot better. Otis ONE is a key element of our strategy for portfolio growth anytime we are connected whether it's Otis ONE or our Compass destination dispatch system, eView, anytime we are connected, we get better conversions where people come to us for service. And then we also get improved retention. And our retention rate did maintain at 94%, which we believe is the best in the industry. We will at least deliver as many as in 2020, which was 100,000 in \u201821. We have started shipping all units out of our China factories, in our North America factories already Otis ONE IoT enabled. And we will, beyond the 6 countries last year, which were China, the U.S and 4 in Europe, we are going to be adding some in Asia Pacific as well this year. There is great pull. We just \u2013 again, this is about a focused strategy on density. So, we don't want to send Otis ONE to every country simultaneously, we want to have the ability to define where we are going to put it because it's on our capital investment, so that we can yield the productivity we expect from it and then obviously, also give our customers some additional insight beyond the productivity and the information for our mechanics to perform even better. So again, it's a logical strategic rollout, and we will be adding some countries in Asia Pacific as well as potentially another few in EMEA. So great to hear from you, Carter. It was 50 basis points on revenue per unit. So let me make sure I said that correctly. We saw that up everywhere, except one major country in Asia Pacific, where we had some very challenging service pricing, but not enough to obviously be material. So China was up, EMEA was up, Americas was up and the majority of challenging service pricing, but not exception of one kind of mature country. So those results really stand tall. It's important for us that, that happens in first quarter because that's when so many of the maintenance contracts get resigned. That's \u2013 if we have a sense of seasonality, that's where it happens. So that's why that was so important for us. In terms of portfolio in China, we are taking it away from the ISPs. There's no doubt now with the pace and the rate that we're securing that portfolio growth in China, that's exactly who we're taking it away from. And we've shared our strategy where we've expanded Service depots. We've added our reach in the Tier 5 and on cities, and it's paying off. And so again, double-digit teens in China in the first quarter, and they just have sequentially now for the past three or four quarters, continue to improve their portfolio attachment rate. Everywhere else, In terms of portfolio, we had EMEA had good growth. We had growth in the Americas. And again, the Asia growth was more driven by China. Thank you, Stephanie. On April 3, we celebrated our 1-year anniversary as a stand-alone public company. I am proud of what our 69,000 colleagues accomplished in every corner of the globe, serving our customers, keeping passengers moving and building our company at a time of global crisis. We had a very strong start to 2021, and I'm confident that our positive momentum and the continued recovery in our end markets positions us well to deliver our improved 2021 outlook. We'll remain focused on driving value for our customers, colleagues, communities and shareholders. Everyone, stay safe and well. Take care."

            "name": "Rahul Ghai",
            "content": "Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with first quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales grew 14.9% to $3.4 billion, with organic sales up 10.3% as the growth momentum continued in New Equipment and Service returns to growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 18% or $83 million and up $57 million at constant currency as the drop-through in higher volume, strong material and service productivity and favorable service pricing more than offset the headwinds from New Equipment mix and pricing as well as incremental public company expenses. We maintained the focus on cost containment, while continuing to invest in the business. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A was down 20 basis points despite the step-up in public company expenses. And R&D spend and other strategic investments were about flat versus prior year. This strong focus on execution drove 40 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. First quarter adjusted EPS was up 20% or $0.12, driven by $0.13 of operating profit growth and $0.05 from a lower adjusted tax rate. This was partially offset by incremental interest cost from the full quarter impact of our external debt. Moving to Slide 6. New Equipment orders were up 18.4% at constant currency with growth in all regions. Orders rebounded strongly in Americas, up mid-teens and were up for the fourth straight quarter in Asia, including strength in China, where the orders were up double digits. Booked margin in the quarter was down 60 basis points year-over-year but improved sequentially. Organic sales were up 25.1%, with Americas and Asia up about 22% and 46%, respectively, driven by strong backlog execution. EMEA was up low single digits, sustaining the turnaround that started in Q4 of 2020. Despite the strong sales, there was broad-based growth in backlog, that was up 8% and up 2% at constant currency, with backlog margin down slightly versus prior year and up 20 basis points sequentially from prior quarter. New Equipment adjusted operating profit was up $44 million, and margin expanded 170 basis points as higher volume and strong material productivity that met our 3% target more than offset the impact of unfavorable mix and pricing. Service segment results on Slide 7. The number of units under maintenance contract increased by 2%, with growth in all regions and China up low teens after high single-digit growth in 2020 from strong improvement in underlying operational metrics. Modernization orders were up slightly at constant currency as double-digit growth in Asia, driven by successful go-to-market strategy to leverage the mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets and low single-digit growth in the Americas was partially offset by lower order intake in EMEA. Service organic sales were up 1.3% in the first quarter, with continued resiliency of the contractual maintenance business and discretionary repair and modernization sales returning to growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 60 basis points, and profit grew $35 million from the benefit of higher volume, strong contribution from productivity initiatives and favorable pricing. Translational FX benefit of $20 million was mostly offset by higher SG&A, including incremental public company expenses. As we look forward to the remainder of 2021, on Slide 8, we feel confident about growth across all key metrics, given the higher backlog, strength of the maintenance business and our focus on operational excellence. Service callbacks, our proxy for repair volume, is also showing continued sequential improvement and contributed to the growth of the repair business in the first quarter after three quarters of year-over-year decline. These encouraging trends, combined with the strong Q1 results, gives us confidence to raise the organic sales outlook to be up 4% to 6% for the year, up 2 points versus prior outlook driven by accelerated recovery in the New Equipment business. We now expect adjusted operating profit to grow $175 million to $215 million at actual currency, up $45 million from prior outlook at the midpoint, with sales growth, operating profit growth and margin expansion in both segments. Adjusted EPS is expected in a range of $2.78 to $2.84, $0.09 higher than prior outlook and up 12% versus prior year at the midpoint. The year-over-year increase is driven by strong operating profit growth, a 90 basis point reduction in the adjusted tax rate to 29.5% and reduced share count. This EPS outlook is ahead of the high single-digit medium-term growth target that we had provided at Investor Day. Following the strong cash generation in Q1 from higher net income and more than $300 million reduction in working capital, we now expect free cash flow for the year to be in a range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, $50 million higher than prior outlook at the midpoint, reflecting the improvement in net income and better working capital performance. Given the strong Q1 free cash flow and success in repatriation of foreign cash, we raised our dividend 20% last week and are increasing the share buyback target for 2021 to $500 million. Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9. The new equipment business is projected to be up between 7.5% to 8.5%, driven by accelerated backlog conversion and continued recovery in the market. This 4.5% improvement at the midpoint is driven by increased expectations in all regions and is supported by strong order intake in Q1 and demand signals from the market. Americas is now expected to be up high single digits, EMEA up low to mid-single digits and Asia up approximately 10% from improved outlook in China, and other markets in Asia Pacific returning to growth. Consistent with our prior outlook, we expect service sales to be up 2% to 4%, with maintenance and repair sales up 2% to 4% as well and modernization sales up low to mid-single digits, as maintenance remains resilient and we see continued recovery in the repair and modernization businesses. In addition to our success in Asia Pacific, modernization growth is also driven by market growth in China and conversion of backlog in the Americas and EMEA. Overall, the organic sales growth outlook of 5% at the midpoint represents a solid turnaround after a difficult 2020, with growth across all regions and all lines of business and puts us above 2019 levels in both segments on a reported basis. Switching to operating profit on Slide 10. We now expect operating profit to be up $175 million to $215 million and up $120 million to $160 million at constant currency, reflecting the benefits of higher volume, service and material productivity initiatives and favorable service pricing environment, partially offset by unfavorable mix and pricing in the New Equipment segment, headwinds from commodities and incremental stand-alone expenses. This represents a $45 million increase versus prior expectations, driven by the improvement of outlook in both segments, lower corporate expenses and higher translational FX benefit. New Equipment margins at the midpoint are now expected to be up 80 basis points for the year versus prior expectations of 50 basis points and above 2019 levels. Service margins are now expected to be up 40 basis points from 30 basis points previously, building on the 110 basis point improvement in 2020. We expect overall margin expansion of approximately 40 basis points for the year. Overall, we believe that this strong outlook for the business on sales growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation reflects our focus on execution and the benefits of a solid market recovery. And with that, I will request Stephanie to please open the line for questions. Good morning, Nigel Yes. And the only other thing, Nigel, that I will add is the accelerated backlog. We have been talking about it that we had substantial disruption in 2020, both because of the COVID related issues in the factory and lack of access to job sites. And with those things not being as much of an issue in Q1, we saw really good field execution in the Americas specifically. So, that is where you saw the America sales being up. And the other point, just to go back to your question on large orders, if you look at the mega orders, which is like we define those as $10 million above, that's less than 10% of our volume in any given quarter. While those were up in the quarter, we saw really strong-double digit plus increase in the ongoing volume business as well. So, it was a good performance across both the Mega Project and the volume business. Yes. Steve, just a couple of other things to add related to China. Really strong start to the year in the market, as Judy said, we expected kind of mid-single digit growing into the year. And we think that market growth could be a little bit north of that. So, a little bit positive on China than we were at the beginning of the year. And the other thing is that despite all the conversations around property market cooling down the area under construction in China, the construction area is actually up 11%. So, we are seeing strong momentum in the market in China. So good morning Jeff, so is your question that is our backlog sufficient to drive growth sales in the back half, is that \u2013 you are trying to go? Yes. And typically, we expect our backlog to drive maybe two-thirds of the revenue in the year. Jeff, that's kind of our typical standard. And this year, it's going to be north of that. And that's part of the accelerated backlog conversion that we have been talking about is that this year, we expect that revenue conversion to be higher. So \u2013 and that is where it is really positive to see backlog growing in the first quarter, because we did have accelerated backlog conversion over Q1 of last year, driven by better execution in the field, to Nigel's question, and higher shipments out of China. So despite that, it was really good to see the backlog growing because we did have accelerated conversion in Q1. Yes. So Jeff, we have always expected a strong start to the year in New Equipment because, as you pointed out, easier compares in China, but even in the Americas, because Americas revenue was down in Q1 of 2020, and yet a relatively slow start here. But as we look forward to Q2, China recovered strongly and was up high-single digits last year. But the rest of the world was still weak. So, we expect New Equipment will still be strong in the second quarter, but maybe not as strong as Q1. So, that's where we think. Then Q3 should be up as well, and then compares get up in Q4 because Americas and the EMEA market recovered very strongly last year. So on the service side, the flip side is true because we got out of the gate marginally stronger than we had expected, with the recovery of the repair business. But the impact to that full year is marginal. And so we didn't change the guide there. But the fact is that we do expect service to be up really strongly in Q2, just given the year-over-year compares were weak last year. So, that's the reason we expect service to be really strong in Q2 and then Q3 as well. Good morning John. Thanks John. Yes. Good afternoon. So yes, there was pricing pressure in the first quarter. And as we have said in our prepared remarks, there were headwinds from both mix and pricing. But the pricing pressure was really no surprise. I mean, we have been talking about it given the macro environment, we did expect pricing requirement to be challenges. As you said previously, we focused on taking cost out of the business. And even on the field side, we are focusing on reducing the number of installation hours. So, that's been our focus and that's where you saw a substantial improvement in the margins in the New Equipment segment. The positive that we did see was that both the backlog and the book margins improved versus Q4. And that's a positive sign because if this improvement holds through the year, that should be positive for 2022. And this is different than the trends, especially on the backlog margin. This improvement, sequential improvement is different than the trends that we were seeing last year. So, that is a positive development. And if it holds, that should be a positive for 2022. And that is where we see \u2013 if you look at our full year guide, that is \u2013 as Judy said, we have offset the incremental commodity through pricing in these countries, so we have been able to address that. And that is where you see \u2013 if you look at our full year guide, we have now increased the margin expansion of the New Equipment segment from 50 basis points in our previous guide to 80 basis points. So, that's a good sign. And also, if you look at the remaining 3 quarters of the year, our drop through on the higher volume at constant FX is close to 20%, so good, which is above our contribution margin of 18%. So clearly, the fact is we are getting the benefit from volume and even a little bit from productivity that we are able to see in the 20% drop through for the remaining 3 quarters of the year. Thank you. Well, let's just kind of take away the pieces, Julian. So, in the New Equipment segment, the biggest driver for the earnings growth is going to be the 8% organic sales growth that we are talking about at midpoint and the drop through from that, along with material productivity that is offsetting the commodity headwinds. The savings that we are getting from restructuring actions that we have taken in 2020, that will help us to offset the incremental standalone cost and headwinds from some of the actions that we took last year. So \u2013 and we have raised the New Equipment earnings outlook, primarily from the higher revenue. But based on the drop through again, just to repeat what we said earlier, but based on the drop through on incremental volume for the year is close to 20%. So, we are seeing and it's \u2013 it's just the fact is we are seeing the drop when you see about 30% \u2013 $30 million improvement in earnings. So, it's early in the year. So it's good to be prudent, but we are seeing good drop through and good continued improvement in the New Equipment profit for us through the year. Well, when we started the year, we expected the commodity headwinds to be more skewed towards the first half, given we were expecting prices to come down. But as we \u2013 as the prices are sitting right now, I think that commodity headwind is probably evenly spread out throughout the year, just given that commodity prices are hanging a little bit longer. So, we are expecting that to continue throughout the year. So, that is where \u2013 but it's good to see, Julian, despite that, I mean if you look at our profit guide, even for balance of the year, we are expecting close to $40 million improvement in our New Equipment earnings. So we are absorbing that. You are seeing the benefit from volume. So, we see continued improvement on the New Equipment profitability. The margins are higher in the second half. I mean based on the guide that we provided, our margins for the remaining 3 quarters of the year, up 50 basis points year-over-year. So, not only we saw very strong margin expansion in first quarter given the volume increase, but even as we go through the rest of the year, second half compares do get tougher just given the strong growth that we had in New Equipment segment, especially in the fourth quarter. But despite that, we are seeing a 50 basis point improvement in the margins in the remaining 3 quarters of the year with continued profit growth. The other good thing that happened in the service Julian, in the first quarter was our pricing concessions that we have been providing to our customers, they continue to come down. We have seen that number continue to come down over the last 4 quarters. So that \u2013 Q2 last year was the peak, and they have been sequentially coming down. So, that was another part because it's less than $5 million for the quarter, so it's insignificant. So, that was another really positive development. And as Judy said, the pricing \u2013 overall service pricing was favorable. And that is where you saw us increase the guide. But that part, the concessions, just given the overall COVID environment, that part, we have been very careful right now just because we are not through COVID, especially if you see certain parts of the world, we are seeing some resurgence. So that part, we baked in some improvement in service pricing. We reflected that in our guide, but we were careful not to bake in the sequential reduction of service concessions in our outlook, just given the uncertainty being driver. So, we have been prudent on the absence of pricing concessions in our guide. So, let's just talk about the quarterly trend first, Cai. So, the difference between 2021 and maybe some of the prior years is the COVID impact. So, this year is a little bit different than the prior years. Just given the slowdown in China in Q1 of last year, so we expected and China rebounded very strongly in Q2 of 2020 just because it was a snapback. So, that is where you see. The historical trends that you mentioned, they are primarily driven by the Chinese New Year holiday. So, Q1 is typically a lighter quarter in China. And then you see an improvement in Q2. So, that's what a typical year is. But last year, that trend got magnified because of COVID. So therefore, we saw a really strong snapback in Q1 of this year. And I think the improvement in China, well, we are still going to see the sequential improvement in China that we always do, but it's not going to be to the same extent. I think that's what \u2013 in response to Jeff's question, I think that's what I was trying to say earlier. So, that's what you will see. So this year, the trends are going to look a little bit different than the prior year trends, just given that. So, we expect Q2 to be strong. We expect Q2 New Equipment sales to still be up strongly, just given Americas and EMEA compares. And again, as we said earlier, the service compares should be easy as well. So, we expect snapback in service, compares are easy, our repair and modernization revenues coming back. And the snapback of the repair revenue in Q1, that was a positive that we have not seen that year-over-year growth in the repair revenue since Q1 of 2020. So, that was a positive, and we expect that trend to accelerate in Q2 of 2020 \u2013 Q2 of 2021. So, that's the positive that we see. So, Q2 will be higher than Q1, but not to the same extent as the prior years, just given the COVID impact last year. Thanks, Cai."

Presentation materials are available for download from Otis\u2019 website at www.otis.com. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Michael Rednor, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Rednor: Thank you, Norma. Welcome to Otis\u2019 fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Judy Marks, Chair, CEO and President; and Anurag Maheshwari, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and significant nonrecurring items. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis\u2019 SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Judy.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We hope everyone listening is safe and well. We\u2019re pleased that we ended the year with a strong fourth quarter and solid full year performance in a year characterized by a variety of macro headwinds. We entered 2023 with good momentum as we continue to execute our four strategic pillars: sustaining new equipment growth, accelerating service portfolio growth, advancing digitalization, while focusing and empowering our organization. I\u2019m proud of our colleagues around the globe who delivered these results demonstrating the strategic resiliency of our company as we continue to grow and perform in 2022. Starting on Slide 3. We continue to perform well in New Equipment Orders, growing 7% for the full year. In the quarter, orders grew 4%, with particularly strong performance in EMEA and continued solid performance in Asia-Pacific. China orders returned to growth with mid-single-digit performance in the quarter. Orders in the Americas were down 4% in the quarter, although the business had a very strong 2022 overall, with orders up almost 18%. Our New Equipment adjusted backlog at constant currency is up 11% heading into 2023, giving us solid multiyear visibility to grow sales. Organic sales increased 2.5%, driven by service, which grew 6%. We grew our industry-leading maintenance portfolio by 4.1%. It now stands at 2.2 million units, a new milestone for our company. We delivered 7.5% adjusted EPS growth despite $156 million in foreign exchange-related headwinds. We generated $1.45 billion in free cash flow, allowing us to return $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We continue to win many exciting projects based on our innovation, ability to deliver and the trust customers have in us. For example, in the Americas, Otis was selected to provide our Compass destination dispatch system, along with six SkyRise and two Gen 3 elevators for City Centre 4 in Surrey, British Columbia. The 23-storey building will be built to lead gold standards and extends our more than six-year relationship with the Lark Group. In China, Tianjin Metro has been using Otis equipment since opening in 1984. In November, Otis was selected to provide more than 120 escalators and Gen 3 elevators for their new Line 4 Northern Extension. This takes the number of Otis units on the Port City\u2019s expanding subway network to more than 1,500. These new elevators will be connected to the Otis ONE IoT-based platform, already delivering real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance for the metro system. In the UK, we\u2019ve had a longstanding relationship with Transport for London, including a long-term contract through 2042, to manufacture, install and maintain the escalators and travelators on the busy network. Most recently, we were contracted to provide Battersea station with specialty escalators, specifically designed to run for about 20 hours a day and extend 24 meters in length and nine meters in rise. We\u2019re playing our part to keep the busy network flowing. Our ESG initiatives continued to progress in 2022, helping to drive stakeholder value alongside our financial priorities. Our manufacturing facility in Florence, South Carolina achieved gold level total resource and use efficiency, or true certification, recognizing its success in zero waste. With this achievement, Otis has become the first in the elevator industry to have a true certified facility, helping us towards our goal of having all our factories eligible for zero waste to landfill certification by 2025. We look forward to sharing more about our ESG progress in our second annual ESG report, which is set to be published in the spring. Moving to Slide 4. With strong orders performance in 2022, we were able to achieved approximately 1 point of new equipment share gain, on top of the 2-point increase between 2020 and 2021. For the first quarter since Q4 2021, New Equipment sales returned to growth as we continued the strong growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific that we\u2019ve experienced all year and were able to overcome supply chain and installation-related challenges, especially in the Americas. These results mitigated the impact of mid-single-digit New Equipment sales decline in China, demonstrating the power of geographic diversification within our business. Notably, we see China on a recovery path as New Equipment sales in the region improved compared to Q3. Innovation is helping to drive growth across our business. For example, we continue to roll out our digitally-connected elevator platforms, launching Gen 3 in India, and expanding the deployment of Gen360 in Europe to the Czech Republic, Poland, Portugal and Slovakia. The accelerated portfolio growth we saw this year is an essential component of our long-term strategy and top line growth algorithm. We believe the disruption in our industry favors the OEM, and we\u2019re demonstrating this as we deploy our Otis ONE IoT solution into our New Equipment product offerings and our service portfolio. We continue to work towards our goal of increasing connectivity to approximately 60% of the portfolio, and we\u2019re pleased to have connected more than 100,000 additional units this year. Our service sales force performed well throughout the year, with like-for-like maintenance pricing of 3 points, helping to mitigate labor cost headwinds within the service business. For the third year in a row as an independent company, we delivered adjusted operating profit margin expansion, and we remain well positioned as we enter 2023 with momentum, especially as we execute on New Equipment projects from our backlog. Now turning to Slide 5. In the Americas market in 2022, while North America had a strong year, up better than mid-single digits, Latin America was roughly flat, leading to a market that was up low to mid-single digits. In EMEA, Western Europe performed well, offset by Eastern Europe due to the conflict. In Asia, the market was down high-single digits. Asia-Pacific had a very strong year, up approximately 10% with the performance masked by the downturn in China, which we estimate to be down about 15%. Although market dynamics remain fluid, as we\u2019ve seen over the past several years, the long-term fundamentals of the industry are well grounded in the service-driven growth model. In 2023, globally New Equipment markets are expected to be down mid-single digits in units with flattish markets in the Americas and EMEA and down mid-single digits in Asia, driven by China, where we expect the market to be down 5% to 10%. Asia-Pacific should see another year of mid-single-digit or better growth, driven by urbanization in the region and infrastructure investments. The global industry installed base is expected to grow at a similar rate to that of 2022 at about mid-single digits and reach approximately 21 million units. In the Americas and EMEA, we expect low single-digit growth. And in Asia, we\u2019re expecting high single-digit growth driven by China. With this as the industry backdrop for Otis, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 4% to 6%, with total sales of $13.8 billion to $14.1 billion, up 1.5% to 4% at actual FX. By segment, we expect New Equipment will grow 3% to 5% this year, with mid-single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA and low single-digit growth in Asia. We expect Asia-Pacific to grow at least mid-single digits, while we anticipate our China New Equipment business to be about flat for the year. We\u2019re expecting a better China market as we get into the second half of 2023 as COVID-related and liquidity constraints in the market should ease on the back of government support. In the Service segment, we anticipate another year of solid growth, with the business growing 5% to 7%. We expect volume and pricing to drive solid mid-single-digit growth in the maintenance and repair business, with higher growth in our modernization business line. Our modernization orders performed quite well over the past few quarters, and we entered the year with a MOD backlog up 7% at constant currency. We expect 7% sales growth at the midpoint, driven by the backlog growth. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be between $2.2 billion and $2.25 billion, up $70 million to $130 million of actual currency or $130 million to $175 million accounting for foreign exchange headwinds. We expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $3.35 to $3.50, up 6% to 10% or approximately $0.26 at the midpoint versus the prior year. Finally, we expect free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion between 105% to 115% of GAAP net income. We remain committed to our discipline and balanced capital allocation strategy and expect to repurchase $600 million to $800 million in shares this year following the new Board authorized $2 billion repurchase program in addition to paying our dividends and pursuing our typical bolt-on M&A strategy. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Anurag to walk through our 2022 results and 2023 outlook in more detail.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with fourth quarter results on Slide 6. For the fourth quarter, reported sales of $3.4 billion were down 3.6%. Organic sales grew for the ninth consecutive quarter and growth accelerated to 6%, our best performance of the year with mid-single-digit growth in new equipment and high-single-digit growth in service. Adjusted operating profit excluding a $49 million Forex headwind increased $39 million with constant currency growth in both segments. Strong service performance, especially on volume and price was partially offset by commodities in mixed headwinds and new equipment as well as higher corporate cost. Adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter and the year improved 80 basis points as a percentage of sales, as we remain vigilant on structural cost reduction and cost containment to help mitigate the macro headwinds we have faced. At the same time, we are committed to growing the business and R&D and strategic investment as a percent of sales remain about flat. Adjusted EPS grew 4% or $0.03 in the quarter driven by operational growth of $0.07. This strong operational growth alongside the accretion from Zardoya and $850 million of share repurchases more than offset the $0.08 headwind from Forex. While the fourth quarter free cash flow conversion was strong at 145%, our full year free cash flow came in at $1.45 billion or 115% of net income lighter than we had anticipated as we built $65 million of inventory to mitigate supply chain challenges and support backlog conversion going into 2023. Moving to new equipment performance on Slide 7. Otis new equipment orders in the quarter increased 4% with EMEA and Asia-Pacific up high single digits and China orders returning to growth of mid-single digits, which more than offset a modest decline in the Americas. Overall with better than expected orders growth in the quarter, we finished the year with a new equipment adjusted backlog up 11% at constant currency with growth in all regions, including notably in China. Pricing on new equipment orders in the quarter increased 3 points led by the Americas with solid performance in EMEA and APAC. In China, we have been roughly price cost neutral throughout 2022 as commodity inflation eased and we continue to drive productivity to offset pricing pressure in the market. Fourth quarter new equipment sales of $1.5 billion return to growth driven by over 10% growth in the America, EMEA and Asia Pacific with EMEA outperforming our prior expectations. China sales declined at a lower rate than what we saw in the middle of the year as the team navigated well through post lockdown COVID outbreaks to execute on the backlog. Overall, strong execution by the team will return to sales growth in the fourth quarter in new equipment. Operating profit margins were roughly flat for the quarter. The benefit of higher volume, strong productivity and cost containment nearly mitigated the approximately $25 million headwinds from commodities and Forex. Now turning to Service segment performance on Slide 8. We saw an acceleration in our portfolio growth to over 4% with every region adding to the portfolio this year. With another year of excellent high teens growth in China and low single digit growth elsewhere, our portfolio now is about 2.2 million units. Globally, our recaptures more than offset cancellations for the year with conversions as the growth driver. Additional details on our portfolio growth in 2022 and drivers for future growth can be found in the appendix. Modernization orders were also a highlight up 13% with growth in all regions, including some major project bookings in the Americas and Asia Pacific and continued strength from a mod package offerings. Our modernization backlog is up 7% versus the prior year, giving us good line of sight for growth in 2023. Moving on to service sales. We delivered another quarter of strong organic sales growth up almost 7% with growth in all lines of business. Maintenance pricing, excluding the impact of mix and churn came in as expected up about 3 points for the year, contributing approximately 1 point to overall revenue growth. Organic modernization sales grew 8.8% and similar to last quarter we saw broad growth across regions, including double digit growth in both Americas and Asia Pacific. We finished with our best service margin expansion for the year up 70 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit, excluding $42 million of Forex headwind was up $51 million as higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity were partially offset by our annual wage increases. We have now delivered 12 consecutive quarters of service margin expansion with margins increasing roughly 200 basis points over the past three years. Slide 9 lays out the full year 2022 adjusted EPS bridge. Strong operational execution drove $0.39 of constant currency EPS growth, which mitigated $0. 18 in commodity headwinds leading to operating profit growth of $124 million or $0.21. Through our capital allocation strategy, including the accretion from the Zardoya transaction and share repurchase of $850 million and optimizing a tax rate, we were able to offset $0.26 in Forex headwinds. Overall, strong operational performance led to EPS growth of 7.5% or $0.22. We finished the year with 2022 adjusted tax rate of 26.5%, a 220 basis point improvement versus 2021, which contributed to EPS growth both in the quarter and for the full year. Overall, the team performed well throughout 2022 by executing on the controllables, which helped us to build a strong backlog, grow organic sales, expand margin by 30 basis points and return $1.3 billion to shareholders. As we look ahead to 2023, the new equipment outlook is on Slide 10. Over the past few years, we have delivered strong orders globally from a combination of market growth, our share gain initiatives and incremental pricing actions. This has resulted in a robust multi-year backlog, giving us good line of sight for the next couple of years. In 2023, we expect new equipment organic sales to grow between 3% to 5% with Americas and EMEA up mid-single digits and Asia growing low single digits. Asia-Pacific is expected to be up at least mid-single digits, and though the backlog in China is up 2 points, we expect sales to be about flat reflecting pressure on the Book and Ship business from expected market declines in the first half. We expect new equipment profit margins to be flat to up 40 basis points. We expect roughly $100 million of tailwinds from volume, pricing, productivity and commodities. This will be partially offset by unfavorable regional and project mix and some snap back in SG&A expense due to 2022 cost containment actions. We will continue to drive strong productivity on both material and installation and project closeouts as the year progresses to drive out performance. Turning to our service outlook on Slide 11. Starting with sales, we expect another solid year in service and anticipate organic sales increasing 5% to 7%. Maintenance and repair organic sales are expected to grow 4.5% or 6.5% driven by maintenance portfolio growth, pricing and low to mid-single digit repair growth after two strong years of COVID-related recovery. We expect more than 1 point of pricing after adjusting for mix and churn. For modernization, we anticipate organic sales of mid to high single digits as we execute on a solid backlog and drive our Book and Ship business from new product launches and focus on sales force specialization. Turning to profit, we expect roughly 50 basis points of margin expansion. Headwinds from annual wage inflation will be more than offset by volume, price and productivity similar drivers to 2022. Turning to Slide 12 for the 2023 adjusted EPS bridge. We are expecting $3.35 to $3.50 in adjusted EPS driven by $0.23 to $0.31 of operating profit growth. We expect to offset $0.09 of Forex headwind at the midpoint and a modest increase in interest expense through a lower share count, $0.04 of remaining Zardoya accretion and continued optimization of a tax rate. We plan to complete $600 million to $800 million in share repurchases during the year. For cadence, we expect strong EPS growth in the second half of the year, while the first half remains roughly flat. We see the bulk of the FX headwind, post lockdown COVID impact in China, and a modest supply chain overhang in new equipment in the first quarter. We anticipate stronger growth sequentially thereafter, including better performance in China in the second half of the year. Overall, we anticipate Otis organic sales growth of 4% to 6% with approximately 20 basis points to 30 basis points of margin expansion leading to 6% to 10% EPS growth. And on cash, we expect to generate $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion in free cash flow in 2023, 110% conversion of GAAP net income at the midpoint. This outlook demonstrates another year of consistent and solid operational execution as we continue to mitigate macro challenges and create meaningful shareholder value. With that, I will request Norma to please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning, and thanks very much. First off, I suppose I just wanted to dig in a little bit more into the assumptions for how you see the China market starting out the year in terms of orders after a very good Q4 performance? And maybe just homing a little bit more on the commentary around some of those headwinds in Q1. Should we still expect EPS to be up kind of sequentially in the first quarter?\nJudy Marks: Well, good morning, Julian. It\u2019s Judy. Let me start with what we\u2019re seeing really on the ground. I would tell you that the Chinese economy is in a state of recovery now. We were really pleased with our team\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter, again, with orders being up in new equipment in what was a challenging quarter with all the lockdowns. It\u2019s a fluid situation on the ground between liquidity and the COVID-related absenteeism as we come back from the Chinese New Year. We\u2019re going to watch that closely. But 2022 came in where we expected on the market down about 15%. We shared, we think that was about down 10% in Q4 and came in where we thought between 540,000 and 550,000 units. Obviously, Q4 saw some abrupt changes with COVID between the lockdowns and then the lifting, which led to the outbreaks. And what we\u2019re monitoring is the liquidity easing, which we\u2019re seeing and where the consumer sentiment and confidence is in terms of the property market. So as we go through the first few quarters of 2023, first of all, we\u2019re very encouraged by the government policy and actions to date. We are expecting a better second half. We have a harder compare in the first half based on what was happening in China, first half of 2022. But we did see an up infrastructure market that was the only segment that was up in 2022 in a 15% down market, and we did very well there. Perry and the team just executed really well. Tier 1 and 2 in China were the least negatively impacted by the down market. And again, you know our strategy there has been very focused on agents and distributors on key accounts and we\u2019ve executed that. So I\u2019ll leave it with, I\u2019m feeling good about the health of our business in China. In a down market in 2022, we did well, we were down mid-single digits versus a down 15% market and in a down 5% to 10% market, we expect to do well as well. So we gained share last year. Our strategy will enable us to do that, and we\u2019re going in with backlog. I\u2019ll let Anurag talk to the EPS question.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Great. Thanks, Judy. Yes, so Julian, just on the quarter one, let me start with the segments first. From a service perspective, we expect to see performance in line with the full year guidance. The swing factor could be repair, modernization or some mix, but overall we aren\u2019t seeing anything major to call out and expect kind of mid-single digit growth and margin expansion. It may be not close to 50 basis points regarding for the year, but still be good at expansion as we ran through the year. The new equipment is a segment that we do expect some weakness from both a sales and a margin perspective. Specifically compared to last year, China as a tough compare as the COVID impact didn\u2019t really start until the second quarter. And while we \u2013 as Judy mentioned, we do expect better performance in China as we go through the course of the year. We aren\u2019t expecting it to happen until the second half of the year. In Americas, the team performed very well in the fourth quarter. But there is still some supply chain inefficiencies and labor shortages, which I expected to clear up in the second or third quarter. So overall, we expect sales on the new equipment side to be down quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, and margins to be above flattish with where we ended up in the fourth quarter. Now kind of going to the other line items, starting with corporate expenses. Last year, the first half was light because of all the cost containment we did. So it is going to \u2013 the run rate is going to pick up very similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. So there could be a couple of pennies of headwinds over there. And then on the FX side, we\u2019ve said about at the midpoint $55 million of FX headwind and a bulk of it will come in the first quarter because last year at this point in time, the euro was $1.15, the renminbi was $6.35. So though the currencies have improved, there is still a significant headwind. So majority of our FX headwind will come in the first quarter. So putting it all together, we do expect EPS to be down a couple of pennies. As you know, the Forex any new equipment corporate will kind of offset the good performance in service and the Zardoya accretion. So net-net down a couple of pennies and sequentially also could be down $0.01 or $0.02.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s extremely helpful. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Steve, your line is now open. Mr. Tusa, are you on mute?\nMichael Rednor: Norma, let\u2019s go to the next question. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Nick Housden with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nNick Housden: Yes. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019ll just ask one. Looking at the outlook and maintenance, in particular, you\u2019re guiding for up 4.5% to 6.5% organic. I\u2019m just thinking, units are increasing over 4% and you seem pretty competent in being able to maintain that kind of level. Pricing is already at 3% and is probably going up as you enforce the escalation clauses and you kind of hinted that in the slide. So 4% volumes, 3% pricing, am I wrong to think that a 5.5% midpoint in the guidance looks a little bit conservative? And is it to do with maybe pricing being a bit more competitive in Asia Pacific, where a lot of the new units are going into? Thanks.\nJudy Marks: Let me \u2013 Nick, good afternoon. Let me answer the pricing question and then I\u2019ll let Anurag take you through the walk. Listen, we\u2019ve been pleased like-for-like pricing similar to Q3 was up 3 points in Q4 and was very solid as predicted. Mature markets globally is where we saw really strong service pricing, mid-single-digit gains in the Americas, low single-digit in EMEA and Asia Pacific. And as Anurag said in his comments, kind of we\u2019ve got this \u2013 the margin drivers are really less on price and more on productivity, volume and density in China. But we think 2023, like-for-like should be better than that 3%. And that\u2019s really driven by the inflationary clauses we have in the majority of our contracts \u2013 service contracts, especially in Western Europe and in North America. The Western Europe clauses are backward looking, so they will reflect 2022 inflation indices. And we are signing those contracts right now, a lot of them in the first quarter. So next quarter we\u2019ll be able to \u2013 to be able to share how we\u2019re performing on that. But pricing\u2019s healthy, team deserves a lot of credit. We pivoted from being a discount kind of service pricing company for many years to being able to gain price, especially where it was appropriate and justified.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. And just to add to that in terms of the growth for 2023. So yes, you\u2019re right that our growth at the midpoint is very similar to where it is in 2022, but the pieces are a little bit different. The portfolio growth as you put together 4% and what Judy spoke about the pricing, you add 3%, then you adjust for churn and mix, we should be up about 6% for 2023, which is higher than where we were in 2022. Repair is as I mentioned in my prepared comments, over the past two or three years we\u2019ve been running at a 10% CAGR on the Repair business coming out of COVID. Now, typically the Repair business will outgrow the Maintenance business because as we continue on our strategy on new repair packages, increasing penetration. But this year there\u2019ll be \u2013 just be a little bit of a catch up from what happened in the past two to three years. And then going forward, it should outpace the Maintenance business. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re saying low to mid-single digit. And modernization is pretty \u2013 it\u2019s around 7-ish percent at the midpoint. So those are the pieces which get us to 5.5%. Now, clearly, if pricing is a little bit better, repair comes in better, and the modernization book and ship there could be a little bit more over there. But right now we feel well calibrated at the midpoint of the guidance.\nNick Housden: Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi guys. This is actually Jack on for Gautam today. Thanks for the question.\nJudy Marks: Hi, Jack.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, there. Just a quick question kind of just on your perspective on the end market demand kind of back to Judy\u2019s comments on the first question. Just kind of what you\u2019re seeing in the field today maybe by geography and then by end market maybe kind of parsing resi versus commercial or infrastructure? Just anything there would be helpful. And then just if you\u2019re seeing any with the slowing global macro backdrop here, if you\u2019re kind of seeing any municipalities or other customers sort of defer projects or kind of what you\u2019re seeing in 2023 so far?\nJudy Marks: Sure. Jack, let me try and respond to both parts. Let me start with new equipment because I\u2019ll break this into new equipment and service, and I\u2019ll actually start with Asia Pacific where the market overall and we\u2019re really expecting solid growth due to urbanization and infrastructure growth in Korea, in Southeast Asia and in India. And we\u2019re not seeing any slowing in that part of the world. It\u2019s really accelerating and expectations should be for solid growth. For 2023 in the Americas, we think it\u2019s going to be a little worse than the market was in 2022. 2022 is an incredibly strong market. First half stronger than second half, but as we saw a really strong market and we\u2019re still seeing the Dodge Momentum Index rising on construction, but the Architects Billing Index for the past three months has been under 50, including December at 47.5. So we\u2019re watching that carefully. In EMEA, we think flattish. We\u2019re balancing potential headwinds, but I\u2019ll tell you, we have seen Europe become far more resilient in terms of the demand including the residential market in Europe is really strong despite all the challenges consumers are facing. And the Middle East is growing. Middle East, although it\u2019s a smaller part of our EMEA has bounced back nicely so that end market\u2019s going to grow as well. The good news in China, it\u2019s going to be better year-on-year than last year. Second half looks better. Again, segment down, we\u2019re predicting 5% to 10% in 2023, down a little more on the first half, and then we expect to see acceleration through the second half. So, we look at that as we shared in the 2023 outlook slide. And we\u2019re prepared for that because we\u2019ve got this great backlog at 11% on new equipment. When I turn to the Service business, it\u2019s the end market\u2019s just growing in all regions. It\u2019s solid mid-single digit growth led by Asia and low-single digit really in the developed markets. And I just make you recall that the new equipment market swings really have minimal impact on the service market. It\u2019s going to grow mid-single digit year after year after year. Modernization is up nicely in all regions, and we\u2019re ready for that. We\u2019re going in with a 7% backlog on mod, and we expect mod to continue to \u2013 from a demand side to continue to grow in 2023. We have not seen a slowing on projects. We\u2019ve also not seen the impact of the Inflationary Reduction Act \u2013 the infrastructure \u2013 the Reduction Act in North America yet. We see that later cycle in terms of airports, metros and other infrastructure. But again, we did see good infrastructure. It was the only positive sector and segment that grew in China in 2022. So we\u2019re feeling good. Our backlog will take us through, again, we\u2019ll watch the book and bill early in the year. But our backlog, we think is going to take us through on new equipment and mod and our Service business is coming in strong. And we\u2019re looking forward to 2023.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks, Judy. Yes, that\u2019s really helpful. And then just one quick one for Anurag, really quickly just on price cost assumptions in 2023 and sort of the backlog margin converting here. Just kind of what your assumptions are snapping the line on seeing raw material sort of roll over here in 2023? Kind of just high level, how you\u2019re kind of thinking about price cost in 2023? Thanks.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Okay, great. Thanks for the question. So price cost is positive in 2023. I mean, you can see it from the margin expansion as well that\u2019s happening at the midpoint. So in pricing, if you look at this year, I mean, after flattish first half, we started seeing pricing going up 3% in the back half. And our backlog is actually up \u2013 our backlog margins are up over 100 basis points. And what we have assumed for next year is about 50 basis points of pricing coming through into the P&L, which is roughly about $30-ish million. And the reason it\u2019s 50 basis points not what we have right now is it takes a while for the backlog to convert into revenue, and some of that will come into later years, but still are price positive. On commodities, we do expect about a $20 million to $30 million tailwind. If we look back over the past two years, we faced about $180 million of commodity headwind. Slightly more than $100 million came from Americas and China, and the rest came from Europe and Asia. In Americas and China, of the $100 million on headwind, we\u2019re seeing about $30 million, $40 million of that come back as prices of steel have started coming down. And though we are 50% locked, we still see some of it coming down over years. So clearly, that is very positive. It is actually in EMEA and in Asia-Pacific where we\u2019re not seeing the tailwinds right now. In Europe, if you look at guide rails, it set up 85% from where it was two years ago. So clearly, there is some headwind over there. And in Asia, we buy a lot from Tier 2 suppliers, and that\u2019s not yet come down as well. But overall, we see about a $20 million, $30 million tailwind on commodities. So net-net between price and commodities, it\u2019s positive.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to monitor some of the puts and take on margins. And I think you called out mix impacts in New Equipment. So just maybe just double-click on that and just to clarify what sort of the mixed headwinds are. But my real question is really on the investments, I mean you continue to invest. I think it\u2019s been very successful on the recaptures and retention initiatives. But maybe just talk about the focus for investment spend going forward?\nJudy Marks: Let me start with the investment spend, and then I\u2019ll have Anurag talk to the mix. Yes, we are \u2013 I think you\u2019ve seen, Nigel, since we became independent, we\u2019ve been obviously focused on our business, focused on our markets, and we\u2019ve been extremely focused on investments in our strategy that will yield in terms of innovation. So we\u2019ve done \u2013 we\u2019ve continued our investments in our service business, both in making our incredible field professionals more productive and that\u2019s yielded the apps that they\u2019ve been using continue to show incredible promise. Our Tune app is up in terms of usage, 70%. In terms of in the field, we\u2019ve got a lot of our service parts being ordered. And our sales \u2013 our field professionals using the upgrade app are also being part of our extended sales force and selling repairs. So all that\u2019s working well but the linchpin of our strategy is Otis ONE. It\u2019s being connected. It\u2019s having that predictive, transparent information available in our ecosystem. And we continued on our investment strategy for Otis ONE, again, where we define on the service side where we\u2019re going to install these to get the best yield for both productivity and customer stickiness. So what we\u2019re seeing, we did deploy well over 100,000 units again this year on our trajectory to 60% coverage of what\u2019s becoming a larger portfolio, 2.2 million this year. We said we\u2019ll be over 2.5 million units by 2026 in our medium term, and that 60% should be off that two point \u2013 that higher number. That\u2019s where we\u2019re heading. And we\u2019re seeing the results of that. We\u2019re seeing it on the productivity side, where our running on arrivals are down. And we\u2019re seeing that also on the customer stickiness side in two ways. One is when we are connected, like our EV product or any connected product, we\u2019re getting more in price for service. And then we\u2019re getting higher conversion rates and higher retention rates. Our retention rates this year, we were pleased with. They\u2019re at 94%. I look forward to the day that we can report a 95% retention rate because that will have significant validity to our service-driven growth strategy. Conversions were up this year. And I think a lot of that, especially in China, going up to 48% this year where they ended was due to our Gen 3 elevators being connected and our Otis ONE units as well. So globally, we\u2019re now at a 64% conversion rate. And as China continues on its path to get to 60%, which we think is the target, then, globally, we will be at about 70% conversion. And that is our higher margin conversion. On the portfolio itself, that it is Otis ONE. It is that connected product that gives us the conviction that we can take the 4.1% portfolio growth even higher. Even though this is what we shared for the medium-term guide at about 4%, we do believe we can get that higher, including in 2023. So all-in-all, investments in the New Equipment side are continuing. Our R&D spend is there. Our strategic investments are there. We\u2019re really pleased with expanding Gen 3 and Gen360. On the service side, the Otis ONE value proposition for the customers is working, and we believe it\u2019s reflected in our margin expansion as well for our shareholders. So Anurag, let me turn it over to you for mix.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. Thanks. So as you can see, on the investment side, we\u2019ll continue to invest and still grow our margins. Last year, we grew about 30 basis points, this year we\u2019re guiding for 2030. And we\u2019ll look for productivity other ways to kind of offset that. On the mix, it\u2019s two, it\u2019s regional and product or project mix. On the regional mix, as you are aware that China New Equipment is a higher margin market for us. And even last year in 2022, the other markets did a little bit better than China. But if you look at 2023, we are guiding for China to be flat, whereas Americas-EMEA to be up mid-single-digit and Asia mid to high single-digit. So that adds a little bit of a regional mix impact. But the more bigger mix impact is coming from project mix. And over the past two or three years, and as you\u2019ve seen us making announcements on, we won a lot of major projects, part of our share growth strategy has obviously been on the volume as well as looking at different verticals, be it infrastructure, others to grow our major projects. And the more major projects are, they definitely come in with very good maintenance business, very high stickiness, very good margin, but they are lower margin than the volume business. So there\u2019s a little bit of that impact, a healthy backlog that we have of 11% as we go into 2023 and beyond.\nNigel Coe: Makes sense. Thanks for the detail. I guess that was my two questions. But I just want to ask a question on \u2013 you called out 800,000 connected elevators today. How much of those Otis ONE connectivity? I want to say about half, but clarify that.\nJudy Marks: Yes, I think that\u2019s accurate, about half.\nNigel Coe: Yes, great, thanks Judy.\nJudy Marks: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, good morning.\nJudy Marks: Hey, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: I think you called me. I was \u2013 we got some other calls going on this morning, so you overlap. Sorry about that. Can we just get a little bit more info on like attrition or retention? Maybe a little more precision around how much that may have improved year-over-year. Obviously, 1% is a lot. So there\u2019s some nuance there. Maybe just a little more precision on that, from the 94%.\nJudy Marks: Yes. We\u2019ve got \u2013 there\u2019s a chart in the back. And Steve, we\u2019ve shared that we \u2013 our focus is having a net positive net churn between retention and recaptures. Retention, they\u2019re the most important units to us. We get them at the highest margin, and that\u2019s where we want to start that individual customer relationship that we hope last decades into modernization and then into it, just for decades. So it\u2019s at 94%. It\u2019s about aligned with last \u2013 with 2021. I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty close in terms of retention and recapture though, it was up. And you can see that slightly, but it was up healthy, and that was really driven by a few items. Two, I\u2019ll call out. One is our sales specialization where we actually have recapture sales reps that, that is all they do. And they focus on the density and capturing the best of the optimal units for Otis because we have to go in at a lower price than we would at a normal conversion, but we want to make sure that they are accretive. So the recapture specialists really \u2013 we saw them hit their stride as we went through 2022. And the second is Otis ONE. And the capital investment, we continue to make at the data level on connected units and on offering that when we do go recapture that really makes a difference to our customers. I\u2019ve personally been involved in a few of those sales calls to win some portfolios back. And it really makes a difference. We can show them the visibility they have, their dashboard they\u2019re going to have and the whole ecosystem we offer. And so those two combined have really helped, and that\u2019s really \u2013 that\u2019s been our strategy, and it\u2019s what we\u2019re going to continue doing.\nSteve Tusa: And then just on the attrition in China. I know it\u2019s a growing part of the installed base, but any trends there worth calling out?\nJudy Marks: I think it\u2019s pretty consistent with 2021 is what I would say. We didn\u2019t see huge anomalies. Obviously, it\u2019s \u2013 our portfolio in China, our service portfolio, I think we\u2019ve shared is a little over 325,000 units. And that\u2019s grown. It\u2019s our sixth straight quarter of mid to high single-digit portfolio growth in China. And so we\u2019re continuing, recapture, did well there. So we\u2019re continuing to monitor that. But our team \u2013 our service teams in China are continuing against six straight quarters, and we expect \u2013 because of the growth in that segment, we expect that to be in the teens again for 2023.\nSteve Tusa: Great, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Miguel Borrega with Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is now open.\nMiguel Borrega: Hi, good morning, everyone. I\u2019ve got a couple of questions. The first one on your margin for New Equipment in China, I know that you don\u2019t disclose this, but can you give us some color on how this has evolved over the years? How does your margin compare today versus, for example, pre-COVID levels? And at the moment, what is the direction of travel for margins on new orders? And then maybe longer term, can you give us a sense why margins in China were keeping much more profitable than, for example, Europe or the U.S.? Thank you.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Okay. I think there were three questions over there. So let me start with the China New Equipment margin. We don\u2019t disclose margin by regions. If you look at China New Equipment, it is slightly higher. It\u2019s a good margin business for us. Importantly, if you look at even last year with all the volume decline, the commodities headwinds that we faced, we were still able to mitigate a significant amount of that through productivity. So the margins of the New Equipment business have actually held quite strong because of the productivity business. And even this year, where we are guiding to our margins to be, we\u2019re almost back to 2021 levels. Despite volume being flattish or slightly down, China volume being down 10% and going through a commodity headwinds of about $150 million, $180 million. So clearly, the margins are trending in the right direction. And all I would say is that we\u2019re quite happy with the way we\u2019ve been able to mitigate some of the headwinds to get to where we are right now. Yes. So that\u2019s on the first question regarding where our New Equipment margins are. Backlog is trending up. The backlog margin is trending up. We\u2019ve had price increases over the past couple of quarters. If you look at where we\u2019re exiting this year, in 2021, our backlog margin declined by one point, we are above one point right now. And \u2013 where commodities are and where our pricing and new orders and new proposals are going in, that backlog margin should kind of inch up as we move along through the course of the year. We, again, don\u2019t give specific guidance on where it would be, but it\u2019s encouraging to see the price kind of sticking in the market over there. Yes. And sorry, what was the third question? I couldn\u2019t quite get the question completely. If you could just repeat that, Miguel.\nMiguel Borrega: Well, just give us a sense on the spread between margins in China and the Rest of the World. Why shouldn\u2019t we see some kind of conversion trending down to more like Europe or the U.S.?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes, it\u2019s still accretive for us in terms of the margins over there when we keep driving productivity. So it will \u2013 the strategy that we\u2019re kind of embarking upon the digitalization of productivity, we should see the margins kind of inching up. I mean net-net, on the service side, we\u2019re seeing 50 basis points margin expansion this year, which is on the high end of a medium-term guidance. And obviously, margins will differ by region, by country. But with all the tools we are doing and we see margin expansion across all the regions.\nMiguel Borrega: Thank you. And then just one last question on free cash flow conversion, I wanted to get your views, not only on 2023, but also a little bit further away. Where do you see this normalizing? Because 2021 was 128%; 2022, 115%, and now you guide between 105% and 115%. Is this basically China contributing less to working capital? And do you see that improving in 2023 with more financing to real estate developers? Maybe if we can get some of your color what\u2019s going on, on the ground in China today? Do you see any improvements there? Thank you very much.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. So let me take back, actually, our working capital in China collection is progressing quite well. If you look at this 2022, we finished about 115% of net income, which was quite good. We had a very strong fourth quarter. We came in a little bit lighter was because of the inventory that we built up to make sure that we can support our backlog as we get into 2023. Between receivables and payables, we are pretty much there. So it was more of the inventory build out. Now what we\u2019re guiding at the midpoint for 2023 is 110% of net income. It\u2019s essentially driven by earnings growth with a little bit of a modest offset from capital expenditure as we\u2019re embarking on our Otis ONE strategy. So that takes us to 110% net income. And as we move forward, we should grow our cash with earnings. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve kind of guided towards. And you should see that normalizing around the 110-ish percent level.\nJudy Marks: Yes. And Miguel, I\u2019ll just let me wrap on that. But I mean this is \u2013 that was our medium-term guide that we gave at the Investor Day in February of last year, and that\u2019s what \u2013 we beat it in 2022, and we\u2019re staying consistent right now with our guide with the Investor Day. Thank you.\nOperator: And I\u2019m currently showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to hand the conference back over to Ms. Marks for any closing remarks.\nJudy Marks: Well, thank you, Norma. Our success in 2022, our third year in a row of performing for all stakeholders, demonstrates the strategic resiliency of our business and provides us with confidence as we begin a new year. Supported by strong industry dynamics, we remain committed to our strategic pillars in order to deliver for our customers, shareholders, valued communities and the riding public. We set significant goals for the year ahead, and we look forward to sharing our 2023 success with you. Please stay safe and well. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Judy Marks",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We hope everyone listening is safe and well. We're pleased that we ended the year with a strong fourth quarter and solid full year performance in a year characterized by a variety of macro headwinds. We entered 2023 with good momentum as we continue to execute our four strategic pillars: sustaining new equipment growth, accelerating service portfolio growth, advancing digitalization, while focusing and empowering our organization. I'm proud of our colleagues around the globe who delivered these results demonstrating the strategic resiliency of our company as we continue to grow and perform in 2022. Starting on Slide 3. We continue to perform well in New Equipment Orders, growing 7% for the full year. In the quarter, orders grew 4%, with particularly strong performance in EMEA and continued solid performance in Asia-Pacific. China orders returned to growth with mid-single-digit performance in the quarter. Orders in the Americas were down 4% in the quarter, although the business had a very strong 2022 overall, with orders up almost 18%. Our New Equipment adjusted backlog at constant currency is up 11% heading into 2023, giving us solid multiyear visibility to grow sales. Organic sales increased 2.5%, driven by service, which grew 6%. We grew our industry-leading maintenance portfolio by 4.1%. It now stands at 2.2 million units, a new milestone for our company. We delivered 7.5% adjusted EPS growth despite $156 million in foreign exchange-related headwinds. We generated $1.45 billion in free cash flow, allowing us to return $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We continue to win many exciting projects based on our innovation, ability to deliver and the trust customers have in us. For example, in the Americas, Otis was selected to provide our Compass destination dispatch system, along with six SkyRise and two Gen 3 elevators for City Centre 4 in Surrey, British Columbia. The 23-storey building will be built to lead gold standards and extends our more than six-year relationship with the Lark Group. In China, Tianjin Metro has been using Otis equipment since opening in 1984. In November, Otis was selected to provide more than 120 escalators and Gen 3 elevators for their new Line 4 Northern Extension. This takes the number of Otis units on the Port City's expanding subway network to more than 1,500. These new elevators will be connected to the Otis ONE IoT-based platform, already delivering real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance for the metro system. In the UK, we've had a longstanding relationship with Transport for London, including a long-term contract through 2042, to manufacture, install and maintain the escalators and travelators on the busy network. Most recently, we were contracted to provide Battersea station with specialty escalators, specifically designed to run for about 20 hours a day and extend 24 meters in length and nine meters in rise. We're playing our part to keep the busy network flowing. Our ESG initiatives continued to progress in 2022, helping to drive stakeholder value alongside our financial priorities. Our manufacturing facility in Florence, South Carolina achieved gold level total resource and use efficiency, or true certification, recognizing its success in zero waste. With this achievement, Otis has become the first in the elevator industry to have a true certified facility, helping us towards our goal of having all our factories eligible for zero waste to landfill certification by 2025. We look forward to sharing more about our ESG progress in our second annual ESG report, which is set to be published in the spring. Moving to Slide 4. With strong orders performance in 2022, we were able to achieved approximately 1 point of new equipment share gain, on top of the 2-point increase between 2020 and 2021. For the first quarter since Q4 2021, New Equipment sales returned to growth as we continued the strong growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific that we've experienced all year and were able to overcome supply chain and installation-related challenges, especially in the Americas. These results mitigated the impact of mid-single-digit New Equipment sales decline in China, demonstrating the power of geographic diversification within our business. Notably, we see China on a recovery path as New Equipment sales in the region improved compared to Q3. Innovation is helping to drive growth across our business. For example, we continue to roll out our digitally-connected elevator platforms, launching Gen 3 in India, and expanding the deployment of Gen360 in Europe to the Czech Republic, Poland, Portugal and Slovakia. The accelerated portfolio growth we saw this year is an essential component of our long-term strategy and top line growth algorithm. We believe the disruption in our industry favors the OEM, and we're demonstrating this as we deploy our Otis ONE IoT solution into our New Equipment product offerings and our service portfolio. We continue to work towards our goal of increasing connectivity to approximately 60% of the portfolio, and we're pleased to have connected more than 100,000 additional units this year. Our service sales force performed well throughout the year, with like-for-like maintenance pricing of 3 points, helping to mitigate labor cost headwinds within the service business. For the third year in a row as an independent company, we delivered adjusted operating profit margin expansion, and we remain well positioned as we enter 2023 with momentum, especially as we execute on New Equipment projects from our backlog. Now turning to Slide 5. In the Americas market in 2022, while North America had a strong year, up better than mid-single digits, Latin America was roughly flat, leading to a market that was up low to mid-single digits. In EMEA, Western Europe performed well, offset by Eastern Europe due to the conflict. In Asia, the market was down high-single digits. Asia-Pacific had a very strong year, up approximately 10% with the performance masked by the downturn in China, which we estimate to be down about 15%. Although market dynamics remain fluid, as we've seen over the past several years, the long-term fundamentals of the industry are well grounded in the service-driven growth model. In 2023, globally New Equipment markets are expected to be down mid-single digits in units with flattish markets in the Americas and EMEA and down mid-single digits in Asia, driven by China, where we expect the market to be down 5% to 10%. Asia-Pacific should see another year of mid-single-digit or better growth, driven by urbanization in the region and infrastructure investments. The global industry installed base is expected to grow at a similar rate to that of 2022 at about mid-single digits and reach approximately 21 million units. In the Americas and EMEA, we expect low single-digit growth. And in Asia, we're expecting high single-digit growth driven by China. With this as the industry backdrop for Otis, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 4% to 6%, with total sales of $13.8 billion to $14.1 billion, up 1.5% to 4% at actual FX. By segment, we expect New Equipment will grow 3% to 5% this year, with mid-single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA and low single-digit growth in Asia. We expect Asia-Pacific to grow at least mid-single digits, while we anticipate our China New Equipment business to be about flat for the year. We're expecting a better China market as we get into the second half of 2023 as COVID-related and liquidity constraints in the market should ease on the back of government support. In the Service segment, we anticipate another year of solid growth, with the business growing 5% to 7%. We expect volume and pricing to drive solid mid-single-digit growth in the maintenance and repair business, with higher growth in our modernization business line. Our modernization orders performed quite well over the past few quarters, and we entered the year with a MOD backlog up 7% at constant currency. We expect 7% sales growth at the midpoint, driven by the backlog growth. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be between $2.2 billion and $2.25 billion, up $70 million to $130 million of actual currency or $130 million to $175 million accounting for foreign exchange headwinds. We expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $3.35 to $3.50, up 6% to 10% or approximately $0.26 at the midpoint versus the prior year. Finally, we expect free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion between 105% to 115% of GAAP net income. We remain committed to our discipline and balanced capital allocation strategy and expect to repurchase $600 million to $800 million in shares this year following the new Board authorized $2 billion repurchase program in addition to paying our dividends and pursuing our typical bolt-on M&A strategy. With that, I'll turn it over to Anurag to walk through our 2022 results and 2023 outlook in more detail. Well, good morning, Julian. It's Judy. Let me start with what we're seeing really on the ground. I would tell you that the Chinese economy is in a state of recovery now. We were really pleased with our team's performance in the fourth quarter, again, with orders being up in new equipment in what was a challenging quarter with all the lockdowns. It's a fluid situation on the ground between liquidity and the COVID-related absenteeism as we come back from the Chinese New Year. We're going to watch that closely. But 2022 came in where we expected on the market down about 15%. We shared, we think that was about down 10% in Q4 and came in where we thought between 540,000 and 550,000 units. Obviously, Q4 saw some abrupt changes with COVID between the lockdowns and then the lifting, which led to the outbreaks. And what we're monitoring is the liquidity easing, which we're seeing and where the consumer sentiment and confidence is in terms of the property market. So as we go through the first few quarters of 2023, first of all, we're very encouraged by the government policy and actions to date. We are expecting a better second half. We have a harder compare in the first half based on what was happening in China, first half of 2022. But we did see an up infrastructure market that was the only segment that was up in 2022 in a 15% down market, and we did very well there. Perry and the team just executed really well. Tier 1 and 2 in China were the least negatively impacted by the down market. And again, you know our strategy there has been very focused on agents and distributors on key accounts and we've executed that. So I'll leave it with, I'm feeling good about the health of our business in China. In a down market in 2022, we did well, we were down mid-single digits versus a down 15% market and in a down 5% to 10% market, we expect to do well as well. So we gained share last year. Our strategy will enable us to do that, and we're going in with backlog. I'll let Anurag talk to the EPS question. Let me \u2013 Nick, good afternoon. Let me answer the pricing question and then I'll let Anurag take you through the walk. Listen, we've been pleased like-for-like pricing similar to Q3 was up 3 points in Q4 and was very solid as predicted. Mature markets globally is where we saw really strong service pricing, mid-single-digit gains in the Americas, low single-digit in EMEA and Asia Pacific. And as Anurag said in his comments, kind of we've got this \u2013 the margin drivers are really less on price and more on productivity, volume and density in China. But we think 2023, like-for-like should be better than that 3%. And that's really driven by the inflationary clauses we have in the majority of our contracts \u2013 service contracts, especially in Western Europe and in North America. The Western Europe clauses are backward looking, so they will reflect 2022 inflation indices. And we are signing those contracts right now, a lot of them in the first quarter. So next quarter we'll be able to \u2013 to be able to share how we're performing on that. But pricing's healthy, team deserves a lot of credit. We pivoted from being a discount kind of service pricing company for many years to being able to gain price, especially where it was appropriate and justified. Hi, Jack. Sure. Jack, let me try and respond to both parts. Let me start with new equipment because I'll break this into new equipment and service, and I'll actually start with Asia Pacific where the market overall and we're really expecting solid growth due to urbanization and infrastructure growth in Korea, in Southeast Asia and in India. And we're not seeing any slowing in that part of the world. It's really accelerating and expectations should be for solid growth. For 2023 in the Americas, we think it's going to be a little worse than the market was in 2022. 2022 is an incredibly strong market. First half stronger than second half, but as we saw a really strong market and we're still seeing the Dodge Momentum Index rising on construction, but the Architects Billing Index for the past three months has been under 50, including December at 47.5. So we're watching that carefully. In EMEA, we think flattish. We're balancing potential headwinds, but I'll tell you, we have seen Europe become far more resilient in terms of the demand including the residential market in Europe is really strong despite all the challenges consumers are facing. And the Middle East is growing. Middle East, although it's a smaller part of our EMEA has bounced back nicely so that end market's going to grow as well. The good news in China, it's going to be better year-on-year than last year. Second half looks better. Again, segment down, we're predicting 5% to 10% in 2023, down a little more on the first half, and then we expect to see acceleration through the second half. So, we look at that as we shared in the 2023 outlook slide. And we're prepared for that because we've got this great backlog at 11% on new equipment. When I turn to the Service business, it's the end market's just growing in all regions. It's solid mid-single digit growth led by Asia and low-single digit really in the developed markets. And I just make you recall that the new equipment market swings really have minimal impact on the service market. It's going to grow mid-single digit year after year after year. Modernization is up nicely in all regions, and we're ready for that. We're going in with a 7% backlog on mod, and we expect mod to continue to \u2013 from a demand side to continue to grow in 2023. We have not seen a slowing on projects. We've also not seen the impact of the Inflationary Reduction Act \u2013 the infrastructure \u2013 the Reduction Act in North America yet. We see that later cycle in terms of airports, metros and other infrastructure. But again, we did see good infrastructure. It was the only positive sector and segment that grew in China in 2022. So we're feeling good. Our backlog will take us through, again, we'll watch the book and bill early in the year. But our backlog, we think is going to take us through on new equipment and mod and our Service business is coming in strong. And we're looking forward to 2023. Let me start with the investment spend, and then I'll have Anurag talk to the mix. Yes, we are \u2013 I think you've seen, Nigel, since we became independent, we've been obviously focused on our business, focused on our markets, and we've been extremely focused on investments in our strategy that will yield in terms of innovation. So we've done \u2013 we've continued our investments in our service business, both in making our incredible field professionals more productive and that's yielded the apps that they've been using continue to show incredible promise. Our Tune app is up in terms of usage, 70%. In terms of in the field, we've got a lot of our service parts being ordered. And our sales \u2013 our field professionals using the upgrade app are also being part of our extended sales force and selling repairs. So all that's working well but the linchpin of our strategy is Otis ONE. It's being connected. It's having that predictive, transparent information available in our ecosystem. And we continued on our investment strategy for Otis ONE, again, where we define on the service side where we're going to install these to get the best yield for both productivity and customer stickiness. So what we're seeing, we did deploy well over 100,000 units again this year on our trajectory to 60% coverage of what's becoming a larger portfolio, 2.2 million this year. We said we'll be over 2.5 million units by 2026 in our medium term, and that 60% should be off that two point \u2013 that higher number. That's where we're heading. And we're seeing the results of that. We're seeing it on the productivity side, where our running on arrivals are down. And we're seeing that also on the customer stickiness side in two ways. One is when we are connected, like our EV product or any connected product, we're getting more in price for service. And then we're getting higher conversion rates and higher retention rates. Our retention rates this year, we were pleased with. They're at 94%. I look forward to the day that we can report a 95% retention rate because that will have significant validity to our service-driven growth strategy. Conversions were up this year. And I think a lot of that, especially in China, going up to 48% this year where they ended was due to our Gen 3 elevators being connected and our Otis ONE units as well. So globally, we're now at a 64% conversion rate. And as China continues on its path to get to 60%, which we think is the target, then, globally, we will be at about 70% conversion. And that is our higher margin conversion. On the portfolio itself, that it is Otis ONE. It is that connected product that gives us the conviction that we can take the 4.1% portfolio growth even higher. Even though this is what we shared for the medium-term guide at about 4%, we do believe we can get that higher, including in 2023. So all-in-all, investments in the New Equipment side are continuing. Our R&D spend is there. Our strategic investments are there. We're really pleased with expanding Gen 3 and Gen360. On the service side, the Otis ONE value proposition for the customers is working, and we believe it's reflected in our margin expansion as well for our shareholders. So Anurag, let me turn it over to you for mix. Yes, I think that's accurate, about half. You bet. Hey, Steve. Yes. We've got \u2013 there's a chart in the back. And Steve, we've shared that we \u2013 our focus is having a net positive net churn between retention and recaptures. Retention, they're the most important units to us. We get them at the highest margin, and that's where we want to start that individual customer relationship that we hope last decades into modernization and then into it, just for decades. So it's at 94%. It's about aligned with last \u2013 with 2021. I'd say it's pretty close in terms of retention and recapture though, it was up. And you can see that slightly, but it was up healthy, and that was really driven by a few items. Two, I'll call out. One is our sales specialization where we actually have recapture sales reps that, that is all they do. And they focus on the density and capturing the best of the optimal units for Otis because we have to go in at a lower price than we would at a normal conversion, but we want to make sure that they are accretive. So the recapture specialists really \u2013 we saw them hit their stride as we went through 2022. And the second is Otis ONE. And the capital investment, we continue to make at the data level on connected units and on offering that when we do go recapture that really makes a difference to our customers. I've personally been involved in a few of those sales calls to win some portfolios back. And it really makes a difference. We can show them the visibility they have, their dashboard they're going to have and the whole ecosystem we offer. And so those two combined have really helped, and that's really \u2013 that's been our strategy, and it's what we're going to continue doing. I think it's pretty consistent with 2021 is what I would say. We didn't see huge anomalies. Obviously, it's \u2013 our portfolio in China, our service portfolio, I think we've shared is a little over 325,000 units. And that's grown. It's our sixth straight quarter of mid to high single-digit portfolio growth in China. And so we're continuing, recapture, did well there. So we're continuing to monitor that. But our team \u2013 our service teams in China are continuing against six straight quarters, and we expect \u2013 because of the growth in that segment, we expect that to be in the teens again for 2023. Yes. And Miguel, I'll just let me wrap on that. But I mean this is \u2013 that was our medium-term guide that we gave at the Investor Day in February of last year, and that's what \u2013 we beat it in 2022, and we're staying consistent right now with our guide with the Investor Day. Thank you. Well, thank you, Norma. Our success in 2022, our third year in a row of performing for all stakeholders, demonstrates the strategic resiliency of our business and provides us with confidence as we begin a new year. Supported by strong industry dynamics, we remain committed to our strategic pillars in order to deliver for our customers, shareholders, valued communities and the riding public. We set significant goals for the year ahead, and we look forward to sharing our 2023 success with you. Please stay safe and well. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with fourth quarter results on Slide 6. For the fourth quarter, reported sales of $3.4 billion were down 3.6%. Organic sales grew for the ninth consecutive quarter and growth accelerated to 6%, our best performance of the year with mid-single-digit growth in new equipment and high-single-digit growth in service. Adjusted operating profit excluding a $49 million Forex headwind increased $39 million with constant currency growth in both segments. Strong service performance, especially on volume and price was partially offset by commodities in mixed headwinds and new equipment as well as higher corporate cost. Adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter and the year improved 80 basis points as a percentage of sales, as we remain vigilant on structural cost reduction and cost containment to help mitigate the macro headwinds we have faced. At the same time, we are committed to growing the business and R&D and strategic investment as a percent of sales remain about flat. Adjusted EPS grew 4% or $0.03 in the quarter driven by operational growth of $0.07. This strong operational growth alongside the accretion from Zardoya and $850 million of share repurchases more than offset the $0.08 headwind from Forex. While the fourth quarter free cash flow conversion was strong at 145%, our full year free cash flow came in at $1.45 billion or 115% of net income lighter than we had anticipated as we built $65 million of inventory to mitigate supply chain challenges and support backlog conversion going into 2023. Moving to new equipment performance on Slide 7. Otis new equipment orders in the quarter increased 4% with EMEA and Asia-Pacific up high single digits and China orders returning to growth of mid-single digits, which more than offset a modest decline in the Americas. Overall with better than expected orders growth in the quarter, we finished the year with a new equipment adjusted backlog up 11% at constant currency with growth in all regions, including notably in China. Pricing on new equipment orders in the quarter increased 3 points led by the Americas with solid performance in EMEA and APAC. In China, we have been roughly price cost neutral throughout 2022 as commodity inflation eased and we continue to drive productivity to offset pricing pressure in the market. Fourth quarter new equipment sales of $1.5 billion return to growth driven by over 10% growth in the America, EMEA and Asia Pacific with EMEA outperforming our prior expectations. China sales declined at a lower rate than what we saw in the middle of the year as the team navigated well through post lockdown COVID outbreaks to execute on the backlog. Overall, strong execution by the team will return to sales growth in the fourth quarter in new equipment. Operating profit margins were roughly flat for the quarter. The benefit of higher volume, strong productivity and cost containment nearly mitigated the approximately $25 million headwinds from commodities and Forex. Now turning to Service segment performance on Slide 8. We saw an acceleration in our portfolio growth to over 4% with every region adding to the portfolio this year. With another year of excellent high teens growth in China and low single digit growth elsewhere, our portfolio now is about 2.2 million units. Globally, our recaptures more than offset cancellations for the year with conversions as the growth driver. Additional details on our portfolio growth in 2022 and drivers for future growth can be found in the appendix. Modernization orders were also a highlight up 13% with growth in all regions, including some major project bookings in the Americas and Asia Pacific and continued strength from a mod package offerings. Our modernization backlog is up 7% versus the prior year, giving us good line of sight for growth in 2023. Moving on to service sales. We delivered another quarter of strong organic sales growth up almost 7% with growth in all lines of business. Maintenance pricing, excluding the impact of mix and churn came in as expected up about 3 points for the year, contributing approximately 1 point to overall revenue growth. Organic modernization sales grew 8.8% and similar to last quarter we saw broad growth across regions, including double digit growth in both Americas and Asia Pacific. We finished with our best service margin expansion for the year up 70 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit, excluding $42 million of Forex headwind was up $51 million as higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity were partially offset by our annual wage increases. We have now delivered 12 consecutive quarters of service margin expansion with margins increasing roughly 200 basis points over the past three years. Slide 9 lays out the full year 2022 adjusted EPS bridge. Strong operational execution drove $0.39 of constant currency EPS growth, which mitigated $0. 18 in commodity headwinds leading to operating profit growth of $124 million or $0.21. Through our capital allocation strategy, including the accretion from the Zardoya transaction and share repurchase of $850 million and optimizing a tax rate, we were able to offset $0.26 in Forex headwinds. Overall, strong operational performance led to EPS growth of 7.5% or $0.22. We finished the year with 2022 adjusted tax rate of 26.5%, a 220 basis point improvement versus 2021, which contributed to EPS growth both in the quarter and for the full year. Overall, the team performed well throughout 2022 by executing on the controllables, which helped us to build a strong backlog, grow organic sales, expand margin by 30 basis points and return $1.3 billion to shareholders. As we look ahead to 2023, the new equipment outlook is on Slide 10. Over the past few years, we have delivered strong orders globally from a combination of market growth, our share gain initiatives and incremental pricing actions. This has resulted in a robust multi-year backlog, giving us good line of sight for the next couple of years. In 2023, we expect new equipment organic sales to grow between 3% to 5% with Americas and EMEA up mid-single digits and Asia growing low single digits. Asia-Pacific is expected to be up at least mid-single digits, and though the backlog in China is up 2 points, we expect sales to be about flat reflecting pressure on the Book and Ship business from expected market declines in the first half. We expect new equipment profit margins to be flat to up 40 basis points. We expect roughly $100 million of tailwinds from volume, pricing, productivity and commodities. This will be partially offset by unfavorable regional and project mix and some snap back in SG&A expense due to 2022 cost containment actions. We will continue to drive strong productivity on both material and installation and project closeouts as the year progresses to drive out performance. Turning to our service outlook on Slide 11. Starting with sales, we expect another solid year in service and anticipate organic sales increasing 5% to 7%. Maintenance and repair organic sales are expected to grow 4.5% or 6.5% driven by maintenance portfolio growth, pricing and low to mid-single digit repair growth after two strong years of COVID-related recovery. We expect more than 1 point of pricing after adjusting for mix and churn. For modernization, we anticipate organic sales of mid to high single digits as we execute on a solid backlog and drive our Book and Ship business from new product launches and focus on sales force specialization. Turning to profit, we expect roughly 50 basis points of margin expansion. Headwinds from annual wage inflation will be more than offset by volume, price and productivity similar drivers to 2022. Turning to Slide 12 for the 2023 adjusted EPS bridge. We are expecting $3.35 to $3.50 in adjusted EPS driven by $0.23 to $0.31 of operating profit growth. We expect to offset $0.09 of Forex headwind at the midpoint and a modest increase in interest expense through a lower share count, $0.04 of remaining Zardoya accretion and continued optimization of a tax rate. We plan to complete $600 million to $800 million in share repurchases during the year. For cadence, we expect strong EPS growth in the second half of the year, while the first half remains roughly flat. We see the bulk of the FX headwind, post lockdown COVID impact in China, and a modest supply chain overhang in new equipment in the first quarter. We anticipate stronger growth sequentially thereafter, including better performance in China in the second half of the year. Overall, we anticipate Otis organic sales growth of 4% to 6% with approximately 20 basis points to 30 basis points of margin expansion leading to 6% to 10% EPS growth. And on cash, we expect to generate $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion in free cash flow in 2023, 110% conversion of GAAP net income at the midpoint. This outlook demonstrates another year of consistent and solid operational execution as we continue to mitigate macro challenges and create meaningful shareholder value. With that, I will request Norma to please open the line for questions. Great. Thanks, Judy. Yes, so Julian, just on the quarter one, let me start with the segments first. From a service perspective, we expect to see performance in line with the full year guidance. The swing factor could be repair, modernization or some mix, but overall we aren't seeing anything major to call out and expect kind of mid-single digit growth and margin expansion. It may be not close to 50 basis points regarding for the year, but still be good at expansion as we ran through the year. The new equipment is a segment that we do expect some weakness from both a sales and a margin perspective. Specifically compared to last year, China as a tough compare as the COVID impact didn't really start until the second quarter. And while we \u2013 as Judy mentioned, we do expect better performance in China as we go through the course of the year. We aren't expecting it to happen until the second half of the year. In Americas, the team performed very well in the fourth quarter. But there is still some supply chain inefficiencies and labor shortages, which I expected to clear up in the second or third quarter. So overall, we expect sales on the new equipment side to be down quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, and margins to be above flattish with where we ended up in the fourth quarter. Now kind of going to the other line items, starting with corporate expenses. Last year, the first half was light because of all the cost containment we did. So it is going to \u2013 the run rate is going to pick up very similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. So there could be a couple of pennies of headwinds over there. And then on the FX side, we've said about at the midpoint $55 million of FX headwind and a bulk of it will come in the first quarter because last year at this point in time, the euro was $1.15, the renminbi was $6.35. So though the currencies have improved, there is still a significant headwind. So majority of our FX headwind will come in the first quarter. So putting it all together, we do expect EPS to be down a couple of pennies. As you know, the Forex any new equipment corporate will kind of offset the good performance in service and the Zardoya accretion. So net-net down a couple of pennies and sequentially also could be down $0.01 or $0.02. Yes. And just to add to that in terms of the growth for 2023. So yes, you're right that our growth at the midpoint is very similar to where it is in 2022, but the pieces are a little bit different. The portfolio growth as you put together 4% and what Judy spoke about the pricing, you add 3%, then you adjust for churn and mix, we should be up about 6% for 2023, which is higher than where we were in 2022. Repair is as I mentioned in my prepared comments, over the past two or three years we've been running at a 10% CAGR on the Repair business coming out of COVID. Now, typically the Repair business will outgrow the Maintenance business because as we continue on our strategy on new repair packages, increasing penetration. But this year there'll be \u2013 just be a little bit of a catch up from what happened in the past two to three years. And then going forward, it should outpace the Maintenance business. So that's why we're saying low to mid-single digit. And modernization is pretty \u2013 it's around 7-ish percent at the midpoint. So those are the pieces which get us to 5.5%. Now, clearly, if pricing is a little bit better, repair comes in better, and the modernization book and ship there could be a little bit more over there. But right now we feel well calibrated at the midpoint of the guidance. Okay, great. Thanks for the question. So price cost is positive in 2023. I mean, you can see it from the margin expansion as well that's happening at the midpoint. So in pricing, if you look at this year, I mean, after flattish first half, we started seeing pricing going up 3% in the back half. And our backlog is actually up \u2013 our backlog margins are up over 100 basis points. And what we have assumed for next year is about 50 basis points of pricing coming through into the P&L, which is roughly about $30-ish million. And the reason it's 50 basis points not what we have right now is it takes a while for the backlog to convert into revenue, and some of that will come into later years, but still are price positive. On commodities, we do expect about a $20 million to $30 million tailwind. If we look back over the past two years, we faced about $180 million of commodity headwind. Slightly more than $100 million came from Americas and China, and the rest came from Europe and Asia. In Americas and China, of the $100 million on headwind, we're seeing about $30 million, $40 million of that come back as prices of steel have started coming down. And though we are 50% locked, we still see some of it coming down over years. So clearly, that is very positive. It is actually in EMEA and in Asia-Pacific where we're not seeing the tailwinds right now. In Europe, if you look at guide rails, it set up 85% from where it was two years ago. So clearly, there is some headwind over there. And in Asia, we buy a lot from Tier 2 suppliers, and that's not yet come down as well. But overall, we see about a $20 million, $30 million tailwind on commodities. So net-net between price and commodities, it's positive. Yes. Thanks. So as you can see, on the investment side, we'll continue to invest and still grow our margins. Last year, we grew about 30 basis points, this year we're guiding for 2030. And we'll look for productivity other ways to kind of offset that. On the mix, it's two, it's regional and product or project mix. On the regional mix, as you are aware that China New Equipment is a higher margin market for us. And even last year in 2022, the other markets did a little bit better than China. But if you look at 2023, we are guiding for China to be flat, whereas Americas-EMEA to be up mid-single-digit and Asia mid to high single-digit. So that adds a little bit of a regional mix impact. But the more bigger mix impact is coming from project mix. And over the past two or three years, and as you've seen us making announcements on, we won a lot of major projects, part of our share growth strategy has obviously been on the volume as well as looking at different verticals, be it infrastructure, others to grow our major projects. And the more major projects are, they definitely come in with very good maintenance business, very high stickiness, very good margin, but they are lower margin than the volume business. So there's a little bit of that impact, a healthy backlog that we have of 11% as we go into 2023 and beyond. Okay. I think there were three questions over there. So let me start with the China New Equipment margin. We don't disclose margin by regions. If you look at China New Equipment, it is slightly higher. It's a good margin business for us. Importantly, if you look at even last year with all the volume decline, the commodities headwinds that we faced, we were still able to mitigate a significant amount of that through productivity. So the margins of the New Equipment business have actually held quite strong because of the productivity business. And even this year, where we are guiding to our margins to be, we're almost back to 2021 levels. Despite volume being flattish or slightly down, China volume being down 10% and going through a commodity headwinds of about $150 million, $180 million. So clearly, the margins are trending in the right direction. And all I would say is that we're quite happy with the way we've been able to mitigate some of the headwinds to get to where we are right now. Yes. So that's on the first question regarding where our New Equipment margins are. Backlog is trending up. The backlog margin is trending up. We've had price increases over the past couple of quarters. If you look at where we're exiting this year, in 2021, our backlog margin declined by one point, we are above one point right now. And \u2013 where commodities are and where our pricing and new orders and new proposals are going in, that backlog margin should kind of inch up as we move along through the course of the year. We, again, don't give specific guidance on where it would be, but it's encouraging to see the price kind of sticking in the market over there. Yes. And sorry, what was the third question? I couldn't quite get the question completely. If you could just repeat that, Miguel. Yes, it's still accretive for us in terms of the margins over there when we keep driving productivity. So it will \u2013 the strategy that we're kind of embarking upon the digitalization of productivity, we should see the margins kind of inching up. I mean net-net, on the service side, we're seeing 50 basis points margin expansion this year, which is on the high end of a medium-term guidance. And obviously, margins will differ by region, by country. But with all the tools we are doing and we see margin expansion across all the regions. Yes. So let me take back, actually, our working capital in China collection is progressing quite well. If you look at this 2022, we finished about 115% of net income, which was quite good. We had a very strong fourth quarter. We came in a little bit lighter was because of the inventory that we built up to make sure that we can support our backlog as we get into 2023. Between receivables and payables, we are pretty much there. So it was more of the inventory build out. Now what we're guiding at the midpoint for 2023 is 110% of net income. It's essentially driven by earnings growth with a little bit of a modest offset from capital expenditure as we're embarking on our Otis ONE strategy. So that takes us to 110% net income. And as we move forward, we should grow our cash with earnings. And that's what we've kind of guided towards. And you should see that normalizing around the 110-ish percent level."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We hope everyone listening is safe and well. Starting with Q3 highlights on Slide 3. Otis delivered a solid third quarter and strong year-to-date results, especially considering the macro headwinds we're facing. We grew organic sales, expanded margins and achieved mid-single-digit adjusted EPS growth, all largely driven by strong performance of our resilient service business. By executing our strategy, we continue to set ourselves up for the future. This quarter, we demonstrated that performance through accelerating maintenance portfolio growth, which was up 3.8% in the quarter, growing modernization backlog 7% and gaining about one point of New Equipment share year-to-date, with share about flat in the quarter. Year-to-date, the New Equipment market was down mid-single digits, driven by China, which was down about 15%. In the Americas, we are honored to be selected for a modernization project at the iconic Space Needle in Seattle. Otis installed the original elevator in the early 1960s and has been maintaining the units ever since. We will now modernize the Landmarks 3 elevators, including introducing new technologies such as custom design cabs and Compass 360. In Suzhou, part of the Greater Shanghai Metropolitan area, the urban rail network is being expanded once again with the support of Otis. The new Line 8 will be served by nearly 140 Otis escalators and 38 Gen 3 and SkyRise elevators when it begins operations in late 2024. In London, Otis was selected to help modernize an office block into a modern mixed-use development that strives to be the first net zero carbon-enabled office development in London. Otis will provide vertical transportation solutions, including several escalators and elevators equipped with Compass 360 destination dispatching to allow tenants and visitors seamless and efficient access to the buildings floors. And lastly, in Korea, we're extending an over 30-year relationship with GS Engineering & Construction to provide more than 55 elevators to the [indiscernible] Apartment Complex. These units will be outfitted with ReGen Drive technology, helping to maximize energy efficiency for the elevator serving 1,500 apartments in the complex. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion was 106% of GAAP net income, and we kept our capital allocation plans on track with another $300 million of share repurchases in the quarter, completing the $700 million in repurchases we had planned for 2022. With a quarter to go, we feel confident in our cash flow outlook and are increasing our full-year share repurchase outlook to $850 million. And we continue to drive important ESG initiatives, a key priority for Otis. This quarter, our efforts resulted in achieving a gold rating with EcoVadis. Now moving to Slide 4, Q3 results and 2022 outlook. New Equipment orders were down 0.8% at constant currency in the third quarter. Excluding China, orders were up 7.4% with growth in all regions. On a rolling 12-month basis, total Otis orders were up 7.6%. Organic sales were up 0.8%, and adjusted operating profit was up $35 million at constant currency with 60 basis points of margin expansion driven by segment mix and strong performance in the Service business. In the quarter, we generated $215 million of free cash flow, which was down versus prior year, driven by an increase in inventory to support backlog conversion and the timing of supplier payments. This brings us to $1 billion year-to-date with 106% conversion of GAAP net income. Looking ahead to our 2022 outlook. We're revising our full-year outlook and now expect organic sales growth of 2% to 2.5%, with net sales in the range of $13.4 million to $13.5 billion. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be approximately $2.1 billion, up $120 million to $140 million, excluding the impacts from foreign exchange. After approximately $175 million in headwinds from foreign exchange translation, adjusted operating profit at actual currency is expected to be down $35 million to $55 million. Adjusted EPS is expected in the range of $3.11 to $3.15, up 5% to 7% versus the prior-year. Lastly, we still expect free cash flow to be robust between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion or approximately 125% conversion of GAAP net income. We will remain disciplined and balanced on our capital allocation, advancing our bolt-on M&A strategy where it makes sense and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases expected to be $850 million versus the $700 million target announced previously. With that, I'll turn it over to Anurag to walk through our Q3 results in more detail.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with third quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales of $3.3 billion were down 7.6%, driven by the broad strengthening of the U.S. dollar, a 7.2% headwind in the quarter. Organically, sales were up 80 basis points, the eighth consecutive quarter of growth driven by service, which increased over 6%. Adjusted operating profit, excluding a $50 million foreign exchange translation headwind, was up $35 million. Drop-through on higher service volume, favorable service pricing, strong SG&A cost control and the benefit from productivity in both segments was partially offset by impact of lower New Equipment volume, commodity price increases and annual wage inflation. Adjusted SG&A expense was down 90 basis points as a percentage of sales as we continue to drive cost reduction and containment to help mitigate the inflationary headwinds. Despite the challenging environment, we maintained investment in the business and R&D spend and other strategic investments were about flat versus the prior-year. Overall, adjusted operating profit margin expanded 60 basis points, driven by segment mix, strong Service performance and cost containment. Adjusted EPS was up 5% or $0.04. An $0.08 headwind from foreign exchange translation was more than offset by strong operational performance, driven by the Service segment, accretion from the Zardoya transaction and a benefit of $700 million in share repurchases completed year-to-date. Moving to Slide 6. Q3 New Equipment orders were down slightly at constant currency and up 7.4%, excluding China. Orders in the Americas were up 3% with solid growth and multi-family residential and infrastructure. EMEA orders were up 11% with growth in both Europe and the Middle East, and orders in Asia outside of China were up approximately 10% driven by strong growth in South Korea and India. The strong orders growth over the last 12 months contributed to New Equipment backlog increasing 12% at constant currency with growth in all regions, including China, which was up slightly. Backlog in Americas, EMEA and Asia outside of China was up high-teens. Pricing trends improved year-over-year in all regions, excluding China, where pricing was flat. Globally, pricing on New Equipment orders continues to accelerate and was up 4% leading to sequential backlog margin improvement. New Equipment organic sales were down 5% in the quarter, as mid single-digit growth in EMEA and low-teens growth in Asia, excluding China was more than offset by 4% decline in the Americas due to a tough compare and delays in building construction and a high-teens decline in China driven by the challenging market conditions. Sales decline of $191 million and adjusted operating profit declined $23 million, largely from the impact of lower volume and related under absorption. Commodity inflation of $18 million that was aligned with price expectations was more than offset by productivity and lower SG&A expense. Service segment results on Slide 7. Maintenance portfolio units were up 3.8% with recaptured units more than offsetting cancellations in the quarter. Conversion rate continues to show improvement this year in China, which contributed to mid-teens portfolio growth in the region. Modernization orders growth accelerated to 18% in the quarter with growth in all regions driven by good traction or newer mod package offerings and several major project wings. Backlog was up 7% at constant currency. Service organic sales grew for the seventh consecutive quarter up 6.2% the growth in all lines of business. Maintenance and repair grew 5.4% from the benefit of high single-digit repair volume and growth in contractual maintenance sales that outpaced our unit growth due to improved pricing, which was up three points on a like-for-like basis. Modernization sales continued the recovery that started in Q4 of '21 and were up 10% in the quarter the growth in every region. Service profit at constant FX was up $49 million driven by the drop through on higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity, which more than offset the headwinds from annual wage increases. As a result of this, margins were up 50 basis points, the 11th consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Overall, despite the significant macro headwinds, our year-to-date results are strong. We gain approximately one point of New Equipment share delivered the best portfolio growth in over a decade and more than mitigated $195 million of headwinds from FX and commodity inflation through strong execution to achieve an 8.5% EPS growth. Moving to Slide 8 and the revised outlook. These changes reflect revised expectations in the China market outlook, the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar and our focus on productivity initiatives to offset the headwinds. Starting with sales, we are expecting organic sales to be up 2% to 2.5% versus 2.5% to 3.5% previously. This 75 basis point reduction is driven by lower expectations for China New Equipment partially offset by an improved modernization outlook in service. The New Equipment margin outlook is down 10 basis points at the midpoint from the impact of lower volume in China offset by cost containment. Service margins are now expected to be up approximately 50 basis points, a 10 basis point reduction from the prior outlook reflecting the mix impact of modernization sales growing faster than the maintenance and repair business. The overall margin outlook remains unchanged versus the prior outlook, and is expected to be up approximately 30 basis points to 15.7%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.11 to $3.15 up 5% to 7% versus the prior year. This adjusted EPS growth is driven by strong operational execution, accretion from the Zardoya transaction, progress on reducing our tax rate and a lower share count that more than offset $0.47 of headwind from foreign exchange translation and commodity inflation. We now expect free cash flow to be in a range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion versus approximately $1.6 billion previously. Foreign exchange translation continues to weigh on cash flow generation, and we anticipate a moderate build in inventory heading into 2023 to support project execution on the growing backlog. On capital deployment, we are increasing the share repurchase target to $850 million, having already completed our previous outlook of $700 million in the first three quarters. This is an over 2x increase from the $300 million to $500 million guidance we had given in the beginning of the year, and combined with a 20% dividend increase, underscores our commitment to return cash to shareholders. Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9. The New Equipment business is projected to be down approximately 2.5% versus down 0.5% to 1% previously. We now expect Asia to be down approximately 6% from down low single-digits previously driven by China. Despite our backlog being up slightly versus prior year and up from the end of '21, we now expect Otis China organic sales to be down 10%, driven by the shift of project execution to the right and lower market expectations now expected to be down roughly 15%. This has been partially offset by improved outlook in Asia Pacific from the benefit of strong orders growth momentum in India and South Korea. The New Equipment outlook in the Americas and EMEA is unchanged, expected to be flat and up low to mid single-digits, respectively. Turning to Service. We now expect organic sales to be up 6% to 6.5%, an improvement of 50 basis points at the low end, driven by a conversion of modernization backlog that is up 7%. Moving to Slide 10. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 5% to 7%, an $0.18 increase at the midpoint. We expect to more than offset the $110 million headwind from commodities with $230 million to $250 million of operational improvement from higher service volume and pricing, productivity in both segments and other cost containment actions, resulting in profit growth of $120 million to $140 million at constant currency. This is $5 million lower than our prior outlook at the midpoint, driven by reduced China New Equipment volume expectations that we are partially mitigating through better cost containment and productivity. Accretion from the Zardoya transaction, over two points of tax rate reduction versus last year and the benefit from over $1.5 billion of share repurchases since spin, partially offsets the $0.29 or $175 million headwind from the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We have now assumed the euro at $0.97 for the fourth quarter or $1.04 for the full-year. Overall, since 2019, this outlook represents 50 basis points of annual margin expansion and low teens three-year adjusted EPS CAGR, reflecting the execution of our long-term strategy and our ability to mitigate the macro challenges we have faced. We feel confident that this momentum, along with our growing backlog and service portfolio sets us up well to deliver strong financial performance in 2023 and beyond. And with that, I will request Norma to please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Good morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: So obviously -- China is obviously the sort of the big issue. But just wanted to talk about the Americas because it -- you mentioned some project and construction delays in the Americas. I'm just wondering if you could just give us some context on the geographies there. I'm assuming it's the U.S., but if there's anything else going on there, please let us know. And any verticals of standout where you've seen delays?\nJudy Marks: Nigel, it's Judy. Good morning. So it is primarily the U.S. It's not rate driven. It really is availability of construction labor outside of the elevator part. We're feeling very confident in our ability to be at job sites at the right time. We recognize we're in the critical path, but it's all the other trades from getting the hoistway poured to really just directing the building. So that's really what we're seeing, and it's a delay, it's a slowdown, but it's not going to go away. The buildings are going to get built, but it's going to move some revenue into '23 even from the fourth quarter. So we're watching that carefully. There's really no unique vertical that, that's happening. The verticals are really still strong. And if you look at ABI is at 51 7, Dodge construction starts. The biggest growth we're seeing is in multifamily residential. And year-to-date, Dodge construction starts for multifamily residential is up 28%. So demand is still strong. Orders are strong, 24.3% year-to-date in the Americas, and we're just seeing a little bit of delay in terms of being able to deliver and record that revenue.\nNigel Coe: Yes, I agree with that. And then my second question is really on, I think Anurag, you mentioned 4% pricing on orders, if I caught that right? What is the realized price today? Is it still trending negative today? So I'm just wondering of that 4% as we convert that backlog into 2023, if we have a little bit of good news on commodities, is there a path to expanding New Equipment margins in 2023.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Thanks for the question. So yes, the price increase, firstly, it's coming through on the backlog margins, as I mentioned, right? So this quarter, we did see the backlog margins kind of flattish sequentially relative to -- sorry, VPY, it was kind of flattish. Now I'm talking about flowing it through. If you look at the third quarter on the New Equipment side, the flow-through to the bottom line, it was essentially volume. So we have about $100 million VPY in terms of decline in terms of revenue and $20 million of that should flow through to the bottom line. And that is what the VPY is on the New Equipment side. So we're kind of hitting the price cost neutrality in the quarter itself, right? So -- and as backlog margins improve from now to the end of the year, we should see that expansion coming into 2023 as well.\nJudy Marks: Yes. Nigel, just one other thing. What I watch is that early trend as well. And we were up two points in the second quarter on New Equipment pricing and now four points this quarter. As a long cycle, it's going to take some time to get through the backlog, but it's going to come through. In terms of commodities flipping, really the only place we've seen that significantly already is China. And I would say Europe is a question mark there in terms of -- because of energy prices and everything else going on. But we would welcome commodities coming down as soon as possible, and you'll see that flow through. That again, during our long cycle, gives us the opportunity to drive material productivity, supply chain, everything in our backlog.\nNigel Coe: That's great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nJudy Marks: Hey, Jeff.\nJeffrey Sprague: Hi, good morning. Can we just delve a little deeper now into China? Maybe just frame the order decline, kind of speaking to order declines ex-China, I guess we can all try to do that math, but I'd love to maybe have you frame that up for us. And maybe more importantly, just kind of speak to what's in backlog and sort of your visibility on China revenues over the next two to four quarters or so?\nJudy Marks: Sure. Let me start, and then, Anurag, feel free to jump in. So we now view full-year '22 China market growth estimates down 15%, roughly. Some of this is driven to the lockdown. Some of its driven by the property market confidence. And clearly, the market won't recover in '22. Q1 was down 5%. Q2, the segment was down 20%. Q3, we believe it was down 20% as well. And last quarter, we assumed COVID would be relieved. There'd be somewhat of a return to normal. And while this might not be as visible to everyone outside China, the COVID lockdowns are absolutely continuing, especially in Tier 3 and below cities. So those constraints are really constraining us from being able to do final shipments in terms of delivering them on the trucks and then installing them. Having said that, Jeff, I'm feeling good about the health of our business in China. When we talked about New Equipment pricing just a second ago, we're net price cost neutral to favorable in China this quarter, which is just a testament to the resiliency and the tenacity of Harry and our China team to be able to do that. The market segment was down about 20%. We were down pretty close to that in orders. So we didn't -- there was not a share gain there for us this quarter, although we've had them in the first two quarters. Our strategy and our initiatives are on track in New Equipment. We've gained share year-to-date. The only segment that was up in China in the third quarter was infrastructure. All of the others were down. All of the tier cities were down as well, but they were down -- Tier 1 was down the least, Tier 2 next and then it degraded from there in terms of larger down in terms of segment. While all this was happening, our teams still delivered. Modernization grew and service grew again. It was our fifth consecutive quarter where we had mid-teens or above portfolio growth where recaptures outpaced cancellations. And so they were all really good positive contributors. As I look into '23 without -- we're not going to give a guide right now. But as we look at it, especially in China, the segment, if you go back to our first Investor Day in February of 2020, we shared we thought the China segment would be about 550,000 units a year and be flattish. That's where it was in early '20 pre-COVID. It spiked and got up to 650,000 last year. If you assume the segment is down 15%, it gets you to a 540,000 kind of number. Our early assessment for '23 is the segment is going to be between 500,000 and 525,000. And again, the pricing we've seen is rational, and we're driving costs down, commodities are down and material productivity is doing a great job. So on the New Equipment side, I actually think we're in a good position. We've got some limited backlog in China, fourth quarter will drive that as well as we go into the rest of the year. But the rest of the -- total company-wise, we're up 12% on New Equipment orders. Everybody is growing in mod as well. And I will remind everyone that there are 8 million units at the end of this year in Service in China. So that's going to be the key growth lever. We're still going to be gaining share in New Equipment, executing our strategy, but our service growth and portfolio growth will continue. Anurag?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. Thanks, Judy. I mean, overall, we feel very good about the market over there. In terms of the backlog, today, Jeff, right, so as Judy said in the prepared comments, we're up 12% on the backlog. And China is slightly up as well relative to last year. So we have a good line of sight over the next few quarters, not only in China and the other regions for the backlog. As you are aware, two-thirds of our revenue for next year will come from the ending backlog. So given where we are today and the pipeline that we have seen on the new order side, good line of sight to convert that into shipment next year.\nJeffrey Sprague: Maybe just, thank you for all that color. That was very helpful. Just to maybe shift gears back to mod and maybe it's more of a global question now. But any indication of just kind of economic weakness coloring some of the forward demand around mod, it's a great deal that can certainly be discretionary, at least temporarily discretionary.\nJudy Marks: Jeff, the challenge is this would be the third or fourth year of discretionary. So all of a sudden, there's modernization projects, especially the ones that are technology insertion versus just aesthetics have really started coming to the forefront. 7 million of the units in the world are over 20 years old. So it's a huge mod market, and the team really delivered 18% up in orders, year-to-date up 6.5%. We got a 7% backlog. So I actually think we're seeing the pent-up demand. And again, for those who don't modernize, and the elevators will tend to break down, especially 20 years old, more frequently, which drives our repair business. And between that and just people returning to office, hotels, our repair business is up really nicely.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great. Thanks. I'll leave it there.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just wanted to start with the fourth quarter guidance. So it looks as if you're dialing in a pretty severe sequential margin decline. And I realize maybe there's some deleveraging with fixed cost under absorption because of the China calendar and also the market weakness there. Maybe just highlight if there's anything else driving that big sequential decremental margin. And also just to put a finer point on it in Q4, China New Equipment, I think those sales were down high-teens in the third quarter. Are we expecting a steeper rate of decline year-on-year in the fourth?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Thanks, Julian. This is Anurag here. Let me answer the second question first. On the channel, the rate of decline is actually reducing in the fourth quarter. You're right, it was double-digit in the third quarter, but we see it to be low single-digit in the fourth quarter, right? Now going back to -- on the fourth quarter, where you see the margin is essentially on the New Equipment side of the business, right? If you go back to the past few years, seasonally, Q4 has been a lower margin for us. We've been around the 5% so margin level. And that is the big difference between the year-to-date run rate on New Equipment margin versus the fourth quarter. And when we gave guidance in July, at that point in time, that was calibrated. We said that the guidance margin for the second half of the year for New Equipment would be closer to 6.2%. I mean, clearly -- and that was assuming that China would kind of return back to more normal times. But as you can see in our guide, the revenue is down by about $100 million, largely because of China, and that flows through at 20% -- $20 million. So if that has flown through to the bottom line, it would have been a 50 basis points margin degradation from 6.2% to 5.7%. But through productivity to other cost containment, we were able to mitigate it and get it back to 6%. And clearly, a lot of it was overdriven in the third quarter, both in terms of closeout, in terms of productivity, in terms of cost containment. As we go into the fourth quarter, in terms of volume, in terms of our commodities, that is pretty much constant run rate where we see a little bit is on the regional mix, and that kind of makes the margin go down. Having said that, we'll continue to work on the SG&A side of productivity, and it was a little bit more upside on New Equipment. We'll kind of drive that through. So that is the big one. And lastly is just FX, right? We had a $50 million FX headwind in the third quarter. That steps up to about $67 million, $68 million that $17 million, $18 million. So it's between New Equipment and FX, which is kind of causing the Q4 versus Q3 margins.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just my follow-up would be around not so much modernization specifically, which I think came up. But more broadly on kind of Europe pricing. I think people are very nervous because of the macro data that you might get a deep and possibly a long European construction slowdown fairly soon. The last time that happened, there was pricing pressure in a number of areas, including elevator service 14 or 13 years ago. Just wanted your thoughts today on the sort of fragmentation of the Europe service market and maybe how Otis kind of practices might be different there? And how does it work in terms of inflation feeding through to your new Service contracts for next year in Europe?\nJudy Marks: Yes, let me start with that one. So Service pricing in general, just for -- we know, like-for-like pricing increased three points. In the third quarter it was very solid and really was strongest in the developed mature markets globally where the majority of our portfolio resides. So that hits right to the heart of your question, Julian, in terms of really how is Europe doing on service pricing. The majority of renewals are pretty much up. When you think about how the year rolls out, our largest renewals happened in the first quarter and then over time. So we should finish the year with that like-for-like pricing, especially in Europe. We do have inflationary clauses. Most of them tied to labor, especially in Europe and North America. So we have the ability to raise prices again when the new year starts. And what encourages me is that it will be indexed based on '21 -- '22 inflation this year when we start '23. So the inflation indices will be even higher. And now it's up to us to go get that because it's in our contracts and our sales teams are trained to do that. So we've been offsetting the labor inflation is the labor inflation, as you can see, even in Europe based on the margin expansion we've had. On the general macroeconomics in Europe, so far, I got to tell you, especially on the New Equipment side, it looks good in '22. Orders are up this quarter 11%, 10.3% for the 12-month roll. We're watching the headwinds, but building permits are still holding. So we haven't seen that change. And so our goal, again, is to gain share and build backlog, and that's exactly what Bernardo and our EMEA team have been doing. On your last part about comparing to 13 or 14 years ago, it's a very different time now. Back then, we were 10 points differentiation between ourselves and our closest OEM maintenance service providers in terms of margins. And that was what was driving the Otis machine at the time. Right now, we're much closer, very close, pricing is rational. There's not an oversupply of labor like we experienced after the '08 financial crisis and all those New Equipment installers became ISPs, and there wasn't a technology like Otis ONE that gives us that advanced stickiness that customers are really believing in now and seeing and it's giving us productivity. So it's a different world, and I think our performance over the last 10 or 11 quarters shows that.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nStephen Tusa: Hi guys. Good morning.\nJudy Marks: Good morning.\nStephen Tusa: So where do you expect to end the -- I'm not sure if you said it's four, I wasn't on in the first 10, 15 minutes, but where do you expect to end the year with backlog? I mean is book-to-bill still above one and/or can it be above one in the fourth quarter? Maybe just talk about kind of the regional expectations for orders in the fourth quarter?\nJudy Marks: Yes. So really strong orders year-to-date. I mean I love what we've been doing, and it's been -- it's really been kind of fulsome across Americas, EMEA and Asia. Obviously, China orders are down as the segment is down. We're not losing share there. We were flattish this year, Steve. But we've got 12% backlog right now on New Equipment orders, and we're doing mod orders or mod backlog is almost 7%. So that's strong as we've had in a really long time. Orders are -- they're going to be lumpy. We had a great mod orders quarter. This quarter we expect mod to continue to be strong now in the whole medium-term forecast, a medium-term guide. But they will -- there's times that New Equipment orders with major projects will get lumpy. But I would say kind of watch where we end the year, be it now at 12%, where we've gotten to on backlog conversion, we should be really strong going into '23. I'm feeling pretty good about line of sight for '23. We know the backlog on the New Equipment side. We'll know the backlog on mod. And our service portfolio is -- yes, so I would -- if you were going to calibrate backlog for fourth quarter -- as we exit fourth quarter, I think high single-digit. I think you could feel good doing that. But then on the Service side, repair is up, mod is up, and maintenance is up because our portfolio is up 3.8% last quarter. It was just under 3.5% the quarter before. We hope and plan for that to start with a 4% when we talk to you the next time. And that volume is driving -- is going to drive really good backlog in service.\nStephen Tusa: Right. So high single-digit constant currency year-over-year is what you're saying for the equipment backlog end of the year? Is that what you're saying?\nJudy Marks: Yes, yes. Correct.\nStephen Tusa: And one follow-up, just on the '23. Can you just maybe give us some color around anything that's more mechanical for '23 in the bridge, whether it's 4x snapping the line here, cost inflation? And any of that stuff that you'd highlight as part of the bridge for '23, just using the prevailing rates today?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Steve, Anurag here. You mean on the FX side, on the Forex side?\nStephen Tusa: Yes. Just anything else more mechanical, whether it's raws or anything like that, that on the '23 bridge that you have good visibility on today that you want to just get out there?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. So if we snap the line on foreign exchange today, we'll be -- of at the headwind of this year that we would see next year. So it will be around $75 million to $100 million, right? On the below-the-line stuff, we have a quarter of the Zardoya accretion, which will come through next year. We did very well on tax this year. It should come down a little bit more next year. So -- but nothing materially different over there, right? So that, I would say, is on the FX and year. And just on the '23 as going -- as what Judy said, we're going to end the year with a very good backlog, both on service as well as on New Equipment side on service more than maintenance growth. And where we are on pricing that we're seeing in the backlog today, that should kind of flow through next year as a tailwind, commodity as well. If you look at it, I mean we take commodity but it's a little bit different dynamics in the four regions. China, we started seeing it coming down. Americas as well, we've seen it stabilizing coming down. So those should be tailwinds as we go into next year. In the case of Asia-Pacific, ex-China, we buy from second-tier supplies majority that should also be a tailwind going to next year, maybe in the second half. It's Europe, right? But just given the -- what's happening with energy prices, the conflict over there, the prices are still kind of flattish, that may not be so much of a tailwind going into next year, right?\nJudy Marks: Yes. Steve, the only other thing I'd add is we are watching labor inflation. I think in our case, the great news is more than half of our field workforce is covered by collective bargaining. We shared that we do have a new agreement here with the International Union of Elevator Constructors, the multi-employer union in the U.S. that goes into effect in January. So we've got five years of predictability here. It was a fair agreement, and it looks very similar to the last five years. And with a little increase as it should as is appropriate. But we've got predictability. So now it comes back to us to be able to offset that with price and productivity. And we're watching labor in Europe. We've got some more negotiations coming up. But again, we will [Technical Difficulty] that. Our backlog, it takes that 12-plus months to work its way through in most countries. So we know what we need to do in terms of productivity and price to offset that. The last part of labor we're watching, just for you to know is or to be aware of are the subcontractors, mainly on the -- they're on the installation side outside the U.S. in several countries. And we've got to offset those increases with price and productivity. We know what we need to do.\nStephen Tusa: Great, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning and I appreciate you taking the question. Maybe just building off of Steve's question there, just looking more at it from a cash flow perspective. As you think about into next year, obviously, you're carrying higher working capital than normal. I'm curious what you might think normal is and if we actually revert to that next year? And then maybe just on the supplier timing payments that were called out in this quarter, do those all get made up in Q4? Or is that also a bridge item into '23 for the cash flow?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Hey, good morning, John, Anurag here. So just on cash flow, as you kind of think about going forward, we will grow cash pretty much with earnings, right, as to where -- and that should be the biggest driver of cash flow. Now to your second question. Yes, we -- if you look at this quarter, quarter three, we used about $150 million of cash, and it was around three different buckets. The first bucket was getting ready to execute, second was around receivables, and third was around a timing between cash and book taxes. So on the first part, we have -- our backlog is up 12%. We need to be in a position to deliver product and execute on time. So to do that, we built up some inventory, prepaid certain suppliers to lock in price as well as critical supply, right? On the second on receivables, the modernization grew a little bit more faster, which comes in with more back-end payment and also because of the delays in projects moving to the right, there was a few New Equipment collections. And on tax, we've done a very good job, as you saw in the second quarter on bringing the tax rate down. There's just some timing difference between cash and book taxes. So these three things should more or less unwind in the fourth quarter. So as we get into fourth quarter, so which is why we will get to the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion guide. So they should unwind. So as we look into next year, it should be mainly earnings, which should be driving the free cash flow growth.\nJudy Marks: Yes. John, as part of our customer focus, we understand we are in the critical path of every new construction job. That hoistway has to go in. And one of our differentiators in the market is general contractors know we will deliver on time. And to do that, we increased inventory. We locked in some suppliers just to make sure we would have that ability. I probably would have liked some better backlog conversion, if you ask me. But we'll get there and -- but we just needed to make sure we weren't going to let a job site or a customer fail on the New Equipment side.\nJohn Walsh: Great. That's a very helpful answer. And then if I could just circle back to modernization, just curious if there's a particular driver to call out if you're seeing -- I mean, you talked about deferred or deferrals earlier. But what about like taking an office and converting it into multi-tenant? Are you seeing that? Or customers, buildings trying to make sustainability commitments. We don't always think of the elevators as a big energy user. But are you hearing customers talk about that? Just any more color around why the customers are moving ahead with these modernizations would be helpful? Thank you.\nJudy Marks: Yes, so it's a variety of reasons. You've called out a few. The other one I would add would be is part of return to office. People are trying to make the offices more attractive as well, especially those that -- again, there are so many buildings where the elevators are over 20 years old. So now that really people have choices, they want to create a more engaging workplace. They want people to come in. We're seeing it really across the board. Some of its pent-up demand, some of it's delayed, some of it's just dramatic need. But the rest is by choice, and we think that's going to continue.\nJohn Walsh: That's great. Thanks for taking the questions.\nJudy Marks: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Joseph O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nJoseph O'Dea: Thank you. I'll give you the address of my building because the modernization wouldn't be bad there.\nJudy Marks: Happy to.\nJoseph O'Dea: I wanted to ask on the Americas, just project experience and delays. And just how that's been trending as it been an issue now for some time? Whether there are any indications of seeing some improvement there over the past, call it, six to nine months? And then as well, just what you're hearing from folks in terms of expectations moving forward and where we get some better project activity or just execution?\nJudy Marks: Yes, I think we're going to see it get better, Joe. I think it's absolutely correlated to employment in the rest of the trades. And as things change in the global -- in the economy in the U.S., we're starting to see it get better. But again, it's job by job, and it's local. Construction is local everywhere. So there's no national provider like someone like us in all the other trades that come together to build a building. We anticipate it improving, and we anticipate better backlog conversion from our Americas team, especially in North America. We're watching the same trends you are, but we expect that. And we haven't seen the indicators change yet. I mean the billing -- Architect's Billing Index is still over 50, and Dodge is still up. So will it be at the -- will the new starts be at the same amazing rate we've had probably for the last couple of years? Probably not at the same great rate, but it will be at a good rate. And we've got really good share there and team -- our team will deliver.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes and if I could just add to that. I mean, we see all these underlying secular drivers being very strong. And if you look at the sites, they are actually started gradually opening up. Our guidance for the full-year still remains what was as per the prior guide, which is flat on New Equipment for Americas, so sometime in Q3 and Q4. So we should see Q4 as kind of a turning point as we convert this backlog into revenue. So you should start seeing indicators starting in Q4 itself.\nJoseph O'Dea: That's helpful. And then I wanted to circle back on fourth quarter margins and specifically on Service and then corporate and other. Corporate and other was a little bit lighter than we expected in the third quarter. Just kind of what you're anticipating in the fourth quarter? And then coming off of a 23.9% service margin in the third quarter. How to think about kind of the bridge into the fourth quarter and some of the moving items there?\nJudy Marks: Yes, Joe, I hope you saw our sustained zealous approach to reducing G&A down 90 bps in this quarter. Anurag's come on board and he is looking, together, we are looking, but he is certainly taking a hard look at G&A structure, what do we need especially in corporate functions. So I'll turn it over to him to talk about fourth quarter, but know that everything that can be contained is being contained in terms of cost without risking investment for our future.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Thanks, Judy. Absolutely. I mean, cost is something we control. We will continue to take a look at it. On the Service margin side, if you look at quarter three, we grew 50 basis points. Year-to-date on service, we are growing at 50 basis points. There's really good performance in terms of pricing for sure, in terms of productivity, in terms of cost. So that's kind of what got us to a very good performance in Q3. We see similar performance in Q4 as well. We'll be at similar margins of 23.9%, 24%, 50 basis points more than last year, right? We will see some catch-up on the cost side because we did contain it very closely in the third quarter. There will be some part of it was permanent, part of it was temporary that we contained. There'll be some snapback in Q4, but we'll continue to look at that. And that should be a tailwind as we enter into the fourth quarter. But just on the Service side, I think the trend, if you look at revenue growth and margin expansion, it is pretty linear through the course of the year, and you expect to see the same in the fourth quarter.\nJoseph O'Dea: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nGautam Khanna: Hey good morning guys.\nJudy Marks: Good morning.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Hey good morning.\nGautam Khanna: Had a couple of questions, just to follow-up on some of the pricing comments. On the inflation clauses in Europe, North America, et cetera, where is the magnitude of the opportunity greatest by region in terms of repricing service? Is it Europe followed by North America? Just where do you -- can you speak to the magnitude by region?\nJudy Marks: I would place Europe as the highest followed by North America.\nGautam Khanna: And then when you roll it up, do you have a view on kind of price cost and service next year, what that could be? I mean it's positive, but is it -- can you frame the magnitude?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Hey Gautam, yes, it's -- listen, it's going to be positive. I mean our medium-term guidance, what we said is Service should be up 40 to 50 basis points, right? This year, we have 50 basis points. We've increased price managed, inflation managed, wage costs, as Judy earlier spoke about, be it in Americas and other places. As we go into next year, I think we feel good about being on track for the medium-term guidance in terms of expansion of margins. And we're expanding margins, but also modernization business growing at a faster clip, right, which is a headwind to the overall margin on the service business. So we'll give more specificity as we get into the January, February call for the guidance for next year, but continue to kind of see that margin expansion trajectory that we are on today.\nJudy Marks: Yes. It will be a service play, Gautam, next year. As we said in our medium-term guidance. And I think in year one, since we did the Investor Day just this past February, I think we've proven that.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you. And then last one on China pricing. Kind of what are your expectations as you move through the next couple of quarters given it looks like the market's long capacity. Do you get a sense of the magnitude of New Equipment pricing pressures next year? Thank you.\nJudy Marks: Yes, we think it looks like it looked this quarter, which will be relatively flat kind of neutral. That will certainly be what we do. We're not seeing irrational pricing, and we get to see it on the infrastructure, their public bids. And so we think it will be flat.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you guys.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. And Gautam, just to add, in the quarter, even the market being down, we are very happy with the way it is right now, price cost. And if that continues, it's going to be very positive for us.\nJudy Marks: Yes.\nGautam Khanna: Great. Thanks.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Joel Spungin with Berenberg. Your line is open.\nJoel Spungin: Yes, hi guys. I guess good morning for you all.\nJudy Marks: Yes, good afternoon Joel.\nJoel Spungin: Maybe I could just start by talking about the growth in the maintenance reported 3.8% was it in Q3. Is there any sort of color you can give us around the differences by region in terms of where you're seeing the growth in your maintenance units?\nJudy Marks: Yes. The largest growth we're seeing, and I think I mentioned this, it's our fifth consecutive quarter in China with mid-teens plus growth. So that's the largest followed by Asia Pacific, but all four regions are growing. But those two are the biggest hitters in terms of growth rates.\nJoel Spungin: Okay. But all regions are growing, that was the main thing.\nJudy Marks: Yes.\nJoel Spungin: Okay. Understood. And then maybe just changing that slightly on -- just going back on your comment earlier, Judy, about the field workforce, you mentioned that half of the field workforce is covered by collective bargaining. Just so I understand, is that across both Service and New Equipment? And then sort of related to that, is it sort of reasonable to think that the split of that labor force is broadly in line with your regional split?\nJudy Marks: Yes. So when you think about -- so yes, it's both -- it's our field workforce. So to me, field is -- there's -- we have 41,000 field professionals. Some are in New Equipment, the majority are in Service because we do use subcontractors to help us with installations in parts of the world. It's clearly collective bargaining works councils is clearly the way we do business in Europe. We have had a unionized workforce in the United States for a long time, think about Korea, Japan. So it's the field workforce. And in many locations, it's our factory workforces as well, as well as some of our professionals. It really depends on the country. And we have -- I think we have been operating under this for so many decades to us, it's the way we go-to-market and it's the way we lead our company, it's the way our colleagues show up for work every day. So it's very normal for us. We understand the headwinds when they happen and when we understand the opportunities when they happen, and we believe we give 68,000 colleagues a great place to work and a great career.\nJoel Spungin: That's great. Thanks. And maybe just one very quick follow-up. You mentioned, obviously, subcontracted costs being a factor. You're probably aware, obviously, that [indiscernible] were calling subcontracted costs out as a potential risk in 2023. Are you able to give us a bit more detail about how important subcontracting costs are on the installation side?\nJudy Marks: So again, we only use them in countries where it makes sense to us. We do have thousands of our own installers and all of our supervisors who are on the job sites are Otis colleagues. The majority of where we use them, as you can imagine, is China, Asia and Europe, and it gives us flexibility in terms of surge because New Equipment has more variability as we've seen over the past few years significantly than the service business. So it gives us the opportunity to manage and lead our workforce while being able to provide solutions. Anurag, anything you want to...\nAnurag Maheshwari: I think you said it, Judy. I mean these are the markets where we work with subcontractors. We work through this year as well. I mean they are also seeing inflation, but we work on installation productivity with them, right, how we can reduce the hours that it takes to install an elevator? We'll continue doing that, but they've been great partners for us in these regions and we'll continue to be so. So net-net, if you look at New Equipment for next year, both on the top-line as well as on the bottom line, it should do better than the medium-term guidance that we set up.\nJudy Marks: Yes, a non-extension of us, Joel. They really -- they take our -- they -- our ethics, our safety program, our methods, our tools, you won't know the difference. The challenge we have, which our teams are dealing very well with is ensuring we have a robust available workforce at a good price, and that includes these subcontractors.\nJoel Spungin: Got it. And are those costs booked within cost of goods? Is that as opposed to labor costs?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Sorry, what was the question?\nJudyMarks: Are they within the cost book, subcontractors?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. Yes, that is correct, yes.\nJoel Spungin: Great. Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the conference back over to Ms. Judy Marks for closing comments.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Norma, and thank you all for joining us today. This solid year-to-date performance, the advancement of our long-term strategy and continued growth in New Equipment backlog and maintenance portfolio units positions us well to deliver on our 2022 outlook and build on that in '23 and beyond. Thank you for joining us. Stay safe and well.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We hope everyone listening is safe and well. Starting with Q3 highlights on Slide 3. Otis delivered a solid third quarter and strong year-to-date results, especially considering the macro headwinds we're facing. We grew organic sales, expanded margins and achieved mid-single-digit adjusted EPS growth, all largely driven by strong performance of our resilient service business. By executing our strategy, we continue to set ourselves up for the future. This quarter, we demonstrated that performance through accelerating maintenance portfolio growth, which was up 3.8% in the quarter, growing modernization backlog 7% and gaining about one point of New Equipment share year-to-date, with share about flat in the quarter. Year-to-date, the New Equipment market was down mid-single digits, driven by China, which was down about 15%. In the Americas, we are honored to be selected for a modernization project at the iconic Space Needle in Seattle. Otis installed the original elevator in the early 1960s and has been maintaining the units ever since. We will now modernize the Landmarks 3 elevators, including introducing new technologies such as custom design cabs and Compass 360. In Suzhou, part of the Greater Shanghai Metropolitan area, the urban rail network is being expanded once again with the support of Otis. The new Line 8 will be served by nearly 140 Otis escalators and 38 Gen 3 and SkyRise elevators when it begins operations in late 2024. In London, Otis was selected to help modernize an office block into a modern mixed-use development that strives to be the first net zero carbon-enabled office development in London. Otis will provide vertical transportation solutions, including several escalators and elevators equipped with Compass 360 destination dispatching to allow tenants and visitors seamless and efficient access to the buildings floors. And lastly, in Korea, we're extending an over 30-year relationship with GS Engineering & Construction to provide more than 55 elevators to the [indiscernible] Apartment Complex. These units will be outfitted with ReGen Drive technology, helping to maximize energy efficiency for the elevator serving 1,500 apartments in the complex. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion was 106% of GAAP net income, and we kept our capital allocation plans on track with another $300 million of share repurchases in the quarter, completing the $700 million in repurchases we had planned for 2022. With a quarter to go, we feel confident in our cash flow outlook and are increasing our full-year share repurchase outlook to $850 million. And we continue to drive important ESG initiatives, a key priority for Otis. This quarter, our efforts resulted in achieving a gold rating with EcoVadis. Now moving to Slide 4, Q3 results and 2022 outlook. New Equipment orders were down 0.8% at constant currency in the third quarter. Excluding China, orders were up 7.4% with growth in all regions. On a rolling 12-month basis, total Otis orders were up 7.6%. Organic sales were up 0.8%, and adjusted operating profit was up $35 million at constant currency with 60 basis points of margin expansion driven by segment mix and strong performance in the Service business. In the quarter, we generated $215 million of free cash flow, which was down versus prior year, driven by an increase in inventory to support backlog conversion and the timing of supplier payments. This brings us to $1 billion year-to-date with 106% conversion of GAAP net income. Looking ahead to our 2022 outlook. We're revising our full-year outlook and now expect organic sales growth of 2% to 2.5%, with net sales in the range of $13.4 million to $13.5 billion. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be approximately $2.1 billion, up $120 million to $140 million, excluding the impacts from foreign exchange. After approximately $175 million in headwinds from foreign exchange translation, adjusted operating profit at actual currency is expected to be down $35 million to $55 million. Adjusted EPS is expected in the range of $3.11 to $3.15, up 5% to 7% versus the prior-year. Lastly, we still expect free cash flow to be robust between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion or approximately 125% conversion of GAAP net income. We will remain disciplined and balanced on our capital allocation, advancing our bolt-on M&A strategy where it makes sense and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases expected to be $850 million versus the $700 million target announced previously. With that, I'll turn it over to Anurag to walk through our Q3 results in more detail. Nigel, it's Judy. Good morning. So it is primarily the U.S. It's not rate driven. It really is availability of construction labor outside of the elevator part. We're feeling very confident in our ability to be at job sites at the right time. We recognize we're in the critical path, but it's all the other trades from getting the hoistway poured to really just directing the building. So that's really what we're seeing, and it's a delay, it's a slowdown, but it's not going to go away. The buildings are going to get built, but it's going to move some revenue into '23 even from the fourth quarter. So we're watching that carefully. There's really no unique vertical that, that's happening. The verticals are really still strong. And if you look at ABI is at 51 7, Dodge construction starts. The biggest growth we're seeing is in multifamily residential. And year-to-date, Dodge construction starts for multifamily residential is up 28%. So demand is still strong. Orders are strong, 24.3% year-to-date in the Americas, and we're just seeing a little bit of delay in terms of being able to deliver and record that revenue. Yes. Nigel, just one other thing. What I watch is that early trend as well. And we were up two points in the second quarter on New Equipment pricing and now four points this quarter. As a long cycle, it's going to take some time to get through the backlog, but it's going to come through. In terms of commodities flipping, really the only place we've seen that significantly already is China. And I would say Europe is a question mark there in terms of -- because of energy prices and everything else going on. But we would welcome commodities coming down as soon as possible, and you'll see that flow through. That again, during our long cycle, gives us the opportunity to drive material productivity, supply chain, everything in our backlog. Hey, Jeff. Sure. Let me start, and then, Anurag, feel free to jump in. So we now view full-year '22 China market growth estimates down 15%, roughly. Some of this is driven to the lockdown. Some of its driven by the property market confidence. And clearly, the market won't recover in '22. Q1 was down 5%. Q2, the segment was down 20%. Q3, we believe it was down 20% as well. And last quarter, we assumed COVID would be relieved. There'd be somewhat of a return to normal. And while this might not be as visible to everyone outside China, the COVID lockdowns are absolutely continuing, especially in Tier 3 and below cities. So those constraints are really constraining us from being able to do final shipments in terms of delivering them on the trucks and then installing them. Having said that, Jeff, I'm feeling good about the health of our business in China. When we talked about New Equipment pricing just a second ago, we're net price cost neutral to favorable in China this quarter, which is just a testament to the resiliency and the tenacity of Harry and our China team to be able to do that. The market segment was down about 20%. We were down pretty close to that in orders. So we didn't -- there was not a share gain there for us this quarter, although we've had them in the first two quarters. Our strategy and our initiatives are on track in New Equipment. We've gained share year-to-date. The only segment that was up in China in the third quarter was infrastructure. All of the others were down. All of the tier cities were down as well, but they were down -- Tier 1 was down the least, Tier 2 next and then it degraded from there in terms of larger down in terms of segment. While all this was happening, our teams still delivered. Modernization grew and service grew again. It was our fifth consecutive quarter where we had mid-teens or above portfolio growth where recaptures outpaced cancellations. And so they were all really good positive contributors. As I look into '23 without -- we're not going to give a guide right now. But as we look at it, especially in China, the segment, if you go back to our first Investor Day in February of 2020, we shared we thought the China segment would be about 550,000 units a year and be flattish. That's where it was in early '20 pre-COVID. It spiked and got up to 650,000 last year. If you assume the segment is down 15%, it gets you to a 540,000 kind of number. Our early assessment for '23 is the segment is going to be between 500,000 and 525,000. And again, the pricing we've seen is rational, and we're driving costs down, commodities are down and material productivity is doing a great job. So on the New Equipment side, I actually think we're in a good position. We've got some limited backlog in China, fourth quarter will drive that as well as we go into the rest of the year. But the rest of the -- total company-wise, we're up 12% on New Equipment orders. Everybody is growing in mod as well. And I will remind everyone that there are 8 million units at the end of this year in Service in China. So that's going to be the key growth lever. We're still going to be gaining share in New Equipment, executing our strategy, but our service growth and portfolio growth will continue. Anurag? Jeff, the challenge is this would be the third or fourth year of discretionary. So all of a sudden, there's modernization projects, especially the ones that are technology insertion versus just aesthetics have really started coming to the forefront. 7 million of the units in the world are over 20 years old. So it's a huge mod market, and the team really delivered 18% up in orders, year-to-date up 6.5%. We got a 7% backlog. So I actually think we're seeing the pent-up demand. And again, for those who don't modernize, and the elevators will tend to break down, especially 20 years old, more frequently, which drives our repair business. And between that and just people returning to office, hotels, our repair business is up really nicely. Yes, let me start with that one. So Service pricing in general, just for -- we know, like-for-like pricing increased three points. In the third quarter it was very solid and really was strongest in the developed mature markets globally where the majority of our portfolio resides. So that hits right to the heart of your question, Julian, in terms of really how is Europe doing on service pricing. The majority of renewals are pretty much up. When you think about how the year rolls out, our largest renewals happened in the first quarter and then over time. So we should finish the year with that like-for-like pricing, especially in Europe. We do have inflationary clauses. Most of them tied to labor, especially in Europe and North America. So we have the ability to raise prices again when the new year starts. And what encourages me is that it will be indexed based on '21 -- '22 inflation this year when we start '23. So the inflation indices will be even higher. And now it's up to us to go get that because it's in our contracts and our sales teams are trained to do that. So we've been offsetting the labor inflation is the labor inflation, as you can see, even in Europe based on the margin expansion we've had. On the general macroeconomics in Europe, so far, I got to tell you, especially on the New Equipment side, it looks good in '22. Orders are up this quarter 11%, 10.3% for the 12-month roll. We're watching the headwinds, but building permits are still holding. So we haven't seen that change. And so our goal, again, is to gain share and build backlog, and that's exactly what Bernardo and our EMEA team have been doing. On your last part about comparing to 13 or 14 years ago, it's a very different time now. Back then, we were 10 points differentiation between ourselves and our closest OEM maintenance service providers in terms of margins. And that was what was driving the Otis machine at the time. Right now, we're much closer, very close, pricing is rational. There's not an oversupply of labor like we experienced after the '08 financial crisis and all those New Equipment installers became ISPs, and there wasn't a technology like Otis ONE that gives us that advanced stickiness that customers are really believing in now and seeing and it's giving us productivity. So it's a different world, and I think our performance over the last 10 or 11 quarters shows that. Good morning. Yes. So really strong orders year-to-date. I mean I love what we've been doing, and it's been -- it's really been kind of fulsome across Americas, EMEA and Asia. Obviously, China orders are down as the segment is down. We're not losing share there. We were flattish this year, Steve. But we've got 12% backlog right now on New Equipment orders, and we're doing mod orders or mod backlog is almost 7%. So that's strong as we've had in a really long time. Orders are -- they're going to be lumpy. We had a great mod orders quarter. This quarter we expect mod to continue to be strong now in the whole medium-term forecast, a medium-term guide. But they will -- there's times that New Equipment orders with major projects will get lumpy. But I would say kind of watch where we end the year, be it now at 12%, where we've gotten to on backlog conversion, we should be really strong going into '23. I'm feeling pretty good about line of sight for '23. We know the backlog on the New Equipment side. We'll know the backlog on mod. And our service portfolio is -- yes, so I would -- if you were going to calibrate backlog for fourth quarter -- as we exit fourth quarter, I think high single-digit. I think you could feel good doing that. But then on the Service side, repair is up, mod is up, and maintenance is up because our portfolio is up 3.8% last quarter. It was just under 3.5% the quarter before. We hope and plan for that to start with a 4% when we talk to you the next time. And that volume is driving -- is going to drive really good backlog in service. Yes, yes. Correct. Yes. Steve, the only other thing I'd add is we are watching labor inflation. I think in our case, the great news is more than half of our field workforce is covered by collective bargaining. We shared that we do have a new agreement here with the International Union of Elevator Constructors, the multi-employer union in the U.S. that goes into effect in January. So we've got five years of predictability here. It was a fair agreement, and it looks very similar to the last five years. And with a little increase as it should as is appropriate. But we've got predictability. So now it comes back to us to be able to offset that with price and productivity. And we're watching labor in Europe. We've got some more negotiations coming up. But again, we will [Technical Difficulty] that. Our backlog, it takes that 12-plus months to work its way through in most countries. So we know what we need to do in terms of productivity and price to offset that. The last part of labor we're watching, just for you to know is or to be aware of are the subcontractors, mainly on the -- they're on the installation side outside the U.S. in several countries. And we've got to offset those increases with price and productivity. We know what we need to do. Yes. John, as part of our customer focus, we understand we are in the critical path of every new construction job. That hoistway has to go in. And one of our differentiators in the market is general contractors know we will deliver on time. And to do that, we increased inventory. We locked in some suppliers just to make sure we would have that ability. I probably would have liked some better backlog conversion, if you ask me. But we'll get there and -- but we just needed to make sure we weren't going to let a job site or a customer fail on the New Equipment side. Yes, so it's a variety of reasons. You've called out a few. The other one I would add would be is part of return to office. People are trying to make the offices more attractive as well, especially those that -- again, there are so many buildings where the elevators are over 20 years old. So now that really people have choices, they want to create a more engaging workplace. They want people to come in. We're seeing it really across the board. Some of its pent-up demand, some of it's delayed, some of it's just dramatic need. But the rest is by choice, and we think that's going to continue. Thanks, John. Happy to. Yes, I think we're going to see it get better, Joe. I think it's absolutely correlated to employment in the rest of the trades. And as things change in the global -- in the economy in the U.S., we're starting to see it get better. But again, it's job by job, and it's local. Construction is local everywhere. So there's no national provider like someone like us in all the other trades that come together to build a building. We anticipate it improving, and we anticipate better backlog conversion from our Americas team, especially in North America. We're watching the same trends you are, but we expect that. And we haven't seen the indicators change yet. I mean the billing -- Architect's Billing Index is still over 50, and Dodge is still up. So will it be at the -- will the new starts be at the same amazing rate we've had probably for the last couple of years? Probably not at the same great rate, but it will be at a good rate. And we've got really good share there and team -- our team will deliver. Yes, Joe, I hope you saw our sustained zealous approach to reducing G&A down 90 bps in this quarter. Anurag's come on board and he is looking, together, we are looking, but he is certainly taking a hard look at G&A structure, what do we need especially in corporate functions. So I'll turn it over to him to talk about fourth quarter, but know that everything that can be contained is being contained in terms of cost without risking investment for our future. Good morning. I would place Europe as the highest followed by North America. Yes. It will be a service play, Gautam, next year. As we said in our medium-term guidance. And I think in year one, since we did the Investor Day just this past February, I think we've proven that. Yes, we think it looks like it looked this quarter, which will be relatively flat kind of neutral. That will certainly be what we do. We're not seeing irrational pricing, and we get to see it on the infrastructure, their public bids. And so we think it will be flat. Yes. Yes, good afternoon Joel. Yes. The largest growth we're seeing, and I think I mentioned this, it's our fifth consecutive quarter in China with mid-teens plus growth. So that's the largest followed by Asia Pacific, but all four regions are growing. But those two are the biggest hitters in terms of growth rates. Yes. Yes. So when you think about -- so yes, it's both -- it's our field workforce. So to me, field is -- there's -- we have 41,000 field professionals. Some are in New Equipment, the majority are in Service because we do use subcontractors to help us with installations in parts of the world. It's clearly collective bargaining works councils is clearly the way we do business in Europe. We have had a unionized workforce in the United States for a long time, think about Korea, Japan. So it's the field workforce. And in many locations, it's our factory workforces as well, as well as some of our professionals. It really depends on the country. And we have -- I think we have been operating under this for so many decades to us, it's the way we go-to-market and it's the way we lead our company, it's the way our colleagues show up for work every day. So it's very normal for us. We understand the headwinds when they happen and when we understand the opportunities when they happen, and we believe we give 68,000 colleagues a great place to work and a great career. So again, we only use them in countries where it makes sense to us. We do have thousands of our own installers and all of our supervisors who are on the job sites are Otis colleagues. The majority of where we use them, as you can imagine, is China, Asia and Europe, and it gives us flexibility in terms of surge because New Equipment has more variability as we've seen over the past few years significantly than the service business. So it gives us the opportunity to manage and lead our workforce while being able to provide solutions. Anurag, anything you want to... Yes, a non-extension of us, Joel. They really -- they take our -- they -- our ethics, our safety program, our methods, our tools, you won't know the difference. The challenge we have, which our teams are dealing very well with is ensuring we have a robust available workforce at a good price, and that includes these subcontractors. Are they within the cost book, subcontractors? Thank you, Norma, and thank you all for joining us today. This solid year-to-date performance, the advancement of our long-term strategy and continued growth in New Equipment backlog and maintenance portfolio units positions us well to deliver on our 2022 outlook and build on that in '23 and beyond. Thank you for joining us. Stay safe and well."

            "content": "Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with third quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales of $3.3 billion were down 7.6%, driven by the broad strengthening of the U.S. dollar, a 7.2% headwind in the quarter. Organically, sales were up 80 basis points, the eighth consecutive quarter of growth driven by service, which increased over 6%. Adjusted operating profit, excluding a $50 million foreign exchange translation headwind, was up $35 million. Drop-through on higher service volume, favorable service pricing, strong SG&A cost control and the benefit from productivity in both segments was partially offset by impact of lower New Equipment volume, commodity price increases and annual wage inflation. Adjusted SG&A expense was down 90 basis points as a percentage of sales as we continue to drive cost reduction and containment to help mitigate the inflationary headwinds. Despite the challenging environment, we maintained investment in the business and R&D spend and other strategic investments were about flat versus the prior-year. Overall, adjusted operating profit margin expanded 60 basis points, driven by segment mix, strong Service performance and cost containment. Adjusted EPS was up 5% or $0.04. An $0.08 headwind from foreign exchange translation was more than offset by strong operational performance, driven by the Service segment, accretion from the Zardoya transaction and a benefit of $700 million in share repurchases completed year-to-date. Moving to Slide 6. Q3 New Equipment orders were down slightly at constant currency and up 7.4%, excluding China. Orders in the Americas were up 3% with solid growth and multi-family residential and infrastructure. EMEA orders were up 11% with growth in both Europe and the Middle East, and orders in Asia outside of China were up approximately 10% driven by strong growth in South Korea and India. The strong orders growth over the last 12 months contributed to New Equipment backlog increasing 12% at constant currency with growth in all regions, including China, which was up slightly. Backlog in Americas, EMEA and Asia outside of China was up high-teens. Pricing trends improved year-over-year in all regions, excluding China, where pricing was flat. Globally, pricing on New Equipment orders continues to accelerate and was up 4% leading to sequential backlog margin improvement. New Equipment organic sales were down 5% in the quarter, as mid single-digit growth in EMEA and low-teens growth in Asia, excluding China was more than offset by 4% decline in the Americas due to a tough compare and delays in building construction and a high-teens decline in China driven by the challenging market conditions. Sales decline of $191 million and adjusted operating profit declined $23 million, largely from the impact of lower volume and related under absorption. Commodity inflation of $18 million that was aligned with price expectations was more than offset by productivity and lower SG&A expense. Service segment results on Slide 7. Maintenance portfolio units were up 3.8% with recaptured units more than offsetting cancellations in the quarter. Conversion rate continues to show improvement this year in China, which contributed to mid-teens portfolio growth in the region. Modernization orders growth accelerated to 18% in the quarter with growth in all regions driven by good traction or newer mod package offerings and several major project wings. Backlog was up 7% at constant currency. Service organic sales grew for the seventh consecutive quarter up 6.2% the growth in all lines of business. Maintenance and repair grew 5.4% from the benefit of high single-digit repair volume and growth in contractual maintenance sales that outpaced our unit growth due to improved pricing, which was up three points on a like-for-like basis. Modernization sales continued the recovery that started in Q4 of '21 and were up 10% in the quarter the growth in every region. Service profit at constant FX was up $49 million driven by the drop through on higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity, which more than offset the headwinds from annual wage increases. As a result of this, margins were up 50 basis points, the 11th consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Overall, despite the significant macro headwinds, our year-to-date results are strong. We gain approximately one point of New Equipment share delivered the best portfolio growth in over a decade and more than mitigated $195 million of headwinds from FX and commodity inflation through strong execution to achieve an 8.5% EPS growth. Moving to Slide 8 and the revised outlook. These changes reflect revised expectations in the China market outlook, the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar and our focus on productivity initiatives to offset the headwinds. Starting with sales, we are expecting organic sales to be up 2% to 2.5% versus 2.5% to 3.5% previously. This 75 basis point reduction is driven by lower expectations for China New Equipment partially offset by an improved modernization outlook in service. The New Equipment margin outlook is down 10 basis points at the midpoint from the impact of lower volume in China offset by cost containment. Service margins are now expected to be up approximately 50 basis points, a 10 basis point reduction from the prior outlook reflecting the mix impact of modernization sales growing faster than the maintenance and repair business. The overall margin outlook remains unchanged versus the prior outlook, and is expected to be up approximately 30 basis points to 15.7%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.11 to $3.15 up 5% to 7% versus the prior year. This adjusted EPS growth is driven by strong operational execution, accretion from the Zardoya transaction, progress on reducing our tax rate and a lower share count that more than offset $0.47 of headwind from foreign exchange translation and commodity inflation. We now expect free cash flow to be in a range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion versus approximately $1.6 billion previously. Foreign exchange translation continues to weigh on cash flow generation, and we anticipate a moderate build in inventory heading into 2023 to support project execution on the growing backlog. On capital deployment, we are increasing the share repurchase target to $850 million, having already completed our previous outlook of $700 million in the first three quarters. This is an over 2x increase from the $300 million to $500 million guidance we had given in the beginning of the year, and combined with a 20% dividend increase, underscores our commitment to return cash to shareholders. Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9. The New Equipment business is projected to be down approximately 2.5% versus down 0.5% to 1% previously. We now expect Asia to be down approximately 6% from down low single-digits previously driven by China. Despite our backlog being up slightly versus prior year and up from the end of '21, we now expect Otis China organic sales to be down 10%, driven by the shift of project execution to the right and lower market expectations now expected to be down roughly 15%. This has been partially offset by improved outlook in Asia Pacific from the benefit of strong orders growth momentum in India and South Korea. The New Equipment outlook in the Americas and EMEA is unchanged, expected to be flat and up low to mid single-digits, respectively. Turning to Service. We now expect organic sales to be up 6% to 6.5%, an improvement of 50 basis points at the low end, driven by a conversion of modernization backlog that is up 7%. Moving to Slide 10. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 5% to 7%, an $0.18 increase at the midpoint. We expect to more than offset the $110 million headwind from commodities with $230 million to $250 million of operational improvement from higher service volume and pricing, productivity in both segments and other cost containment actions, resulting in profit growth of $120 million to $140 million at constant currency. This is $5 million lower than our prior outlook at the midpoint, driven by reduced China New Equipment volume expectations that we are partially mitigating through better cost containment and productivity. Accretion from the Zardoya transaction, over two points of tax rate reduction versus last year and the benefit from over $1.5 billion of share repurchases since spin, partially offsets the $0.29 or $175 million headwind from the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We have now assumed the euro at $0.97 for the fourth quarter or $1.04 for the full-year. Overall, since 2019, this outlook represents 50 basis points of annual margin expansion and low teens three-year adjusted EPS CAGR, reflecting the execution of our long-term strategy and our ability to mitigate the macro challenges we have faced. We feel confident that this momentum, along with our growing backlog and service portfolio sets us up well to deliver strong financial performance in 2023 and beyond. And with that, I will request Norma to please open the line for questions. Thanks for the question. So yes, the price increase, firstly, it's coming through on the backlog margins, as I mentioned, right? So this quarter, we did see the backlog margins kind of flattish sequentially relative to -- sorry, VPY, it was kind of flattish. Now I'm talking about flowing it through. If you look at the third quarter on the New Equipment side, the flow-through to the bottom line, it was essentially volume. So we have about $100 million VPY in terms of decline in terms of revenue and $20 million of that should flow through to the bottom line. And that is what the VPY is on the New Equipment side. So we're kind of hitting the price cost neutrality in the quarter itself, right? So -- and as backlog margins improve from now to the end of the year, we should see that expansion coming into 2023 as well. Yes. Thanks, Judy. I mean, overall, we feel very good about the market over there. In terms of the backlog, today, Jeff, right, so as Judy said in the prepared comments, we're up 12% on the backlog. And China is slightly up as well relative to last year. So we have a good line of sight over the next few quarters, not only in China and the other regions for the backlog. As you are aware, two-thirds of our revenue for next year will come from the ending backlog. So given where we are today and the pipeline that we have seen on the new order side, good line of sight to convert that into shipment next year. Thanks, Julian. This is Anurag here. Let me answer the second question first. On the channel, the rate of decline is actually reducing in the fourth quarter. You're right, it was double-digit in the third quarter, but we see it to be low single-digit in the fourth quarter, right? Now going back to -- on the fourth quarter, where you see the margin is essentially on the New Equipment side of the business, right? If you go back to the past few years, seasonally, Q4 has been a lower margin for us. We've been around the 5% so margin level. And that is the big difference between the year-to-date run rate on New Equipment margin versus the fourth quarter. And when we gave guidance in July, at that point in time, that was calibrated. We said that the guidance margin for the second half of the year for New Equipment would be closer to 6.2%. I mean, clearly -- and that was assuming that China would kind of return back to more normal times. But as you can see in our guide, the revenue is down by about $100 million, largely because of China, and that flows through at 20% -- $20 million. So if that has flown through to the bottom line, it would have been a 50 basis points margin degradation from 6.2% to 5.7%. But through productivity to other cost containment, we were able to mitigate it and get it back to 6%. And clearly, a lot of it was overdriven in the third quarter, both in terms of closeout, in terms of productivity, in terms of cost containment. As we go into the fourth quarter, in terms of volume, in terms of our commodities, that is pretty much constant run rate where we see a little bit is on the regional mix, and that kind of makes the margin go down. Having said that, we'll continue to work on the SG&A side of productivity, and it was a little bit more upside on New Equipment. We'll kind of drive that through. So that is the big one. And lastly is just FX, right? We had a $50 million FX headwind in the third quarter. That steps up to about $67 million, $68 million that $17 million, $18 million. So it's between New Equipment and FX, which is kind of causing the Q4 versus Q3 margins. Steve, Anurag here. You mean on the FX side, on the Forex side? Yes. So if we snap the line on foreign exchange today, we'll be -- of at the headwind of this year that we would see next year. So it will be around $75 million to $100 million, right? On the below-the-line stuff, we have a quarter of the Zardoya accretion, which will come through next year. We did very well on tax this year. It should come down a little bit more next year. So -- but nothing materially different over there, right? So that, I would say, is on the FX and year. And just on the '23 as going -- as what Judy said, we're going to end the year with a very good backlog, both on service as well as on New Equipment side on service more than maintenance growth. And where we are on pricing that we're seeing in the backlog today, that should kind of flow through next year as a tailwind, commodity as well. If you look at it, I mean we take commodity but it's a little bit different dynamics in the four regions. China, we started seeing it coming down. Americas as well, we've seen it stabilizing coming down. So those should be tailwinds as we go into next year. In the case of Asia-Pacific, ex-China, we buy from second-tier supplies majority that should also be a tailwind going to next year, maybe in the second half. It's Europe, right? But just given the -- what's happening with energy prices, the conflict over there, the prices are still kind of flattish, that may not be so much of a tailwind going into next year, right? Hey, good morning, John, Anurag here. So just on cash flow, as you kind of think about going forward, we will grow cash pretty much with earnings, right, as to where -- and that should be the biggest driver of cash flow. Now to your second question. Yes, we -- if you look at this quarter, quarter three, we used about $150 million of cash, and it was around three different buckets. The first bucket was getting ready to execute, second was around receivables, and third was around a timing between cash and book taxes. So on the first part, we have -- our backlog is up 12%. We need to be in a position to deliver product and execute on time. So to do that, we built up some inventory, prepaid certain suppliers to lock in price as well as critical supply, right? On the second on receivables, the modernization grew a little bit more faster, which comes in with more back-end payment and also because of the delays in projects moving to the right, there was a few New Equipment collections. And on tax, we've done a very good job, as you saw in the second quarter on bringing the tax rate down. There's just some timing difference between cash and book taxes. So these three things should more or less unwind in the fourth quarter. So as we get into fourth quarter, so which is why we will get to the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion guide. So they should unwind. So as we look into next year, it should be mainly earnings, which should be driving the free cash flow growth. Yes and if I could just add to that. I mean, we see all these underlying secular drivers being very strong. And if you look at the sites, they are actually started gradually opening up. Our guidance for the full-year still remains what was as per the prior guide, which is flat on New Equipment for Americas, so sometime in Q3 and Q4. So we should see Q4 as kind of a turning point as we convert this backlog into revenue. So you should start seeing indicators starting in Q4 itself. Thanks, Judy. Absolutely. I mean, cost is something we control. We will continue to take a look at it. On the Service margin side, if you look at quarter three, we grew 50 basis points. Year-to-date on service, we are growing at 50 basis points. There's really good performance in terms of pricing for sure, in terms of productivity, in terms of cost. So that's kind of what got us to a very good performance in Q3. We see similar performance in Q4 as well. We'll be at similar margins of 23.9%, 24%, 50 basis points more than last year, right? We will see some catch-up on the cost side because we did contain it very closely in the third quarter. There will be some part of it was permanent, part of it was temporary that we contained. There'll be some snapback in Q4, but we'll continue to look at that. And that should be a tailwind as we enter into the fourth quarter. But just on the Service side, I think the trend, if you look at revenue growth and margin expansion, it is pretty linear through the course of the year, and you expect to see the same in the fourth quarter. Hey good morning. Hey Gautam, yes, it's -- listen, it's going to be positive. I mean our medium-term guidance, what we said is Service should be up 40 to 50 basis points, right? This year, we have 50 basis points. We've increased price managed, inflation managed, wage costs, as Judy earlier spoke about, be it in Americas and other places. As we go into next year, I think we feel good about being on track for the medium-term guidance in terms of expansion of margins. And we're expanding margins, but also modernization business growing at a faster clip, right, which is a headwind to the overall margin on the service business. So we'll give more specificity as we get into the January, February call for the guidance for next year, but continue to kind of see that margin expansion trajectory that we are on today. Yes. And Gautam, just to add, in the quarter, even the market being down, we are very happy with the way it is right now, price cost. And if that continues, it's going to be very positive for us. Thanks. I think you said it, Judy. I mean these are the markets where we work with subcontractors. We work through this year as well. I mean they are also seeing inflation, but we work on installation productivity with them, right, how we can reduce the hours that it takes to install an elevator? We'll continue doing that, but they've been great partners for us in these regions and we'll continue to be so. So net-net, if you look at New Equipment for next year, both on the top-line as well as on the bottom line, it should do better than the medium-term guidance that we set up. Sorry, what was the question? Yes. Yes, that is correct, yes."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Michael Rednor, Senior Vice Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rednor: Thank you, Michelle. Welcome to Otis' Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Judy Marks; Rahul Ghai; and Anurag Maheshwari. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and significant nonrecurring items. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis' second SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy.\nJudith Marks: Thank you, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We hope everyone listening is safe and well. I'd like to welcome Anurag Maheshwari in joining us this morning. Anurag is an experienced executive that many of you have worked with in his prior role leading Investor Relations at Harris. More recently, he's been leading our finance team as CFO in the Asia Pacific region since then. I look forward to my partnership with Anurag in driving growth, operational execution and value for our customers, colleagues and shareholders.  I want to also take this opportunity to thank Rahul for his leadership and all of his contributions in transitioning Otis to an independent company and in championing our long-term strategy. We wish him well in his future endeavors. Before I get into the results and outlook, on our Q1 call, we noted our growing concerns about the long-term sustainability of our operations in Russia. At that time, we removed Otis' Russian operations from our 2022 outlook and prior year compares. Amidst mounting regulations, we concluded that the best solution for our customers, colleagues and shareholders was to divest this business, and we recently entered into an agreement to do so. Closing of the transaction is expected imminently. We remain hopeful for a return to peace and stability in the region, and we will continue to contribute to the ongoing relief and humanitarian efforts in Ukraine. This quarter and going forward, Otis' Russia operations and related nonrecurring charges are excluded from our adjusted results, prior year compares and our outlook. Moving to Q2 highlights on Slide 3. We Otis delivered a solid second quarter, closing out a strong first half, especially considering the macro headwinds that we faced. We grew organic sales, expanded margins and achieved 12% adjusted EPS growth. We had record new equipment bookings and continue to build our maintenance portfolio that was up nearly 3.5% in the quarter. Our Service business continued to deliver this quarter where we grew sales in all lines of business and expanded margins due to favorable pricing and productivity. We generated $326 million in free cash flow while continuing to return cash to shareholders, completing another $200 million in share repurchases on top of the $200 million completed in Q1. In addition, as expected, Zardoya Otis was delisted in early May. We gained approximately 1 point of new equipment share in the second quarter, driven by high teens new equipment orders growth for Otis in a market that was down mid-single digits globally. New equipment orders in the Americas were particularly strong, up 57%, despite facing a difficult compare in the prior year. In Los Angeles, we're supporting the modernization of Terminal 4 at LAX. Otis was selected to provide 13 Gen 3 elevators, further extending the long-term relationship with the general contractor Hensel Phelps and marking our latest project at LAX. In Paris, Otis was selected to support the construction of the Tour Triangle, a 180-meter high tower that will include office, hospitality and retail spaces. During the construction phase and Otis SkyBuild self-climbing elevator will ascend as the floors are built, providing speed and simplified logistics to the building's construction teams. The building is designed to meet several environmental standards that Otis will help support by providing space-saving digitally native solutions like our Gen360 platform, SkyRise double-deck elevators and Compass 360 destination dispatching. In South China's Greater Bay Area, Otis is supporting several projects to fuel smart city development. In Guangzhou's Canton Fair Complex, we will provide more than 140 SkyRise and Gen 3 elevators as well as escalators for Phase 4 of the Canton Fair complex, including IoT systems that will monitor performance in real time. In Shenzhen, the new China Life Insurance Tower in the Central Business District will be served by 20 Otis SkyRise elevators. And in Zhuhai, Otis will provide nearly 90 elevators and escalators for the Ngong Ping Royal Times Square. This project will include Gen 3 elevators equipped with Otis' latest ambience features and digital technologies, serving passengers headed to offices, shopping centers and hotels. And lastly, in Korea, Otis was selected to provide more than 45 elevators and escalators in the Teachers' Pension tower, a landmark the financial district of soul. This project will include our Compass360 destination dispatching system to seamlessly move tenants between nearly 50 floors. Moving to Slide 4, Q2 results and 2022 outlook. New equipment orders were up 16.5% at constant currency in the second quarter and up 8.5% on a rolling 12-month basis. Organic sales were up 0.4% and adjusted operating profit margin expanded 20 basis points and was up $16 million at constant currency, driven by strong performance in the service business. Free cash flow conversion was robust at 102% of GAAP net income. Looking ahead to our 2022 outlook, we're revising our full year outlook and now expect organic sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, with net sales in the range of $13.6 million to $13.8 billion. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be in a range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion, up $120 million to $150 million, excluding the impacts from foreign exchange. After approximately $145 million in headwinds from foreign exchange translation, adjusted operating profit at actual currency is expected to be up $5 million to down $25 million. Adjusted EPS is expected in a range of $3.17 to $3.21, up 7% to 9% versus the prior year. Lastly, we still expect free cash flow to be robust at about $1.6 billion or approximately 125% conversion of GAAP net income. We will remain disciplined and balanced on capital allocation, advancing our bolt-on M&A strategy where it makes sense and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which we're now in a position to increase to $700 million versus the $500 million target announced previously.  With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our Q2 results in more detail.\nRahul Ghai: Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with second quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales of $3.5 billion were down 5.8%, primarily due to broad strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Organic sales were up 40 basis points, the seventh consecutive quarter of growth, driven by Service, which increased over 5%. Adjusted operating profit was down $21 million, excluding the impact of translational foreign exchange, adjusted operating profit was up $16 million at constant currency, drop-through on higher service volume, favorable service pricing and benefit from productivity in both segments was partially offset by the impact of commodity price increases and annual wage inflation.  We also continued our unrelenting focus on cost containment. And adjusted SG&A expense was down over $50 million or 90 basis points as a percentage of sales, even with inflationary trends in the economy. Despite the challenging environment, we maintained the investment in the business and R&D spend and other strategic investments were flat versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS was up 12% or $0.09. A $0.06 headwind from foreign exchange translation was more than offset by strong operational performance, accretion from the Zardoya transaction, continued progress on reducing the tax rate and the benefit of $400 million in share repurchases completed year-to-date. Moving to Slide 6. New equipment orders in the second quarter were up 16.5% at constant currency. Orders in the Americas were up over 50%, with growth in all verticals on top of nearly 50% growth in Q2 of 2021. Awards, which preceded orders in North America stayed strong and were up 5 points on a sequential basis. EMEA orders were up 29% and growth in both Europe and the Middle East, and orders in Asia outside of China were up double digits. Driven by strong growth in South Korea and India, where bookings were more than double last year's volume. Orders in China were down low teens outperforming the market that we estimate was down about 20%. Strong orders growth contributed to new equipment backlog increasing 6% and 10% at constant currency. Backlog in China was about flat, and backlog in Americas, EMEA and Asia, outside of China, was up approximately 15%. Globally, pricing on new equipment orders was up low single digits after 5 straight quarters of year-over-year decline. Pricing trends improved year-over-year in all regions. Excluding China, where pricing was down low single digits versus the prior year. New Equipment organic sales were down 5% in the quarter, as low single-digit growth in EMEA and high single-digit growth in Asia, excluding China, was more than offset by mid-single-digit decline in the Americas due to a tough compare from the prior year and slowdown in building construction, and a low teens decline in China from COVID-related lockdowns.  Adjusted operating profit was down $28 million at constant currency, largely from the impact of lower volume and related under absorption. Commodity inflation of $35 million that was in line with prior expectations was mostly mitigated by installation and material productivity and lower SG&A expense.  Service segment results on Slide 7. Maintenance portfolio units were up nearly 3.5% from improvements in retention, recapture and conversion rates with recaptured units more than offsetting cancellations in the quarter. In China, conversion rates continued to improve year-over-year and contributed to the fourth consecutive quarter of high teens portfolio growth. Modernization orders growth accelerated to 9% in the quarter. With growth in all regions, driving backlog growth of 4%.  Service organic sales grew for the sixth consecutive quarter, up 5.2%, with growth in all lines of business. Maintenance and repair grew 4.9% as the benefit of strong repair volume and growth in contractual maintenance sales that outpaced our unit growth due to improved pricing, which was up about 3% on a like-for-like basis. Modernization sales continued the recovery that started in Q4 of 2021 and were up 6.4% in the quarter with growth in every region. Service profit at constant FX was up $39 million. Benefit from higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity was partially offset by annual wage increases. Margins were up 50 basis points, the tenth consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Overall, the first half results reflect solid operational execution with a point of new equipment share gain, the best portfolio growth in a decade and close to $125 million of cost reduction between productivity and SG&A. These actions helped us manage through the continuing macroeconomic challenges and achieved low single-digit organic sales growth, $50 million of earnings growth at constant FX and 15.8% adjusted margins, a 30 basis point improvement over the first half of 2021. Margins for the first half are up 140 basis points from pre-COVID levels of comparable period in 2019. First half free cash flow generation of $800 million, 50% of our guide for the year enabled us to repay $500 million of debt, raise dividends by 20% and complete $400 million in share repurchases. With that, let me turn it over to Anurag to walk through the revised 2022 outlook.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Thanks, Rahul and Judy, for the kind introduction, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here and look forward to continuing the great work Rahul has done in advancing our long-term strategy, driving operational execution and creating value for our shareholders. Thank you, Rahul. Let me start on Slide 8 with a recalibrated outlook, that incorporates the evolving macroeconomic headwinds, combined with our continued focus on things we can control, accelerating service growth, driving productivity, optimizing the tax rate and reducing our share count. Starting with sales. We are expecting organic sales to be up 2.5% to 3.5%, which is 0.5 point lower than the previous guidance, driven by a reduction in the New Equipment segment partially offset by better expectations for Service. Though new equipment sales are lower, margins remain unchanged, expected to be down 20 to 60 basis points versus the prior year. with the impact of lower volume, offset by improved productivity. Service margins are now expected to be up approximately 60 basis points, a 10 basis point decrease from the prior outlook reflecting the mix impact of modernization sales growing faster than the maintenance and repair business. The overall margin outlook remains unchanged versus the prior outlook and is expected to be up approximately 30 basis points to 15.7%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.17 to $3.21, up 7% to 9% versus the prior year. This high single-digit adjusted EPS growth is driven by strong operational execution, accretion from the Zardoya transaction, progress on reducing our tax rate and a lower share count at more than up $0.42 of headwind from foreign exchange translation and commodity inflation. Our free cash flow guidance for the year remains unchanged at $1.6 billion and we have increased the 2022 share repurchase target from $500 million to $700 million.  Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9. New Equipment business is projected to be down 0.5% to 1%. This is 1.5 points decrease from prior outlook at the midpoint, driven by revised expectation in the Americas and China. While the backlog in Americas is up more than 10%, shipments are shifting from 2022 to next year from delayed building construction activity by our customers. As a result, we now expect Americas organic New Equipment sales to be about flat versus up low single digits previously. We expect Asia to be down low single digits from down slightly previously driven by China. Despite our backlog being flattish versus prior year and up from the end of '21, we now expect Otis China organic sales to be down mid-single digits driven by lower market expectations now expected to be down approximately 10% at the low end of our prior guidance and the impact of lockdowns during Q2 that have moved projects to the right into '23. This has been partially offset by improved outlook in Asia Pacific from the benefit of strong orders growth and momentum in India and South Korea. Outlook on New Equipment organic sales in EMEA remains unchanged, and is expected to be up low to mid-single digits in 2022. Turning to Service. We now expect organic sales to be up 5.5% to 6.5%, an improvement of 50 basis points from the prior outlook of 5% to 6%, driven by strong maintenance pricing, robust repair order growth in the second quarter and incrementally higher confidence to convert a modernization backlog and that is up 4%.  Moving to Slide 10. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 9%, a $0.24 increase at the midpoint. The $0.18 or $110 million headwind from commodities is more than offset by the $230 million to $260 million of operational improvement through higher service volume and pricing, productivity in both segments and other cost containment actions resulting in profit growth of $120 million to $150 million at constant currency. This is $5 million higher than our prior outlook at the midpoint. Accretion from the Zardoya transaction, close to 2 points of tax rate reduction versus last year and the benefit from $1.4 billion of share repurchases since spin is more than offsetting the $0.24 or $145 million headwind from the unprecedented strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We have now assumed the euro at EUR 1.01 for the second half of the year or EUR 1.05 for the full year. Compared to the prior guidance, we are offsetting more than half of the incremental FX headwinds on by driving the service business, containing costs and reducing the tax rate an additional point now projected to be 26.6% for the year at the midpoint.  Overall, this outlook clearly reflects our ability to mitigate the macro challenges and deliver another year of solid organic top line growth, margin expansion, robust free cash and importantly, strong new equipment backlog and service portfolio growth that positions us well for 2023 and beyond. And with that, I will request Michelle to please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey Sprague: Congrats on doing well. First, just on China. Obviously, a lot of headlines of the outlook as you presented, down the single digit for the year-end, market down 10 actually sounds surprisingly okay. I just actually wonder your confidence level on that relative to the backlog conversion and what's happening on the ground, if you could give us a little update there.\nJudith Marks: Sure, Jeff. It's Judy. Listen, we are taking our market growth estimates down really due to the lockdown impact that we felt in April and May, and we just don't expect that the market will recover fully in 2022. So we've taken the market for 2022 to decline at about 10%, which is the low end of our previous range and I will be sure to disclose that, that do not assume or factor in any return to growth or any stimulus. Listen, I'm feeling good about the health of our business in China. Our strategy and our initiatives are on track. It's helping us gain share, as you've seen. And we grew faster than the market, not just in Q1, but also in this most recent quarter. Our new equipment orders were down low teens, but the market was down 20% in the second quarter. So we're outperforming the market, and that's really what gives me the confidence that our strategy is working. Residential, infrastructure and industrial were what were strong in the second quarter in China. And the higher tier cities, Tiers 1 through 4, but especially 1 and 2 have really continued to perform for us and the market in general. And that's really where we focused our strategy. We've doubled our agents and distributors, and that is continuing to yield. We're now at about 2,250 agents and distributors who are representing both our product and services -- so net share is up in a donation market. And we have really also focused on our service strategy. As Rahul said, we had our fourth consecutive quarter of high teens portfolio growth -- and that's where it is going to continue in China. So we're trying to find balance in China, and then we have balance in geography and our mix. China is about 20% of our global revenue and really, as you've seen in the second quarter, the balance of our business, Asia Pacific, Europe and Americas just really picked up the pace. And we're feeling good the backlogs there across the globe, and we've got the new equipment orders that are going to continue to drive our future well into '23. So we're watching China like everyone else, but a really strong Q2 by Perry and the team post the COVID lockdowns. Our factories are manufacturing at peak rates. We've got capacity if there is a stimulus. And all of our service indicators are really strong. When we can tell you across the globe, including China, that our recaptures for the first quarter have exceeded cancellation rates, second quarter having exceeded cancellation rates, we are managing every KPI and every metric and the team's delivering.\nRahul Ghai: And just to add to that so just to add to that, I said in my prepared remarks, anything that's important for everyone to recognize that our backlog in China getting to second half is flattish year-over-year. So the orders were down kind of low teens, sales were down. So we enter into the second half of the year with flattish backlog. So as we take -- as we're revising our guide for the year, we are projecting a sequential improvement in year-over-year growth.  So we're down about between first quarter and second quarter, we're down about 9% and the full year is down kind of mid-single digits. So that does -- second half fiscal is down but not down to the same extent as the first half. So that's clearly the case and revenue is going to be up sequentially between first half and second half.  The conversion to your question is a little bit slower. Given the lock downs, not all the projects that we have projected will be completed in 2022. So that pushes some demand into 2023. So overall, we think our conversions are going to be down kind of high single digits for the year relative to a very, very strong 2021, but they're still kind of in line with where they were pre-COVID. So conversions are slower than last year, but in line with pre-COVID levels. So that's where we are.\nJeffrey Sprague: Sounds great. And then just on the Americas, I mean, these orders really the headline growth itself and then especially versus the comp is just extraordinarily strong I. wonder if you could give us a little bit more context on what's going on there, a couple of large lumpy things perhaps but also address kind of the revenue slippage. Is that primarily kind of job site issues with your customers or you see folks kind of tapping the brakes on economic concerns? Just any additional color there on the Americas should be appreciated.\nJudith Marks: Yes. Well, kudos to Jim and the Americas team, orders are always lumpy, Jeff. You know that in all industrials, but especially in our business, which is longer cycle. But this was a volume-driven quarter for our Americas team. I can't peg it to significant major projects or huge major orders. So it was just strength. And the biggest strength we saw in the Americas was actually in residential, and it reflects what we think is this population migration growth because we saw residential uptick in the South and the Western U.S. and in the Tier 2 cities. So it's fitting the thesis that you're hearing from others, but we're seeing it come through in the orders book. So just really strong performance across the board, across all of our branches and everybody just delivering and converting those awards, which is what we measure as well into orders. In terms of the '22, some of that moving into '23, we told you last quarter that we have some large projects that we didn't expect a lot of the revenue to happen until '23. What we're seeing more is not a shift beyond really labor and job sites. And it's not our labor. We're fully staffed, but it's general construction labor from the general contractors and just a slowness because of the demand in the right places, in the right cities, especially in the South and the West. So it's a little bit of delay just our normal cycle time on some of this and seeing the revenue come through, but it's certainly -- it's going to happen and should bode well for '23.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: And Rahul, thanks for all the support and help you've been great. Thank you very much. So I just wanted to maybe just come back to the comments on China. Obviously, low teens decline was much better than we be expected and obviously a lot better than some of your comps. So -- just curious, how did that compare to your plan? I can't remember if you gave a specific plan for what you expected in China than you did. But how did that play out versus your plan? And more importantly, how does that tracked through the quarter? I know you were behind the curve kind of mid-May. Just wondering how that tracked through June and what we've seen through July so far.\nJudith Marks: Yes. So Nigel, great to talk to you. And June was a tremendous month for our team. They just -- the response was phenomenal. And actually, our shipments, we hit a record level of shipments out of our factories in China in June. So we were prepared. We -- our factories never shut down just based on geo location of them in China. So I think we had some readiness, both our elevator and our escalator factories ready to go. And then we just needed to produce and we need to be able to ship and cross boundaries in China in certain regions. So the team had gotten prepared for that. So June was a strong over July, and July performance continues. We don't guide to the quarter. But obviously, April and May gave us pause, but our team was prepared for it. And now we're going to match our cost structure to what we're seeing happening in terms of the market itself. We've done that before. But we are not expecting the precipitous drop we saw in 2015. We don't believe there's a an instantaneous type of drop there. And we're going to -- again, we'll match our cost to what we're seeing happen in the market.\nNigel Coe: Great. And then on the backlog, maybe just give us a little bit of a taste of through a slower macro, maybe a research and what typically happens to your backlog? Do we see cancellations? Do we typically see push outs? What should we expect? And maybe if you can talk about new equipment versus modernization, that would be helpful.\nRahul Ghai: Yes. Nigel, what we are seeing right now, yes, there are some projects that cancel, but it's always the case. But as you know, we get an advance we book an order. So it's not that we're booking an order or the like some other industrial companies, there has been some concern about our -- given the overall supply chain challenges, our people placing multiple orders. That doesn't happen in our industry. I mean you're creating an elevated or an escalator for a certain building and you're not going to switch designs midway through the project. So -- and we get in advance. So the cancellation do happen. Projects do get canceled, but we are not seeing any change in the year-over-year trends. And those are typically like small. I mean it's not a big thing in our business, that we have to deal with massive cancellation that we are not seeing any of that happen in any material way in terms of changes year-over-year. So the trends are kind of similar. Projects do move, and I think Judy alluded to that in both. I think we've seen that in China in terms of conversion, which to Jeff's question and then into Americas as well as projects are moving out. And I think it's the construction label shortage in EMEA and in the U.S. that is creating some challenges. Our factories are more or less -- we are having supply chain issues. It's not that we are not having supply chain issues, but as best as we can trying to track it very, very rigorously. We are not holding our projects. The challenges we are facing is that customers are behind in terms of their building construction. So we are seeing that slow down, and that is flowing through our revenue. And -- but you saw our backlog. I mean it's up 10% at constant currency. China is flattish and the other regions are combined up approximately 15%. So that bodes really, really well for 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Hudson with RBC Capital Markets.\nNicholas Housden: The first one is on the tax rate, which was obviously quite a nice tailwind this quarter. It looks like it was down about 5 percentage points quarter-on-quarter. And I know, obviously, you've been saying that you're working to reduce this on a structural level, but I'm just trying to get my head around whether the reduction that we've seen this quarter is completely structural or whether we should expect more normal levels in the next few quarters?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. No, Nick. So great progress on reducing our tax rate. I mean, we lowered our full year tax rate guide to about 26.5%, 26.6% at the midpoint. So that's about a point reduction from the prior guide and about 2 points down where we ended in 2021. So that's obviously a really good progress. And in terms of the tax rate within the quarter, there always timing impact on things that we are working on and when they get booked, and the tax rate does fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter but the actions that the team is taking is definitely reducing our structural tax rate, and that is where we reduced our full year guide by about 1 point. And now we are well -- we are within our medium-term guide that we have provided of 25% to 27% on Investor Day.  So we are kind of now in that range, which is really good progress. And the progress has been a little bit more front-end loaded. We've made more progress this year than we were anticipating at the beginning of the year, but we are absolutely confident that we will continue to work our way through to the lower end of the guidance. And -- but given the progress that we have made, the rate of pace will not be the same. Obviously, we're not going to get 2 points of reduction every year. So now we are within the range. And I think you're going to see some improvement next year, but it's not going to be the same rate that we achieved this year.\nNicholas Housden: That's great. My second question is on the margin profile of modernization and just how that compares to the Service business as a whole my gut sense is that it's probably more like new equipment in terms of the profitability there. Any color you could provide would be helpful.\nRahul Ghai: It's slightly lower than new equipment in our business. And we typically are working on modernization. When you do modernization, the attractiveness of that project is typically that you get to renew your service contract for multiple years going forward, right? So that's the attractiveness. So it's highly completed, and you end up taking a modernization job at lower margins on new equipment, but it's still a profitable line of business. So it's not that we are losing money on modernization jobs as a whole. We make money, we make decent margins on it. Our contribution margins are fairly healthy, but they are lower. And the other part that -- the other thing that modernization does help is it does help with that absorption of labor. So modernization growth, while the absolute margins that we attribute to that one line of business may be lower than others, but it definitely helps us with absorption overall. So it's good to see the growth. It's good to see the fact that we are raising our guide for the year. Keep in mind that we were challenged all last year on modernization. We had supply chain issues, we couldn't get -- we were not able to get a supply chain ramped up, but we have kind of worked our way through that. And it's our third consecutive quarter of growth and modernization. And now we are raising our guide from 6% to 8% for the year, which is absolutely fantastic given the issues we had last year.\nJudith Marks: Yes. Nick, it's Judy. We just also very pleased with the progress. We've been telling you for a while was delayed, but there -- this is -- some of mode is discretionary, but every elevator is now about 3 years older than when we -- just before we spun -- so the market is growing in mod and it's got all the attractiveness of that stickiness we want for the follow-on service business, as Rahul said.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nCharles Tusa: Rahul, congrats again, and thanks for all the help over the last couple of years. Can you guys just give a little -- I think you said 3% price and service. Is that right? Should we assume kind of flattish in new equipment?\nJudith Marks: Yes. So service pricing was up 3%. New equipment was actually up low single digits in terms of pricing. So we got price in both segments, Steve.\nCharles Tusa: Okay. And we should assume that most of the commodity headwinds. What were the -- out of that, I guess, you're guiding now kind of $108 million, $110 million in commodities year-over-year inflation year-over-year. What was that number for the quarter?\nRahul Ghai: The $35 million for the quarter, Steve, $70 million for the year. So $70 million for the first half. So you can see -- kind of [indiscernible] first half and about 40 in the second half on a year-over-year basis.\nCharles Tusa: And the vast majority of that is coming in New Equipment, right?\nRahul Ghai: All of it is coming in New Equipment.\nCharles Tusa: Yes. Okay. And then 1 more question for you just on the second half. And anything within the 2 quarters that we should considered from a seasonality perspective? Should we assume a little more catch-up in China in the third quarter and then a bit of a fade on that in the fourth? Or how do we think about the trajectory of EPS just between the third and the fourth?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. Thanks, Steve. It's Anurag here, right? Yes. So if you look -- I think you're asking for the cadence between Q3 and Q4. If you look at 3Q, both sales and our profit will look very similar to 2Q '22 at reported currency, and that is due to the large FX impact in the second half of the year, right? Let me give you a little bit more details on the organic growth. If you look at our current guide, we expect the second half to grow organically about 4% with positive growth in both NE and Service. Last year, Q3 was extremely strong for us, where we grew organically by about 8%. With the new equipment growing mid-teens in third quarter and low single digits in the fourth quarter. So though we will see sequential growth in New Equipment in Q3, it will be down [indiscernible] given the strong compare. As we get into fourth quarter, we do expect to see the return to organic growth as we face an easier compare versus last year and also sequential growth. On Service, for the first half, we are up 5.5%. Our guide is 6%. So that assumes about 6.5% growth for the second half. It should be pretty consistent between Q3 and Q4 in terms of the service growth. Now moving down to the profit side. Given what I just said about new equipment, we will expect some year-on-year margin contraction in third quarter related to the under absorption. But in fourth quarter, you should see modest margin expansion year-on-year as the organic sales increase.  For service, I would say we see a little bit more margin expansion in the fourth quarter than third quarter. Simply based just on the timing of the repair work because we got just more repair revenue coming into the fourth quarter. Overall, we will see margin expansion in both the quarters, but probably more in Q4 than Q3. So if you take it down to the EPS line after normalizing for the tax rate, you'll see a couple of pennies growth in Q3 and the remaining coming out in Q4. And for the rest of the year, we were pretty balanced in terms of EPS growth for the quarter.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: And Rahul wish you all the best in the new role. Maybe a first question around the EMEA business, as I don't think that's been touched on too much, but maybe help us understand sort of how comfortable you feel on the service pricing environment in Europe as I know that was a big concern a decade ago when you had a construction downturn there.  And also on the New Equipment side, a mix picture from sort of other companies on what's going on in European construction. Any updates from you on how that's looking in terms of order intake and so forth?\nJudith Marks: Yes, Julian, we're really pleased with the service pricing that we've been seeing now quarter after quarter in Europe itself. The majority of our service portfolio is Western and Southern Europe, as you know, some in the Middle East, some in Africa. But by far, more far more heavily skewed towards developed Europe, more than half of our service portfolio is there, which why the pricing is so important. And the team has done a great job, again, in Service, pricing there. So -- and they had growth in the portfolio for 2 quarters in a row there in the EMEA. So all showing the right trajectory by Bernardo and team.  In terms of the market that itself, on the New Equipment side, the core European markets are really strong. And we had orders this quarter of 29.3% for New Equipment, a 12-month roll of 5.5%. So all the indicators are there. We're seeing a lot of those volume business and some nice major objects, whether it be around the Olympics coming to Paris or other places. We're seeing some nice major projects as well.  And so right now, the only headwinds we're seeing are in Eastern Europe, not surprising based on the conflict there. So construction is fine. I think Rahul mentioned in one of his responses, that labor is always a challenge in terms of unemployment in Europe and with some of our installation subcontractors. So we're managing that very tightly and very closely. And we're moving our own labor around region-to-region, country-to-country, intra-Europe to be able to handle some of these larger projects.\nRahul Ghai: Julian, just to add to that, just a couple of things to add. I mean on -- first, on the construction outlook, and then I'll come back to pricing maybe in a second. But on construction outlook, what is good to see is that the construction outlook -- the confidence level is a couple of points, but still up. And -- but more importantly, what we see in the building permits index it is probably at the highest level over the last 12 months or so. So that is good that the permit is still kind of hanging in there and in fact, sequentially up from the latest output versus the prior report. So that is good. Our proposals are up high single digits in EMEA. So our baseline activity is fairly strong. So it's just not that we got the orders, but the underlying trends from both an industry and our own activity are strong as well. And then on New Equipment, we also got pricing in EMEA, our second consecutive quarter now of price improvement in kind of up mid-single digits in the quarter. So sequentially, better year-over-year than we were in the first quarter. So that is good that we're getting pricing as well on new equipment orders.  And on Service, I think Judy said it, our pricing was up kind of in that low single-digit level on EMEA, but it's good that it's the game. It's the same thing that we saw in the first quarter as well. So service pricing is good, and that's where you're seeing the margin expansion come through on service because we won't be able to grow our margins 50 basis points on service if we were not seeing pricing in Europe, right? That would not have happened. So that's an important component of our margin expansion.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. And then just my quick follow-up would be, I think you gave some color on the commodity impact this year, which is not really changing from prior. But as we think sort of a little bit further out, maybe. Remind us, I suppose, on the hedging practices on commodities. And also, I suppose, how quickly you think that things like lower steel costs will roll into your COGS? And what degree of tailwind you might benefit from next year looking at sort of steel spot prices today? And again, the speed, just trying to understand the speed at which changes in those prices roll through into your cost of goods sold?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. No, great question, Julian. So we use several strategies to lock in our prices. We're locking with our suppliers, either at spot or locking at the futures, which is our preferred option, we don't always get there, but we definitely lock in rates with our suppliers. And we also hedge -- I think we've discussed it before, our hedging is a little bit challenging, just given that the grades of steel that we buy, we don't always have a corresponding index. So we sometimes run the risk of mark-to-market accounting on our hedges. So we do use hedges. We just can't use it as widely as we would like, just given the nature of what we buy. But overall, we are about 80% locked for the year, almost 100% locked for Q3. Our Q4 spend is still slightly open. So we could -- in our -- and the prices have been coming down. I mean you're clearly seeing, like if you go to China, prices were down 15% in second quarter, they're down about 30% year-over-year in Q3. So we're definitely seeing the prices come down. So we have a small single-digit million tailwind for Q4. We could, but the market has been so fluid that we definitely don't want to bake that in. Now on a year-over-year basis, you're definitely seeing the benefit come through. I mean the prices have come down substantially from where they were. So if you look at Q3, Q4 right now, steel in the U.S. is down 50% year-over-year. So yes, we should definitely get some favorability to 2023. And that will definitely come through as we buy as we buy in Q2, we will definitely see the favorable impact.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Michelle, let's move to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Walsh: Congratulations, Rahul and Anurag.\nRahul Ghai: Thanks, John.\nJohn Walsh: Maybe just circling back to China. You talked a little bit about internal geographies within China. Just your manufacturing wasn't as impacted by the others due to the Shanghai lockdown. But just curious how you think about the share gains you likely saw in the quarter as it relates to China. Do you think they're sustainable or if it kind of normalizes and maybe only keep a portion of what you gained? Just any thoughts around that?\nJudith Marks: John, it's -- our strategy is on track in China, and our team is executing it operationally. And I would tell you with excellence. We have figured out and invested in sales coverage. We've invested in product innovation with our Gen3 offering. We have our factories. Some of them are already at industry 4.0. And all of these investments and strategies are paying off. We've had share gain now in China for multiple quarters. And we believe it's absolutely sustainable. We think we're at the right price point with the most innovative products with the right customer relationships through our agents and distributors, and it's all coming together and working. So even if the segment declines, we should still be able to gain share.\nJohn Walsh: Great. And then you touched on capital allocation, obviously, generating a lot of cash. Just curious as you look at the opportunities, should we think about kind of more service portfolio acquisition, equipment, software, kind of just any color you have there and what we should expect?\nJudith Marks: Our capital allocation strategy allocates about $50 million to $70 million a year for bolt-on M&A. Obviously, the Zardoya transaction was a great opportunity for us at the right time, at the appropriate and fair price. And we not only executed it well. But with the squeeze out, we're able to execute it as quickly as possible. And we're seeing the benefit of that with the $0.12 EPS gain this year and there'll be a little more next year. But really, our M&A strategy revolves around adding to our bolt-on Service business. And we've been doing this for years, it gives us in places where we have density and opportunity, we make it accretive no later than year 2. And we have a playbook for doing it. We've got a really good deal book across the globe to continue doing it, and that's what you're going to see from us.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Miguel Borrega with BNP Paribas.\nMiguel Borrega: The first one, just a follow-up on the order intake, specifically in the Americas, where you said mostly comes from residential and volumes. Can you give us a flavor for timing of delivery. I suppose, lead times in residential are shorter. And then can you talk about pricing of these new orders? Do they contribute positively to the backlog margin?\nJudith Marks: Yes, Miguel, can I -- you said residential and a second word, I didn't quite hear. Could you clarify?\nMiguel Borrega: Yes, the residential orders in the U.S.\nJudith Marks: Okay, just residential, okay. Yes. So residential in the U.S. is our traditional cycle time. It's kind of in apartment buildings and the like. It's a typical lead time that we have for all of our projects. So we anticipate that, that will continue to fill the pipeline, again, with a strong backlog for our Americas group to execute. Rahul, do you want to touch on?\nRahul Ghai: Yes, it's about 12 months, Miguel. So that's Judy saying it's like we typically see 12 months and I think these new orders are going to be in the same range as well. So we should see the orders that we are getting now is probably translating into revenue in the second half of next year.  And overall, I think in Americas, we've got some really good pricing. In fact, pricing was good. New Equipment pricing was up. I think it said in my prepared remarks, up kind of low single digits. So if you -- and we said China was down a couple of points, but that basically implies that all other regions, Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pac outside of China was up mid-single digits. So we're getting good pricing and we implemented these pricing actions in Q3 of last year, and we have seen the turnaround in Asia Pac and EMEA. So it was really good to see the turnaround in Americas. It's coming just as we would have expected. But the pricing overall is slightly better, I would say, in the grand scheme of things. So the pricing is good. In China, while I just want to comment on China pricing, while the pricing is down, keep in mind that the commodity prices to respond to Julian's question, there we are seeing commodity prices down 15% in the second quarter, 30% in the third quarter. So even New Equipment pricing in China is down, we are seeing VR price cost prelim second quarter in China. So overall pricing on New Equipment is good and Americas kind of led the way for us on New Equipment pricing.\nJudith Marks: Yes. And I think what you're seeing, Miguel is the entire team is absolutely focused on cost reduction. SG&A is down 90 basis points as a percent of sales this quarter, and it just reinforces everything we can control, we will. And we've said this since we've spun, we're going to continue to drive SG&A as a percent of sales to be as low as absolutely possible while still investing in our business on the other side.\nMiguel Borrega: That's great. And then just on labor inflation. Can you give us a flavor for what you've negotiated with your unions, when will that hit? And whether you expect this to be passed both in New Equipment and maintenance?\nJudith Marks: So we have many agreements for labor negotiations. Obviously, works cancels in Europe. They come up at all different times. Our U.S. labor negotiation has been concluded. It's a multi-employer agreement, and those rates will be effective on 1 January. So we have the -- and it's a 5-year agreement. So we have the ability, and the knowledge most importantly, to offset that with productivity. So we obviously pass through and raised prices, but that has to cover on the Service side, wage inflation to the best of our ability as well as on the installation side for New Equipment, but we offset that with productivity and then volume and price increases should drop through.\nMiguel Borrega: Great. And then just one quick last question on China. Can you just quantify the lost sales and EBIT from Q2? And whether this will be fully recovered already in Q3?\nRahul Ghai: Yes, Miguel, what I would say is quantification you can debate it, right? I mean overall, the sales are down about 12% in the quarter -- slight -- Q1 was down slightly. So you can average maybe 6, 7 points, I would say, is the stuff that's moving around. But I think the more important part to focus on is our guide for the year, right? I think we've provided you guidance for the year. We haven't lost sales. It's just shifting revenue from Q2 to Q3. I think we should be able to capture most of that -- but it all depends on the timing of the projects.  Clearly, we've spoken about the fact that we expect the market to be softer and we expect conversion rates in China to be slower than they were at the same point last quarter. So conversion rates are slower. So some demand is shifting to the right. But overall, I think the important part to focus on is a guide for the year.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Joel Spungin with Berenberg.\nJoel Spungin: Judy, I was just wondering if I could start by asking you a question on one of the comments you made earlier in answer to another question about why you don't think that what's going on in China is similar to the situation in 2014, 2015. I mean if I was to play devil's advocate for a second, I would say, well, housing inventory levels are alarmingly high rates as high as 2014, sales of new floor space are on the catering.  Why are you more sanguine about the outlook for the Chinese market in the longer run?\nJudith Marks: Yes. So listen, I do believe there are structural changes eventually that will impact the China property market. But we don't believe, Joel, that it will be as precipitous as it was then. -- there was -- in our industry, certainly, there was tremendous supply overcapacity, which then drove significant pricing actions that made the entire industry far less profitable, and that we're not seeing.  I think we had 90% of the new equipment fulfillment today is by the top 10 providers. Almost all of those providers are public companies. They're all from the best we can see pricing rationally. And we're -- and I will tell you, Otis is in a far more competitive position. We have less factories than we did. We have a better offering than we did in terms of innovation. We have a far better sales network -- so we are better aligned with this potential gradual slowing and we have the ability to control that, far better than that [indiscernible] is drop where there was just a buildup from 2000 until 2015 and then a sharp drop off.  So do I believe there's structural changes coming over time? Absolutely. But we're far better prepared for that, and I expect our team will perform just like we have for the past multiple quarters and actually performed better than our peers.\nRahul Ghai: Just to add, just a couple of data points to add to what Judy said. I mean, if you look at things that different now, I believe, from -- if you go back to 2015, 2016, first, if you look at the inventory, residential inventory, it's at 3 to 4 months, right? And it's been hanging in there. In fact, it came down a little bit over the last 6 quarters, I think it's like 3.5 months of inventory, which is lower than 3.8 from April. And I believe if you go back to '16 or '17, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I think it was at this point, maybe double the levels it is today, so it's 6, 6.5 months of inventory. So that is good. And even if you look at the investments, the real estate investment, that's about 5 -- down about 5%. Slow space under construction is down about 3%.  So yes, things are not great. but they're definitely not pointing to the same levels of decline that we saw back in '16 and '17.\nJudith Marks: And the last differentiator I'll give you, Joel, is that we're seeing the state-owned enterprises have a far larger impact. And that bodes well for our relationships as well as our performance and our installed base and our customers. So again, we've been watching -- not just watching the trends, but our strategy has been to prepare for this, and we're ready.\nJoel Spungin: That's great. If I could just squeeze another one in very quickly. Just to clarify really with regards to your comments on the North American new equipment market. You're saying that the delays you're seeing are purely it sounds like a function of issues on the construction side with factors such as labor.  You're not seeing people delaying projects because of increased concern about the economic outlook or anything like that.\nJudith Marks: That's correct. It's labor availability in the right market on the job site from all the trades from the people pouring the hoistway with the cement to the general contractors.\nOperator: This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Judy Marks for any further remarks.\nJudith Marks: Thank you, Michelle. This solid first half demonstrates the strength of our strategy and our ability to execute and adapt to mitigate the significant macroeconomic challenges. We will continue to focus on strong execution to deliver high single-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2022 with continued growth in '23 and beyond. Thank you for joining us today. Everyone, stay safe and well.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating in today's conference call. Thank you for participating.",

            "name": "Judith Marks",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We hope everyone listening is safe and well. I'd like to welcome Anurag Maheshwari in joining us this morning. Anurag is an experienced executive that many of you have worked with in his prior role leading Investor Relations at Harris. More recently, he's been leading our finance team as CFO in the Asia Pacific region since then. I look forward to my partnership with Anurag in driving growth, operational execution and value for our customers, colleagues and shareholders.  I want to also take this opportunity to thank Rahul for his leadership and all of his contributions in transitioning Otis to an independent company and in championing our long-term strategy. We wish him well in his future endeavors. Before I get into the results and outlook, on our Q1 call, we noted our growing concerns about the long-term sustainability of our operations in Russia. At that time, we removed Otis' Russian operations from our 2022 outlook and prior year compares. Amidst mounting regulations, we concluded that the best solution for our customers, colleagues and shareholders was to divest this business, and we recently entered into an agreement to do so. Closing of the transaction is expected imminently. We remain hopeful for a return to peace and stability in the region, and we will continue to contribute to the ongoing relief and humanitarian efforts in Ukraine. This quarter and going forward, Otis' Russia operations and related nonrecurring charges are excluded from our adjusted results, prior year compares and our outlook. Moving to Q2 highlights on Slide 3. We Otis delivered a solid second quarter, closing out a strong first half, especially considering the macro headwinds that we faced. We grew organic sales, expanded margins and achieved 12% adjusted EPS growth. We had record new equipment bookings and continue to build our maintenance portfolio that was up nearly 3.5% in the quarter. Our Service business continued to deliver this quarter where we grew sales in all lines of business and expanded margins due to favorable pricing and productivity. We generated $326 million in free cash flow while continuing to return cash to shareholders, completing another $200 million in share repurchases on top of the $200 million completed in Q1. In addition, as expected, Zardoya Otis was delisted in early May. We gained approximately 1 point of new equipment share in the second quarter, driven by high teens new equipment orders growth for Otis in a market that was down mid-single digits globally. New equipment orders in the Americas were particularly strong, up 57%, despite facing a difficult compare in the prior year. In Los Angeles, we're supporting the modernization of Terminal 4 at LAX. Otis was selected to provide 13 Gen 3 elevators, further extending the long-term relationship with the general contractor Hensel Phelps and marking our latest project at LAX. In Paris, Otis was selected to support the construction of the Tour Triangle, a 180-meter high tower that will include office, hospitality and retail spaces. During the construction phase and Otis SkyBuild self-climbing elevator will ascend as the floors are built, providing speed and simplified logistics to the building's construction teams. The building is designed to meet several environmental standards that Otis will help support by providing space-saving digitally native solutions like our Gen360 platform, SkyRise double-deck elevators and Compass 360 destination dispatching. In South China's Greater Bay Area, Otis is supporting several projects to fuel smart city development. In Guangzhou's Canton Fair Complex, we will provide more than 140 SkyRise and Gen 3 elevators as well as escalators for Phase 4 of the Canton Fair complex, including IoT systems that will monitor performance in real time. In Shenzhen, the new China Life Insurance Tower in the Central Business District will be served by 20 Otis SkyRise elevators. And in Zhuhai, Otis will provide nearly 90 elevators and escalators for the Ngong Ping Royal Times Square. This project will include Gen 3 elevators equipped with Otis' latest ambience features and digital technologies, serving passengers headed to offices, shopping centers and hotels. And lastly, in Korea, Otis was selected to provide more than 45 elevators and escalators in the Teachers' Pension tower, a landmark the financial district of soul. This project will include our Compass360 destination dispatching system to seamlessly move tenants between nearly 50 floors. Moving to Slide 4, Q2 results and 2022 outlook. New equipment orders were up 16.5% at constant currency in the second quarter and up 8.5% on a rolling 12-month basis. Organic sales were up 0.4% and adjusted operating profit margin expanded 20 basis points and was up $16 million at constant currency, driven by strong performance in the service business. Free cash flow conversion was robust at 102% of GAAP net income. Looking ahead to our 2022 outlook, we're revising our full year outlook and now expect organic sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, with net sales in the range of $13.6 million to $13.8 billion. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be in a range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion, up $120 million to $150 million, excluding the impacts from foreign exchange. After approximately $145 million in headwinds from foreign exchange translation, adjusted operating profit at actual currency is expected to be up $5 million to down $25 million. Adjusted EPS is expected in a range of $3.17 to $3.21, up 7% to 9% versus the prior year. Lastly, we still expect free cash flow to be robust at about $1.6 billion or approximately 125% conversion of GAAP net income. We will remain disciplined and balanced on capital allocation, advancing our bolt-on M&A strategy where it makes sense and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which we're now in a position to increase to $700 million versus the $500 million target announced previously.  With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our Q2 results in more detail. Sure, Jeff. It's Judy. Listen, we are taking our market growth estimates down really due to the lockdown impact that we felt in April and May, and we just don't expect that the market will recover fully in 2022. So we've taken the market for 2022 to decline at about 10%, which is the low end of our previous range and I will be sure to disclose that, that do not assume or factor in any return to growth or any stimulus. Listen, I'm feeling good about the health of our business in China. Our strategy and our initiatives are on track. It's helping us gain share, as you've seen. And we grew faster than the market, not just in Q1, but also in this most recent quarter. Our new equipment orders were down low teens, but the market was down 20% in the second quarter. So we're outperforming the market, and that's really what gives me the confidence that our strategy is working. Residential, infrastructure and industrial were what were strong in the second quarter in China. And the higher tier cities, Tiers 1 through 4, but especially 1 and 2 have really continued to perform for us and the market in general. And that's really where we focused our strategy. We've doubled our agents and distributors, and that is continuing to yield. We're now at about 2,250 agents and distributors who are representing both our product and services -- so net share is up in a donation market. And we have really also focused on our service strategy. As Rahul said, we had our fourth consecutive quarter of high teens portfolio growth -- and that's where it is going to continue in China. So we're trying to find balance in China, and then we have balance in geography and our mix. China is about 20% of our global revenue and really, as you've seen in the second quarter, the balance of our business, Asia Pacific, Europe and Americas just really picked up the pace. And we're feeling good the backlogs there across the globe, and we've got the new equipment orders that are going to continue to drive our future well into '23. So we're watching China like everyone else, but a really strong Q2 by Perry and the team post the COVID lockdowns. Our factories are manufacturing at peak rates. We've got capacity if there is a stimulus. And all of our service indicators are really strong. When we can tell you across the globe, including China, that our recaptures for the first quarter have exceeded cancellation rates, second quarter having exceeded cancellation rates, we are managing every KPI and every metric and the team's delivering. Yes. Well, kudos to Jim and the Americas team, orders are always lumpy, Jeff. You know that in all industrials, but especially in our business, which is longer cycle. But this was a volume-driven quarter for our Americas team. I can't peg it to significant major projects or huge major orders. So it was just strength. And the biggest strength we saw in the Americas was actually in residential, and it reflects what we think is this population migration growth because we saw residential uptick in the South and the Western U.S. and in the Tier 2 cities. So it's fitting the thesis that you're hearing from others, but we're seeing it come through in the orders book. So just really strong performance across the board, across all of our branches and everybody just delivering and converting those awards, which is what we measure as well into orders. In terms of the '22, some of that moving into '23, we told you last quarter that we have some large projects that we didn't expect a lot of the revenue to happen until '23. What we're seeing more is not a shift beyond really labor and job sites. And it's not our labor. We're fully staffed, but it's general construction labor from the general contractors and just a slowness because of the demand in the right places, in the right cities, especially in the South and the West. So it's a little bit of delay just our normal cycle time on some of this and seeing the revenue come through, but it's certainly -- it's going to happen and should bode well for '23. Yes. So Nigel, great to talk to you. And June was a tremendous month for our team. They just -- the response was phenomenal. And actually, our shipments, we hit a record level of shipments out of our factories in China in June. So we were prepared. We -- our factories never shut down just based on geo location of them in China. So I think we had some readiness, both our elevator and our escalator factories ready to go. And then we just needed to produce and we need to be able to ship and cross boundaries in China in certain regions. So the team had gotten prepared for that. So June was a strong over July, and July performance continues. We don't guide to the quarter. But obviously, April and May gave us pause, but our team was prepared for it. And now we're going to match our cost structure to what we're seeing happening in terms of the market itself. We've done that before. But we are not expecting the precipitous drop we saw in 2015. We don't believe there's a an instantaneous type of drop there. And we're going to -- again, we'll match our cost to what we're seeing happen in the market. Yes. Nick, it's Judy. We just also very pleased with the progress. We've been telling you for a while was delayed, but there -- this is -- some of mode is discretionary, but every elevator is now about 3 years older than when we -- just before we spun -- so the market is growing in mod and it's got all the attractiveness of that stickiness we want for the follow-on service business, as Rahul said. Yes. So service pricing was up 3%. New equipment was actually up low single digits in terms of pricing. So we got price in both segments, Steve. Yes, Julian, we're really pleased with the service pricing that we've been seeing now quarter after quarter in Europe itself. The majority of our service portfolio is Western and Southern Europe, as you know, some in the Middle East, some in Africa. But by far, more far more heavily skewed towards developed Europe, more than half of our service portfolio is there, which why the pricing is so important. And the team has done a great job, again, in Service, pricing there. So -- and they had growth in the portfolio for 2 quarters in a row there in the EMEA. So all showing the right trajectory by Bernardo and team.  In terms of the market that itself, on the New Equipment side, the core European markets are really strong. And we had orders this quarter of 29.3% for New Equipment, a 12-month roll of 5.5%. So all the indicators are there. We're seeing a lot of those volume business and some nice major objects, whether it be around the Olympics coming to Paris or other places. We're seeing some nice major projects as well.  And so right now, the only headwinds we're seeing are in Eastern Europe, not surprising based on the conflict there. So construction is fine. I think Rahul mentioned in one of his responses, that labor is always a challenge in terms of unemployment in Europe and with some of our installation subcontractors. So we're managing that very tightly and very closely. And we're moving our own labor around region-to-region, country-to-country, intra-Europe to be able to handle some of these larger projects. John, it's -- our strategy is on track in China, and our team is executing it operationally. And I would tell you with excellence. We have figured out and invested in sales coverage. We've invested in product innovation with our Gen3 offering. We have our factories. Some of them are already at industry 4.0. And all of these investments and strategies are paying off. We've had share gain now in China for multiple quarters. And we believe it's absolutely sustainable. We think we're at the right price point with the most innovative products with the right customer relationships through our agents and distributors, and it's all coming together and working. So even if the segment declines, we should still be able to gain share. Our capital allocation strategy allocates about $50 million to $70 million a year for bolt-on M&A. Obviously, the Zardoya transaction was a great opportunity for us at the right time, at the appropriate and fair price. And we not only executed it well. But with the squeeze out, we're able to execute it as quickly as possible. And we're seeing the benefit of that with the $0.12 EPS gain this year and there'll be a little more next year. But really, our M&A strategy revolves around adding to our bolt-on Service business. And we've been doing this for years, it gives us in places where we have density and opportunity, we make it accretive no later than year 2. And we have a playbook for doing it. We've got a really good deal book across the globe to continue doing it, and that's what you're going to see from us. Yes, Miguel, can I -- you said residential and a second word, I didn't quite hear. Could you clarify? Okay, just residential, okay. Yes. So residential in the U.S. is our traditional cycle time. It's kind of in apartment buildings and the like. It's a typical lead time that we have for all of our projects. So we anticipate that, that will continue to fill the pipeline, again, with a strong backlog for our Americas group to execute. Rahul, do you want to touch on? Yes. And I think what you're seeing, Miguel is the entire team is absolutely focused on cost reduction. SG&A is down 90 basis points as a percent of sales this quarter, and it just reinforces everything we can control, we will. And we've said this since we've spun, we're going to continue to drive SG&A as a percent of sales to be as low as absolutely possible while still investing in our business on the other side. So we have many agreements for labor negotiations. Obviously, works cancels in Europe. They come up at all different times. Our U.S. labor negotiation has been concluded. It's a multi-employer agreement, and those rates will be effective on 1 January. So we have the -- and it's a 5-year agreement. So we have the ability, and the knowledge most importantly, to offset that with productivity. So we obviously pass through and raised prices, but that has to cover on the Service side, wage inflation to the best of our ability as well as on the installation side for New Equipment, but we offset that with productivity and then volume and price increases should drop through. Yes. So listen, I do believe there are structural changes eventually that will impact the China property market. But we don't believe, Joel, that it will be as precipitous as it was then. -- there was -- in our industry, certainly, there was tremendous supply overcapacity, which then drove significant pricing actions that made the entire industry far less profitable, and that we're not seeing.  I think we had 90% of the new equipment fulfillment today is by the top 10 providers. Almost all of those providers are public companies. They're all from the best we can see pricing rationally. And we're -- and I will tell you, Otis is in a far more competitive position. We have less factories than we did. We have a better offering than we did in terms of innovation. We have a far better sales network -- so we are better aligned with this potential gradual slowing and we have the ability to control that, far better than that [indiscernible] is drop where there was just a buildup from 2000 until 2015 and then a sharp drop off.  So do I believe there's structural changes coming over time? Absolutely. But we're far better prepared for that, and I expect our team will perform just like we have for the past multiple quarters and actually performed better than our peers. And the last differentiator I'll give you, Joel, is that we're seeing the state-owned enterprises have a far larger impact. And that bodes well for our relationships as well as our performance and our installed base and our customers. So again, we've been watching -- not just watching the trends, but our strategy has been to prepare for this, and we're ready. That's correct. It's labor availability in the right market on the job site from all the trades from the people pouring the hoistway with the cement to the general contractors. Thank you, Michelle. This solid first half demonstrates the strength of our strategy and our ability to execute and adapt to mitigate the significant macroeconomic challenges. We will continue to focus on strong execution to deliver high single-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2022 with continued growth in '23 and beyond. Thank you for joining us today. Everyone, stay safe and well."

            "name": "Anurag Maheshwari",
            "content": "Thanks, Rahul and Judy, for the kind introduction, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here and look forward to continuing the great work Rahul has done in advancing our long-term strategy, driving operational execution and creating value for our shareholders. Thank you, Rahul. Let me start on Slide 8 with a recalibrated outlook, that incorporates the evolving macroeconomic headwinds, combined with our continued focus on things we can control, accelerating service growth, driving productivity, optimizing the tax rate and reducing our share count. Starting with sales. We are expecting organic sales to be up 2.5% to 3.5%, which is 0.5 point lower than the previous guidance, driven by a reduction in the New Equipment segment partially offset by better expectations for Service. Though new equipment sales are lower, margins remain unchanged, expected to be down 20 to 60 basis points versus the prior year. with the impact of lower volume, offset by improved productivity. Service margins are now expected to be up approximately 60 basis points, a 10 basis point decrease from the prior outlook reflecting the mix impact of modernization sales growing faster than the maintenance and repair business. The overall margin outlook remains unchanged versus the prior outlook and is expected to be up approximately 30 basis points to 15.7%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.17 to $3.21, up 7% to 9% versus the prior year. This high single-digit adjusted EPS growth is driven by strong operational execution, accretion from the Zardoya transaction, progress on reducing our tax rate and a lower share count at more than up $0.42 of headwind from foreign exchange translation and commodity inflation. Our free cash flow guidance for the year remains unchanged at $1.6 billion and we have increased the 2022 share repurchase target from $500 million to $700 million.  Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9. New Equipment business is projected to be down 0.5% to 1%. This is 1.5 points decrease from prior outlook at the midpoint, driven by revised expectation in the Americas and China. While the backlog in Americas is up more than 10%, shipments are shifting from 2022 to next year from delayed building construction activity by our customers. As a result, we now expect Americas organic New Equipment sales to be about flat versus up low single digits previously. We expect Asia to be down low single digits from down slightly previously driven by China. Despite our backlog being flattish versus prior year and up from the end of '21, we now expect Otis China organic sales to be down mid-single digits driven by lower market expectations now expected to be down approximately 10% at the low end of our prior guidance and the impact of lockdowns during Q2 that have moved projects to the right into '23. This has been partially offset by improved outlook in Asia Pacific from the benefit of strong orders growth and momentum in India and South Korea. Outlook on New Equipment organic sales in EMEA remains unchanged, and is expected to be up low to mid-single digits in 2022. Turning to Service. We now expect organic sales to be up 5.5% to 6.5%, an improvement of 50 basis points from the prior outlook of 5% to 6%, driven by strong maintenance pricing, robust repair order growth in the second quarter and incrementally higher confidence to convert a modernization backlog and that is up 4%.  Moving to Slide 10. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 9%, a $0.24 increase at the midpoint. The $0.18 or $110 million headwind from commodities is more than offset by the $230 million to $260 million of operational improvement through higher service volume and pricing, productivity in both segments and other cost containment actions resulting in profit growth of $120 million to $150 million at constant currency. This is $5 million higher than our prior outlook at the midpoint. Accretion from the Zardoya transaction, close to 2 points of tax rate reduction versus last year and the benefit from $1.4 billion of share repurchases since spin is more than offsetting the $0.24 or $145 million headwind from the unprecedented strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We have now assumed the euro at EUR 1.01 for the second half of the year or EUR 1.05 for the full year. Compared to the prior guidance, we are offsetting more than half of the incremental FX headwinds on by driving the service business, containing costs and reducing the tax rate an additional point now projected to be 26.6% for the year at the midpoint.  Overall, this outlook clearly reflects our ability to mitigate the macro challenges and deliver another year of solid organic top line growth, margin expansion, robust free cash and importantly, strong new equipment backlog and service portfolio growth that positions us well for 2023 and beyond. And with that, I will request Michelle to please open the line for questions. Yes. Thanks, Steve. It's Anurag here, right? Yes. So if you look -- I think you're asking for the cadence between Q3 and Q4. If you look at 3Q, both sales and our profit will look very similar to 2Q '22 at reported currency, and that is due to the large FX impact in the second half of the year, right? Let me give you a little bit more details on the organic growth. If you look at our current guide, we expect the second half to grow organically about 4% with positive growth in both NE and Service. Last year, Q3 was extremely strong for us, where we grew organically by about 8%. With the new equipment growing mid-teens in third quarter and low single digits in the fourth quarter. So though we will see sequential growth in New Equipment in Q3, it will be down [indiscernible] given the strong compare. As we get into fourth quarter, we do expect to see the return to organic growth as we face an easier compare versus last year and also sequential growth. On Service, for the first half, we are up 5.5%. Our guide is 6%. So that assumes about 6.5% growth for the second half. It should be pretty consistent between Q3 and Q4 in terms of the service growth. Now moving down to the profit side. Given what I just said about new equipment, we will expect some year-on-year margin contraction in third quarter related to the under absorption. But in fourth quarter, you should see modest margin expansion year-on-year as the organic sales increase.  For service, I would say we see a little bit more margin expansion in the fourth quarter than third quarter. Simply based just on the timing of the repair work because we got just more repair revenue coming into the fourth quarter. Overall, we will see margin expansion in both the quarters, but probably more in Q4 than Q3. So if you take it down to the EPS line after normalizing for the tax rate, you'll see a couple of pennies growth in Q3 and the remaining coming out in Q4. And for the rest of the year, we were pretty balanced in terms of EPS growth for the quarter. Michelle, let's move to the next question."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Rahul Ghai",
            "content": "Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with second quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales of $3.5 billion were down 5.8%, primarily due to broad strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Organic sales were up 40 basis points, the seventh consecutive quarter of growth, driven by Service, which increased over 5%. Adjusted operating profit was down $21 million, excluding the impact of translational foreign exchange, adjusted operating profit was up $16 million at constant currency, drop-through on higher service volume, favorable service pricing and benefit from productivity in both segments was partially offset by the impact of commodity price increases and annual wage inflation.  We also continued our unrelenting focus on cost containment. And adjusted SG&A expense was down over $50 million or 90 basis points as a percentage of sales, even with inflationary trends in the economy. Despite the challenging environment, we maintained the investment in the business and R&D spend and other strategic investments were flat versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS was up 12% or $0.09. A $0.06 headwind from foreign exchange translation was more than offset by strong operational performance, accretion from the Zardoya transaction, continued progress on reducing the tax rate and the benefit of $400 million in share repurchases completed year-to-date. Moving to Slide 6. New equipment orders in the second quarter were up 16.5% at constant currency. Orders in the Americas were up over 50%, with growth in all verticals on top of nearly 50% growth in Q2 of 2021. Awards, which preceded orders in North America stayed strong and were up 5 points on a sequential basis. EMEA orders were up 29% and growth in both Europe and the Middle East, and orders in Asia outside of China were up double digits. Driven by strong growth in South Korea and India, where bookings were more than double last year's volume. Orders in China were down low teens outperforming the market that we estimate was down about 20%. Strong orders growth contributed to new equipment backlog increasing 6% and 10% at constant currency. Backlog in China was about flat, and backlog in Americas, EMEA and Asia, outside of China, was up approximately 15%. Globally, pricing on new equipment orders was up low single digits after 5 straight quarters of year-over-year decline. Pricing trends improved year-over-year in all regions. Excluding China, where pricing was down low single digits versus the prior year. New Equipment organic sales were down 5% in the quarter, as low single-digit growth in EMEA and high single-digit growth in Asia, excluding China, was more than offset by mid-single-digit decline in the Americas due to a tough compare from the prior year and slowdown in building construction, and a low teens decline in China from COVID-related lockdowns.  Adjusted operating profit was down $28 million at constant currency, largely from the impact of lower volume and related under absorption. Commodity inflation of $35 million that was in line with prior expectations was mostly mitigated by installation and material productivity and lower SG&A expense.  Service segment results on Slide 7. Maintenance portfolio units were up nearly 3.5% from improvements in retention, recapture and conversion rates with recaptured units more than offsetting cancellations in the quarter. In China, conversion rates continued to improve year-over-year and contributed to the fourth consecutive quarter of high teens portfolio growth. Modernization orders growth accelerated to 9% in the quarter. With growth in all regions, driving backlog growth of 4%.  Service organic sales grew for the sixth consecutive quarter, up 5.2%, with growth in all lines of business. Maintenance and repair grew 4.9% as the benefit of strong repair volume and growth in contractual maintenance sales that outpaced our unit growth due to improved pricing, which was up about 3% on a like-for-like basis. Modernization sales continued the recovery that started in Q4 of 2021 and were up 6.4% in the quarter with growth in every region. Service profit at constant FX was up $39 million. Benefit from higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity was partially offset by annual wage increases. Margins were up 50 basis points, the tenth consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Overall, the first half results reflect solid operational execution with a point of new equipment share gain, the best portfolio growth in a decade and close to $125 million of cost reduction between productivity and SG&A. These actions helped us manage through the continuing macroeconomic challenges and achieved low single-digit organic sales growth, $50 million of earnings growth at constant FX and 15.8% adjusted margins, a 30 basis point improvement over the first half of 2021. Margins for the first half are up 140 basis points from pre-COVID levels of comparable period in 2019. First half free cash flow generation of $800 million, 50% of our guide for the year enabled us to repay $500 million of debt, raise dividends by 20% and complete $400 million in share repurchases. With that, let me turn it over to Anurag to walk through the revised 2022 outlook. And just to add to that so just to add to that, I said in my prepared remarks, anything that's important for everyone to recognize that our backlog in China getting to second half is flattish year-over-year. So the orders were down kind of low teens, sales were down. So we enter into the second half of the year with flattish backlog. So as we take -- as we're revising our guide for the year, we are projecting a sequential improvement in year-over-year growth.  So we're down about between first quarter and second quarter, we're down about 9% and the full year is down kind of mid-single digits. So that does -- second half fiscal is down but not down to the same extent as the first half. So that's clearly the case and revenue is going to be up sequentially between first half and second half.  The conversion to your question is a little bit slower. Given the lock downs, not all the projects that we have projected will be completed in 2022. So that pushes some demand into 2023. So overall, we think our conversions are going to be down kind of high single digits for the year relative to a very, very strong 2021, but they're still kind of in line with where they were pre-COVID. So conversions are slower than last year, but in line with pre-COVID levels. So that's where we are. Yes. Nigel, what we are seeing right now, yes, there are some projects that cancel, but it's always the case. But as you know, we get an advance we book an order. So it's not that we're booking an order or the like some other industrial companies, there has been some concern about our -- given the overall supply chain challenges, our people placing multiple orders. That doesn't happen in our industry. I mean you're creating an elevated or an escalator for a certain building and you're not going to switch designs midway through the project. So -- and we get in advance. So the cancellation do happen. Projects do get canceled, but we are not seeing any change in the year-over-year trends. And those are typically like small. I mean it's not a big thing in our business, that we have to deal with massive cancellation that we are not seeing any of that happen in any material way in terms of changes year-over-year. So the trends are kind of similar. Projects do move, and I think Judy alluded to that in both. I think we've seen that in China in terms of conversion, which to Jeff's question and then into Americas as well as projects are moving out. And I think it's the construction label shortage in EMEA and in the U.S. that is creating some challenges. Our factories are more or less -- we are having supply chain issues. It's not that we are not having supply chain issues, but as best as we can trying to track it very, very rigorously. We are not holding our projects. The challenges we are facing is that customers are behind in terms of their building construction. So we are seeing that slow down, and that is flowing through our revenue. And -- but you saw our backlog. I mean it's up 10% at constant currency. China is flattish and the other regions are combined up approximately 15%. So that bodes really, really well for 2023. Yes. No, Nick. So great progress on reducing our tax rate. I mean, we lowered our full year tax rate guide to about 26.5%, 26.6% at the midpoint. So that's about a point reduction from the prior guide and about 2 points down where we ended in 2021. So that's obviously a really good progress. And in terms of the tax rate within the quarter, there always timing impact on things that we are working on and when they get booked, and the tax rate does fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter but the actions that the team is taking is definitely reducing our structural tax rate, and that is where we reduced our full year guide by about 1 point. And now we are well -- we are within our medium-term guide that we have provided of 25% to 27% on Investor Day.  So we are kind of now in that range, which is really good progress. And the progress has been a little bit more front-end loaded. We've made more progress this year than we were anticipating at the beginning of the year, but we are absolutely confident that we will continue to work our way through to the lower end of the guidance. And -- but given the progress that we have made, the rate of pace will not be the same. Obviously, we're not going to get 2 points of reduction every year. So now we are within the range. And I think you're going to see some improvement next year, but it's not going to be the same rate that we achieved this year. It's slightly lower than new equipment in our business. And we typically are working on modernization. When you do modernization, the attractiveness of that project is typically that you get to renew your service contract for multiple years going forward, right? So that's the attractiveness. So it's highly completed, and you end up taking a modernization job at lower margins on new equipment, but it's still a profitable line of business. So it's not that we are losing money on modernization jobs as a whole. We make money, we make decent margins on it. Our contribution margins are fairly healthy, but they are lower. And the other part that -- the other thing that modernization does help is it does help with that absorption of labor. So modernization growth, while the absolute margins that we attribute to that one line of business may be lower than others, but it definitely helps us with absorption overall. So it's good to see the growth. It's good to see the fact that we are raising our guide for the year. Keep in mind that we were challenged all last year on modernization. We had supply chain issues, we couldn't get -- we were not able to get a supply chain ramped up, but we have kind of worked our way through that. And it's our third consecutive quarter of growth and modernization. And now we are raising our guide from 6% to 8% for the year, which is absolutely fantastic given the issues we had last year. The $35 million for the quarter, Steve, $70 million for the year. So $70 million for the first half. So you can see -- kind of [indiscernible] first half and about 40 in the second half on a year-over-year basis. All of it is coming in New Equipment. Julian, just to add to that, just a couple of things to add. I mean on -- first, on the construction outlook, and then I'll come back to pricing maybe in a second. But on construction outlook, what is good to see is that the construction outlook -- the confidence level is a couple of points, but still up. And -- but more importantly, what we see in the building permits index it is probably at the highest level over the last 12 months or so. So that is good that the permit is still kind of hanging in there and in fact, sequentially up from the latest output versus the prior report. So that is good. Our proposals are up high single digits in EMEA. So our baseline activity is fairly strong. So it's just not that we got the orders, but the underlying trends from both an industry and our own activity are strong as well. And then on New Equipment, we also got pricing in EMEA, our second consecutive quarter now of price improvement in kind of up mid-single digits in the quarter. So sequentially, better year-over-year than we were in the first quarter. So that is good that we're getting pricing as well on new equipment orders.  And on Service, I think Judy said it, our pricing was up kind of in that low single-digit level on EMEA, but it's good that it's the game. It's the same thing that we saw in the first quarter as well. So service pricing is good, and that's where you're seeing the margin expansion come through on service because we won't be able to grow our margins 50 basis points on service if we were not seeing pricing in Europe, right? That would not have happened. So that's an important component of our margin expansion. Yes. No, great question, Julian. So we use several strategies to lock in our prices. We're locking with our suppliers, either at spot or locking at the futures, which is our preferred option, we don't always get there, but we definitely lock in rates with our suppliers. And we also hedge -- I think we've discussed it before, our hedging is a little bit challenging, just given that the grades of steel that we buy, we don't always have a corresponding index. So we sometimes run the risk of mark-to-market accounting on our hedges. So we do use hedges. We just can't use it as widely as we would like, just given the nature of what we buy. But overall, we are about 80% locked for the year, almost 100% locked for Q3. Our Q4 spend is still slightly open. So we could -- in our -- and the prices have been coming down. I mean you're clearly seeing, like if you go to China, prices were down 15% in second quarter, they're down about 30% year-over-year in Q3. So we're definitely seeing the prices come down. So we have a small single-digit million tailwind for Q4. We could, but the market has been so fluid that we definitely don't want to bake that in. Now on a year-over-year basis, you're definitely seeing the benefit come through. I mean the prices have come down substantially from where they were. So if you look at Q3, Q4 right now, steel in the U.S. is down 50% year-over-year. So yes, we should definitely get some favorability to 2023. And that will definitely come through as we buy as we buy in Q2, we will definitely see the favorable impact. Thanks, John. Yes, it's about 12 months, Miguel. So that's Judy saying it's like we typically see 12 months and I think these new orders are going to be in the same range as well. So we should see the orders that we are getting now is probably translating into revenue in the second half of next year.  And overall, I think in Americas, we've got some really good pricing. In fact, pricing was good. New Equipment pricing was up. I think it said in my prepared remarks, up kind of low single digits. So if you -- and we said China was down a couple of points, but that basically implies that all other regions, Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pac outside of China was up mid-single digits. So we're getting good pricing and we implemented these pricing actions in Q3 of last year, and we have seen the turnaround in Asia Pac and EMEA. So it was really good to see the turnaround in Americas. It's coming just as we would have expected. But the pricing overall is slightly better, I would say, in the grand scheme of things. So the pricing is good. In China, while I just want to comment on China pricing, while the pricing is down, keep in mind that the commodity prices to respond to Julian's question, there we are seeing commodity prices down 15% in the second quarter, 30% in the third quarter. So even New Equipment pricing in China is down, we are seeing VR price cost prelim second quarter in China. So overall pricing on New Equipment is good and Americas kind of led the way for us on New Equipment pricing. Yes, Miguel, what I would say is quantification you can debate it, right? I mean overall, the sales are down about 12% in the quarter -- slight -- Q1 was down slightly. So you can average maybe 6, 7 points, I would say, is the stuff that's moving around. But I think the more important part to focus on is our guide for the year, right? I think we've provided you guidance for the year. We haven't lost sales. It's just shifting revenue from Q2 to Q3. I think we should be able to capture most of that -- but it all depends on the timing of the projects.  Clearly, we've spoken about the fact that we expect the market to be softer and we expect conversion rates in China to be slower than they were at the same point last quarter. So conversion rates are slower. So some demand is shifting to the right. But overall, I think the important part to focus on is a guide for the year. Just to add, just a couple of data points to add to what Judy said. I mean, if you look at things that different now, I believe, from -- if you go back to 2015, 2016, first, if you look at the inventory, residential inventory, it's at 3 to 4 months, right? And it's been hanging in there. In fact, it came down a little bit over the last 6 quarters, I think it's like 3.5 months of inventory, which is lower than 3.8 from April. And I believe if you go back to '16 or '17, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I think it was at this point, maybe double the levels it is today, so it's 6, 6.5 months of inventory. So that is good. And even if you look at the investments, the real estate investment, that's about 5 -- down about 5%. Slow space under construction is down about 3%.  So yes, things are not great. but they're definitely not pointing to the same levels of decline that we saw back in '16 and '17."

Presentation materials are available for download from Otis\u2019 website at www.otis.com. I will now turn it over to Michael Rednor, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nMichael Rednor: Thank you, Latonia. Welcome to Otis\u2019 first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Judy Marks, Chair, CEO and President; and Rahul Ghai, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and significant non-recurring items. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis\u2019 SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Judy.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Mike and thank you everyone for joining us. We hope that everyone listening is safe and well. We had a strong start to the year, reflected in our financial results and in the progress made on our balanced capital allocation strategy. We grew organic sales, expanded margins and achieved high single-digit adjusted EPS growth, while driving growth in all regions in new equipment orders and our maintenance portfolio. Our service business experienced favorable pricing and grew revenue, margins and adjusted operating profit. In addition, we generated nearly $0.5 billion in free cash flow while continuing to return the majority of our cash generated to shareholders. In Q1, we completed $200 million in share repurchases and received Board approval of a $1 billion share repurchase authorization. In April, we announced a 20.8% increase to our quarterly dividend, while acquiring the remaining interest in Zardoya Otis. After settlement of the tender offer in mid-April, we now have over 95% ownership of Zardoya Otis and expect to automatically delist it in early May. Timing was better than our prior expectations and is expected to add another $0.02 of EPS accretion in 2022. This progress sets us up well for the remainder of 2022 and beyond. New equipment orders were up 8.8% in the quarter with growth in all regions, leading to approximately 1 point of new equipment share gain on top of close to 2 points of share gain since 2020. In Korea, Otis was selected to provide more than 70 Gen 2 units to the Yonghyun Xi Crest apartment complex in Incheon, Korea. Otis Gen 2 elevators equipped with ReGen drive technology that can deliver substantial energy savings will serve more than 2,200 apartment units. This is our latest project in the region with GS Engineering & Construction and further strengthens our 20-year collaboration with them. In China, we received an order to support the next phase of the Shenzhen Metro project extending more than two decades of collaboration with the installation of nearly 1,000 units to-date. In this phase, we will provide more than 350 IoT-enabled elevators and escalators. This award marks another milestone in our digitalization journey in China and allows us to continue delivering the benefits of Otis ONE\u2019s predictive maintenance to our customers. In addition to executing on our financial priorities, we remain committed to advancing our ESG initiatives and published our inaugural ESG report in Q1. This report reflects the focus we have placed and progress we have made on reducing our carbon footprint, creating a safe, equitable and inclusive work environment, supporting the communities around us and maintaining best-in-class governance practices. Moving to Slide 4, Q1 results and 2022 outlook. New equipment orders in the first quarter were up 8.8% at constant currency and up 10.9% on a rolling 12-month basis, contributing to backlog growth of 6% versus prior year. Organic sales were up 3.1% due to the strength in our service business, which was up 5.8%. Adjusted operating profit was up $29 million at constant currency and up $9 million at actual currency, with margin expansion of 30 basis points, driven by strong performance in the service business as well as some benefit from segment mix. Free cash flow was robust at $474 million at 152% conversion of GAAP net income. A few additional updates before I begin our revised 2022 outlook. In April, the agreement between the National Elevator Bargaining Association and the International Union of Elevator Constructors was ratified. This collective bargaining agreement covers the majority of Otis\u2019 U.S. field colleagues and will become effective this July with wage increases taking effect in January of 2023. We believe this 5-year agreement is fair and equitable to both parties with the annual increases generally in line with historical trends. And like in private years, we expect to fully offset this cost through increased productivity as we upscale and continue to develop this essential workforce. In addition, we are disheartened to see the escalation of the crisis in Ukraine. We have growing concerns about the long-term sustainability of Otis\u2019 operations in Russia, especially with mounting regulations and supply chain disruptions. As a result, we are motivated to find solutions and explore alternatives for our Russia business that are in the best interest of all of our stakeholders. We remain hopeful for return to peace and stability in the region and we will continue to contribute to the ongoing relief and humanitarian efforts necessary for those most impacted by this crisis. Looking ahead to our 2022 outlook, given the wide range of outcomes and the process that we are undergoing, we have removed Otis\u2019 Russian operations from the current outlook as well as in the prior year compares. This adjustment will largely impact the new equipment business. Rahul will walk through this in more detail and a reconciliation of Otis\u2019 results, excluding Russia for the last five quarters can be found in the appendix of this webcast. For the year, excluding Russia, we expect organic sales growth of 3% to 4% with net sales in the range of $14.1 billion to $14.3 billion. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be in a range of $2.2 billion to $2.25 billion, up $105 million to $155 million, excluding the impacts from foreign exchange. At actual currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be in the $40 million to $90 million. Adjusted EPS is expected in the range of $3.22 to $3.27, up 9% to 11% versus the prior year. Lastly, we still expect free cash flow to be robust at approximately $1.6 billion or approximately 120% conversion of GAAP net income. We remain disciplined in our capital allocation strategy. And in addition to increasing our ownership in Zardoya Otis, we will continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and advance our bolt-on M&A strategy where it makes sense and adds to the density of our growing service portfolio. With that, I will turn it over to Rahul to walk through our Q1 results and 2022 outlook in more detail.\nRahul Ghai: Thank you, Judy and good morning everyone. Starting with first quarter results on Slide 5, net sales were up 0.2% to $3.4 billion. Organic sales grew for the sixth consecutive quarter, up 3.1% driven by service sales, which increased nearly 6%. Adjusted operating profit was up $9 million and up $29 million at constant currency as the drop-through on higher service volume, favorable service pricing, productivity in both segments and lower bad debt expense was partially offset by commodity headwinds and annual labor cost increases. We also maintained our unrelenting focus on cost containment and adjusted SG&A expense was down $17 million versus the prior year and down 60 basis points as a percentage of sales despite the inflationary trends in the economy. R&D trend and other strategic investments were flat versus the prior year. Given the strong cash flow and progress on repatriation, we completed our deleveraging and repurchased $200 million of shares in the quarter. Overall, growth in operating profit, reduction in share count and continued progress on reducing the tax rate resulted in first quarter adjusted EPS growth of 6.9%. Moving to Slide 6, new equipment orders were up 8.8% at constant currency, with growth in all regions. Orders momentum remained strong in Asia, up mid single-digits with about 10% growth in Asia, ex-China. China orders were up 3%, the eighth consecutive quarter of orders growth in the country and outgrew the market that was down mid single-digits. Orders in America were up high single-digit and awards, which precede order bookings, were up nearly 25% in North America, signaling continued strong demand. EMEA orders were up 17% with growth in both Europe and the Middle East. Strong orders growth contributed to total company backlog increasing 4% and 6% at constant currency, with growth in all regions, including approximately 6% growth in Asia. In addition, global proposal volume was up low teens with more than 25% growth in China, demonstrating robust market activity and the benefits of increased sales coverage. Globally, pricing on new equipment orders was about flat in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. New equipment organic sales were down 0.5% in the quarter. EMEA was up mid single-digits, but this was offset by a low single-digit decline in both Americas and Asia. Americas declined due to a tough compare from COVID recovery in the prior year. And in Asia, China was impacted by job site closures towards the end of the quarter. Adjusted operating profit was down $12 million, partially from the impact of lower volume. Commodity inflation of $38 million that was in line with prior expectations was largely mitigated by installation and material productivity and lower bad debt expense. Service segment results on Slide 7, maintenance portfolio units were up more than 3% from broad-based improvements in retention, recapture and conversion rates, with recaptured units more than offsetting cancellations in the quarter. In China, conversion rates continued to improve and contributed to third consecutive quarter of high-teens portfolio growth. Modernization orders were down about 6% in the quarter, but are up close to 6% on a rolling 12-month basis, driving backlog growth of 3% versus the prior year. Service organic sales grew for the fifth consecutive quarter, up 5.8% with growth in all lines of business. Maintenance and repair grew 5.6%, with mid single-digit growth in contractual maintenance sales, above our unit growth due to improved pricing that was up approximately 2.5% adjusted for geographical mix and the benefits of strong repair volumes. Modernization sales were up 6.9% with strong growth in Americas, EMEA and China. Modernization sales declined in Asia-Pacific on a tough compare after a strong demand in Southeast Asia in the prior year. Service adjusted operating profit was up $17 million, with 30 basis points of margin expansion, the ninth consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Profit at constant FX was up $40 million, driven by benefit of higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity and partially offset by annual labor cost increases. As we look forward to the balance of the year on Slide 8, we are excluding Russia, both in the current outlook for \u201822 and in prior year comparisons. Overall, organic growth expectations of 3% to 4% are unchanged at the midpoint, with the improvement in service offset by lower new equipment growth expectations. Total company margin expansion of approximately 30 basis points is also consistent with prior expectations. We are raising our outlook for service margin improvement to 70 basis points from 50 basis points previously from better maintenance pricing and drop-through from higher volume. However, this is getting offset by reduced margin expectations in the new equipment segment from increased headwinds on commodities and higher freight costs and the impact from lower volume growth. Overall, adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.22 to $3.27, up 9% to 11% versus the prior year after adjusting for Russia. This strong growth is driven by an increase in operating profit, accretion from the Zardoya transaction and progress on reducing our tax rate and share count. Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9, the new equipment business is projected to be flat to up 1.5%. This is a 1 point decrease from the prior outlook at the midpoint driven by adjustment in sales growth expectations for EMEA and Asia. While the backlog in EMEA is up more than 5%, our customers are requesting postponement of deliveries due to a broader slowdown in building construction activity, pushing shipments from 2022 to 2023. As a result, we now expect EMEA sales to be up low to mid single-digits for 2022. In China, our backlog at the end of Q1 was up 4% from strong orders growth. But the current lockdowns are not only impacting shipments, but are also disrupting the supply chain. While we expect deliveries to pickup starting May, given the supply chain challenges, we are adjusting our 2022 China outlook to be down low single-digits from flat to down 3% previously as some sales moved to the right. Given the lower volume expectations in China, Asia is now expected to be down slightly for the year. Outlook on new equipment organic sales in Americas remains unchanged and is expected to be up low single-digits in 2022. Turning to service, we now expect organic sales to be up 5% to 6%, an improvement from the prior outlook of 4% to 6%, driven by better than expected maintenance pricing and repair orders in the first quarter and higher confidence to execute our modernization backlog from the steps we have taken to resolve the supply chain challenges. Switching to adjusted EPS bridge on Slide 10, we now expect adjusted EPS growth of 9% to 11%, with operating profit growth of $105 million to $155 million at constant currency. This increase of $0.17 to $0.26 versus prior year is driven by strong operational execution, higher volume and favorable pricing. This is partially offset by commodity headwinds, which we now expect to be $110 million for the year, $20 million higher than in the prior outlook and incremental freight costs. We are absorbing these higher commodity and freight costs through increases in productivity and better maintenance pricing. And the midpoint of profit growth expectation at constant FX remains unchanged. Foreign exchange translation is now expected to be an $0.11 headwind versus the prior year and $0.04 worse than the prior outlook, primarily from strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the yen. The euro is now expected to be $1.10 for the year, implying a $1.09 for the balance of the year. The $0.11 FX headwind is more than offset by $0.12 of in-year accretion expected from the Zardoya transaction. This estimate is $0.02 better than the prior outlook from a faster pace of acquisition of shares. The balance of the EPS growth is driven by progress on reducing the adjusted tax rate, now expected to be approximately 27.7% for the year and a lower share count. We have completed $200 million in share repurchases for the year and plan on completing an additional $300 million in the balance of the year at the high end of the prior outlook. This guidance clearly reflects the acceleration of both sales and profit trajectory of the service business from the benefits of investments and our sustained focus on driving productivity. And while the new equipment business is challenged this year due to the current macroeconomic environment, our robust backlog, pricing actions and over $100 million of in-year productivity will ensure that the business recovers sharply once the commodity and the freight headwinds abate. And with that, I will request Latonia to please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. So there is lots of \u2013 lots to talk about. Maybe just to start off with China. What we\u2019re seeing right now in China, obviously, lots of headlines about potentially Beijing locking down? So curious what impact you\u2019re seeing and what we might expect for 2Q?\nJudy Marks: Yes. Good morning, Nigel, it\u2019s Judy. So listen, we had a really strong start to the year, and I\u2019ve got to just applaud our China team for their tenacity and resilience, really good start. New equipment orders up low single digits, backlog up mid-single digits and their portfolio up high teens for the third straight quarter. Our elevator factories are open in China, including our one in Hangzhou, which is outside of Beijing. I confirm that as well as recent as today, but we do \u2013 we\u2019ve seen some challenges with shipments and obviously site access. So what we\u2019ve done is we really expect the second quarter to be lighter due to the COVID lockdowns, and we\u2019ve really adjusted the rest of the year to be down low single digits, mainly from our suppliers needing to restart their operations as well. So this is a kind of full supply chain impact where we manufacture in China, mainly for China. We think it\u2019s a reasonable approach. We\u2019re going to continue to monitor how things come back in China. But again, our elevator our factories are open and the timing of the reopening could push some performance into 2023, and that\u2019s why we think it\u2019s a prudent guide. We revised China new equipment to low single digits down and took our full guide down on new equipment, mainly because of this.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, Judy. That\u2019s great. And then on pricing, we\u2019re seeing strong \u2013 obviously, very strong pricing on \u2013 in service. I think you said 2.6%, if I\u2019m not mistaken. Equipment orders are [still stat] (ph) on pricing. So \u2013 the two questions here is any reason why we shouldn\u2019t expect that kind of cadence on service pricing to continue? And then are we electing to not get price in equipment to maybe gain share \u2013 or is there still a lag impact on the pricing recovery?\nJudy Marks: Yes. So pricing \u2013 let me start with service, Nigel. We\u2019re really pleased. We\u2019re seeing good service pricing increased more than 2 points in Q1, and we expect that to continue. Very strong start on service pricing in the Americas, followed by EMEA. So we still have a mix as China is growing at the high teens in terms of the portfolio, but really pleased that between the volume in the portfolio and the service pricing, that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing such a nice guide in service, and we raised our outlook 5% to 6% growth there. We expect that to continue as the year goes on, and we see no reason not to. We\u2019re exercising our clauses that give us that ability to up our service pricing because of inflation, and our sales folks are being able to realize that price. So, very pleased with that. In terms of new equipment, overall, we\u2019re flat globally. Good performance in Asia and Asia Pacific and EMEA. Americas is flat. We expect America\u2019s new equipment pricing to improve throughout the year, continuing the second half \u201821 trend they had; China is under pressure on pricing and their pricing is down. But overall, we expect to end the year with flat pricing on new equipment.\nNigel Coe: Great. Thank you.\nRahul Ghai: So Nigel, just maybe a point or two to add on China. First thing, what we\u2019ve seen in China, as Judy said, the pricing was a little bit under pressure. But what we are seeing is that the volume business is doing well. That is where we\u2019ve actually gained a little bit of price flattish to up on the volume side. The larger projects is where we are seeing the pressure. So that is where the pressure is coming through. The flip side on China is that the commodity prices in China, unlike the rest of the world are also coming down. So if you look at the rebar steel, that was down close to 10% in Q1 and the hot-rolled coil, which is another commodity that impacts the steel prices are down close to 5% in the second quarter. So the China commodity market is behaving a little bit differently than the rest of the world. So that is why maybe the China pricing trends are a little bit different. So \u2013 but overall, as Judy said, we are kind of flat for the quarter. And for the year, we\u2019re largely expecting that we will mitigate the backlog pricing headwind that we inherited from last year by in-year price increases. So largely, we will be kind of flattish on price for the year.\nNigel Coe: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Steve, your line is open.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, guys. Good morning.\nJudy Marks: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: So on the services business, some of the key stats that you talked about as being pretty positive, the whole attrition recapture. Can you just give a little more detail on those? Just a little bit more like maybe rolling averages on those metrics, those KPIs?\nRahul Ghai: So we typically don\u2019t provide those quarterly, Steve, as you know. But overall, the trends were fairly robust across all 3 \u2013 retention, recapture and conversion. I think we saw global improvements in all three metrics, retention continues to be our, as we\u2019ve discussed previously, continues to be our focus and that improved year-over-year in the quarter, kind of in line with the full year improvement that we saw for all of \u201821. So that trend is good. Recaptures are very strong, especially in China. And as I have said in my prepared remarks, recaptured units exceeded the cancellations in the quarter. So that contributed to our portfolio growth and conversion trends look really good. I mean, again, with China, where we see the maximum opportunity driving the way, and that was a big contributor to the portfolio growth here. So overall, listen, we are very, very pleased with the way things progress. We have, as we said previously, a really, really strong focus on that. And there was a subtle change in what we said, but that\u2019s our portfolio grew more than 3%. So it says the continued traction that we said, we grew 3% last year. And in Q1, it\u2019s more than 3%. So that\u2019s \u2013 so we feel good about the full year growth on service portfolio growth.\nSteve Tusa: I think Schindler said something about a big difference in order volume versus order price in \u2013 specifically in North America, like a double-digit difference. Anything going on there with regards to timing of price increases? Did you guys see that a pretty significant between orders to volume and price in kind of developed markets in North America?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. As we said, our pricing in North America was flattish, right? So North America pricing was flattish. I mean the only part in new equipment where we responded to Nigel\u2019s question, Steve, the only place where we saw a little bit of pressure on price was China, right? So that\u2019s where the rest of the world kind of behaved and we expected North America to improve starting Q1 because the cycle time for \u2013 from proposal to actually booking the order is really long in North America. So we expected Q4, our pricing was down in the Americas, and we always expected that Q1, we will see the sequential improvement, and we did. So that is good. And hopefully, it continues to gain traction as we go through the rest of the year. But in China, the pricing was under a little bit of pressure as previously discussed, and there was a difference between our units booked and the overall revenue growth in China.\nJudy Marks: Yes. Steve, we\u2019re seeing a really strong market in North America. Our orders were up 9.1%. The awards, as Rahul said, were up nearly 25%, which is our leading indicator. Resi, non-resi, but especially multifamily, in North America is just really coming in very strong. 12-month roll in the Americas is 13%. So the market is strong. We\u2019re seeing \u2013 we\u2019re not \u2013 obviously, we have a lag from the time we book till the time we recognize that revenue, but we think that bodes very well for the rest of \u201822 and \u201823.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Great, thanks a lot.\nRahul Ghai: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. First, just kind of on housekeeping on Russia, would you had kind of been anticipating something similar to that $0.06 for 2022 in your original guide? And \u2013 maybe you could just elaborate on what the plan is there? Are you unwinding the business? You\u2019re trying to find somebody to acquire it? I\u2019m just a little unclear what the plan is there actually.\nRahul Ghai: Yes. So let me answer the first part of your question, Jeff, and then I\u2019ll hand it over to Julie for the second part. So we were expecting a little bit of growth in Russia. The markets were strong getting into the year. So we were expecting a little bit of growth in Russia as we got into the year. But for the sake of ease, we kind of took $0.06 out because we can size the number. But in our original guide, we had a little bit of growth coming from Russia. So Judy, maybe you want to take the second part?\nJudy Marks: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Jeff, so I think everyone is aware that we stopped taking new equipment orders and making new investments. We\u2019ve been very public about that in Russia. And really, we are right now evaluating the best ownership structure for the business, whether that\u2019s with us or somewhere else. And that\u2019s why we removed it from the outlook. We really wanted to be able to have a useful comparison. We\u2019re working through our backlog in Russia to try and meet existing customer commitments. Candidly, it is very challenging due to supply chain issues and sanctions. And really, it\u2019s against that backdrop that we\u2019re evaluating options to provide a more certain future for the business. I can\u2019t comment on potential future transactions, but we will update you in due course.\nJeff Sprague: Great, thanks. And then just coming back to service, it\u2019s nice to see the uptick in the margin outlook, and I\u2019m sure some of it is explained by price. I just wonder if you could unpack a little bit more what you\u2019re seeing as it relates to mix and adoption of the IoT offerings across the geographies. You\u2019ve got this outgrowth in China, which would technically be mix negative, right, and the margins are looking better in spite of that. So I just wonder if you could unpack that a little bit more for us. Thank you.\nJudy Marks: Yes. So on Otis ONE, we had a strong start to the year, especially versus last year first quarter and probably \u201820 first quarter. So we\u2019re picking up nice momentum there and we are headed towards our mid-term \u2013 our midterm outlook of 60% of the portfolio covered. We also had some really nice progress in EV bookings, really, which give us another connected product. As we exited the quarter, we had significant EV bookings as well. But we\u2019re really starting to see both the volume pickup and the stickiness, as Rahul said. All three categories are doing better conversion, retension as well as really bringing portfolios, bringing items back to our portfolio. Productivity is strong. It is taking care of any labor increases we\u2019re seeing. And even our apps that we don\u2019t talk about as much anymore, Jeff, have really seen sustained uptick. We\u2019re still rolling them out in some of our Southeast Asia countries as recent as last month. And if you look at the apps, we saw a 20% increase in repair sales booked through the Upgrade app year-over-year. The Tune app, which really gives our mechanics just that ability to use their iPhones to do vibration checking is up more than double same period last year. And we had 50,000 parts ordered, which is up mid-single-digit plus over the year before all using technology. So our mechanics are getting more productive. Otis ONE is adding that ability to be predictive. They have got the ability to see what\u2019s happening with transparency with our customers and we\u2019re seeing actually Otis ONE make a difference in our recaptures when customers come to us, put us back on maintenance because of Otis ONE. So all in all, everything is trending, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got confidence in the service, not just in the revenue side, but it will, with volume, it\u2019s going to fall through and the incrementals are going to be strong.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Nick Housden of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nNick Housden: Yes. Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. My first one is on China. And if I heard you correctly, you said that you grew orders 3% against the market that was down mid-single digits, which seems like a pretty significant outperformance there. So I\u2019m just wondering what exactly the components are? Is it partly because when you talk about the market, you\u2019re including the lower tier cities where maybe the declines have been sharper, whereas your focus is more on the higher tier cities, where my understanding is demand has been holding up a bit better? Or just any color you could give would be helpful there.\nJudy Marks: Yes. Let me start, Rahul, and then I\u2019ll let you add. But we saw a share gain of about 1 point globally, but we saw a share gain clearly in China. We came into the year and we expected our backlog to cover 60% or so of the revenue and the rest for the in-year revenue and the rest would be kind of book-to-bill. We thought that book-to-bill, Nick, would be down 5% to 10%. But what we saw in the first quarter was it was only down 5%. So that was fairly positive. As you look at the first quarter, though, we did well Tier 1 through 4 cities, so it wasn\u2019t just the big Tier 1s. We really did well in Tier 1 to 4, and we grew share there, and we grew share in every vertical, residential, commercial, high-rise and infrastructure. So it was an across-the-board gain in terms of share from our China team, and I think that\u2019s what really led to the up 3% in new equipment orders and the backlog up mid-single now.\nRahul Ghai: And Nick, not a lot to add. I think Judy has kind of covered it. I think we covered verticals. We had share gain in all verticals. And what we saw in the market was the market was down about 5% in the quarter, where we saw the growth \u2013 we saw a growth in industrial and on the infrastructure side. And residential, as you would expect, was down in the quarter just given the policy that we had. So the market \u2013 and the minus 5% that we saw in the market was actually a little bit better than what we would have thought going into the year. We still expect the market to be down 5% to 10% for the year. That estimate has not changed even though some of the metrics have moved around. The construction was up kind of 1% in the quarter. Investment was down a couple of points. The new starts were down, maybe 20% plus in the quarter, but that was a tough compare and then obviously, you had the impact from COVID. But the inventory is kind of holding in China, so the inventory is still at a 3.5 months of inventory. So our estimates for the year on China market growth have not changed. So we\u2019re still expecting minus 5% to minus 10% and with Q1 being down about minus 5%.\nJudy Marks: Yes, I think it\u2019s just execution of strategy, Nick. Our sales coverage is there. We kept A&D about \u2013 our agents and distributors around 2,200. There is been some churn in them as the lower performers are exited and we bring on new for coverage. But our sales coverage actually globally went up about 150 \u2013 about 4%, and even though our SG&A went down significantly. So we\u2019re driving everything and it\u2019s all about executing our strategy.\nNick Housden: That\u2019s great. And then just one more on China and looking at working capital. So you\u2019re expecting the market to be down 5% to 10% this year. And I\u2019m just wondering what the potential impact could be on working capital and specifically in terms of the prepayment position. Should we expect this to move downward at all? Or will it just increase at a slower rate?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. Our business in China did really well on cash last year, Nick. I mean we were up more than 20% over 2020 levels in 2021. And for the year, for 2022, we kind of expect similar level of improvement in free cash flow in China. So last year, if you look at 2021, our receivables were up slightly less than 10% on revenue that was up more than 25%. So we did really well on cash management in China. But obviously, the situation is volatile. We are looking at our payable situation. We are extending some advances to our customers to ensure supply. But at the same time, we are also looking at, okay, where we can, we are stretching the payable terms. So we\u2019re kind of going both ways, managing it on a supplier-by-supplier basis. But overall, listen, the situation, cash in China was good last year, and we expect a similar level of performance in \u201822.\nNick Housden: That\u2019s great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.\nJudy Marks: Hi.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning, Judy. Maybe just switching away from China perhaps to Europe. I thought it was interesting you talked about the kind of pushouts there into 2023. So maybe just a little bit more color, I suppose, on was that a Europe-wide comment? Or are there just particular markets that are being affected and you had very, very strong new equipment orders growth in EMEA in Q1. Just wondered how you\u2019re expecting those European orders to play out over the balance of the year? And when you think about the broader Europe market, the last time they had some kind of GDP downturn, obviously, service price and elevators was under pressure. How you feel the market structure is different today, if at all?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. So as you said, our orders were strong in Europe. And we are seeing \u2013 so the backlog goes up, as I said in my prepared remarks, it was up more than 5%, and the ARPU more than that, clearly. But what we are seeing, Julian, is we are seeing delays in construction activity, and that\u2019s pretty much all the major European \u2013 or most of major Western European markets. So we are seeing that slowdown, which is extending our delivery times from our factories. So that is what we are seeing. And that is the reason we kind of looked at our revenue expectations for the year in EMEA, and we took them down slightly. We were up kind of mid-single digit levels last time if we took them to mid to high this time or low to mid this time. And part of that was obviously Russia coming out because Russia was a faster growth market. So some of that impact was just Russia getting pulled out and some of that was construction. So now we think it\u2019s low to mid. But as you look at the overall construction activity in EMEA, that is kind of holding. So, if you look at the building permit activity that was up 2% to 3% over last year. I think they are expecting that to continue. And so that is where we expect that our orders growth in Europe should be okay for the year. We are not expecting any big slowdown at this point. So, the business seems to be holding up. And all we are seeing is this delay in revenue recognition and the pricing was good as well. So, we saw \u2013 we picked up pricing up low-single digits in EMEA. So overall, the business is doing well, except for the slowdown in construction that\u2019s impacting us.\nJudy Marks: Yes, it\u2019s not a demand issue, Julian, it\u2019s just a delay in the delivery and the recognition of revenue.\nJulian Mitchell: Understood. Thank you. And then just on the operating profit line. So, I think your adjusted profit at constant currency was up $29 million in Q1 year-on-year. And the year as a whole, you are guiding up around $130 million. So, you are sort of just taking it looks like the Q1 increase and sort of times it by four across the quarters. I wonder if there was any kind of cadence on that profit development to call out or it really is as simple as sort of $30 million, $35 million increase every quarter? And then specifically on that point, you mentioned the cost inflation headwind of $110 million for the year. How \u2013 what was that in Q1? How do we think about that in the second half, the $110 million?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. So, let me start with the second part of your question first, Julian, and then I will get to the first part of the question. So, overall commodity headwinds is about 110 for the year, about $38 million in the first quarter, similar levels expected in second quarter. And what has shifted from the last estimate is clearly, we are expecting a little bit of a headwind in the second half of the year, which was not in our prior expectation that that\u2019s driven by the higher energy prices in Europe that are driving aluminum costs and also some of the steel prices in Europe have gone up. And same thing in North America, we have seen commodity pricing moving higher in North America as well, offset to some extent by lower prices in China. So, commodity headwinds $110 million for the year, about $76 million in the first half, the balance in the second half of the year. Now, in terms of cadence, you are right, I mean what we saw \u2013 you can think it\u2019s kind of a run rate. But what you are seeing, obviously, the earnings in new equipment were pressured in the first quarter because of the higher commodity headwinds. And we are expecting kind of similar level of pressure on new equipment earnings in the second quarter. So, the margins in new equipment on a year-over-year basis are going to look very similar in the second quarter as they did in the first quarter. So, the margin expectations in new equipment first quarter, second quarter are going to be similar. And if you look at our full year margin guide, that is more or less in line with the first quarter margin guide. So, we are not expecting a huge acceleration in new equipment margins and maybe that\u2019s a little bit conservative as we get into the second half. Maybe there is a little bit of tailwind. But given all the uncertainty, we felt that, okay, holding the margins kind of sequentially flat to Q1 levels was appropriate. Now, as you move to service though, on the other side, we do expect acceleration of margins in the Service segment. And the biggest driver of that, a, obviously, sequential revenue growth in service that comes through a high drop-through. But also, if you go back to Q1 of last year, we still had the impact from COVID. So, in Q1 of this year, we had some of the costs coming back that were not there in Q1 of last year. So, we absorbed that incremental cost and yet grew margins. So, as we get into the second to the fourth quarter, that headwind is not there, and that helps us drive higher service margins. So, that\u2019s the underlying cover. But as you look overall, obviously, a good start to the year. And we expect Q2 is the same, we expect to grow revenue in the second quarter and then EPS on a year-over-year basis and on a sequential basis, should be up as well in the second quarter.\nJudy Marks: Julian, the only other thing I would add is what we saw in repair in the first quarter was very positive, which shows even in the regions where people are concerned about office populations, we are seeing elevator usage pick up in the \u2013 really in the commercial side of the business as well. And our repair business certainly indicated that in Q1. That\u2019s going to help drive this \u2013 again, this margin expansion in service as we go through Q2 through Q4.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nRahul Ghai: Thanks Julian.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Joe O\u2019day of Wells Fargo. Joe, your line is open.\nJoe O\u2019day: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to a comment, I think last quarter, just talking about the cadence around Americas. And I think Judy, you had mentioned that there were some larger projects in Americas that were \u2013 you were kind of scheduled for back half of the year. I just wanted to kind of check in on that, see if those time lines are still kind of going according to plan.\nJudy Marks: Yes. Joe, good morning, they are. I mean, we had secured some large projects in \u201821 and that will actually not just be second half of this year, will be more strong in early \u201823. And that\u2019s still consistent. Those projects are all on schedule. So, what we said last quarter still holds.\nJoe O\u2019day: Got it. And then it looks like there was a $20 million cut to CapEx guide. How much of that is Russia related? How much of that is other factors?\nRahul Ghai: Yes, some impact from Russia, but we are just looking at calibrating the full year. So, that\u2019s what we did. So, just nothing major things move around all the time. There is not a big cut in any one line, but there is some definitely some impact from lower investments in Russia. But overall, it\u2019s just kind of minor tweaking in different lines.\nJoe O\u2019day: And then maybe just a clarification on service price, the pricing you got in the quarter, how much of that was contractual just on kind of escalators? How much of that was maybe a little bit more proactive on activity levels?\nJudy Marks: Well, it all takes activity. So, even though we have those clauses in the contract, they don\u2019t automatically happen at a renewal unless we can enforce it and sell the value of what we are doing. So, our sales force had to go out and basically make all of that happen. So, there was nothing that would just happen automatically, mechanically or commercially. So, it was all make happen, and the team did a great job explaining how we had additional costs and how it\u2019s appropriate for those to flow through on price.\nJoe O\u2019day: Got it. Thanks very much.\nJudy Marks: Yes. Thanks Joe.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Your line is open.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific. Thank you very much and nice results. And so just follow-up on Jeff\u2019s question. I mean we have terrible relations with Russia. The numbers weren\u2019t bad, but presumably going forward, are you concerned that basically, there will be any sort of penalties put on you or operating difficulties as a result of being a U.S. company. And what should we think about the ultimate exit? I mean are you going to be able to get your bat back, or are they basically going to squeeze you, so it ends up being a loss.\nJudy Marks: Well, Cai, I think it\u2019s important to reinforce that we are following all sanctions that have been imposed by the U.S., the UK and \u2013 so we are following all of those rules. We provide an important life safety service everywhere in the world, especially in our service business. So, we are \u2013 obviously, we are evaluating who should be or could be the rightful owner of this asset, and that\u2019s the evaluation we are under. We will share more as we learn more, but we will have to see where that evolves.\nCai von Rumohr: Got it. Thank you. And then turning to your service population, so could \u2013 you were up, obviously, I think you said high teens in China, which looks like it suggests the rest of the world was up 1.5%, 1.8%. Could you give us some color on the service population growth in each of the other three areas as well as some comment in terms of the growth versus how much from conversion, what was the retention loss? And what was the recapture in M&A? Thanks.\nRahul Ghai: Yes. No, it was \u2013 as we said, overall, Cai, good growth globally, obviously, strong growth in China. And the other emerging markets in Asia did well as well, but we did grow our portfolio in both Europe and the Americas as well. Obviously, they are lower growth economies. And so they contribute a lower amount because the growth is clearly happening in Asia, but it was a global improvement with improvement in all four regions. And then your second question on conversion. I think the conversion rates obviously moved up a lot overall throughout the world, but especially with the improvement in China kind of driving that, and that is where we expect most of the improvement to come. And the cancellation rate is good. I mean we keep making progress and the fact is that we make, especially in the where that is really important is in the more mature markets, in the U.S. and in the Western European economies. And that is where if you look at our improvement this year, that is we saw \u2013 that is where we saw the maximum improvement in our retention rates. Both Europe and U.S. did really well, or Europe and Americas did really well on improving the retention rates. And that is what we really need to see because that also drives price because that\u2019s \u2013 losing that portfolio hurts us the most. And by improving our retention rate, that drives incremental price and incremental margin. But overall, really pleased with the progress we are making globally.\nJudy Marks: Yes. And Cai, we were 1% 2 years ago. Actually, in 2020, we were 2% portfolio growth. 1% in \u201819, 2% in \u201820, 3% last year. We said we would be 3%-plus. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving, again, everything we have said that to drive that portfolio is the key to our service success, and we just had our fifth consecutive quarter of service organic sales growth and our ninth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating profit growth in our Service segment, So, this and growth in every region this quarter on the portfolio. So, that\u2019s what we need to continue to see going forward. That\u2019s what our team is focused on.\nCai von Rumohr: I get that, but you give projections for everything else, obviously, if \u2013 you mentioned how well China is doing. If China continues at upper teens, even at mid-teens as it\u2019s getting bigger, that has some leverage on the rest. So, what\u2019s the potential that you could be close to the 3.5% for the full year?\nRahul Ghai: Definitely. Yes. I mean our expectation, I think we said it just post Investor Day, Cai, that we see portfolio growth hedging \u2013 continue to improve, and there is a clear line of sight at some point to this portfolio growth, starting with maybe a four and then maybe even going up from there. But we take this in small steps and every quarter is a dot point on the board that \u2013 and all these dot points make up a trend. So, I think that\u2019s what Judy kind of alluded to, just kind of the sequential improvement. And I think we are putting another dot point on the board with this quarter. And we are hoping that by the time we end the year, this number starts with a four, but we are not there yet. So, we will keep marching forward.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning and I appreciate you taking the questions.\nJudy Marks: Thanks John.\nJohn Walsh: Maybe just first on pricing, can you just remind us kind of historical cycles, the ability to hold on to the pricing you have been pushing through? And I guess, the question really focuses around is this all still strategic, or is some portion of this kind of a surcharge that as we get maybe some lack of inflation at some point gets given back to the customer?\nRahul Ghai: So, most of our price increases are structural. There are surcharges kind of built into that number, because as we have discussed previously, we have escalator clauses, which are tied to overall inflation in the economy. So, that gets captured on the maintenance side, so nothing unusual in the quarter. We should be keeping this entire price increase. Obviously, it\u2019s all market-dependent, and a large portion of our portfolio comes up for renewal in the first quarter, but not all of it. So, we will keep kind of guiding to you guys as the year goes on, how this moves forward. So, that\u2019s point number one. And the second part is \u2013 and then obviously, on the new equipment side, it is once you kind of sign the contract, it\u2019s there. So, I think on both sides, there is no reason to give any of this price increase back. On repair, where we kind of do more break/fix work, there are some surcharges that we add based on the travel that we need to do. So, that is where we do add a surcharge based on travel. But on maintenance and new equipment, there is nothing unusual about the price increases we are just kind of pushing through, and we should be retaining all of it.\nJohn Walsh: Great. And then maybe as a follow-on to that, just thinking about capital allocation, every once in a while, you get some noise around a larger asset, either in Asia or Europe. Can you just remind us kind of where doing something larger kind of fits within your capital allocation strategy of share repurchase, dividends, smaller bolt-ons?\nJudy Marks: Sure. So, we talk about the smaller bolt-ons at about the $50 million-ish kind of level a year. As you can see when something is attractive like Zardoya Otis, we didn\u2019t hesitate. And kudos to our team for just executing that with excellence with the squeeze out occurring. So, we will be the full owner and delist in the next week or two weeks. So, we are always looking for an opportunity. We think we are at a really good leverage point right now. We are still investment grade. We were able to keep that as well as repaying. We repaid $0.5 billion of debt in the first quarter after $350 million in \u201820 and $450 million in debt in \u201821. So, we are keeping the debt kind of where we want it. Our gross debt is at about $6.75 billion right now, and we think that\u2019s a good place. And if a large strategic opportunity comes up, whether it\u2019s in Europe or Asia or in the Americas, we are going to \u2013 we are obviously interested and we are going to evaluate it because the large generation type opportunities don\u2019t happen that often in this industry. So, we are making sure we have got the flexibility on the balance sheet to do that. In the interim, the cash we generate in-year, we plan on returning to our shareholders. We raised our dividend late last week, a little over 20%. And now that\u2019s 45% over 2 years, and already bought back $200 million of shares in the first quarter. As Rahul said, we are going to do another $300 million. So, we will be at $500 million for this year. And our Board reauthorized $1 billion cap for us to do that. So, we are going to share with our shareholders until \u2013 and keep our ability to do strategic acquisitions when they arise.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thank you very much.\nJudy Marks: Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Joel Spungin of Berenberg. Your line is open.\nJoel Spungin: Good. Good morning.\nJudy Marks: Hi Joel.\nJoel Spungin: Hi. On Russia, if I could start there. Just \u2013 I just want \u2013 I can\u2019t see the number in the presentation or the release, maybe I have missed it. Have you actually said what your operating assets in Russia is and if there is a level of any outstanding receivables or working capital there?\nRahul Ghai: Yes. Overall, we did not disclose that, Joel. But overall, our asset base in Russia is not huge. We are \u2013 we typically do get advances from our customers in everywhere in the world before we get a new equipment order. And Russia is, call it, 80% new equipment. So, our \u2013 we are actually in a negative working capital position in Russia. So, as and when something happens, obviously, we will update the accounting, but we don\u2019t expect a big asset write-off. There could be some other charges that we will have to evaluate as time goes on, but we don\u2019t expect a big asset right off to come from anything that Judy mentioned earlier.\nJoel Spungin: Great. Okay. Thank you for that. And then can I just ask about just looking at the numbers on Slide 28. But then is this right, the adjusted operating profit margin in Russia on new equipment was 18%, and that seems incredibly high.\nRahul Ghai: So, just keep in mind, Joel, yes, it is high. And the reason for that is twofold. One, obviously, the biggest reason for that is that we don\u2019t do a lot of installation in Russia. We sell the equipment through our factory to people who actually install it. So therefore, that just drives higher margins because what you \u2013 if you look at our industry, we made more money on selling the equipment and the installation part is lower profit. So, that is what you see in Russia because we don\u2019t do a lot of installation that comes through. And obviously, there are some other adjustments that go through as well anytime you try and pull a business out. But the biggest driver of that is just the nature of our business in Russia.\nJoel Spungin: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just one quick question on China. And thank you for the detail on how you are doing there and on the outlook there. I was just wondering to what extent I think you talked about the market being down mid-single sort of now your current thinking. Are you able to say sort of implicitly within that, what your assumptions are about sort of normalization some of the challenges you are seeing in Russia. Are you assuming that things get back together back to something approaching normality by the middle of the year, or do you just assume that they stay roughly as they are?\nRahul Ghai: Joel, your question is on China, whether we see the market getting back to normal in China?\nJoel Spungin: Well, actually, more when you see supply chains and some of the disruption that you have seen they are normalizing.\nRahul Ghai: Yes. So, we are \u2013 obviously, Q2 is going to be tough, right. I mean we \u2013 obviously, we are expecting the lockdowns to kind of end mid-April, but they have now extended. So, we will see how. So Q2, we are still expecting to resume delivery starting May. So, that\u2019s still part of the expectation. But obviously, we will keep monitoring that. We think from our own delivery standpoint, we should be able to catch up as we get into Q3 and Q4 because we saw that just post-COVID, after the lockdowns, we had a really, really strong Q2 in Russia in 2019 \u2013 sorry, in China. We saw a really strong bounce back in China in Q2 of 2019. And we expect that as soon as the lockdowns lift, we should be able to recover. But the supply chain part is a little bit more uncertain for us because that we don\u2019t control directly, and that was the reason for taking down our guide, as Judy said earlier. So, we have adjusted our guide, reflecting more of the supply chain issues and potential some conversion challenges with job sites and other places. But from our own factory standpoint, we are pretty confident that as soon as the lockdowns lift, we are ready to go.\nJoel Spungin: Understood. Thank you very much.\nRahul Ghai: Thank you.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the conference back to Judy Marks for closing remarks.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Latonia. So to summarize, we had a strong first quarter and continue to make progress on our strategic priorities while weathering macroeconomic challenges. We recognize the work left to be done to continue building on our track record of resiliency and strong execution. We are confident we will do just that and deliver 10% adjusted EPS growth in 2022 with continued momentum in 2023 and beyond. Thank you for joining our call, and please stay safe and well.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Judy Marks",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike and thank you everyone for joining us. We hope that everyone listening is safe and well. We had a strong start to the year, reflected in our financial results and in the progress made on our balanced capital allocation strategy. We grew organic sales, expanded margins and achieved high single-digit adjusted EPS growth, while driving growth in all regions in new equipment orders and our maintenance portfolio. Our service business experienced favorable pricing and grew revenue, margins and adjusted operating profit. In addition, we generated nearly $0.5 billion in free cash flow while continuing to return the majority of our cash generated to shareholders. In Q1, we completed $200 million in share repurchases and received Board approval of a $1 billion share repurchase authorization. In April, we announced a 20.8% increase to our quarterly dividend, while acquiring the remaining interest in Zardoya Otis. After settlement of the tender offer in mid-April, we now have over 95% ownership of Zardoya Otis and expect to automatically delist it in early May. Timing was better than our prior expectations and is expected to add another $0.02 of EPS accretion in 2022. This progress sets us up well for the remainder of 2022 and beyond. New equipment orders were up 8.8% in the quarter with growth in all regions, leading to approximately 1 point of new equipment share gain on top of close to 2 points of share gain since 2020. In Korea, Otis was selected to provide more than 70 Gen 2 units to the Yonghyun Xi Crest apartment complex in Incheon, Korea. Otis Gen 2 elevators equipped with ReGen drive technology that can deliver substantial energy savings will serve more than 2,200 apartment units. This is our latest project in the region with GS Engineering & Construction and further strengthens our 20-year collaboration with them. In China, we received an order to support the next phase of the Shenzhen Metro project extending more than two decades of collaboration with the installation of nearly 1,000 units to-date. In this phase, we will provide more than 350 IoT-enabled elevators and escalators. This award marks another milestone in our digitalization journey in China and allows us to continue delivering the benefits of Otis ONE's predictive maintenance to our customers. In addition to executing on our financial priorities, we remain committed to advancing our ESG initiatives and published our inaugural ESG report in Q1. This report reflects the focus we have placed and progress we have made on reducing our carbon footprint, creating a safe, equitable and inclusive work environment, supporting the communities around us and maintaining best-in-class governance practices. Moving to Slide 4, Q1 results and 2022 outlook. New equipment orders in the first quarter were up 8.8% at constant currency and up 10.9% on a rolling 12-month basis, contributing to backlog growth of 6% versus prior year. Organic sales were up 3.1% due to the strength in our service business, which was up 5.8%. Adjusted operating profit was up $29 million at constant currency and up $9 million at actual currency, with margin expansion of 30 basis points, driven by strong performance in the service business as well as some benefit from segment mix. Free cash flow was robust at $474 million at 152% conversion of GAAP net income. A few additional updates before I begin our revised 2022 outlook. In April, the agreement between the National Elevator Bargaining Association and the International Union of Elevator Constructors was ratified. This collective bargaining agreement covers the majority of Otis' U.S. field colleagues and will become effective this July with wage increases taking effect in January of 2023. We believe this 5-year agreement is fair and equitable to both parties with the annual increases generally in line with historical trends. And like in private years, we expect to fully offset this cost through increased productivity as we upscale and continue to develop this essential workforce. In addition, we are disheartened to see the escalation of the crisis in Ukraine. We have growing concerns about the long-term sustainability of Otis' operations in Russia, especially with mounting regulations and supply chain disruptions. As a result, we are motivated to find solutions and explore alternatives for our Russia business that are in the best interest of all of our stakeholders. We remain hopeful for return to peace and stability in the region and we will continue to contribute to the ongoing relief and humanitarian efforts necessary for those most impacted by this crisis. Looking ahead to our 2022 outlook, given the wide range of outcomes and the process that we are undergoing, we have removed Otis' Russian operations from the current outlook as well as in the prior year compares. This adjustment will largely impact the new equipment business. Rahul will walk through this in more detail and a reconciliation of Otis' results, excluding Russia for the last five quarters can be found in the appendix of this webcast. For the year, excluding Russia, we expect organic sales growth of 3% to 4% with net sales in the range of $14.1 billion to $14.3 billion. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be in a range of $2.2 billion to $2.25 billion, up $105 million to $155 million, excluding the impacts from foreign exchange. At actual currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be in the $40 million to $90 million. Adjusted EPS is expected in the range of $3.22 to $3.27, up 9% to 11% versus the prior year. Lastly, we still expect free cash flow to be robust at approximately $1.6 billion or approximately 120% conversion of GAAP net income. We remain disciplined in our capital allocation strategy. And in addition to increasing our ownership in Zardoya Otis, we will continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and advance our bolt-on M&A strategy where it makes sense and adds to the density of our growing service portfolio. With that, I will turn it over to Rahul to walk through our Q1 results and 2022 outlook in more detail. Yes. Good morning, Nigel, it's Judy. So listen, we had a really strong start to the year, and I've got to just applaud our China team for their tenacity and resilience, really good start. New equipment orders up low single digits, backlog up mid-single digits and their portfolio up high teens for the third straight quarter. Our elevator factories are open in China, including our one in Hangzhou, which is outside of Beijing. I confirm that as well as recent as today, but we do \u2013 we've seen some challenges with shipments and obviously site access. So what we've done is we really expect the second quarter to be lighter due to the COVID lockdowns, and we've really adjusted the rest of the year to be down low single digits, mainly from our suppliers needing to restart their operations as well. So this is a kind of full supply chain impact where we manufacture in China, mainly for China. We think it's a reasonable approach. We're going to continue to monitor how things come back in China. But again, our elevator our factories are open and the timing of the reopening could push some performance into 2023, and that's why we think it's a prudent guide. We revised China new equipment to low single digits down and took our full guide down on new equipment, mainly because of this. Yes. So pricing \u2013 let me start with service, Nigel. We're really pleased. We're seeing good service pricing increased more than 2 points in Q1, and we expect that to continue. Very strong start on service pricing in the Americas, followed by EMEA. So we still have a mix as China is growing at the high teens in terms of the portfolio, but really pleased that between the volume in the portfolio and the service pricing, that's why we're seeing such a nice guide in service, and we raised our outlook 5% to 6% growth there. We expect that to continue as the year goes on, and we see no reason not to. We're exercising our clauses that give us that ability to up our service pricing because of inflation, and our sales folks are being able to realize that price. So, very pleased with that. In terms of new equipment, overall, we're flat globally. Good performance in Asia and Asia Pacific and EMEA. Americas is flat. We expect America's new equipment pricing to improve throughout the year, continuing the second half \u201821 trend they had; China is under pressure on pricing and their pricing is down. But overall, we expect to end the year with flat pricing on new equipment. Good morning, Steve. Yes. Steve, we're seeing a really strong market in North America. Our orders were up 9.1%. The awards, as Rahul said, were up nearly 25%, which is our leading indicator. Resi, non-resi, but especially multifamily, in North America is just really coming in very strong. 12-month roll in the Americas is 13%. So the market is strong. We're seeing \u2013 we're not \u2013 obviously, we have a lag from the time we book till the time we recognize that revenue, but we think that bodes very well for the rest of \u201822 and \u201823. Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Jeff, so I think everyone is aware that we stopped taking new equipment orders and making new investments. We've been very public about that in Russia. And really, we are right now evaluating the best ownership structure for the business, whether that's with us or somewhere else. And that's why we removed it from the outlook. We really wanted to be able to have a useful comparison. We're working through our backlog in Russia to try and meet existing customer commitments. Candidly, it is very challenging due to supply chain issues and sanctions. And really, it's against that backdrop that we're evaluating options to provide a more certain future for the business. I can't comment on potential future transactions, but we will update you in due course. Yes. So on Otis ONE, we had a strong start to the year, especially versus last year first quarter and probably \u201820 first quarter. So we're picking up nice momentum there and we are headed towards our mid-term \u2013 our midterm outlook of 60% of the portfolio covered. We also had some really nice progress in EV bookings, really, which give us another connected product. As we exited the quarter, we had significant EV bookings as well. But we're really starting to see both the volume pickup and the stickiness, as Rahul said. All three categories are doing better conversion, retension as well as really bringing portfolios, bringing items back to our portfolio. Productivity is strong. It is taking care of any labor increases we're seeing. And even our apps that we don't talk about as much anymore, Jeff, have really seen sustained uptick. We're still rolling them out in some of our Southeast Asia countries as recent as last month. And if you look at the apps, we saw a 20% increase in repair sales booked through the Upgrade app year-over-year. The Tune app, which really gives our mechanics just that ability to use their iPhones to do vibration checking is up more than double same period last year. And we had 50,000 parts ordered, which is up mid-single-digit plus over the year before all using technology. So our mechanics are getting more productive. Otis ONE is adding that ability to be predictive. They have got the ability to see what's happening with transparency with our customers and we're seeing actually Otis ONE make a difference in our recaptures when customers come to us, put us back on maintenance because of Otis ONE. So all in all, everything is trending, and that's why we've got confidence in the service, not just in the revenue side, but it will, with volume, it's going to fall through and the incrementals are going to be strong. Yes. Let me start, Rahul, and then I'll let you add. But we saw a share gain of about 1 point globally, but we saw a share gain clearly in China. We came into the year and we expected our backlog to cover 60% or so of the revenue and the rest for the in-year revenue and the rest would be kind of book-to-bill. We thought that book-to-bill, Nick, would be down 5% to 10%. But what we saw in the first quarter was it was only down 5%. So that was fairly positive. As you look at the first quarter, though, we did well Tier 1 through 4 cities, so it wasn't just the big Tier 1s. We really did well in Tier 1 to 4, and we grew share there, and we grew share in every vertical, residential, commercial, high-rise and infrastructure. So it was an across-the-board gain in terms of share from our China team, and I think that's what really led to the up 3% in new equipment orders and the backlog up mid-single now. Yes, I think it's just execution of strategy, Nick. Our sales coverage is there. We kept A&D about \u2013 our agents and distributors around 2,200. There is been some churn in them as the lower performers are exited and we bring on new for coverage. But our sales coverage actually globally went up about 150 \u2013 about 4%, and even though our SG&A went down significantly. So we're driving everything and it's all about executing our strategy. Hi. Yes, it's not a demand issue, Julian, it's just a delay in the delivery and the recognition of revenue. Julian, the only other thing I would add is what we saw in repair in the first quarter was very positive, which shows even in the regions where people are concerned about office populations, we are seeing elevator usage pick up in the \u2013 really in the commercial side of the business as well. And our repair business certainly indicated that in Q1. That's going to help drive this \u2013 again, this margin expansion in service as we go through Q2 through Q4. Yes. Joe, good morning, they are. I mean, we had secured some large projects in \u201821 and that will actually not just be second half of this year, will be more strong in early \u201823. And that's still consistent. Those projects are all on schedule. So, what we said last quarter still holds. Well, it all takes activity. So, even though we have those clauses in the contract, they don't automatically happen at a renewal unless we can enforce it and sell the value of what we are doing. So, our sales force had to go out and basically make all of that happen. So, there was nothing that would just happen automatically, mechanically or commercially. So, it was all make happen, and the team did a great job explaining how we had additional costs and how it's appropriate for those to flow through on price. Yes. Thanks Joe. Well, Cai, I think it's important to reinforce that we are following all sanctions that have been imposed by the U.S., the UK and \u2013 so we are following all of those rules. We provide an important life safety service everywhere in the world, especially in our service business. So, we are \u2013 obviously, we are evaluating who should be or could be the rightful owner of this asset, and that's the evaluation we are under. We will share more as we learn more, but we will have to see where that evolves. Yes. And Cai, we were 1% 2 years ago. Actually, in 2020, we were 2% portfolio growth. 1% in \u201819, 2% in \u201820, 3% last year. We said we would be 3%-plus. That's what's driving, again, everything we have said that to drive that portfolio is the key to our service success, and we just had our fifth consecutive quarter of service organic sales growth and our ninth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating profit growth in our Service segment, So, this and growth in every region this quarter on the portfolio. So, that's what we need to continue to see going forward. That's what our team is focused on. Thanks John. Sure. So, we talk about the smaller bolt-ons at about the $50 million-ish kind of level a year. As you can see when something is attractive like Zardoya Otis, we didn't hesitate. And kudos to our team for just executing that with excellence with the squeeze out occurring. So, we will be the full owner and delist in the next week or two weeks. So, we are always looking for an opportunity. We think we are at a really good leverage point right now. We are still investment grade. We were able to keep that as well as repaying. We repaid $0.5 billion of debt in the first quarter after $350 million in \u201820 and $450 million in debt in \u201821. So, we are keeping the debt kind of where we want it. Our gross debt is at about $6.75 billion right now, and we think that's a good place. And if a large strategic opportunity comes up, whether it's in Europe or Asia or in the Americas, we are going to \u2013 we are obviously interested and we are going to evaluate it because the large generation type opportunities don't happen that often in this industry. So, we are making sure we have got the flexibility on the balance sheet to do that. In the interim, the cash we generate in-year, we plan on returning to our shareholders. We raised our dividend late last week, a little over 20%. And now that's 45% over 2 years, and already bought back $200 million of shares in the first quarter. As Rahul said, we are going to do another $300 million. So, we will be at $500 million for this year. And our Board reauthorized $1 billion cap for us to do that. So, we are going to share with our shareholders until \u2013 and keep our ability to do strategic acquisitions when they arise. Thank you. Hi Joel. Thank you, Latonia. So to summarize, we had a strong first quarter and continue to make progress on our strategic priorities while weathering macroeconomic challenges. We recognize the work left to be done to continue building on our track record of resiliency and strong execution. We are confident we will do just that and deliver 10% adjusted EPS growth in 2022 with continued momentum in 2023 and beyond. Thank you for joining our call, and please stay safe and well."

            "name": "Rahul Ghai",
            "content": "Thank you, Judy and good morning everyone. Starting with first quarter results on Slide 5, net sales were up 0.2% to $3.4 billion. Organic sales grew for the sixth consecutive quarter, up 3.1% driven by service sales, which increased nearly 6%. Adjusted operating profit was up $9 million and up $29 million at constant currency as the drop-through on higher service volume, favorable service pricing, productivity in both segments and lower bad debt expense was partially offset by commodity headwinds and annual labor cost increases. We also maintained our unrelenting focus on cost containment and adjusted SG&A expense was down $17 million versus the prior year and down 60 basis points as a percentage of sales despite the inflationary trends in the economy. R&D trend and other strategic investments were flat versus the prior year. Given the strong cash flow and progress on repatriation, we completed our deleveraging and repurchased $200 million of shares in the quarter. Overall, growth in operating profit, reduction in share count and continued progress on reducing the tax rate resulted in first quarter adjusted EPS growth of 6.9%. Moving to Slide 6, new equipment orders were up 8.8% at constant currency, with growth in all regions. Orders momentum remained strong in Asia, up mid single-digits with about 10% growth in Asia, ex-China. China orders were up 3%, the eighth consecutive quarter of orders growth in the country and outgrew the market that was down mid single-digits. Orders in America were up high single-digit and awards, which precede order bookings, were up nearly 25% in North America, signaling continued strong demand. EMEA orders were up 17% with growth in both Europe and the Middle East. Strong orders growth contributed to total company backlog increasing 4% and 6% at constant currency, with growth in all regions, including approximately 6% growth in Asia. In addition, global proposal volume was up low teens with more than 25% growth in China, demonstrating robust market activity and the benefits of increased sales coverage. Globally, pricing on new equipment orders was about flat in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. New equipment organic sales were down 0.5% in the quarter. EMEA was up mid single-digits, but this was offset by a low single-digit decline in both Americas and Asia. Americas declined due to a tough compare from COVID recovery in the prior year. And in Asia, China was impacted by job site closures towards the end of the quarter. Adjusted operating profit was down $12 million, partially from the impact of lower volume. Commodity inflation of $38 million that was in line with prior expectations was largely mitigated by installation and material productivity and lower bad debt expense. Service segment results on Slide 7, maintenance portfolio units were up more than 3% from broad-based improvements in retention, recapture and conversion rates, with recaptured units more than offsetting cancellations in the quarter. In China, conversion rates continued to improve and contributed to third consecutive quarter of high-teens portfolio growth. Modernization orders were down about 6% in the quarter, but are up close to 6% on a rolling 12-month basis, driving backlog growth of 3% versus the prior year. Service organic sales grew for the fifth consecutive quarter, up 5.8% with growth in all lines of business. Maintenance and repair grew 5.6%, with mid single-digit growth in contractual maintenance sales, above our unit growth due to improved pricing that was up approximately 2.5% adjusted for geographical mix and the benefits of strong repair volumes. Modernization sales were up 6.9% with strong growth in Americas, EMEA and China. Modernization sales declined in Asia-Pacific on a tough compare after a strong demand in Southeast Asia in the prior year. Service adjusted operating profit was up $17 million, with 30 basis points of margin expansion, the ninth consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Profit at constant FX was up $40 million, driven by benefit of higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity and partially offset by annual labor cost increases. As we look forward to the balance of the year on Slide 8, we are excluding Russia, both in the current outlook for \u201822 and in prior year comparisons. Overall, organic growth expectations of 3% to 4% are unchanged at the midpoint, with the improvement in service offset by lower new equipment growth expectations. Total company margin expansion of approximately 30 basis points is also consistent with prior expectations. We are raising our outlook for service margin improvement to 70 basis points from 50 basis points previously from better maintenance pricing and drop-through from higher volume. However, this is getting offset by reduced margin expectations in the new equipment segment from increased headwinds on commodities and higher freight costs and the impact from lower volume growth. Overall, adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.22 to $3.27, up 9% to 11% versus the prior year after adjusting for Russia. This strong growth is driven by an increase in operating profit, accretion from the Zardoya transaction and progress on reducing our tax rate and share count. Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9, the new equipment business is projected to be flat to up 1.5%. This is a 1 point decrease from the prior outlook at the midpoint driven by adjustment in sales growth expectations for EMEA and Asia. While the backlog in EMEA is up more than 5%, our customers are requesting postponement of deliveries due to a broader slowdown in building construction activity, pushing shipments from 2022 to 2023. As a result, we now expect EMEA sales to be up low to mid single-digits for 2022. In China, our backlog at the end of Q1 was up 4% from strong orders growth. But the current lockdowns are not only impacting shipments, but are also disrupting the supply chain. While we expect deliveries to pickup starting May, given the supply chain challenges, we are adjusting our 2022 China outlook to be down low single-digits from flat to down 3% previously as some sales moved to the right. Given the lower volume expectations in China, Asia is now expected to be down slightly for the year. Outlook on new equipment organic sales in Americas remains unchanged and is expected to be up low single-digits in 2022. Turning to service, we now expect organic sales to be up 5% to 6%, an improvement from the prior outlook of 4% to 6%, driven by better than expected maintenance pricing and repair orders in the first quarter and higher confidence to execute our modernization backlog from the steps we have taken to resolve the supply chain challenges. Switching to adjusted EPS bridge on Slide 10, we now expect adjusted EPS growth of 9% to 11%, with operating profit growth of $105 million to $155 million at constant currency. This increase of $0.17 to $0.26 versus prior year is driven by strong operational execution, higher volume and favorable pricing. This is partially offset by commodity headwinds, which we now expect to be $110 million for the year, $20 million higher than in the prior outlook and incremental freight costs. We are absorbing these higher commodity and freight costs through increases in productivity and better maintenance pricing. And the midpoint of profit growth expectation at constant FX remains unchanged. Foreign exchange translation is now expected to be an $0.11 headwind versus the prior year and $0.04 worse than the prior outlook, primarily from strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the yen. The euro is now expected to be $1.10 for the year, implying a $1.09 for the balance of the year. The $0.11 FX headwind is more than offset by $0.12 of in-year accretion expected from the Zardoya transaction. This estimate is $0.02 better than the prior outlook from a faster pace of acquisition of shares. The balance of the EPS growth is driven by progress on reducing the adjusted tax rate, now expected to be approximately 27.7% for the year and a lower share count. We have completed $200 million in share repurchases for the year and plan on completing an additional $300 million in the balance of the year at the high end of the prior outlook. This guidance clearly reflects the acceleration of both sales and profit trajectory of the service business from the benefits of investments and our sustained focus on driving productivity. And while the new equipment business is challenged this year due to the current macroeconomic environment, our robust backlog, pricing actions and over $100 million of in-year productivity will ensure that the business recovers sharply once the commodity and the freight headwinds abate. And with that, I will request Latonia to please open the line for questions. So Nigel, just maybe a point or two to add on China. First thing, what we've seen in China, as Judy said, the pricing was a little bit under pressure. But what we are seeing is that the volume business is doing well. That is where we've actually gained a little bit of price flattish to up on the volume side. The larger projects is where we are seeing the pressure. So that is where the pressure is coming through. The flip side on China is that the commodity prices in China, unlike the rest of the world are also coming down. So if you look at the rebar steel, that was down close to 10% in Q1 and the hot-rolled coil, which is another commodity that impacts the steel prices are down close to 5% in the second quarter. So the China commodity market is behaving a little bit differently than the rest of the world. So that is why maybe the China pricing trends are a little bit different. So \u2013 but overall, as Judy said, we are kind of flat for the quarter. And for the year, we're largely expecting that we will mitigate the backlog pricing headwind that we inherited from last year by in-year price increases. So largely, we will be kind of flattish on price for the year. So we typically don't provide those quarterly, Steve, as you know. But overall, the trends were fairly robust across all 3 \u2013 retention, recapture and conversion. I think we saw global improvements in all three metrics, retention continues to be our, as we've discussed previously, continues to be our focus and that improved year-over-year in the quarter, kind of in line with the full year improvement that we saw for all of \u201821. So that trend is good. Recaptures are very strong, especially in China. And as I have said in my prepared remarks, recaptured units exceeded the cancellations in the quarter. So that contributed to our portfolio growth and conversion trends look really good. I mean, again, with China, where we see the maximum opportunity driving the way, and that was a big contributor to the portfolio growth here. So overall, listen, we are very, very pleased with the way things progress. We have, as we said previously, a really, really strong focus on that. And there was a subtle change in what we said, but that's our portfolio grew more than 3%. So it says the continued traction that we said, we grew 3% last year. And in Q1, it's more than 3%. So that's \u2013 so we feel good about the full year growth on service portfolio growth. Yes. As we said, our pricing in North America was flattish, right? So North America pricing was flattish. I mean the only part in new equipment where we responded to Nigel's question, Steve, the only place where we saw a little bit of pressure on price was China, right? So that's where the rest of the world kind of behaved and we expected North America to improve starting Q1 because the cycle time for \u2013 from proposal to actually booking the order is really long in North America. So we expected Q4, our pricing was down in the Americas, and we always expected that Q1, we will see the sequential improvement, and we did. So that is good. And hopefully, it continues to gain traction as we go through the rest of the year. But in China, the pricing was under a little bit of pressure as previously discussed, and there was a difference between our units booked and the overall revenue growth in China. Thanks, Steve. Yes. So let me answer the first part of your question, Jeff, and then I'll hand it over to Julie for the second part. So we were expecting a little bit of growth in Russia. The markets were strong getting into the year. So we were expecting a little bit of growth in Russia as we got into the year. But for the sake of ease, we kind of took $0.06 out because we can size the number. But in our original guide, we had a little bit of growth coming from Russia. So Judy, maybe you want to take the second part? And Nick, not a lot to add. I think Judy has kind of covered it. I think we covered verticals. We had share gain in all verticals. And what we saw in the market was the market was down about 5% in the quarter, where we saw the growth \u2013 we saw a growth in industrial and on the infrastructure side. And residential, as you would expect, was down in the quarter just given the policy that we had. So the market \u2013 and the minus 5% that we saw in the market was actually a little bit better than what we would have thought going into the year. We still expect the market to be down 5% to 10% for the year. That estimate has not changed even though some of the metrics have moved around. The construction was up kind of 1% in the quarter. Investment was down a couple of points. The new starts were down, maybe 20% plus in the quarter, but that was a tough compare and then obviously, you had the impact from COVID. But the inventory is kind of holding in China, so the inventory is still at a 3.5 months of inventory. So our estimates for the year on China market growth have not changed. So we're still expecting minus 5% to minus 10% and with Q1 being down about minus 5%. Yes. Our business in China did really well on cash last year, Nick. I mean we were up more than 20% over 2020 levels in 2021. And for the year, for 2022, we kind of expect similar level of improvement in free cash flow in China. So last year, if you look at 2021, our receivables were up slightly less than 10% on revenue that was up more than 25%. So we did really well on cash management in China. But obviously, the situation is volatile. We are looking at our payable situation. We are extending some advances to our customers to ensure supply. But at the same time, we are also looking at, okay, where we can, we are stretching the payable terms. So we're kind of going both ways, managing it on a supplier-by-supplier basis. But overall, listen, the situation, cash in China was good last year, and we expect a similar level of performance in \u201822. Yes. So as you said, our orders were strong in Europe. And we are seeing \u2013 so the backlog goes up, as I said in my prepared remarks, it was up more than 5%, and the ARPU more than that, clearly. But what we are seeing, Julian, is we are seeing delays in construction activity, and that's pretty much all the major European \u2013 or most of major Western European markets. So we are seeing that slowdown, which is extending our delivery times from our factories. So that is what we are seeing. And that is the reason we kind of looked at our revenue expectations for the year in EMEA, and we took them down slightly. We were up kind of mid-single digit levels last time if we took them to mid to high this time or low to mid this time. And part of that was obviously Russia coming out because Russia was a faster growth market. So some of that impact was just Russia getting pulled out and some of that was construction. So now we think it's low to mid. But as you look at the overall construction activity in EMEA, that is kind of holding. So, if you look at the building permit activity that was up 2% to 3% over last year. I think they are expecting that to continue. And so that is where we expect that our orders growth in Europe should be okay for the year. We are not expecting any big slowdown at this point. So, the business seems to be holding up. And all we are seeing is this delay in revenue recognition and the pricing was good as well. So, we saw \u2013 we picked up pricing up low-single digits in EMEA. So overall, the business is doing well, except for the slowdown in construction that's impacting us. Yes. So, let me start with the second part of your question first, Julian, and then I will get to the first part of the question. So, overall commodity headwinds is about 110 for the year, about $38 million in the first quarter, similar levels expected in second quarter. And what has shifted from the last estimate is clearly, we are expecting a little bit of a headwind in the second half of the year, which was not in our prior expectation that that's driven by the higher energy prices in Europe that are driving aluminum costs and also some of the steel prices in Europe have gone up. And same thing in North America, we have seen commodity pricing moving higher in North America as well, offset to some extent by lower prices in China. So, commodity headwinds $110 million for the year, about $76 million in the first half, the balance in the second half of the year. Now, in terms of cadence, you are right, I mean what we saw \u2013 you can think it's kind of a run rate. But what you are seeing, obviously, the earnings in new equipment were pressured in the first quarter because of the higher commodity headwinds. And we are expecting kind of similar level of pressure on new equipment earnings in the second quarter. So, the margins in new equipment on a year-over-year basis are going to look very similar in the second quarter as they did in the first quarter. So, the margin expectations in new equipment first quarter, second quarter are going to be similar. And if you look at our full year margin guide, that is more or less in line with the first quarter margin guide. So, we are not expecting a huge acceleration in new equipment margins and maybe that's a little bit conservative as we get into the second half. Maybe there is a little bit of tailwind. But given all the uncertainty, we felt that, okay, holding the margins kind of sequentially flat to Q1 levels was appropriate. Now, as you move to service though, on the other side, we do expect acceleration of margins in the Service segment. And the biggest driver of that, a, obviously, sequential revenue growth in service that comes through a high drop-through. But also, if you go back to Q1 of last year, we still had the impact from COVID. So, in Q1 of this year, we had some of the costs coming back that were not there in Q1 of last year. So, we absorbed that incremental cost and yet grew margins. So, as we get into the second to the fourth quarter, that headwind is not there, and that helps us drive higher service margins. So, that's the underlying cover. But as you look overall, obviously, a good start to the year. And we expect Q2 is the same, we expect to grow revenue in the second quarter and then EPS on a year-over-year basis and on a sequential basis, should be up as well in the second quarter. Thanks Julian. Yes, some impact from Russia, but we are just looking at calibrating the full year. So, that's what we did. So, just nothing major things move around all the time. There is not a big cut in any one line, but there is some definitely some impact from lower investments in Russia. But overall, it's just kind of minor tweaking in different lines. Yes. No, it was \u2013 as we said, overall, Cai, good growth globally, obviously, strong growth in China. And the other emerging markets in Asia did well as well, but we did grow our portfolio in both Europe and the Americas as well. Obviously, they are lower growth economies. And so they contribute a lower amount because the growth is clearly happening in Asia, but it was a global improvement with improvement in all four regions. And then your second question on conversion. I think the conversion rates obviously moved up a lot overall throughout the world, but especially with the improvement in China kind of driving that, and that is where we expect most of the improvement to come. And the cancellation rate is good. I mean we keep making progress and the fact is that we make, especially in the where that is really important is in the more mature markets, in the U.S. and in the Western European economies. And that is where if you look at our improvement this year, that is we saw \u2013 that is where we saw the maximum improvement in our retention rates. Both Europe and U.S. did really well, or Europe and Americas did really well on improving the retention rates. And that is what we really need to see because that also drives price because that's \u2013 losing that portfolio hurts us the most. And by improving our retention rate, that drives incremental price and incremental margin. But overall, really pleased with the progress we are making globally. Definitely. Yes. I mean our expectation, I think we said it just post Investor Day, Cai, that we see portfolio growth hedging \u2013 continue to improve, and there is a clear line of sight at some point to this portfolio growth, starting with maybe a four and then maybe even going up from there. But we take this in small steps and every quarter is a dot point on the board that \u2013 and all these dot points make up a trend. So, I think that's what Judy kind of alluded to, just kind of the sequential improvement. And I think we are putting another dot point on the board with this quarter. And we are hoping that by the time we end the year, this number starts with a four, but we are not there yet. So, we will keep marching forward. So, most of our price increases are structural. There are surcharges kind of built into that number, because as we have discussed previously, we have escalator clauses, which are tied to overall inflation in the economy. So, that gets captured on the maintenance side, so nothing unusual in the quarter. We should be keeping this entire price increase. Obviously, it's all market-dependent, and a large portion of our portfolio comes up for renewal in the first quarter, but not all of it. So, we will keep kind of guiding to you guys as the year goes on, how this moves forward. So, that's point number one. And the second part is \u2013 and then obviously, on the new equipment side, it is once you kind of sign the contract, it's there. So, I think on both sides, there is no reason to give any of this price increase back. On repair, where we kind of do more break/fix work, there are some surcharges that we add based on the travel that we need to do. So, that is where we do add a surcharge based on travel. But on maintenance and new equipment, there is nothing unusual about the price increases we are just kind of pushing through, and we should be retaining all of it. Yes. Overall, we did not disclose that, Joel. But overall, our asset base in Russia is not huge. We are \u2013 we typically do get advances from our customers in everywhere in the world before we get a new equipment order. And Russia is, call it, 80% new equipment. So, our \u2013 we are actually in a negative working capital position in Russia. So, as and when something happens, obviously, we will update the accounting, but we don't expect a big asset write-off. There could be some other charges that we will have to evaluate as time goes on, but we don't expect a big asset right off to come from anything that Judy mentioned earlier. So, just keep in mind, Joel, yes, it is high. And the reason for that is twofold. One, obviously, the biggest reason for that is that we don't do a lot of installation in Russia. We sell the equipment through our factory to people who actually install it. So therefore, that just drives higher margins because what you \u2013 if you look at our industry, we made more money on selling the equipment and the installation part is lower profit. So, that is what you see in Russia because we don't do a lot of installation that comes through. And obviously, there are some other adjustments that go through as well anytime you try and pull a business out. But the biggest driver of that is just the nature of our business in Russia. Joel, your question is on China, whether we see the market getting back to normal in China? Yes. So, we are \u2013 obviously, Q2 is going to be tough, right. I mean we \u2013 obviously, we are expecting the lockdowns to kind of end mid-April, but they have now extended. So, we will see how. So Q2, we are still expecting to resume delivery starting May. So, that's still part of the expectation. But obviously, we will keep monitoring that. We think from our own delivery standpoint, we should be able to catch up as we get into Q3 and Q4 because we saw that just post-COVID, after the lockdowns, we had a really, really strong Q2 in Russia in 2019 \u2013 sorry, in China. We saw a really strong bounce back in China in Q2 of 2019. And we expect that as soon as the lockdowns lift, we should be able to recover. But the supply chain part is a little bit more uncertain for us because that we don't control directly, and that was the reason for taking down our guide, as Judy said earlier. So, we have adjusted our guide, reflecting more of the supply chain issues and potential some conversion challenges with job sites and other places. But from our own factory standpoint, we are pretty confident that as soon as the lockdowns lift, we are ready to go. Thank you."

Presentation materials are available for download from Otis' website at www.otis.com. I'll now turn it over to Michael Rednor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Michael, you may begin.\nMichael Rednor: Thank you, Krista. Welcome to Otis' fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Judy Marks, Chair, CEO, and President; and Anurag Maheshwari, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and significant non-recurring items. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, Otis' SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Mike, and thank you everyone for joining us. We hope everyone listening is safe and well. We delivered a strong fourth quarter to cap of strong full year performance. We enter 2024 with confidence in our service driven business model, remaining focused on our strategic pillars, including deliver modernization value, which we added as our fifth strategic imperative last year, while driving operational excellence. We achieved these results with the hard work of our colleagues around the globe. So I want to thank each of you for your hard work, commitment to our customers and demonstration of our Otis absolutes. Starting on Slide 3, we achieved full year organic sales growth in all regions with total Otis organic sales growth of 5.6% driven by service, which grew 7.7%. We grew our industry leading maintenance portfolio by a record high of 4.2% for the year, and it now stands at about 2.3 million units, a new milestone for our company. We delivered strong low-teens adjusted EPS growth for the year, including mid-teens growth in the fourth quarter. Modernization orders were up 16.8% for the year, including low-teens growth in the fourth quarter. Our modernization backlog is up 15%. New equipment orders in Q4 increased 2.9%, and our new equipment backlog increased 2% for 2023. In 2023, we achieved approximately 50 basis points of new equipment share gain. Heading into 2024, as our backlogs have continued to grow, we have good visibility on our new equipment sales, despite the uncertain macro environment, and we expect strong sales growth in our modernization business. We generated approximately $1.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow, allowing us to return approximately $1.35 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, earlier in 2023, we began executing initiatives related to our customer-centric uplift program focused on gaining scale across our global organization to unlock synergies, standardizing our processes to generate efficiencies, and optimizing our supplier and indirect spend. Our streamlining and transformation efforts are on-track to achieve $150 million of run rate savings in mid-2025, as we previously indicated. To summarize, 2023 was characterized by solid organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit margin expansion, and nearly 12% EPS growth outperforming our medium-term guidance. We are well-positioned as we enter 2024, as we focus on executing our growing new equipment and modernization backlogs with greater than 4% maintenance unit growth, supporting sales growth in our maintenance and repair business. We also made meaningful progress toward our 13 ESG goals in 2023, emphasizing the alignment of our absolutes of safety, ethics, and quality with our business strategy. Importantly, in early November, we announced our commitment to setting near term science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets, which have been formally submitted to the science-based targets initiative for evaluation. Turning to our orders performance on Slide 4. New equipment orders return to growth in the quarter up 2.9% with quarter-over-quarter acceleration in all regions. Orders were down 3.9% for the year, as mid-teens growth in Asia Pacific and low-single-digit growth in EMEA, were offset by declines in China and the Americas. Overall, globally, new equipment units were down approximately 8% to roughly 850,000 units in 2023. Despite these macro challenges, we were able to achieve about 50 basis points of new equipment share gain on top of the nearly 3 point increase between 2020 and 2022, and we were able to grow our new equipment backlog, which was up 2%. We continue to innovate to better serve our customers and drive growth across our business. For example, we continue to roll out our digitally connected elevator platforms, launching the Gen3 Core in North America, and explain -- expanding the deployment of Gen360 to China. In addition, we launched the Gen3 Mod plus a package of upgrades to support our modernization business in the Americas, which also includes connectivity to our Otis ONE IoT platform. R&D and strategic investments remained relatively stable at about 1.4% as a percent of sales for the year, reflecting our ability to invest and innovate efficiently. We strengthened our number one position globally, accelerating our portfolio growth to over 4% for a second year in a row. We demonstrated the power of geographic diversification within our business with double-digit portfolio growth in China, mid-single-digit growth in Asia Pacific, and low-single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA. Globally, our recaptures offset our cancellations for the second consecutive year, leading to conversions as the portfolio growth driver in line with our strategy. China conversion rate continues to improve, currently standing at about 51% and approximately 4% improvement versus 2022. Additional details on our portfolio growth in 2023 can be found in the appendix. As accelerating our portfolio growth is an essential component of our long-term strategy and top-line growth algorithm. At year-end 2023, we have 900,000 connected units of which 500,000 use our Otis ONE IoT solution. Our service sales force performed well throughout the year with like-for-like maintenance pricing of four points, helping to mitigate labor cost headwinds within the business. Our fifth strategic pillar of delivering modernization value is performing. Modernization orders were up 16.8% driven by double-digit growth in Asia, particularly in Korea as the strength in our Mod package offerings continues to drive results. Additionally, the Americas and EMEA drove strong fourth quarter modernization major project bookings. Our modernization backlog is up 15% versus the prior year, giving us good line of sight for strong growth in 2024. We continue to win many exciting projects based on our innovation, ability to deliver and to trust our customers have in us. As we build, service and modernize our customer's elevators and escalators, we build loyalty and value with increasing recurring revenue streams. For new equipment in China, Otis is building on decades of close cooperation with the nation's metro providers to help expand urban transport and city development. We'll provide 237 escalators and elevators for line 15 of the Chongqing Metro in West China, while incorporating Otis ONE on these units. Otis has a long history with Chongqing Metro, which carries more than 4 million passengers daily across rugged terrain on a network that is famous for its ingenious design and engineering. In San Francisco, Otis was awarded a comprehensive modernization of all 16 elevator units at 560 Mission Street. The project includes the installation of custom cabin interiors and our Compass 360 destination dispatch system. In addition, Otis has been awarded the maintenance contract for the 31 story commercial office building, extending our relationship with Commonwealth Partners and contributing to our service recaptures in the quarter. In Hong Kong, we are honoured to have been selected for a modernization project at Chin, Iowa State. This project for the Hong Kong Housing Authority, a longstanding customer, includes the modernization of 18 elevators, which will all be maintained by Otis upon completion. The new units will use gearless machines with energy efficient drives to meet the project's environmentally conscious requirements. In Dubai, Otis will modernize 42 elevators and eight escalators at the Burj Khalifa. We take pride in being the original equipment manufacturer and maintenance provider of the world's tallest building since its opening. Emaar Properties has trusted us with the upgrade of their controllers and drives and providing the latest technology for this iconic building. In addition, the contract extends our service agreement for another 10 years. And last, also in EMEA, for nearly 130 years, visitors have taken Otis elevators to the top of the Eiffel Tower, where we're delivering a multi-year modernization of this iconic towers two duo lifts. Turning to the fourth quarter results on Slide 5. For the fourth quarter, reported sales of $3.6 billion were up 5.3%. Organic sales grew for the 13th consecutive quarter and were up 3.8% with high-single-digit growth in service while new equipment was roughly flat in the face of the macro challenges, notably in China. Adjusted operating profit, excluding a $9 million foreign exchange tailwind increased $52 million with profit growth in both segments. Adjusted EPS grew 16% or $0.12 in the quarter. We ended the year with fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow of $573 million, allowing us to finish the year strong at approximately $1.5 billion. With that, I'll turn it over to Anurag to walk through our 2023 results in more detail.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Thank you, Judy. Starting with segment sales performance on Slide 6. Otis fourth quarter, new equipment sales were $1.5 billion with organic sales roughly flat driven by high-single-digit growth in Asia Pacific, offsetting mid-single-digit declines in China. Americas and EMEA were up low-single-digits and roughly flat respectively. For service, we delivered another strong quarter of organic sales growth at 6.8% with strong performance across all lines of business and regions. Maintenance and repair sales were up 6.8%, and Mod sales were up 7%, including the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Asia. For the full year, new equipment sales were $5.8 billion, and organic sales grew 2.6% with solid growth in all regions outside of China. New equipment pricing was up low-single-digits globally with Asia Pacific up low-single-digits, the Americas up mid-single-digits, and EMEA high-single-digits. Although the pricing environment in China remains challenging, we remain price cost neutral in the region from a continued focus on price discipline and material productivity. Service sales were $8.4 billion with 7.7% organic growth and all lines of business showing high-single-digit growth, including another year of outstanding performance and repair marking a three year CAGR in the low-teens. Maintenance pricing, excluding the impact of mix in churn, came in about as expected up roughly four points for the year. Turning to segment operating profit performance on Slide 7. Starting with new equipment, we delivered our best margin expansion for the year in the fourth quarter, up 120 basis points. Adjusted operating profit excluding $3 million of Forex headwind was up $20 million as strong productivity, pricing and commodity tailwinds were partially offset by unfavorable regional and product mix, alongside higher SG&A expense. Turning to Service. Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit, excluding $13 million of Forex tailwind was up $33 million as higher volumes, favorable maintenance pricing and productivity were partially offset by annual wage increases and higher material costs. For the past 16 consecutive quarters, we have delivered consistent service margin expansion. And for the second consecutive year, we expanded margin by 50 basis points exiting the year at a 24% rate. For the full year, overall operating profit was up $166 million at constant currency, and margin expanded 30 basis points. Despite the weakness in China, we were able to achieve $26 million of new equipment profit growth at constant currency as pricing, productivity and growth in all other regions more than offset unfavorable mix. This performance was better than anticipated and put us at the midpoint of our initial full year guidance for operating profit growth at constant currency as we overcame the weaker macro backdrop experienced during the year. Service operating profit increased $178 million at constant currency, supported by strong volume, pricing and productivity. Since then, we have increased service margins by 240 basis points. Slide 8 lays out the full year '23 adjusted EPS bridge. Adjusted EPS in the year grew $0.37, driven by $0.29 of solid operational performance. Accretion from the Zardoya transaction, share repurchases of $800 million and optimization of a tax rate by 40 basis points drove an additional $0.12, which more than offset $0.04 of foreign exchange headwinds. Additionally, we closed out 2023 with notable adjusted free cash flow of $573 million in the quarter, up more than 30% versus the prior year driven by higher net income and favorable working capital. In addition to the growth in down payments from increased new equipment orders in the quarter, the team continued to manage working capital well. As a result, we achieved our annual guidance generating approximately $1.5 billion of adjusted free cash flow. If we were to look back to the beginning of '23, we initially guided that we would achieve low to mid-single-digit sales growth, 20 to 30 basis points of operating profit margin expansion and approximately 8% EPS growth. Due to our operational performance, continued penetration of repair sales on a growing maintenance base robust pricing and productivity, we were able to outperform all these metrics despite an uncertain macro environment and grew adjusted EPS by approximately 12%, all while returning approximately $1.35 billion to the shareholders. With a strong end to the year on new equipment orders and solid modernization order activity throughout '23, we further expanded both our new equipment and more backlog, which will support us in '24 and beyond. I'll now turn it back to Judy to discuss our 2024 outlook.\nJudy Marks: Starting on Slide 9 with the market outlook. In the Americas market in 2023, the market was down low-teens as double-digit decline in North America was partially offset by low-single-digit growth in Latin America. In EMEA, Western and Central Europe were the primary drivers, leading to a market that was down high-single-digits. In Asia, the market was down mid-single-digits, with a solid year in Asia Pacific, up low-single-digits but the performance masked by the downturn in China, which we estimate was down just north of 10%. In 2024, the global new equipment market is expected to be down low to mid-single-digits in units with markets in the Americas and EMEA down low-single-digits and markets in Asia down low to mid-single-digits driven by China. While new equipment market dynamics remain fluid, the long-term fundamentals of the industry are well supported by the service-driven growth model. In 2024, the global installed base is expected to grow at a similar rate to that of 2023 at around mid-single-digits and reach approximately 22.5 million units. In the Americas and EMEA, we expect low-single-digit growth. And in Asia, we're expecting mid-single-digit growth driven by China. Overall, we expect service to be the growth driver for the industry, and we expect the same for our business. With this as the industry backdrop, for Otis, we expect net sales of $14.5 billion to $14.8 billion, growing 3% to 5% organically or 2% to 4% at actual currency. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be between $2.4 billion and $2.45 billion, up $125 million to $175 million at actual currency or $150 million to $190 million, excluding foreign exchange headwinds. We expect adjusted EPS in the range of $3.80 to $3.90, up 7% to 10% or nearly $0.25 at the midpoint versus the prior year. Finally, we expect adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.6 billion. With our commitment to a disciplined capital allocation strategy, we expect to repurchase approximately $800 million in shares in 2024, as we look to grow our dividend payout and pursue our typical $50 million to $100 million of bolt-on M&A. With that, let me hand it back to Anurag to outline the 2024 segment outlook in more detail.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Starting on Slide 10 for the new equipment outlook. We have good line of sight for new equipment sales due to our backlog coverage, which extends out to over a year of sales. This, in combination with the share gain initiatives and incremental pricing actions we have taken over the past few years\u2019 position us relatively well for 2024. As a result, we anticipate new equipment organic sales to be flattish with Americas and EMEA up low-single-digits and Asia Pacific up mid-single-digits with mid-single-digit declines in China. We expect new equipment profit margin to be flat to up 10 basis points with roughly steady volume and tailwinds from pricing, productivity, commodities and the benefits from uplift offset by unfavorable regional and project mix alongside higher SG&A expense. Driving strong material and installation productivity and faster backlog conversion will remain a priority with the goal to again outperform our targets. Turning to Slide 11 for the service outlook. Starting with sales. We expect another solid year in service and anticipate organic sales growth of 6% to 7%. Maintenance and repair organic sales are expected to be up 5.5% to 6.5%, driven by the significant additions to our maintenance portfolio and approximately 1 point of net pricing after adjusting for mix and churn. Mid-single-digit repair growth will also contribute through both our traditional and digital channels, although at a more moderate pace than what we saw in '23. For modernization, we anticipate organic sales growth of about 8% as we execute on a solid backlog, which similar to new equipment, extends out over a year and ended the year up in the mid-teens. Our strategy of standardizing products and driving more supply chain and factory optimization will enable us to accelerate sales growth above the 7% achieved in '23. This also has the added benefit of helping to drive modernization margin expansion. Turning to service profit. We expect roughly 50 basis points of margin expansion, continued strong volume, price, productivity and uplift are expected to more than offset annual wage inflation and higher SG&A similar to '23. Now turning to Slide 12. We began executing Project Uplift initiatives in the second half of '23 as we leverage enterprise scale, optimize our indirect and supply chain spend and improve and standardize our processes. We are on-track to achieve our targeted savings of $150 million with $80 million of run rate savings anticipated by year-end 2024, and $150 million in run rate savings by mid-'25. Out of the $150 million in total savings to be realized, nearly half will come from leveraging enterprise scale roughly 25% from indirect and supply chain optimization and the rest from process improvements and standardization. We continue to analyze and execute on the opportunities and estimate 70% of the savings will be in the service segment with the remaining split between new equipment and corporate. Moving to the '24 EPS bridge on Slide 13. Our guidance for adjusted EPS is $3.80 to $3.90 driven by approximately $0.30 of operating profit growth at the midpoint, reflecting organic sales growth of 3% to 5%, with approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion. Below the line, we expect to offset $0.03 to $0.04 of Forex and increased interest expense headwinds with continued optimization of our tax rate and the benefit of approximately $800 million in share repurchases supported by $1.6 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Looking at the EPS cadence for the year, we expect the $0.30 of EPS growth to be fairly level loaded between the first and the second half, while in the first half, we expect the first quarter EPS growth to be a couple of cents lighter than the second quarter. A little bit more color on the first quarter metrics, starting with orders. We faced a difficult compare versus the first quarter of last year where we grew more than 7%. So we expect new equipment orders to be down roughly 10%, while portfolio and modernization orders growth should remain strong. As for sales and profit, sales growth will be roughly 3%, and total company operating profit margins should expand over 50 basis points to 16%-plus both led by service. Below the line, headwinds from higher interest costs and a tax rate roughly in line with the prior year due to timing will be offset by lower share count. All in, this should lead to $0.06 to $0.07 of EPS growth driven primarily by operational performance. Overall, our outlook reflects another year of performance led by consistent service business. We remain focused on continuing to mitigate macro challenges and further driving shareholder value. With that, I will request Krista to please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: So a solid outlook for 2024, I think you mentioned Anurag, 1% price for new equipment. I know we've had some weakness in China. So just wondering if there's any sort of significant SKUs across the geographies that you called out there. And maybe again, excuse me if I missed it, but what would you expect the service pricing this year?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Let me clarify, the 1% that I spoke in my prepared comments was on maintenance pricing. So what we'll see is we'll see adjusted for mix and churn. So we'll see about 3% on a like-to-like basis and just for that. On the new equipment side, clearly, we've seen good price increases in '23 in America, EMEA and AP. Some of that will continue over in '24 new equipment. But China does have price pressure as we saw in '23, but it's a deflationary economy, so we expect it to be price cost neutral.\nNigel Coe: Okay. But no evidence of pricing deflation outside of China?\nJudy Marks: No, Nigel, none at all.\nNigel Coe: And then just on the uplift savings. Obviously, we're starting to see those coming through in '24. Where do these land mainly this year? I mean, what would you say more new equipment or services? And I'm just curious if we're seeing any kind of upward trajectory on the modernization margins? I know that's an initiative that you're focused on. Just wondering if we're going to see some of that coming through in '24?\nJudy Marks: Yes, Nigel, let me talk to the uplift in '23. We pretty much saw it across the board, again, early days but pretty pleased with the savings we've seen and more importantly, the trajectory of where we're going with the process work with the organizational model and really changing how we work to be more customer focused. Anurag, I'll let you touch on Mod margins.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. On the Mod margins, as we said a few months ago that we expect it to be at par with new equipment in a few months and then started going up, and we see that trajectory pretty good. We'll give a little bit more color on the Investor Day in a couple of weeks, but that is on the right trend. And for the uplift savings, I think the cadence, what I outlined in the prepared comments, 70% in service, and the rest between new equipment and corporate, that should be for this year as well. So we're going to exit the year $80 million and in year of $40 million with similar cadence across that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Guatam Khanna from TD Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: I was wondering if you could quantify the net savings from uplift and how we should think about that this year and next this year?\nAnurag Maheshwari: The $40 million is net savings, which is flowing through to the P&L or uplift, right? So if you look at in 2024, we are going to grow our operating profit at constant currency by approximately $170 million. About $140 million of that is price cost. The price is what Nigel asked me earlier, a little bit from the service side, from the new equipment side. We're still seeing commodity tailwinds, a little bit a little bit lighter than '23, but that's obviously positive. So the -- and the uplift is contributing $40 million to that, right? So if you add all of that together, we're getting our price cost of about $140 million, and the rest is coming from volume, net of mix. So the $40 million of uplift is 100% net flow through to the P&L.\nGautam Khanna: And then to your earlier comment on China and the new equipment market, it doesn't sound like you're talking about price erosion due to competition per se, but rather is there some other reason for -- is it just lower cost across all the competitors, if you could just expand on what's going on in new equipment pricing?\nJudy Marks: Sure. So really, it's a very competitive market. We'll start there. And the market remains weak. We've called it north of 10% in terms of what we saw this year. And we're going to be very focused on continued productivity savings. But in a deflationary environment, we're seeing the costs come down, too. And that's really what's helping. The commodity costs are coming down, and it gives us this price cost neutral ability. Now listen, every day in China, we're on new equipment, we're balancing the quality of the orders the volume we're taking in and what that's contributing to our backlog margin. And we are in a market that's down 10% in this quarter, Sally and the team did a great job. We were down 5% in terms of orders. And so we did gain share and we've gained share now consistently for several years. So we're managing that carefully, but I will tell you, our China business, when you look at it as a whole, our China business contributed significantly this year, and their profit for the year was up year-over-year. When you look all in because what we've done is we've really executed our strategy well on new equipment with key accounts with our sales coverage but just as importantly, Gautam, we focused on pivoting more and growing our service business. Our service sales have grown mid-teen CAGRs. And we -- service now accounts for 25% of our China sales, which is up from mid-teens a few years ago. And we had 20% growth in both units and value in service in this last quarter, and that's the trend we've been on. So it's about balance in new equipment. But it's a growing service and long story.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: I just wanted to clarify perhaps on the new equipment outlook. You've got the Slide 9, I think, the market down in every region and globally for the year. How are you thinking about the backlog trending sort of as we move through the year? Because I guess, last year, you had the backlog up new equipment, even with the orders down. So you had a sort of a book-to-bill, I guess, over 1x in '23 in new equipment. So just trying to understand in 2024, how are we thinking about the sort of backlog progression there and the implied book-to-bill?\nJudy Marks: Yes. So the backlog itself, Julian, is obviously, we're going in with 2%. We really couldn't be more pleased with how especially Americas and EMEA really drove strong new equipment orders in the fourth quarter. Americas was up 6%, EMEA was up 11%. So everyone is going in with backlog strength with the exception of China backlog is down mid-single-digits as we go into to '24. But it's that strong backlog that's giving us that line of sight in the majority of our regions that gives us the confidence that we can -- between that and new equipment share gain of 50 basis points that we're going to sustain that gives us the confidence. Anurag, I'll let you take them through kind of how the year transpires.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. Thanks, Judy. Yes. So as you said, Julian, our book-to-bill was more than 1x in \u201823. We expect that to be similar in '24 because orders are quite higher than our new equipment revenue. So as we go through the course of the year, we do expect to finish even if we perform in line with our market outlook and don't even increase share, we should end the year at a backlog flattish to be slightly higher. Clearly, the comps are tough for us in the first quarter in terms of new equipment orders, but then they get easier for us in the second and third quarter. So you will see a little bit of generation quarter-by-quarter, but we are confident that given this market outlook, if it stays the way we should remain in the year with a flattish or slightly higher backlog.\nJulian Mitchell: And then maybe just 1 for Judy on particularly sort of North America and EMEA, how you're seeing that market right now in terms of sort of verticals and how customers are behaving in new equipment? Are you seeing particular weakness in office versus multifamily? Are you seeing projects being delayed or it sort of existing projects are going ahead on plan and it's the new projects that maybe it's just taking longer for customers to sign-off. Any sort of color on that North America and Europe, please?\nJudy Marks: Sure, Julien. Let me start with North America. And as I said, our team is out there and it goes back to these long-term customer relationships that really enable the orders book to be up in the backlog to be up. But for context, the new equipment market segment in units in North America finished last year, the lowest since the GFC. And yet, we still we gain share, we delivered and we increased pricing. So our team is performing very well there. When we look at the segments themselves, none of the segments are strong in North America. Multifamily is the weakest due to several years of outpaced growth. If I had to rank order them, infrastructure is the best, and we've had really good success with major projects. We're going to continue to grow there. But all of the segments -- none of them are strong in North America. And so this is going to be a year where the benefit to Otis and why we're going to be successful is we invested in the low-rise market. We introduced our Gen3 Core product and 80% of the North American market is 2 to 6 stories. And that market, we're still seeing active bids. We've seen a great pipeline for Gen3 Core and that gives us the encouragement between the backlog and the orders we're seeing to know that we can -- it's a mid-single-digit backlog in North America. So -- and that gives us a good 12, 18 plus months line of sight for next year's revenue. In Europe, South Europe remains strong, led by Spain, we're seeing sustained activity. Central Northern Europe is weak. And again, there, infrastructure tends to lead residential is a little better in Europe than it is in North America by far. But again, we -- what we see on the ground, whether it's the German economy or any of the other locations is looks to us like '24 looks like '23 in terms of the segments in Europe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Miguel Borrega from BNP Paribas Exane.\nMiguel Borrega: The first one, just on China, the market -- the competitive environment in China. Obviously, as I said, the market remains weak. But do you sense increased pricing pressure over the last quarter or so, one of your peers reported strong market share gains in Q4. So just wanted to get your views on anything incremental to what we've seen so far?\nJudy Marks: Sure. Listen, Miguel, performance can vary in any given quarter based on compares, but I'd like to take a step back and overall, for '23, we believe we gained share in China with the market down north of 10% and us coming in, again, down about 5% or actually even low-single-digits when you look for the year, but let me try and give you some additional color here. First, we did perform better in the first half of the year versus the second half but we always manage volume and share versus profitability. And we manage those dials appropriately while maintaining momentum on our share growth. Our order value declined mid-single-digits, and we've spoken all year about the deflation that's impacted the market, but we've been able to offset the price decline with better productivity. And when you look at our strategy in China, we've added the agents and distributors. It's given us the geographic and vertical coverage and we've continued to innovate and invest in our products. We've brought multiple products to the market in China. We've upgraded our escalator offering, our OH8000, and we brought Gen360 to the market in China over the past year. And that will yield for us and give us an advantage this year because of the technology because of our -- again, our reach in terms of our sales channel. Overall, we've increased our bookings in China by nearly 20% since pre-spin, while over the market over that same multiyear period is down 10% to 15%. So our strategy is working, our team is out there every day focused. We are -- our backlog, while it's down mid-single-digits, the quality of our backlog, the profitability of our backlog, we're not sacrificing for volume.\nMiguel Borrega: And then my second question, if you can talk a little bit about modernization. You mentioned backlog is up 15%. What is driving that growth exactly? And how should we think about it from here, 2024 and 2025? And then on the margin of modernization, you mentioned that par with new equipment, I think one of your peers stated that margins are even higher than maintenance. Where do you think the different slides? And would you see those margins in modernization growing ahead of the other segments for you in the next few years?\nJudy Marks: Yes. So I'll comment a little on -- let me talk about the market and a little bit on the margins because the margins vary by region in terms of modernization margins. But the mod market is up nicely in all regions. And the majority of that is just driven by the refurbishment required due to the aging equipment that's out based on construction cycles from 20-plus years ago. We're just in a natural growth cycle now where you're going to see year-over-year additional Mod. Really pleased with the backlog up. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of orders up over 10%. Asia Pacific really was the standout again with Korea. But we have a great mod product in China and our China orders, albeit on a small base because it's a little bit of a younger installed base is growing significantly double-digit. And Americas and EMEA, as I said in my prepared comments, really had a strong major project contribution in Mod orders in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to continue. Again, in terms of margins, as Anurag shared, we will surpass new equipment margins shortly. But when you look in different geographies, there are different Mod margins. The market is a combination, again, of aging and safety regulations and demand creation. And I'm really proud of our team because when a part goes obsolete our team is out there. Our sales teams out there, our mechanics are out there. They're ensuring our customers know what they need to keep their elevators, not just current, but to prepare them for the future. I'm really encouraged by modernization. We've organized around it. We've set up this as a fifth strategic imperative, we have Mod kits because we are going to industrialize how we do Mods. So it will look more like new equipment coming out of a factory, and that's what's going to drive the margin expansion.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. Just to add to that, Miguel, I mean I can't speak about the others, but for us, we're clearly seeing the trajectory on margins pick up. And there's no reason why it should be much higher than equipment. And as we standardize our products, optimize the supply chain, do better on the go-to-market strategy, we see that inching up. And as I said, we'll talk more about it in the next couple of weeks. But clearly, the margin should be outpaced new equipment margins.\nOperator: We have no further questions in our queue at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Judy Marks for closing remarks.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Krista. 2023 proved to be another strong year for Otis as we focused on our strategic imperatives to drive value for all stakeholders. We head into 2024 supported by the strength of our service-driven customer-centric business model and remain excited to share our 2024 successes with all of you. We look forward to you joining us at our Investor Day at the New York Stock Exchange on February 15. Please stay safe and well. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Judy Marks",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and thank you everyone for joining us. We hope everyone listening is safe and well. We delivered a strong fourth quarter to cap of strong full year performance. We enter 2024 with confidence in our service driven business model, remaining focused on our strategic pillars, including deliver modernization value, which we added as our fifth strategic imperative last year, while driving operational excellence. We achieved these results with the hard work of our colleagues around the globe. So I want to thank each of you for your hard work, commitment to our customers and demonstration of our Otis absolutes. Starting on Slide 3, we achieved full year organic sales growth in all regions with total Otis organic sales growth of 5.6% driven by service, which grew 7.7%. We grew our industry leading maintenance portfolio by a record high of 4.2% for the year, and it now stands at about 2.3 million units, a new milestone for our company. We delivered strong low-teens adjusted EPS growth for the year, including mid-teens growth in the fourth quarter. Modernization orders were up 16.8% for the year, including low-teens growth in the fourth quarter. Our modernization backlog is up 15%. New equipment orders in Q4 increased 2.9%, and our new equipment backlog increased 2% for 2023. In 2023, we achieved approximately 50 basis points of new equipment share gain. Heading into 2024, as our backlogs have continued to grow, we have good visibility on our new equipment sales, despite the uncertain macro environment, and we expect strong sales growth in our modernization business. We generated approximately $1.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow, allowing us to return approximately $1.35 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, earlier in 2023, we began executing initiatives related to our customer-centric uplift program focused on gaining scale across our global organization to unlock synergies, standardizing our processes to generate efficiencies, and optimizing our supplier and indirect spend. Our streamlining and transformation efforts are on-track to achieve $150 million of run rate savings in mid-2025, as we previously indicated. To summarize, 2023 was characterized by solid organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit margin expansion, and nearly 12% EPS growth outperforming our medium-term guidance. We are well-positioned as we enter 2024, as we focus on executing our growing new equipment and modernization backlogs with greater than 4% maintenance unit growth, supporting sales growth in our maintenance and repair business. We also made meaningful progress toward our 13 ESG goals in 2023, emphasizing the alignment of our absolutes of safety, ethics, and quality with our business strategy. Importantly, in early November, we announced our commitment to setting near term science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets, which have been formally submitted to the science-based targets initiative for evaluation. Turning to our orders performance on Slide 4. New equipment orders return to growth in the quarter up 2.9% with quarter-over-quarter acceleration in all regions. Orders were down 3.9% for the year, as mid-teens growth in Asia Pacific and low-single-digit growth in EMEA, were offset by declines in China and the Americas. Overall, globally, new equipment units were down approximately 8% to roughly 850,000 units in 2023. Despite these macro challenges, we were able to achieve about 50 basis points of new equipment share gain on top of the nearly 3 point increase between 2020 and 2022, and we were able to grow our new equipment backlog, which was up 2%. We continue to innovate to better serve our customers and drive growth across our business. For example, we continue to roll out our digitally connected elevator platforms, launching the Gen3 Core in North America, and explain -- expanding the deployment of Gen360 to China. In addition, we launched the Gen3 Mod plus a package of upgrades to support our modernization business in the Americas, which also includes connectivity to our Otis ONE IoT platform. R&D and strategic investments remained relatively stable at about 1.4% as a percent of sales for the year, reflecting our ability to invest and innovate efficiently. We strengthened our number one position globally, accelerating our portfolio growth to over 4% for a second year in a row. We demonstrated the power of geographic diversification within our business with double-digit portfolio growth in China, mid-single-digit growth in Asia Pacific, and low-single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA. Globally, our recaptures offset our cancellations for the second consecutive year, leading to conversions as the portfolio growth driver in line with our strategy. China conversion rate continues to improve, currently standing at about 51% and approximately 4% improvement versus 2022. Additional details on our portfolio growth in 2023 can be found in the appendix. As accelerating our portfolio growth is an essential component of our long-term strategy and top-line growth algorithm. At year-end 2023, we have 900,000 connected units of which 500,000 use our Otis ONE IoT solution. Our service sales force performed well throughout the year with like-for-like maintenance pricing of four points, helping to mitigate labor cost headwinds within the business. Our fifth strategic pillar of delivering modernization value is performing. Modernization orders were up 16.8% driven by double-digit growth in Asia, particularly in Korea as the strength in our Mod package offerings continues to drive results. Additionally, the Americas and EMEA drove strong fourth quarter modernization major project bookings. Our modernization backlog is up 15% versus the prior year, giving us good line of sight for strong growth in 2024. We continue to win many exciting projects based on our innovation, ability to deliver and to trust our customers have in us. As we build, service and modernize our customer's elevators and escalators, we build loyalty and value with increasing recurring revenue streams. For new equipment in China, Otis is building on decades of close cooperation with the nation's metro providers to help expand urban transport and city development. We'll provide 237 escalators and elevators for line 15 of the Chongqing Metro in West China, while incorporating Otis ONE on these units. Otis has a long history with Chongqing Metro, which carries more than 4 million passengers daily across rugged terrain on a network that is famous for its ingenious design and engineering. In San Francisco, Otis was awarded a comprehensive modernization of all 16 elevator units at 560 Mission Street. The project includes the installation of custom cabin interiors and our Compass 360 destination dispatch system. In addition, Otis has been awarded the maintenance contract for the 31 story commercial office building, extending our relationship with Commonwealth Partners and contributing to our service recaptures in the quarter. In Hong Kong, we are honoured to have been selected for a modernization project at Chin, Iowa State. This project for the Hong Kong Housing Authority, a longstanding customer, includes the modernization of 18 elevators, which will all be maintained by Otis upon completion. The new units will use gearless machines with energy efficient drives to meet the project's environmentally conscious requirements. In Dubai, Otis will modernize 42 elevators and eight escalators at the Burj Khalifa. We take pride in being the original equipment manufacturer and maintenance provider of the world's tallest building since its opening. Emaar Properties has trusted us with the upgrade of their controllers and drives and providing the latest technology for this iconic building. In addition, the contract extends our service agreement for another 10 years. And last, also in EMEA, for nearly 130 years, visitors have taken Otis elevators to the top of the Eiffel Tower, where we're delivering a multi-year modernization of this iconic towers two duo lifts. Turning to the fourth quarter results on Slide 5. For the fourth quarter, reported sales of $3.6 billion were up 5.3%. Organic sales grew for the 13th consecutive quarter and were up 3.8% with high-single-digit growth in service while new equipment was roughly flat in the face of the macro challenges, notably in China. Adjusted operating profit, excluding a $9 million foreign exchange tailwind increased $52 million with profit growth in both segments. Adjusted EPS grew 16% or $0.12 in the quarter. We ended the year with fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow of $573 million, allowing us to finish the year strong at approximately $1.5 billion. With that, I'll turn it over to Anurag to walk through our 2023 results in more detail. Starting on Slide 9 with the market outlook. In the Americas market in 2023, the market was down low-teens as double-digit decline in North America was partially offset by low-single-digit growth in Latin America. In EMEA, Western and Central Europe were the primary drivers, leading to a market that was down high-single-digits. In Asia, the market was down mid-single-digits, with a solid year in Asia Pacific, up low-single-digits but the performance masked by the downturn in China, which we estimate was down just north of 10%. In 2024, the global new equipment market is expected to be down low to mid-single-digits in units with markets in the Americas and EMEA down low-single-digits and markets in Asia down low to mid-single-digits driven by China. While new equipment market dynamics remain fluid, the long-term fundamentals of the industry are well supported by the service-driven growth model. In 2024, the global installed base is expected to grow at a similar rate to that of 2023 at around mid-single-digits and reach approximately 22.5 million units. In the Americas and EMEA, we expect low-single-digit growth. And in Asia, we're expecting mid-single-digit growth driven by China. Overall, we expect service to be the growth driver for the industry, and we expect the same for our business. With this as the industry backdrop, for Otis, we expect net sales of $14.5 billion to $14.8 billion, growing 3% to 5% organically or 2% to 4% at actual currency. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be between $2.4 billion and $2.45 billion, up $125 million to $175 million at actual currency or $150 million to $190 million, excluding foreign exchange headwinds. We expect adjusted EPS in the range of $3.80 to $3.90, up 7% to 10% or nearly $0.25 at the midpoint versus the prior year. Finally, we expect adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.6 billion. With our commitment to a disciplined capital allocation strategy, we expect to repurchase approximately $800 million in shares in 2024, as we look to grow our dividend payout and pursue our typical $50 million to $100 million of bolt-on M&A. With that, let me hand it back to Anurag to outline the 2024 segment outlook in more detail. No, Nigel, none at all. Yes, Nigel, let me talk to the uplift in '23. We pretty much saw it across the board, again, early days but pretty pleased with the savings we've seen and more importantly, the trajectory of where we're going with the process work with the organizational model and really changing how we work to be more customer focused. Anurag, I'll let you touch on Mod margins. Sure. So really, it's a very competitive market. We'll start there. And the market remains weak. We've called it north of 10% in terms of what we saw this year. And we're going to be very focused on continued productivity savings. But in a deflationary environment, we're seeing the costs come down, too. And that's really what's helping. The commodity costs are coming down, and it gives us this price cost neutral ability. Now listen, every day in China, we're on new equipment, we're balancing the quality of the orders the volume we're taking in and what that's contributing to our backlog margin. And we are in a market that's down 10% in this quarter, Sally and the team did a great job. We were down 5% in terms of orders. And so we did gain share and we've gained share now consistently for several years. So we're managing that carefully, but I will tell you, our China business, when you look at it as a whole, our China business contributed significantly this year, and their profit for the year was up year-over-year. When you look all in because what we've done is we've really executed our strategy well on new equipment with key accounts with our sales coverage but just as importantly, Gautam, we focused on pivoting more and growing our service business. Our service sales have grown mid-teen CAGRs. And we -- service now accounts for 25% of our China sales, which is up from mid-teens a few years ago. And we had 20% growth in both units and value in service in this last quarter, and that's the trend we've been on. So it's about balance in new equipment. But it's a growing service and long story. Yes. So the backlog itself, Julian, is obviously, we're going in with 2%. We really couldn't be more pleased with how especially Americas and EMEA really drove strong new equipment orders in the fourth quarter. Americas was up 6%, EMEA was up 11%. So everyone is going in with backlog strength with the exception of China backlog is down mid-single-digits as we go into to '24. But it's that strong backlog that's giving us that line of sight in the majority of our regions that gives us the confidence that we can -- between that and new equipment share gain of 50 basis points that we're going to sustain that gives us the confidence. Anurag, I'll let you take them through kind of how the year transpires. Sure, Julien. Let me start with North America. And as I said, our team is out there and it goes back to these long-term customer relationships that really enable the orders book to be up in the backlog to be up. But for context, the new equipment market segment in units in North America finished last year, the lowest since the GFC. And yet, we still we gain share, we delivered and we increased pricing. So our team is performing very well there. When we look at the segments themselves, none of the segments are strong in North America. Multifamily is the weakest due to several years of outpaced growth. If I had to rank order them, infrastructure is the best, and we've had really good success with major projects. We're going to continue to grow there. But all of the segments -- none of them are strong in North America. And so this is going to be a year where the benefit to Otis and why we're going to be successful is we invested in the low-rise market. We introduced our Gen3 Core product and 80% of the North American market is 2 to 6 stories. And that market, we're still seeing active bids. We've seen a great pipeline for Gen3 Core and that gives us the encouragement between the backlog and the orders we're seeing to know that we can -- it's a mid-single-digit backlog in North America. So -- and that gives us a good 12, 18 plus months line of sight for next year's revenue. In Europe, South Europe remains strong, led by Spain, we're seeing sustained activity. Central Northern Europe is weak. And again, there, infrastructure tends to lead residential is a little better in Europe than it is in North America by far. But again, we -- what we see on the ground, whether it's the German economy or any of the other locations is looks to us like '24 looks like '23 in terms of the segments in Europe. Sure. Listen, Miguel, performance can vary in any given quarter based on compares, but I'd like to take a step back and overall, for '23, we believe we gained share in China with the market down north of 10% and us coming in, again, down about 5% or actually even low-single-digits when you look for the year, but let me try and give you some additional color here. First, we did perform better in the first half of the year versus the second half but we always manage volume and share versus profitability. And we manage those dials appropriately while maintaining momentum on our share growth. Our order value declined mid-single-digits, and we've spoken all year about the deflation that's impacted the market, but we've been able to offset the price decline with better productivity. And when you look at our strategy in China, we've added the agents and distributors. It's given us the geographic and vertical coverage and we've continued to innovate and invest in our products. We've brought multiple products to the market in China. We've upgraded our escalator offering, our OH8000, and we brought Gen360 to the market in China over the past year. And that will yield for us and give us an advantage this year because of the technology because of our -- again, our reach in terms of our sales channel. Overall, we've increased our bookings in China by nearly 20% since pre-spin, while over the market over that same multiyear period is down 10% to 15%. So our strategy is working, our team is out there every day focused. We are -- our backlog, while it's down mid-single-digits, the quality of our backlog, the profitability of our backlog, we're not sacrificing for volume. Yes. So I'll comment a little on -- let me talk about the market and a little bit on the margins because the margins vary by region in terms of modernization margins. But the mod market is up nicely in all regions. And the majority of that is just driven by the refurbishment required due to the aging equipment that's out based on construction cycles from 20-plus years ago. We're just in a natural growth cycle now where you're going to see year-over-year additional Mod. Really pleased with the backlog up. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of orders up over 10%. Asia Pacific really was the standout again with Korea. But we have a great mod product in China and our China orders, albeit on a small base because it's a little bit of a younger installed base is growing significantly double-digit. And Americas and EMEA, as I said in my prepared comments, really had a strong major project contribution in Mod orders in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to continue. Again, in terms of margins, as Anurag shared, we will surpass new equipment margins shortly. But when you look in different geographies, there are different Mod margins. The market is a combination, again, of aging and safety regulations and demand creation. And I'm really proud of our team because when a part goes obsolete our team is out there. Our sales teams out there, our mechanics are out there. They're ensuring our customers know what they need to keep their elevators, not just current, but to prepare them for the future. I'm really encouraged by modernization. We've organized around it. We've set up this as a fifth strategic imperative, we have Mod kits because we are going to industrialize how we do Mods. So it will look more like new equipment coming out of a factory, and that's what's going to drive the margin expansion. Thank you, Krista. 2023 proved to be another strong year for Otis as we focused on our strategic imperatives to drive value for all stakeholders. We head into 2024 supported by the strength of our service-driven customer-centric business model and remain excited to share our 2024 successes with all of you. We look forward to you joining us at our Investor Day at the New York Stock Exchange on February 15. Please stay safe and well. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Judy. Starting with segment sales performance on Slide 6. Otis fourth quarter, new equipment sales were $1.5 billion with organic sales roughly flat driven by high-single-digit growth in Asia Pacific, offsetting mid-single-digit declines in China. Americas and EMEA were up low-single-digits and roughly flat respectively. For service, we delivered another strong quarter of organic sales growth at 6.8% with strong performance across all lines of business and regions. Maintenance and repair sales were up 6.8%, and Mod sales were up 7%, including the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Asia. For the full year, new equipment sales were $5.8 billion, and organic sales grew 2.6% with solid growth in all regions outside of China. New equipment pricing was up low-single-digits globally with Asia Pacific up low-single-digits, the Americas up mid-single-digits, and EMEA high-single-digits. Although the pricing environment in China remains challenging, we remain price cost neutral in the region from a continued focus on price discipline and material productivity. Service sales were $8.4 billion with 7.7% organic growth and all lines of business showing high-single-digit growth, including another year of outstanding performance and repair marking a three year CAGR in the low-teens. Maintenance pricing, excluding the impact of mix in churn, came in about as expected up roughly four points for the year. Turning to segment operating profit performance on Slide 7. Starting with new equipment, we delivered our best margin expansion for the year in the fourth quarter, up 120 basis points. Adjusted operating profit excluding $3 million of Forex headwind was up $20 million as strong productivity, pricing and commodity tailwinds were partially offset by unfavorable regional and product mix, alongside higher SG&A expense. Turning to Service. Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit, excluding $13 million of Forex tailwind was up $33 million as higher volumes, favorable maintenance pricing and productivity were partially offset by annual wage increases and higher material costs. For the past 16 consecutive quarters, we have delivered consistent service margin expansion. And for the second consecutive year, we expanded margin by 50 basis points exiting the year at a 24% rate. For the full year, overall operating profit was up $166 million at constant currency, and margin expanded 30 basis points. Despite the weakness in China, we were able to achieve $26 million of new equipment profit growth at constant currency as pricing, productivity and growth in all other regions more than offset unfavorable mix. This performance was better than anticipated and put us at the midpoint of our initial full year guidance for operating profit growth at constant currency as we overcame the weaker macro backdrop experienced during the year. Service operating profit increased $178 million at constant currency, supported by strong volume, pricing and productivity. Since then, we have increased service margins by 240 basis points. Slide 8 lays out the full year '23 adjusted EPS bridge. Adjusted EPS in the year grew $0.37, driven by $0.29 of solid operational performance. Accretion from the Zardoya transaction, share repurchases of $800 million and optimization of a tax rate by 40 basis points drove an additional $0.12, which more than offset $0.04 of foreign exchange headwinds. Additionally, we closed out 2023 with notable adjusted free cash flow of $573 million in the quarter, up more than 30% versus the prior year driven by higher net income and favorable working capital. In addition to the growth in down payments from increased new equipment orders in the quarter, the team continued to manage working capital well. As a result, we achieved our annual guidance generating approximately $1.5 billion of adjusted free cash flow. If we were to look back to the beginning of '23, we initially guided that we would achieve low to mid-single-digit sales growth, 20 to 30 basis points of operating profit margin expansion and approximately 8% EPS growth. Due to our operational performance, continued penetration of repair sales on a growing maintenance base robust pricing and productivity, we were able to outperform all these metrics despite an uncertain macro environment and grew adjusted EPS by approximately 12%, all while returning approximately $1.35 billion to the shareholders. With a strong end to the year on new equipment orders and solid modernization order activity throughout '23, we further expanded both our new equipment and more backlog, which will support us in '24 and beyond. I'll now turn it back to Judy to discuss our 2024 outlook. Starting on Slide 10 for the new equipment outlook. We have good line of sight for new equipment sales due to our backlog coverage, which extends out to over a year of sales. This, in combination with the share gain initiatives and incremental pricing actions we have taken over the past few years' position us relatively well for 2024. As a result, we anticipate new equipment organic sales to be flattish with Americas and EMEA up low-single-digits and Asia Pacific up mid-single-digits with mid-single-digit declines in China. We expect new equipment profit margin to be flat to up 10 basis points with roughly steady volume and tailwinds from pricing, productivity, commodities and the benefits from uplift offset by unfavorable regional and project mix alongside higher SG&A expense. Driving strong material and installation productivity and faster backlog conversion will remain a priority with the goal to again outperform our targets. Turning to Slide 11 for the service outlook. Starting with sales. We expect another solid year in service and anticipate organic sales growth of 6% to 7%. Maintenance and repair organic sales are expected to be up 5.5% to 6.5%, driven by the significant additions to our maintenance portfolio and approximately 1 point of net pricing after adjusting for mix and churn. Mid-single-digit repair growth will also contribute through both our traditional and digital channels, although at a more moderate pace than what we saw in '23. For modernization, we anticipate organic sales growth of about 8% as we execute on a solid backlog, which similar to new equipment, extends out over a year and ended the year up in the mid-teens. Our strategy of standardizing products and driving more supply chain and factory optimization will enable us to accelerate sales growth above the 7% achieved in '23. This also has the added benefit of helping to drive modernization margin expansion. Turning to service profit. We expect roughly 50 basis points of margin expansion, continued strong volume, price, productivity and uplift are expected to more than offset annual wage inflation and higher SG&A similar to '23. Now turning to Slide 12. We began executing Project Uplift initiatives in the second half of '23 as we leverage enterprise scale, optimize our indirect and supply chain spend and improve and standardize our processes. We are on-track to achieve our targeted savings of $150 million with $80 million of run rate savings anticipated by year-end 2024, and $150 million in run rate savings by mid-'25. Out of the $150 million in total savings to be realized, nearly half will come from leveraging enterprise scale roughly 25% from indirect and supply chain optimization and the rest from process improvements and standardization. We continue to analyze and execute on the opportunities and estimate 70% of the savings will be in the service segment with the remaining split between new equipment and corporate. Moving to the '24 EPS bridge on Slide 13. Our guidance for adjusted EPS is $3.80 to $3.90 driven by approximately $0.30 of operating profit growth at the midpoint, reflecting organic sales growth of 3% to 5%, with approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion. Below the line, we expect to offset $0.03 to $0.04 of Forex and increased interest expense headwinds with continued optimization of our tax rate and the benefit of approximately $800 million in share repurchases supported by $1.6 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Looking at the EPS cadence for the year, we expect the $0.30 of EPS growth to be fairly level loaded between the first and the second half, while in the first half, we expect the first quarter EPS growth to be a couple of cents lighter than the second quarter. A little bit more color on the first quarter metrics, starting with orders. We faced a difficult compare versus the first quarter of last year where we grew more than 7%. So we expect new equipment orders to be down roughly 10%, while portfolio and modernization orders growth should remain strong. As for sales and profit, sales growth will be roughly 3%, and total company operating profit margins should expand over 50 basis points to 16%-plus both led by service. Below the line, headwinds from higher interest costs and a tax rate roughly in line with the prior year due to timing will be offset by lower share count. All in, this should lead to $0.06 to $0.07 of EPS growth driven primarily by operational performance. Overall, our outlook reflects another year of performance led by consistent service business. We remain focused on continuing to mitigate macro challenges and further driving shareholder value. With that, I will request Krista to please open the line for questions. Let me clarify, the 1% that I spoke in my prepared comments was on maintenance pricing. So what we'll see is we'll see adjusted for mix and churn. So we'll see about 3% on a like-to-like basis and just for that. On the new equipment side, clearly, we've seen good price increases in '23 in America, EMEA and AP. Some of that will continue over in '24 new equipment. But China does have price pressure as we saw in '23, but it's a deflationary economy, so we expect it to be price cost neutral. Yes. On the Mod margins, as we said a few months ago that we expect it to be at par with new equipment in a few months and then started going up, and we see that trajectory pretty good. We'll give a little bit more color on the Investor Day in a couple of weeks, but that is on the right trend. And for the uplift savings, I think the cadence, what I outlined in the prepared comments, 70% in service, and the rest between new equipment and corporate, that should be for this year as well. So we're going to exit the year $80 million and in year of $40 million with similar cadence across that. The $40 million is net savings, which is flowing through to the P&L or uplift, right? So if you look at in 2024, we are going to grow our operating profit at constant currency by approximately $170 million. About $140 million of that is price cost. The price is what Nigel asked me earlier, a little bit from the service side, from the new equipment side. We're still seeing commodity tailwinds, a little bit a little bit lighter than '23, but that's obviously positive. So the -- and the uplift is contributing $40 million to that, right? So if you add all of that together, we're getting our price cost of about $140 million, and the rest is coming from volume, net of mix. So the $40 million of uplift is 100% net flow through to the P&L. Yes. Thanks, Judy. Yes. So as you said, Julian, our book-to-bill was more than 1x in \u201823. We expect that to be similar in '24 because orders are quite higher than our new equipment revenue. So as we go through the course of the year, we do expect to finish even if we perform in line with our market outlook and don't even increase share, we should end the year at a backlog flattish to be slightly higher. Clearly, the comps are tough for us in the first quarter in terms of new equipment orders, but then they get easier for us in the second and third quarter. So you will see a little bit of generation quarter-by-quarter, but we are confident that given this market outlook, if it stays the way we should remain in the year with a flattish or slightly higher backlog. Yes. Just to add to that, Miguel, I mean I can't speak about the others, but for us, we're clearly seeing the trajectory on margins pick up. And there's no reason why it should be much higher than equipment. And as we standardize our products, optimize the supply chain, do better on the go-to-market strategy, we see that inching up. And as I said, we'll talk more about it in the next couple of weeks. But clearly, the margin should be outpaced new equipment margins."

Presentation materials are available for download from Otis' website at www.otis.com. I'll now turn it over to Michael Rednor, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rednor: Thank you, Michelle. Welcome to Otis' third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Judy Marks, Chair, CEO and President; and Anurag Maheshwari, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations excluding restructuring and significant non-recurring items. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis' SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide additional details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Mike and thank you everyone for joining us. We hope that everyone listening is safe and well. Starting with Q3 highlights on slide three, Otis achieved strong results in the third quarter marking nine months of solid execution in 2023. We grew organic sales 5.2% with growth in both segments, expanded operating profit margin 60 basis points, and achieved 19% adjusted EPS growth. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter of service organic sales growth, and the 15th quarter where our service operating profit margin has expanded, demonstrating the consistency in our execution and the strength of our strategy. With our fourth consecutive quarter of maintenance portfolio growth above 4% and backlog growth in both new equipment and modernization, we have set ourselves up nicely for the future. Last quarter, we announced the launch of our Gen 3 core elevator in North America. And in the third quarter, we sold our first units. This new product addresses the needs of our customers and the two to six storey building segment, the largest by volume in North America. We also continue to drive progress toward our ESG commitments. For the second year in a row we achieved a gold rating from EcoVadis, ranking us within the top 5% of all assessed companies. We're also proud to have been named by Newsweek as one of the world's most trustworthy companies and one of America's greenest companies. Let me share a few customer highlights from the third quarter. In British Columbia, Otis is providing seven SkyRise and eight Gen 3 edge elevators for South Yards, a mixed-use development by Anthem properties. South yards will include more than 2,500 residential units and over 60,000 square feet of retail and office space surrounding a one-acre community park. In Hong Kong SAR, we're supplying 47 Gen 3 units to enhance access to more than 30 elevated walkways. These elevators will provide improved accessibility for the aging population and people with disabilities, a key part of Hong Kong's Universal Accessibility Initiative. Construction is expected to be complete in July of 2026. In Saudi Arabia, we secured a contract to modernize 18 elevators at the Saudi National Bank headquarters in Riyadh. As part of the modernization, we'll upgrade the controllers in the high-rise units, while adding our Otis ONE IoT solution. This new project builds on our existing relationship with the Saudi National Bank headquarters, which has 47 Otis units in total. And in China, we received a contract to maintain 351 units at Shanghai's Pudong Airport, with 271 of these returning to the Otis portfolio as a recapture. Pudong Airport is a critical cargo access point in East Asia, while also serving roughly 80 million passengers each year. We're proud to say we now maintain all Otis units at the airport. We announced our uplift program last quarter and in Q3 we began executing initiatives focused on three essential areas: gaining scale across our global organization to unlock synergies; standardizing our processes to generate efficiencies; and driving supplier and indirect spend optimization. We are on track to meet our stated expected run rate savings of $150 million by mid-year 2025. Taken together, these initiatives drive further value for our customers, organizational effectiveness, and sustainable profitable growth. Moving to slide four, Q3 results and 2023 outlook. Organic sales in the quarter grew 5.2%. Service was up 8.4% with all lines of business contributing and new equipment up 1% with growth in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. Although new equipment orders declined 10% versus the prior year, backlog was up at 2% at constant currency. Our share in the quarter remained relatively flat, leaving us at approximately 50 basis points of share gain year-to-date. Order growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific was more than offset by declines in the Americas and China. In service, modernization orders remain strong, up 13% in Q3. The fifth consecutive quarter of Mod orders grew at above 10%, driven by strong performance in EMEA, China, and Asia Pacific. Mod backlog was up 15%, giving us line of sight to sales over the next several quarters. With adjusted operating profit growth of $47 million in the quarter, we expanded margins by 60 basis points, driven by 90 basis points of service adjusted operating profit margin expansion. We generated $272 million of free cash flow, driven by higher net income. To summarize, we executed our strategy, growing the portfolio above 4%, increasing our new equipment and Mod backlogs, giving us a strong base to execute on for the next several quarters, while expanding operating profit margins as we drive a consistent operating cadence in the business, ultimately leading to just under 20% EPS growth. Ultimately, we believe we're set up well, despite the relatively weaker macro picture we're facing, which I'll discuss next. For global new equipment unit bookings, Asia Pacific continues to grow, although we now expect it to be up low to mid-single-digits, a step down from our prior expectations. We anticipate that EMEA will decline high-single-digits in line with our expectations for last quarter. While Americas, we now expect to decline mid-teens and China to decline north of 10%, both worse than we were anticipating just a few months ago, as the macro environment remains challenging. In total, this would leave global new equipment bookings somewhere around 850,000 units, down approximately 10% versus 2022. In service, although global new equipment unit bookings are smaller than we anticipated, we still expect the service installed base to grow nearly 5% this year, as units that were booked two to three years ago and installed one to two years ago roll off their warranty periods. This will put the global service installed base somewhere between 21 million units to 22 million units by year end of which we currently maintain approximately 2.2 million and expect to end the year around 2.3 million units in our maintenance portfolio. With that as the global backdrop, let me now update you on Otis's financial outlook. We expect organic sales growth of approximately 5.5% with net sales of about $14.1 billion. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be approximately $2.265 billion, up $170 million at constant currency. At actual currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $140 million, including a foreign exchange headwind of $30 million. We're raising our outlook for adjusted EPS, now expected to be $3.52, up 11% versus the prior year. We now expect free cash flow of about $1.5 billion, or approximately 105% conversion of GAAP net income. We still expect share repurchases of $800 million. With that, I'll turn it over to Anurag to walk through our Q3 results in more detail.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Thank you, Judy, and good morning everyone. Starting with third quarter results on slide five. Net sales of $3.5 billion grew 5.4% and organic sales were up 5.2% with growth in both segments. Adjusted operating profit was up $52 million at actual FX and $47 million at constant currency with margins expanding 60 basis points to 16.9%. Drop-through on service volume, productivity, and pricing in both segments, and commodity tailwinds were partially offset by inflationary pressures, including annual wage increases and higher corporate costs. Adjusted EPS increased 19% or $0.15, with over half of this improvement coming from strong operational performance and the rest from a combination of a capital allocation initiatives and ongoing effort to reduce the tax rate, which came in at 25.5% in the quarter. Free cash flow came in at $272 million, up $57 million versus prior year, largely driven by higher net income. Year-to-date, we generated $934 million of free cash flow, $81 million lower versus the prior year, driven by lower down payments on fewer new equipment orders and the continued outperformance of a repair business as this work tends to be paid in [areas] (ph). Moving to slide six. Let me start by giving some color on Q3 new equipment orders and backlog. In the third quarter, at constant currency, new equipment orders declined 10% versus prior year. Despite this, our new equipment backlog increased 2% with mid-teens growth in Asia Pacific, mid-single-digit growth in the Americas, and EMEA roughly flat. China backlog is down low-single-digits. Sequentially outside of China, our new equipment backlog was relatively stable in all regions. Globally, pricing on new equipment orders was up low-single-digits, building on a similar increase in the third quarter of the prior year. Excluding China, pricing improved by mid-single-digits are better in all regions. Although pricing was down mid-single-digits in China due to macro challenges, we remained price cost neutral in the region from our continued focus on driving material productivity. New equipment organic sales were up 1% in the quarter with strong growth in all regions outside of China. Asia Pacific grew low-teens driven by continued performance in India, as well as traction with major projects. In EMEA, new equipment sales grew high-single-digits underpinned by the significant orders over the past several quarters in Southern Europe and the Middle East, while in the Americas the region grew high-single-digits for the second consecutive quarter, executing on its multi-billion-dollar backlog. We grew new equipment operating profit by $10 million at constant currency, despite China sales coming in weaker than expected. Driving productivity, pricing flowed through from the backlog, and tailwinds from commodities more than offset the project in regional mixed headwinds, leading to a 7.2% margin in the quarter. Turning to service segment results on slide seven. Maintenance units were up 4.2% with growth in all regions, led by high-teens growth in China for the fourth quarter in a row. We deliver another strong quarter of modernization orders, up 13% including China Mod orders growing double-digits from continued success of new product offerings. Asia-Pacific also grew double-digits due to a number of volume and major project wins with standout performance coming from North Asia. EMEA Mod orders grew 10% driven by major project wins. At quarter end our Mod backlog was up 15% with growth in all regions. Service revenue came in better-than-expected with all lines of business contributing to organic sales growth of 8.4%. Maintenance and repair was up 8.6% from higher than anticipated repair volumes, and Mod was up 7.6% with growth across all regions highlighted by a double-digit increase in Asia. Service pricing excluding mix and churn came in around 4 points, similar to last quarter's performance, and adjusted for mix and churn was a net 2 points. Higher volume, favorable pricing, and productivity were partially offset by annual wage increases and higher material costs, leading to $53 million of service profit growth at constant currency. Service adjusted operating profit margin expanded 90 basis points in the quarter to 24.8%. Overall, we are pleased with our results in the quarter, as well as year-to-date. We've grown our new equipment and Mod backlogs, expanded the portfolio at 4% and delivered over 10% EPS growth. Moving to slide eight, and the revised outlook. Starting with sales, total Otis organic sales are expected to be up approximately 5.5% consistent with the midpoint of a prior guide, including slight adjustments by segment. Adjusted operating profit growth at constant currency is expected to be $170 million, a $5 million increase versus the prior guide's midpoint, and the result of strong performance in the service segment. At actual currency, we expect adjusted operating profit of $2.265 billion, as the better operating performance is offset by a slightly higher foreign exchange headwind, driven by a change in the euro and the weakening of various Asian currencies such as the CNY. Our margin expectations remain unchanged with service margins expected to expand 50 basis points to 24% and new equipment margins expected to expand 20 basis points to just under 7%. This puts overall operating margins at approximately 16%, up 30 basis points. We have grazed our guidance for adjusted EPS, now expected to be up 11% versus the prior guide, to $3.52. This represents a $0.04 increase versus the prior guide's midpoint, largely driven by strong operational performance and improvements in below-the-line items, including tax now expected to end the year at 26%. We expect to generate approximately $1.5 billion in free cash flow, a roughly 105% conversion rate, and return substantially all of it to shareholders through $1.35 billion of dividends and share repurchases. Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on slide nine. We now expect new equipment organic sales growth of approximately 3% at the low-end of the prior range driven by larger than expected headwinds in China, which we expect to be down mid-single-digits. The Americas and EMAs are still expected to grow mid-single-digits organically. In service, organic sales are expected to be up approximately 7.5%, a 1 point increase versus the midpoint of the prior guide driven by maintenance and repair. Consistent maintenance portfolio growth and pricing, together with another quarter of strong repair volume, enable us to raise the outlook by 130 basis points to up 7.3% versus the prior guide. Modernization organic sales expectations remain unchanged, up 8% as we execute on our backlog, which was up 15% at quarter end. Moving to slide 10, we have raised our expectations for adjusted EPS and now anticipate growth of approximately 11% or $3.52, a $0.35 increase versus the prior year driven by $0.30 of operational improvement. In closing, we continue to execute well on the things we can control, and our resilient service business is driving profitable growth in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Our strong year-to-date performance gives us confidence to again raise our EPS outlook and deliver a solid fourth quarter, while positioning us well to perform in \u201824 and beyond. With that, Michelle, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Judy or Anurag, could you just elaborate a little bit more on your view on both America's and China new equipment, kind of, the downward tick in the outlook, and maybe just some thoughts on kind of even the trajectory as we exit 2023 into 2024 in those particular regions?\nJudy Marks: Yes, happy to, Jeff. Let me start with the Americas. So we now believe the new equipment market in the Americas is going to be down mid-teens, and we're really seeing that with the highest impact being the interest rates remaining high. It really is impacting new project starts. We've seen that in the most recent ABI and Dodge data. So we're watching that closely. I would tell you the residential, it performed the worst in the third quarter, followed by commercial not being great and infrastructure for the quarter being relatively flat. We expect infrastructure to pick up, you know, as we go into \u201824. We tend to see that a little later in the cycle versus the early construction companies with all the infrastructure activity that's starting. What I do like about the Americas beyond their performance, and they really had a strong performance in terms of backlog conversion, is we still have strong mid-single-digit backlog on new equipment. That puts us in a really good position, not just for the fourth quarter, but I would tell you with our cycle time in the Americas, it gives us really good line of sight for the next 12 to 18 months, especially in North America, which is the majority of our Americas business. So we'll wait and see what happens with interest rates. If this does become the new normal, we think people will adjust because housing demand is real. It's still there. So we have to wait and see where this equilibrium is going come out with the developers and when they go ahead with projects. We're not seeing a decline in terms of interest or proposals, so we really, at this point, it's about people having conviction to start the projects from a development perspective. In China, the new equipment market does remain somewhat weak, and it's worse than we saw it a quarter ago when we told you we didn't see that inflection point for book and ship. We're now saying it's really down. You know, the China market itself is really down north of 10%. So we are continuing to focus on our pivot in China. And you know, I couldn't be more proud of our team in China in terms of what we've done on the maintenance side to offset this, as well as really how we've managed material productivity to be able to drive that cost price neutral scenario in China. We have picked up share in China for the year and so we will continue even though the backlog is down, our team is continuing to fight for all units and execute our strategy which has been in play, which is focusing on key accounts, mainly state-owned enterprises and continuing new product introduction and expansion on Otis ONE. So our Mod is up in China for the fifth straight quarter, sorry, for this year it's up double-digits, so for all year. We've had the ninth straight quarter in China on the service side of mid to high-teens service growth. So we're finding a nice place there in terms of this pivot to becoming more of a service provider. But new equipment is our highest margin in China and I think what you see with the results is despite China being down, our other three regions really picked it up nicely for us to be able to hold margins at 7% on new equipment for the quarter and to grow organically 1% even with China down fairly significantly. So we'll wait and see what happens in terms of stimulus. Obviously, we've seen certain actions already in China in terms of easing monetary support, postponing property taxes, loosening credit policy for mortgages, but we really do -- are watching sentiment and liquidity. Those are the two items that we're watching.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great. And just to shift completely in a different direction, you know, you started the conversation, Judy, with uplift, kind of, getting off the ground. I guess no pun intended. But maybe just a little bit of color. Is it impacting results in Q3? How do you see kind of the staging of that $150 million that you're talking about?\nJudy Marks: Yes, there is no impact in Q3. We just, early days for us, we've kicked off the key activities, including the operating model, a lot of education inside the company, and a lot of focus now on process redesign and indirect spend. You'll see that start coming through slightly in Q4, but 2024 is when you'll really start seeing that impact and then we'll achieve the run rate. We're very comfortable with all the analysis we've done, as well as some of the decisions we've taken already that the $150 million is absolutely achievable.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Please stand by for our next question. The next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning everyone. So, I understand the kind of like the weakness you've update across the globe. I mean, are we seeing any, you know, product cancellations, you know, with the rising rates, you know, some projects not penciled out. So, just wondering on that. And then -- but really, I did want to dig a bit more into China with the pricing down, mid-single-digits. I think that the view was that China would not, kind of, be as bad as perhaps prior down cycles, because margins there are much lower. So just curious how you see the risk of further deterioration in China? And you mentioned price costs remaining positive or rather neutral in China. You know, are China margins holding in there? You know, or are we seeing some deterioration in margins?\nJudy Marks: Yes, let me start and then I'll have Anurag. Nigel, we're not seeing project cancellations at any level different than we have in the past. And we can say that everywhere in the globe. There are always a small amount of project cancellations that occur in which we retain the deposit and the advanced deposit, but nothing unusual there. In terms of China, let me just make sure everyone understands that China now represents about 17% of our global revenue. Now there are several reasons for that. One, is a down China market, but second is with us now out looking, you know, $14.1 billion in revenue and organic growth of 5.5%. You can see that the impact and the pickup of the other three regions in terms of their growth. So, you know, nice call out, America's, EMEA, Asia Pacific, really good revenue growth, as you saw in Anurag's presentation. But China's now about a 17% of our total revenue down from 20% traditionally. So, you know, that's just the reality of where the numbers are right now. On price cost, Anurag why don\u2019t you comment?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes, so on price cost as you mentioned Nigel, we are, you know, either neutral or positive right? In China definitely pricing the new equipment side is coming down, but we are driving hard on material productivity, and the -- it's a deflationary economy over there as well. So a combination of that and this pricing discipline in the market, you put all of that together. Right now, price cost is favorable, and we are able to offset the China mix as you saw in third quarter with a new equipment margin being at 7.2%. And even if you look at the fourth quarter implied outlook its -- new equipment margin is going to be about 7%, even though China is going to be down. So and a couple of reasons one is obviously the price cost in China. Second, pricing in all the other markets that has gone up over the past 12, 15-months, which is in our backlog, has started flushing through to the P&L. We again saw this quarter another $10 million pick up of pricing. We're going to see that similar in the next quarter, and commodities are tailwind. So if I look at pricing in the backlog overall, which is probably up 50 basis points to 70 basis points, and if we snap the line on commodity today, right, we should still see another $40 million or so tailwind next year. You add these two things together, I think it more than kind of makes up for the China mix for us to believe that a new equipment is at a sustainable margin rate.\nNigel Coe: Okay, great. And I know there's about three questions in there, but if I can get one more as a follow-on, just to follow-on Jeff's question on the uplift program at that point in time. So obviously the $150 million run rate, I'm assuming that's an exit $25 million run rate. What would you feel comfortable in a dialed in for FY \u201824 in terms of cost savings and what sort of restructuring would be associated with that savings?\nJudy Marks: Well, we're not going to guide yet for \u201824 uplift savings. So we just need to be, yes, we're not prepared to do that yet. We'll get back to you, obviously, when we do our \u201824 guide to let you know what's going to be in that late January. In terms of restructuring, I think we've been\u2026\nAnurag Maheshwari: Exactly. So first is, you know, program's off to a great start, as Judy mentioned. We'll give an update next year. In terms of to achieve the $150 million of savings, the restructuring cost is about $150 million. It's a one-on-one, right? It's going to start this quarter, but obviously we're going to start seeing the savings coming in next year.\nNigel Coe: That's great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Please stand by for the next question. The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to start off with the global new equipment revenue outlook. So you've been, you know, feeding off a good backlog there and the organic sales maybe flat to up 1% year-on-year in new equipment in the back half of the current year? I just wondered though when you look at the sort of 12-month rolling on new equipment orders down 4%, year-to-date down 6%, last quarter down 10%, and then we think about sort of the nature of how quickly the backlog wears off. It's very fast in China, slower the rest of the world? Is it sort of base assumption as we start out next year that new equipment sales are down then as those weaker orders feed through?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. Hey, thanks for the question, Julian. Yes, so firstly, you know, our backlog is up 2% right now on the new equipment side. We do think that even if orders are down low to mid-single-digits in the fourth quarter, our backlog is going to be flattish to slightly up. And the reason is because we tend to book more orders than revenue over the past couple of years, some of them being major projects. So our assumption is that backlogs should be flattish to up by end of the year. Now within that, America's, Europe, and Asia Pacific, if you put that together, that backlog is up low to mid-single-digit. And that represents roughly about two-thirds of a new equipment revenue. So that should be kind of up low to mid-single-digit next year, let's say low-single-digit. The big variable, of course, is one-third of the revenue, which is China. Right now China backlog is down low-single-digit. It could be down mid-single-digit by end of the year. And what happens to the market over there? It could be flattish, it could be down 10%, it could be up, right? So that we do not know as to where that's going to happen. But let's assume that the market goes down next year and then China is probably down 5%. So that would mean that our new equipment revenue could be flattish. So -- but if I put things in a perspective, it could be flattish, it could be up 2%, it could be down 2%. But 2% or 3% of new equipment revenue is about a couple of $100 million of revenue. And if we look at our margin, it's about $14 million, $15 million, $18 million of profit, so it's just $0.02 or $0.03 of EPS. If you look at what we did this year, we more than overcame that through the service business, which is why we, you know, our guide bent up every quarter because of lack of service. So we think we should be able to make that up next year through our service business.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. And thanks, Anurag. And maybe just my follow-up would be around the service margins perhaps. So, you know, one element is, you know, if I just, maybe it's some incorrect math\u2019s, but it looks like the service margin in Q4 in the guide is down sequentially off flat sales and sort of flattish year-on-year, despite a big increase year-to-date. So just wanted to check if that's right and if it's just conservatism or what have you? And then secondly, on the service margin, how are we thinking about sort of price cost or price net of material cost and service wages playing out? Is that, sort of, getting larger into next year or narrowing as a tailwind? Just any context around that, please.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Oh, absolutely. So I'll break it up into two separate questions over here. So first is, yes, the guide implies 24% margin for service in the fourth quarter, which is eventually down 80 basis points, but we're going to exit the year at what we guided for the full-year, which is 24%. It's a very healthy margin rate. It's from last year where we actually, it's a tough compare because last year we grew margins by 60 basis points, 70 basis points in the same quarter. And the reason there's a difference between the 24.8% and 24% is largely two things. It's the mix, we -- I mean, we are very encouraged. I mean, the performance in third quarter margin was fantastic. I mean, if you look at the portfolio maintenance side, portfolio is growing, pricing is sticking, we are flushing more backlog into revenue, and the repair business, which we thought after two years of very high growth was going to slow down, is not, and it's because of the strategy of the team of penetrating more of the portfolio, and that mix was high in the third quarter and obviously productivity which helped us get to the 24.8%. The big difference between Q3 and Q4 is now we're assuming that repair to be flattish in the fourth quarter and Mod growing double-digit. So that is a mixed impact which is leading for the margins to be lower, but net-net, we're exiting the year at what we guided, so feel pretty good about it on the service side.\nJudy Marks: Yes, Julian, on the second question where you're talking about wages and inflation, inflation on the service side, while we have had wage inflation, you know, we know we need to offset that with productivity, and what we've been doing with price has been fairly significant. We have another quarter where our service pricing, like-for-like is up 4 points, and with inflation staying pretty high, especially in EMEA and in the Americas, we should be able to as we negotiate the majority of our maintenance contracts, you know, first, second quarter next year, which are mainly backward looking for this year's inflation, we expect to be able to get price again at levels comparable to that for 2024. We have line of sight now, the majority of our \u201823 maintenance contracts are in the books, as our commodity prices and everything else as we go with 2.5 months left to go now. So we're actually feeling pretty good about service pricing for next year and price cost. And we've negotiated with the majority of our collective bargaining across the globe. Most of our mechanics are represented. And I think, I know we've treated them fairly and we're able to recover that in both price and productivity.\nJulian Mitchell: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Please stand by for the next question. The next question comes from Joe O\u2019Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to circle back to the backlog comments and could you just expand on how much of next 12-months revenue you generally have visibility into based on backlog levels and talk about that in America's and Europe and then in China. And in particular in China, then the mix that would be coming out of backlog and the mix would be book-and-ship and what you're seeing in some of those book-and-ship trends recently?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes, absolutely. If you look at a backlog, it is significantly more than a 12-month revenue, because we got major projects in there. We have other kind of long-tailed projects as well. But very specifically, the reason why I said earlier we have confidence of America and Europe, kind of, growing low-single-digit next year is the back half -- even if we snap the line today, we have very high visibility of that converting. We enter any political year with 80%, 90% of America's and EMEA revenue coming out of backlog. Followed by that is Asia-Pacific Ex-China, which is probably a little bit lower, depending upon the geography mix, but that backlog is up very healthy. It's probably double-digit up, right? Then China is the only one where we have higher book-and-ship. So when we enter the year, I would say two-thirds of that revenue probably comes from the backlog and a third comes from the book-in-ship, which is why for three out of four regions, we feel it's low-single-digit growth for next year. China is the only variable that we need to see how the next few month\u2019s go.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Got it. That's helpful. And then just some perspective on where China volumes are. Can you talk about for the total market where unit volumes have been over the last several years where they're trending this year? How you think it's setting up in terms of next year for some perspective on the current softness relative to recent strength?\nJudy Marks: Yes, Joe, we would tell you that, you know, if you go back to peak years in China, we probably peaked the segment, peaked new equipment at about 650,000 units. That's been coming down now for the past two years, and we're at about 450,000 currently for this year. Still 450,000 of the 850,000 global units. So still a large healthy market. And 450,000 you'd probably have to go back to 2018-ish timeframe to where we had, you know, obviously pre-COVID to having a market like this. And so we still think it's a very attractive market. We've gained share there this year as we look in China and we will continue to execute our strategies of our agents and distributors being our partners, which we now have about 2,350 agents and distributors, more than twice since we spun. We focus on our key accounts. And we've also really focused on the Tier cities that are having an impact. So if you look at the third quarter, Tier 1 cities, Beijing, Shanghai had the best market segments. And then, you know, obviously it trailed off as you got all the way to Tier 5. So we've adjusted our strategy. That's why our agents and distributors are so helpful, as well as our internal sales folks that support them. The key accounts, again, those relationships are strong, and they are yielding for us.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Thank you. I appreciate the details.\nOperator: Please stand by for the next question. The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, good morning.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Hey, good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: You mentioned the trends of what's going on in China. I think one of your competitors had some pretty big orders numbers there today. Can you maybe help reconcile that? Because I think you guys are obviously, I think you were down, but maybe could you just maybe help reconcile what the difference might be? Obviously, any quarter there's some lumpiness, but just curious from a share perspective there, just trying to tie those two things together.\nJudy Marks: Yes, I think you're going to, I mean, orders are lumpy, kind of, across the board for both modernization and new equipment. And I would argue share is also, kind of, hard to measure on a quarterly basis and something more you'd like to do on an annual level when you really have some fidelity in the information. I can't comment on what our competitors are doing, but I can tell you that, you know, we're, again, our China team is executing our strategy. In a down market, you know, our China team has both driven cost out in terms of material productivity. So that, again, if you look at and you step back, you know, we're driving growth in all lines of business in Otis, especially in service. We're seeing good growth in three regions outside of China. But our China team has really in despite a tough macro environment on new equipment, has really now added this service component, which now we're at 365,000 units in our portfolio in China, more than double from when we spun. And our China modernization business has grown double-digits this year. So we're finding we're moving Mod into the factory, so we're optimizing the cost basis there, and you're going to see that modernization business really in China, as well as globally take off. And for us, we need to watch that mix. That's what Anurag commented on for fourth quarter for service margins. But we think, we know it's actually worth getting that modernization business, because it will bring more units to our portfolio. So we're going to end this year at 2.3 million units in our portfolio. And when you think about 1% portfolio growth throughout the decade before we spun, and now us, four straight quarters over 4%, we're going to end this year at 2.3 million units. And that is the strongest, but it's still at 2.3 million units of a $21 million, $22 million segment leaves us lots of room for growth. And that's why we're convinced the service-driven growth strategy globally is the right answer for us and our shareholders.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, clearly the service is very strong. Just a question on cash flow, I missed the first part of the call, but any reason for that tweak on cash specifically?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Oh yes, absolutely. It's two weeks, okay, So firstly on cash we are at about $934 million. We got $550 million and I guess your question is tweaking it to the low-end of the guidance is two reasons; one is clearly lower down payments, because of new equipment orders which have been a little bit lower. But second is also a repair business which has grown very, we started this year would be low-single-digit repair. It's growing at a very good rate. Great for sales, great for profit on the P&L side, but we do get paid after we complete our work, so it's a little bit of a receivable drag. I think it's a combination of these two reasons why you see a little bit of a tweak in the cash flow guide.\nJudy Marks: Yes, and for any of our customers listening, Steve, I think it's important they know that when they need a repair, we do the repair. And then we make sure we bill and follow-up to collect. And that's really what happens in that repair world. We know customers, if they've got an elevator down, we're going to get them back up.\nSteve Tusa: Sorry, sorry, one last quick one. A lot of volatility in multifamily in the U.S., kind of hard to tell where that business is going. Any impact on you guys from that? And thanks a lot for the answers to the questions.\nJudy Marks: Yes, so I mean, that multifamily was our, from a market perspective, a segment perspective, was the worst performing in the U.S. this past quarter. Now, it's down off record highs for multiple years, and there's still demand for it, but we're just seeing the developers slow down on the start button, which is when we get those advances that Anurag was talking about in his cash answer. So we'll wait and see. If rates stay where they are, you know, developers will figure out the math for this because demand is still there for housing. So, you know, we're in a wait and see, but our backlog in especially in North America is strong mid-single-digit, including a lot of multifamily in the backlog. So we're going to keep performing, and then our team will drive the orders as they come.\nSteve Tusa: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Please stand by for the next question. The next question comes from Nick Housden with RBC. Your line is open.\nNick Housden: Yes. Hi Judy, Anurag, Mike. Thanks for the questions. So, yes, just on that free cash flow point, I mean, it looks like China is never going to go back to that 650,000 unit mark. So I'm just wondering if that means that over the medium term there needs to be a permanent reset on the expectations for cash conversion from the current 100%, 110% target that you've already got. That's the first one, thanks.\nJudy Marks: Well, I can take that 1. The answer is no. No reset.\nNick Housden: Okay.\nAnurag Maheshwari: There's no reset because, I mean, at the two -- with the new, lower -- definitely lower orders, but also we're executing on high backlogs. All these will normalize and the repair revenue will also, kind of, we start converting more into cash. So I don't think there's any reason for us to reset the target, yes.\nNick Housden: Okay. Great. Very clear. And then just a second question on some of the competitive dynamics in modernization. So it sounds like when you guys or some of your European competitors modernize a unit, especially in China, it's almost always someone else's unit and very often it's one of the Asian competitors units that you're modernizing and then moving into your own portfolio. Are the Asian guys just not focused on modernization? Or why does it seem to be the case that you are kind of eating their lunch there?\nJudy Marks: Well, your hypothesis that most of our modernization is on non-Otis equipment in China is accurate. But remember, our China market share is or our share of segment in service is pretty low, because 75% of all the units in China are maintained by ISPs. So I wouldn't specifically say it's, you know, some of the units we're getting back, our Otis units that are not on portfolio. Many are non-Otis units, but they're not necessarily, you know, Japanese or European. I can't comment on who they are. What we've done is we've created very innovative packages to be able to put our hardware on non-Otis equipment to modernize it, to add new technology, and then to convert it into our portfolio.\nNick Housden: Okay, great, Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our Next question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nGautam Khanna: Hey, good morning, guys.\nJudy Marks: Good morning.\nGautam Khanna: I had two questions. First, Anurag, on your comment about escalators next year being comparable to that of this year. I was just wondering if you could elaborate maybe by region and why that's so given the level of inflation this year seems below that of last year? And then I have a follow-up.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. Sorry, you got an email on the service business, the price escalation?\nGautam Khanna: Yes.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. So, yes, listen. Let's start with Europe where we got about half of our portfolio over there. Inflation is still pretty high in Europe, not as high as last year, but not too far off from there. And most of our contracts are right now in negotiation and they're obviously linked to an index. So we feel pretty good about the pricing increase in Europe next year. It could be around the mid-single-digit level again, so that's really encouraging. Inflation in America is also not coming down to a great extent, so we should see that. So these two definitely give us confidence on our pricing going up. The rest of Asia has always been a low to mid-single-digit price increase. That will continue. And China, I think, as I mentioned earlier, there is more price discipline, but it's never been a price escalator market on the service side. So put all of that together, it gives us confidence there's going to be another good price increase next year on top of our portfolio growth, which should mean that our maintenance business should grow mid-single-digit plus.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And just a quick follow-up. Could you talk a little bit about any trends in churn coming down in the quarter? And maybe year-to-date on service renewals?\nJudy Marks: So we will share our statistics at our fourth quarter earnings. We do that on an annual basis, but there's no significant changes that we've seen, but we'll share that next quarter.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you.\nOperator: I show no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Judy Marks for closing remarks.\nJudy Marks: Yes, thank you, Michelle. Our service-driven business model is working as we approach 2.3 million units in our portfolio by year-end with the compounding lifetime value of each additional unit. Year-to-date results are indicative of the strength of our strategy as we continue to prioritize value creation for our shareholders for the remainder of 2023 and beyond. Thank you for joining us today. Stay safe and well.\nOperator: Thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Mike and thank you everyone for joining us. We hope that everyone listening is safe and well. Starting with Q3 highlights on slide three, Otis achieved strong results in the third quarter marking nine months of solid execution in 2023. We grew organic sales 5.2% with growth in both segments, expanded operating profit margin 60 basis points, and achieved 19% adjusted EPS growth. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter of service organic sales growth, and the 15th quarter where our service operating profit margin has expanded, demonstrating the consistency in our execution and the strength of our strategy. With our fourth consecutive quarter of maintenance portfolio growth above 4% and backlog growth in both new equipment and modernization, we have set ourselves up nicely for the future. Last quarter, we announced the launch of our Gen 3 core elevator in North America. And in the third quarter, we sold our first units. This new product addresses the needs of our customers and the two to six storey building segment, the largest by volume in North America. We also continue to drive progress toward our ESG commitments. For the second year in a row we achieved a gold rating from EcoVadis, ranking us within the top 5% of all assessed companies. We're also proud to have been named by Newsweek as one of the world's most trustworthy companies and one of America's greenest companies. Let me share a few customer highlights from the third quarter. In British Columbia, Otis is providing seven SkyRise and eight Gen 3 edge elevators for South Yards, a mixed-use development by Anthem properties. South yards will include more than 2,500 residential units and over 60,000 square feet of retail and office space surrounding a one-acre community park. In Hong Kong SAR, we're supplying 47 Gen 3 units to enhance access to more than 30 elevated walkways. These elevators will provide improved accessibility for the aging population and people with disabilities, a key part of Hong Kong's Universal Accessibility Initiative. Construction is expected to be complete in July of 2026. In Saudi Arabia, we secured a contract to modernize 18 elevators at the Saudi National Bank headquarters in Riyadh. As part of the modernization, we'll upgrade the controllers in the high-rise units, while adding our Otis ONE IoT solution. This new project builds on our existing relationship with the Saudi National Bank headquarters, which has 47 Otis units in total. And in China, we received a contract to maintain 351 units at Shanghai's Pudong Airport, with 271 of these returning to the Otis portfolio as a recapture. Pudong Airport is a critical cargo access point in East Asia, while also serving roughly 80 million passengers each year. We're proud to say we now maintain all Otis units at the airport. We announced our uplift program last quarter and in Q3 we began executing initiatives focused on three essential areas: gaining scale across our global organization to unlock synergies; standardizing our processes to generate efficiencies; and driving supplier and indirect spend optimization. We are on track to meet our stated expected run rate savings of $150 million by mid-year 2025. Taken together, these initiatives drive further value for our customers, organizational effectiveness, and sustainable profitable growth. Moving to slide four, Q3 results and 2023 outlook. Organic sales in the quarter grew 5.2%. Service was up 8.4% with all lines of business contributing and new equipment up 1% with growth in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. Although new equipment orders declined 10% versus the prior year, backlog was up at 2% at constant currency. Our share in the quarter remained relatively flat, leaving us at approximately 50 basis points of share gain year-to-date. Order growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific was more than offset by declines in the Americas and China. In service, modernization orders remain strong, up 13% in Q3. The fifth consecutive quarter of Mod orders grew at above 10%, driven by strong performance in EMEA, China, and Asia Pacific. Mod backlog was up 15%, giving us line of sight to sales over the next several quarters. With adjusted operating profit growth of $47 million in the quarter, we expanded margins by 60 basis points, driven by 90 basis points of service adjusted operating profit margin expansion. We generated $272 million of free cash flow, driven by higher net income. To summarize, we executed our strategy, growing the portfolio above 4%, increasing our new equipment and Mod backlogs, giving us a strong base to execute on for the next several quarters, while expanding operating profit margins as we drive a consistent operating cadence in the business, ultimately leading to just under 20% EPS growth. Ultimately, we believe we're set up well, despite the relatively weaker macro picture we're facing, which I'll discuss next. For global new equipment unit bookings, Asia Pacific continues to grow, although we now expect it to be up low to mid-single-digits, a step down from our prior expectations. We anticipate that EMEA will decline high-single-digits in line with our expectations for last quarter. While Americas, we now expect to decline mid-teens and China to decline north of 10%, both worse than we were anticipating just a few months ago, as the macro environment remains challenging. In total, this would leave global new equipment bookings somewhere around 850,000 units, down approximately 10% versus 2022. In service, although global new equipment unit bookings are smaller than we anticipated, we still expect the service installed base to grow nearly 5% this year, as units that were booked two to three years ago and installed one to two years ago roll off their warranty periods. This will put the global service installed base somewhere between 21 million units to 22 million units by year end of which we currently maintain approximately 2.2 million and expect to end the year around 2.3 million units in our maintenance portfolio. With that as the global backdrop, let me now update you on Otis's financial outlook. We expect organic sales growth of approximately 5.5% with net sales of about $14.1 billion. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be approximately $2.265 billion, up $170 million at constant currency. At actual currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $140 million, including a foreign exchange headwind of $30 million. We're raising our outlook for adjusted EPS, now expected to be $3.52, up 11% versus the prior year. We now expect free cash flow of about $1.5 billion, or approximately 105% conversion of GAAP net income. We still expect share repurchases of $800 million. With that, I'll turn it over to Anurag to walk through our Q3 results in more detail. Yes, happy to, Jeff. Let me start with the Americas. So we now believe the new equipment market in the Americas is going to be down mid-teens, and we're really seeing that with the highest impact being the interest rates remaining high. It really is impacting new project starts. We've seen that in the most recent ABI and Dodge data. So we're watching that closely. I would tell you the residential, it performed the worst in the third quarter, followed by commercial not being great and infrastructure for the quarter being relatively flat. We expect infrastructure to pick up, you know, as we go into \u201824. We tend to see that a little later in the cycle versus the early construction companies with all the infrastructure activity that's starting. What I do like about the Americas beyond their performance, and they really had a strong performance in terms of backlog conversion, is we still have strong mid-single-digit backlog on new equipment. That puts us in a really good position, not just for the fourth quarter, but I would tell you with our cycle time in the Americas, it gives us really good line of sight for the next 12 to 18 months, especially in North America, which is the majority of our Americas business. So we'll wait and see what happens with interest rates. If this does become the new normal, we think people will adjust because housing demand is real. It's still there. So we have to wait and see where this equilibrium is going come out with the developers and when they go ahead with projects. We're not seeing a decline in terms of interest or proposals, so we really, at this point, it's about people having conviction to start the projects from a development perspective. In China, the new equipment market does remain somewhat weak, and it's worse than we saw it a quarter ago when we told you we didn't see that inflection point for book and ship. We're now saying it's really down. You know, the China market itself is really down north of 10%. So we are continuing to focus on our pivot in China. And you know, I couldn't be more proud of our team in China in terms of what we've done on the maintenance side to offset this, as well as really how we've managed material productivity to be able to drive that cost price neutral scenario in China. We have picked up share in China for the year and so we will continue even though the backlog is down, our team is continuing to fight for all units and execute our strategy which has been in play, which is focusing on key accounts, mainly state-owned enterprises and continuing new product introduction and expansion on Otis ONE. So our Mod is up in China for the fifth straight quarter, sorry, for this year it's up double-digits, so for all year. We've had the ninth straight quarter in China on the service side of mid to high-teens service growth. So we're finding a nice place there in terms of this pivot to becoming more of a service provider. But new equipment is our highest margin in China and I think what you see with the results is despite China being down, our other three regions really picked it up nicely for us to be able to hold margins at 7% on new equipment for the quarter and to grow organically 1% even with China down fairly significantly. So we'll wait and see what happens in terms of stimulus. Obviously, we've seen certain actions already in China in terms of easing monetary support, postponing property taxes, loosening credit policy for mortgages, but we really do -- are watching sentiment and liquidity. Those are the two items that we're watching. Yes, there is no impact in Q3. We just, early days for us, we've kicked off the key activities, including the operating model, a lot of education inside the company, and a lot of focus now on process redesign and indirect spend. You'll see that start coming through slightly in Q4, but 2024 is when you'll really start seeing that impact and then we'll achieve the run rate. We're very comfortable with all the analysis we've done, as well as some of the decisions we've taken already that the $150 million is absolutely achievable. Yes, let me start and then I'll have Anurag. Nigel, we're not seeing project cancellations at any level different than we have in the past. And we can say that everywhere in the globe. There are always a small amount of project cancellations that occur in which we retain the deposit and the advanced deposit, but nothing unusual there. In terms of China, let me just make sure everyone understands that China now represents about 17% of our global revenue. Now there are several reasons for that. One, is a down China market, but second is with us now out looking, you know, $14.1 billion in revenue and organic growth of 5.5%. You can see that the impact and the pickup of the other three regions in terms of their growth. So, you know, nice call out, America's, EMEA, Asia Pacific, really good revenue growth, as you saw in Anurag's presentation. But China's now about a 17% of our total revenue down from 20% traditionally. So, you know, that's just the reality of where the numbers are right now. On price cost, Anurag why don't you comment? Well, we're not going to guide yet for \u201824 uplift savings. So we just need to be, yes, we're not prepared to do that yet. We'll get back to you, obviously, when we do our \u201824 guide to let you know what's going to be in that late January. In terms of restructuring, I think we've been... Yes, Julian, on the second question where you're talking about wages and inflation, inflation on the service side, while we have had wage inflation, you know, we know we need to offset that with productivity, and what we've been doing with price has been fairly significant. We have another quarter where our service pricing, like-for-like is up 4 points, and with inflation staying pretty high, especially in EMEA and in the Americas, we should be able to as we negotiate the majority of our maintenance contracts, you know, first, second quarter next year, which are mainly backward looking for this year's inflation, we expect to be able to get price again at levels comparable to that for 2024. We have line of sight now, the majority of our \u201823 maintenance contracts are in the books, as our commodity prices and everything else as we go with 2.5 months left to go now. So we're actually feeling pretty good about service pricing for next year and price cost. And we've negotiated with the majority of our collective bargaining across the globe. Most of our mechanics are represented. And I think, I know we've treated them fairly and we're able to recover that in both price and productivity. Yes, Joe, we would tell you that, you know, if you go back to peak years in China, we probably peaked the segment, peaked new equipment at about 650,000 units. That's been coming down now for the past two years, and we're at about 450,000 currently for this year. Still 450,000 of the 850,000 global units. So still a large healthy market. And 450,000 you'd probably have to go back to 2018-ish timeframe to where we had, you know, obviously pre-COVID to having a market like this. And so we still think it's a very attractive market. We've gained share there this year as we look in China and we will continue to execute our strategies of our agents and distributors being our partners, which we now have about 2,350 agents and distributors, more than twice since we spun. We focus on our key accounts. And we've also really focused on the Tier cities that are having an impact. So if you look at the third quarter, Tier 1 cities, Beijing, Shanghai had the best market segments. And then, you know, obviously it trailed off as you got all the way to Tier 5. So we've adjusted our strategy. That's why our agents and distributors are so helpful, as well as our internal sales folks that support them. The key accounts, again, those relationships are strong, and they are yielding for us. Yes, I think you're going to, I mean, orders are lumpy, kind of, across the board for both modernization and new equipment. And I would argue share is also, kind of, hard to measure on a quarterly basis and something more you'd like to do on an annual level when you really have some fidelity in the information. I can't comment on what our competitors are doing, but I can tell you that, you know, we're, again, our China team is executing our strategy. In a down market, you know, our China team has both driven cost out in terms of material productivity. So that, again, if you look at and you step back, you know, we're driving growth in all lines of business in Otis, especially in service. We're seeing good growth in three regions outside of China. But our China team has really in despite a tough macro environment on new equipment, has really now added this service component, which now we're at 365,000 units in our portfolio in China, more than double from when we spun. And our China modernization business has grown double-digits this year. So we're finding we're moving Mod into the factory, so we're optimizing the cost basis there, and you're going to see that modernization business really in China, as well as globally take off. And for us, we need to watch that mix. That's what Anurag commented on for fourth quarter for service margins. But we think, we know it's actually worth getting that modernization business, because it will bring more units to our portfolio. So we're going to end this year at 2.3 million units in our portfolio. And when you think about 1% portfolio growth throughout the decade before we spun, and now us, four straight quarters over 4%, we're going to end this year at 2.3 million units. And that is the strongest, but it's still at 2.3 million units of a $21 million, $22 million segment leaves us lots of room for growth. And that's why we're convinced the service-driven growth strategy globally is the right answer for us and our shareholders. Yes, and for any of our customers listening, Steve, I think it's important they know that when they need a repair, we do the repair. And then we make sure we bill and follow-up to collect. And that's really what happens in that repair world. We know customers, if they've got an elevator down, we're going to get them back up. Yes, so I mean, that multifamily was our, from a market perspective, a segment perspective, was the worst performing in the U.S. this past quarter. Now, it's down off record highs for multiple years, and there's still demand for it, but we're just seeing the developers slow down on the start button, which is when we get those advances that Anurag was talking about in his cash answer. So we'll wait and see. If rates stay where they are, you know, developers will figure out the math for this because demand is still there for housing. So, you know, we're in a wait and see, but our backlog in especially in North America is strong mid-single-digit, including a lot of multifamily in the backlog. So we're going to keep performing, and then our team will drive the orders as they come. Well, I can take that 1. The answer is no. No reset. Well, your hypothesis that most of our modernization is on non-Otis equipment in China is accurate. But remember, our China market share is or our share of segment in service is pretty low, because 75% of all the units in China are maintained by ISPs. So I wouldn't specifically say it's, you know, some of the units we're getting back, our Otis units that are not on portfolio. Many are non-Otis units, but they're not necessarily, you know, Japanese or European. I can't comment on who they are. What we've done is we've created very innovative packages to be able to put our hardware on non-Otis equipment to modernize it, to add new technology, and then to convert it into our portfolio. Good morning. So we will share our statistics at our fourth quarter earnings. We do that on an annual basis, but there's no significant changes that we've seen, but we'll share that next quarter. Yes, thank you, Michelle. Our service-driven business model is working as we approach 2.3 million units in our portfolio by year-end with the compounding lifetime value of each additional unit. Year-to-date results are indicative of the strength of our strategy as we continue to prioritize value creation for our shareholders for the remainder of 2023 and beyond. Thank you for joining us today. Stay safe and well."

            "content": "Thank you, Judy, and good morning everyone. Starting with third quarter results on slide five. Net sales of $3.5 billion grew 5.4% and organic sales were up 5.2% with growth in both segments. Adjusted operating profit was up $52 million at actual FX and $47 million at constant currency with margins expanding 60 basis points to 16.9%. Drop-through on service volume, productivity, and pricing in both segments, and commodity tailwinds were partially offset by inflationary pressures, including annual wage increases and higher corporate costs. Adjusted EPS increased 19% or $0.15, with over half of this improvement coming from strong operational performance and the rest from a combination of a capital allocation initiatives and ongoing effort to reduce the tax rate, which came in at 25.5% in the quarter. Free cash flow came in at $272 million, up $57 million versus prior year, largely driven by higher net income. Year-to-date, we generated $934 million of free cash flow, $81 million lower versus the prior year, driven by lower down payments on fewer new equipment orders and the continued outperformance of a repair business as this work tends to be paid in [areas] (ph). Moving to slide six. Let me start by giving some color on Q3 new equipment orders and backlog. In the third quarter, at constant currency, new equipment orders declined 10% versus prior year. Despite this, our new equipment backlog increased 2% with mid-teens growth in Asia Pacific, mid-single-digit growth in the Americas, and EMEA roughly flat. China backlog is down low-single-digits. Sequentially outside of China, our new equipment backlog was relatively stable in all regions. Globally, pricing on new equipment orders was up low-single-digits, building on a similar increase in the third quarter of the prior year. Excluding China, pricing improved by mid-single-digits are better in all regions. Although pricing was down mid-single-digits in China due to macro challenges, we remained price cost neutral in the region from our continued focus on driving material productivity. New equipment organic sales were up 1% in the quarter with strong growth in all regions outside of China. Asia Pacific grew low-teens driven by continued performance in India, as well as traction with major projects. In EMEA, new equipment sales grew high-single-digits underpinned by the significant orders over the past several quarters in Southern Europe and the Middle East, while in the Americas the region grew high-single-digits for the second consecutive quarter, executing on its multi-billion-dollar backlog. We grew new equipment operating profit by $10 million at constant currency, despite China sales coming in weaker than expected. Driving productivity, pricing flowed through from the backlog, and tailwinds from commodities more than offset the project in regional mixed headwinds, leading to a 7.2% margin in the quarter. Turning to service segment results on slide seven. Maintenance units were up 4.2% with growth in all regions, led by high-teens growth in China for the fourth quarter in a row. We deliver another strong quarter of modernization orders, up 13% including China Mod orders growing double-digits from continued success of new product offerings. Asia-Pacific also grew double-digits due to a number of volume and major project wins with standout performance coming from North Asia. EMEA Mod orders grew 10% driven by major project wins. At quarter end our Mod backlog was up 15% with growth in all regions. Service revenue came in better-than-expected with all lines of business contributing to organic sales growth of 8.4%. Maintenance and repair was up 8.6% from higher than anticipated repair volumes, and Mod was up 7.6% with growth across all regions highlighted by a double-digit increase in Asia. Service pricing excluding mix and churn came in around 4 points, similar to last quarter's performance, and adjusted for mix and churn was a net 2 points. Higher volume, favorable pricing, and productivity were partially offset by annual wage increases and higher material costs, leading to $53 million of service profit growth at constant currency. Service adjusted operating profit margin expanded 90 basis points in the quarter to 24.8%. Overall, we are pleased with our results in the quarter, as well as year-to-date. We've grown our new equipment and Mod backlogs, expanded the portfolio at 4% and delivered over 10% EPS growth. Moving to slide eight, and the revised outlook. Starting with sales, total Otis organic sales are expected to be up approximately 5.5% consistent with the midpoint of a prior guide, including slight adjustments by segment. Adjusted operating profit growth at constant currency is expected to be $170 million, a $5 million increase versus the prior guide's midpoint, and the result of strong performance in the service segment. At actual currency, we expect adjusted operating profit of $2.265 billion, as the better operating performance is offset by a slightly higher foreign exchange headwind, driven by a change in the euro and the weakening of various Asian currencies such as the CNY. Our margin expectations remain unchanged with service margins expected to expand 50 basis points to 24% and new equipment margins expected to expand 20 basis points to just under 7%. This puts overall operating margins at approximately 16%, up 30 basis points. We have grazed our guidance for adjusted EPS, now expected to be up 11% versus the prior guide, to $3.52. This represents a $0.04 increase versus the prior guide's midpoint, largely driven by strong operational performance and improvements in below-the-line items, including tax now expected to end the year at 26%. We expect to generate approximately $1.5 billion in free cash flow, a roughly 105% conversion rate, and return substantially all of it to shareholders through $1.35 billion of dividends and share repurchases. Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on slide nine. We now expect new equipment organic sales growth of approximately 3% at the low-end of the prior range driven by larger than expected headwinds in China, which we expect to be down mid-single-digits. The Americas and EMAs are still expected to grow mid-single-digits organically. In service, organic sales are expected to be up approximately 7.5%, a 1 point increase versus the midpoint of the prior guide driven by maintenance and repair. Consistent maintenance portfolio growth and pricing, together with another quarter of strong repair volume, enable us to raise the outlook by 130 basis points to up 7.3% versus the prior guide. Modernization organic sales expectations remain unchanged, up 8% as we execute on our backlog, which was up 15% at quarter end. Moving to slide 10, we have raised our expectations for adjusted EPS and now anticipate growth of approximately 11% or $3.52, a $0.35 increase versus the prior year driven by $0.30 of operational improvement. In closing, we continue to execute well on the things we can control, and our resilient service business is driving profitable growth in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Our strong year-to-date performance gives us confidence to again raise our EPS outlook and deliver a solid fourth quarter, while positioning us well to perform in \u201824 and beyond. With that, Michelle, please open the line for questions. Yes, so on price cost as you mentioned Nigel, we are, you know, either neutral or positive right? In China definitely pricing the new equipment side is coming down, but we are driving hard on material productivity, and the -- it's a deflationary economy over there as well. So a combination of that and this pricing discipline in the market, you put all of that together. Right now, price cost is favorable, and we are able to offset the China mix as you saw in third quarter with a new equipment margin being at 7.2%. And even if you look at the fourth quarter implied outlook its -- new equipment margin is going to be about 7%, even though China is going to be down. So and a couple of reasons one is obviously the price cost in China. Second, pricing in all the other markets that has gone up over the past 12, 15-months, which is in our backlog, has started flushing through to the P&L. We again saw this quarter another $10 million pick up of pricing. We're going to see that similar in the next quarter, and commodities are tailwind. So if I look at pricing in the backlog overall, which is probably up 50 basis points to 70 basis points, and if we snap the line on commodity today, right, we should still see another $40 million or so tailwind next year. You add these two things together, I think it more than kind of makes up for the China mix for us to believe that a new equipment is at a sustainable margin rate. Exactly. So first is, you know, program's off to a great start, as Judy mentioned. We'll give an update next year. In terms of to achieve the $150 million of savings, the restructuring cost is about $150 million. It's a one-on-one, right? It's going to start this quarter, but obviously we're going to start seeing the savings coming in next year. Yes. Hey, thanks for the question, Julian. Yes, so firstly, you know, our backlog is up 2% right now on the new equipment side. We do think that even if orders are down low to mid-single-digits in the fourth quarter, our backlog is going to be flattish to slightly up. And the reason is because we tend to book more orders than revenue over the past couple of years, some of them being major projects. So our assumption is that backlogs should be flattish to up by end of the year. Now within that, America's, Europe, and Asia Pacific, if you put that together, that backlog is up low to mid-single-digit. And that represents roughly about two-thirds of a new equipment revenue. So that should be kind of up low to mid-single-digit next year, let's say low-single-digit. The big variable, of course, is one-third of the revenue, which is China. Right now China backlog is down low-single-digit. It could be down mid-single-digit by end of the year. And what happens to the market over there? It could be flattish, it could be down 10%, it could be up, right? So that we do not know as to where that's going to happen. But let's assume that the market goes down next year and then China is probably down 5%. So that would mean that our new equipment revenue could be flattish. So -- but if I put things in a perspective, it could be flattish, it could be up 2%, it could be down 2%. But 2% or 3% of new equipment revenue is about a couple of $100 million of revenue. And if we look at our margin, it's about $14 million, $15 million, $18 million of profit, so it's just $0.02 or $0.03 of EPS. If you look at what we did this year, we more than overcame that through the service business, which is why we, you know, our guide bent up every quarter because of lack of service. So we think we should be able to make that up next year through our service business. Oh, absolutely. So I'll break it up into two separate questions over here. So first is, yes, the guide implies 24% margin for service in the fourth quarter, which is eventually down 80 basis points, but we're going to exit the year at what we guided for the full-year, which is 24%. It's a very healthy margin rate. It's from last year where we actually, it's a tough compare because last year we grew margins by 60 basis points, 70 basis points in the same quarter. And the reason there's a difference between the 24.8% and 24% is largely two things. It's the mix, we -- I mean, we are very encouraged. I mean, the performance in third quarter margin was fantastic. I mean, if you look at the portfolio maintenance side, portfolio is growing, pricing is sticking, we are flushing more backlog into revenue, and the repair business, which we thought after two years of very high growth was going to slow down, is not, and it's because of the strategy of the team of penetrating more of the portfolio, and that mix was high in the third quarter and obviously productivity which helped us get to the 24.8%. The big difference between Q3 and Q4 is now we're assuming that repair to be flattish in the fourth quarter and Mod growing double-digit. So that is a mixed impact which is leading for the margins to be lower, but net-net, we're exiting the year at what we guided, so feel pretty good about it on the service side. Yes, absolutely. If you look at a backlog, it is significantly more than a 12-month revenue, because we got major projects in there. We have other kind of long-tailed projects as well. But very specifically, the reason why I said earlier we have confidence of America and Europe, kind of, growing low-single-digit next year is the back half -- even if we snap the line today, we have very high visibility of that converting. We enter any political year with 80%, 90% of America's and EMEA revenue coming out of backlog. Followed by that is Asia-Pacific Ex-China, which is probably a little bit lower, depending upon the geography mix, but that backlog is up very healthy. It's probably double-digit up, right? Then China is the only one where we have higher book-and-ship. So when we enter the year, I would say two-thirds of that revenue probably comes from the backlog and a third comes from the book-in-ship, which is why for three out of four regions, we feel it's low-single-digit growth for next year. China is the only variable that we need to see how the next few month's go. Hey, good morning, Steve. Oh yes, absolutely. It's two weeks, okay, So firstly on cash we are at about $934 million. We got $550 million and I guess your question is tweaking it to the low-end of the guidance is two reasons; one is clearly lower down payments, because of new equipment orders which have been a little bit lower. But second is also a repair business which has grown very, we started this year would be low-single-digit repair. It's growing at a very good rate. Great for sales, great for profit on the P&L side, but we do get paid after we complete our work, so it's a little bit of a receivable drag. I think it's a combination of these two reasons why you see a little bit of a tweak in the cash flow guide. There's no reset because, I mean, at the two -- with the new, lower -- definitely lower orders, but also we're executing on high backlogs. All these will normalize and the repair revenue will also, kind of, we start converting more into cash. So I don't think there's any reason for us to reset the target, yes. Yes. Sorry, you got an email on the service business, the price escalation? Yes. So, yes, listen. Let's start with Europe where we got about half of our portfolio over there. Inflation is still pretty high in Europe, not as high as last year, but not too far off from there. And most of our contracts are right now in negotiation and they're obviously linked to an index. So we feel pretty good about the pricing increase in Europe next year. It could be around the mid-single-digit level again, so that's really encouraging. Inflation in America is also not coming down to a great extent, so we should see that. So these two definitely give us confidence on our pricing going up. The rest of Asia has always been a low to mid-single-digit price increase. That will continue. And China, I think, as I mentioned earlier, there is more price discipline, but it's never been a price escalator market on the service side. So put all of that together, it gives us confidence there's going to be another good price increase next year on top of our portfolio growth, which should mean that our maintenance business should grow mid-single-digit plus."

Presentation materials are available for download from Otis' website at www.otis.com. I'll now turn it over to Michael Rednor, Senior Director of Investor Relations.\nMichael Rednor: Thank you, Liz. Welcome to Otis' second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Judy Marks, Chair, CEO and President; and Anurag Maheshwari, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations excluding restructuring and significant non-recurring items. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis' SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide additional details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Mike, and thank you everyone for joining us. We hope everyone listening is safe and well. Starting with the second quarter highlights on Slide 3. Otis delivered a strong second quarter and a successful first half of the year. In Q2, we grew organic sales high-single digits in both segments, expanded adjusted operating profit margin 20 basis points, and achieved 7% adjusted EPS growth. This performance again demonstrates the strength of our strategy and our ability to execute and deliver. We have momentum going into the second half and beyond, as new equipment share was up slightly in the quarter and up about 50 basis points in the first half, we grew our maintenance portfolio 4.2%, and continue to grow our new equipment and modernization backlogs. We generated $409 million in free cash flow in the quarter, and returned $175 million to shareholders through share repurchases, taking year-to-date repurchases to $350 million. From an innovation standpoint, this quarter we launched our latest elevator in North America the Gen3 Core, designed specifically to address the needs of customers in the large two to six storey building segment. Gen3 Core is built off the proven design and flat-belt technology of Otis' Gen2 family, while also being equipped with Otis ONE, our IoT platform. Gen3 Core will be manufactured in Florence, South Carolina, and sales will begin this fall. Here are some exciting customer highlights from the second quarter. In Montreal, Otis Canada was selected to provide 28 units, including 11 SkyRise units to the H\u00f4pital Vaudreuil-Soulanges. Hospitals require reliable transportation between floors at all times and we're excited to be a part of this important healthcare initiative expected to open in 2026. It's our latest collaboration in Canada with General Contractor Pomerleau. In Egypt, Otis will provide a total of 57 units for the Iconic Tower in El Alamein, including SkyRise and Gen2 elevators as well as our Link escalators. At 267 meters, this will be the second tallest tower in Egypt and will offer more than 200,000 square meters of housing as well as services and leisure. In China, another 280 elevators and escalators from Otis will keep people moving along Tianjin Metro's new Line 7. This project will bring the total number of Otis units on the city's expanding subway network to more than 1,800. Since it opened, Otis equipment has kept Tianjin Metro passengers on the move, and has been a critical part of the country's transportation network since 1984. And as the Indian government continues to invest in transportation infrastructure, Otis will install 255 units, including our heavy-duty public escalators and Gen2 elevators, for the new Bhopal and Indoor Metro. This is the first metro line in the state of Madhya Pradesh and is expected to serve 500,000 passengers daily. All the equipment will be manufactured at our factory in Bengaluru. We made progress on our ESG priorities, and in the second quarter, received Zero Waste to Landfill Certification for all three of our Spanish factories from AENOR, the Spanish Association for Standardization and Certification. This is important progress towards our goal of achieving a 100% factory eligibility for Zero Waste to Landfill Certification by 2025. In addition, our factory in San Sebastian, Spain received its LEED Platinum certification, the first factory in Spain to receive this designation. The facility opened last year and was designed to reduce environmental impact in the construction and operations through materials used in its waste control system. San Sebastian is our fifth factory to achieve LEED certification. We continue pursuing ways we can improve our environmental impact, which is an increasing focus of our colleagues, customers and shareholders. Moving to Slide 4, Q2 results and 2023 outlook. Overall, organic sales increased 9.5% with all geographic regions exhibiting strong new equipment organic sales growth in the quarter. And in service, all lines of business contributed to our best service organic sales growth performance since spin. We grew our adjusted new equipment backlog at constant currency by 5% compared to prior year and 3% to the prior quarter, despite a tough compare on new equipment orders, which were down 12%. We continued a strong trend in modernization with orders up 16% at constant currency and backlog up 14% in the second quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of 10% or greater mod orders growth. We grew adjusted operating profit by $60 million and expanded margin by 20 basis points. We generated $409 million of free cash flow, a conversion rate of 109% of GAAP net income. Before sharing our updated 2023 outlook, let me update you on our current geographic outlook for new equipment markets. In Asia Pacific, there's no change to our previous outlook. We expect the new equipment market to grow mid-single digits or better, led by India. In EMEA, the market is now expected to be down high-single digits in 2023, worse than our prior expectations of down low- to mid-single digits. This decline is driven by Northern Europe as customer delays in buying decisions persist. The Americas market has weakened over the past few months and we now expect it to be down high-single digits in units. From an end-market perspective, this decline is driven by multifamily residential coming down from a high level over the past two years, slightly offset by a more resilient commercial market. And finally, in China, we now expect the market to be down 10% compared to our prior guide of down 5% to 10%. This decline is primarily driven by a lack of momentum as we exited the second quarter at a weaker run rate than we had anticipated. Despite the weakening of the new equipment markets globally, we've maintained a strong backlog, giving us good visibility to future sales growth. On the service side, there is no change to our outlook for global installed base growth of roughly 5%, led by Asia. Our strong performance in the second quarter and the progress we've made on our strategic imperatives gives us confidence to improve our 2023 outlook. Organic sales are now expected to be in the range of 4.5% to 6%, with net sales in a range of $14 billion to $14.3 billion. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be $2.25 billion to $2.28 billion, up $155 million to $175 million at constant currency. Adjusted operating profit at actual currency is expected to be up $125 million to $155 million, including a $20 million to $30 million headwind from foreign exchange translation. We're raising our guidance for adjusted EPS, and it's now expected in range of $3.45 to $3.50, up 9% to 10% versus the prior year. Lastly, our expectation for free cash flow remains unchanged at about $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion or approximately 105% to 115% conversion of GAAP net income. We continue to prioritize returning cash to shareholders, and I'm pleased to share we're increasing our share repurchases this year to $800 million. Turning to Slide 5. As announced earlier today, we're launching a program called UpLift to transform our operating model, to continue to drive sustainable profitable growth within our business. After three-plus years as a public company in which we've grown new equipment share, expanded operating margins, grown EPS, built a formidable backlog and returned approximately $2.7 billion in cash to shareholders, we're designing Otis for the next phase to ensure high performance and resiliency regardless of the economic environment we may face in the future. We're launching UpLift to drive efficiency across the organization while continuing to prioritize the customer experience. Going forward, we expect our sales specialization to continue to accelerate our growth, our innovation cycles to continue at a rapid pace, and our customer intimacy to continue unabated. Our management team is laser-focused on ensuring that our operating performance can achieve a new higher-performance tier through the transformation of our financial processes, improving our supply chain procurement and rightsizing our cost base where needed among other aspects of the program. Throughout the next two years, we expect the program to generate approximately $150 million in savings, as we drive efficiency across the organization. Our plan is to update our shareholders at regular intervals on the progress we're making with this program and ultimately you'll see the results in better performance, growth, operating profit and returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Anurag to walk through our Q2 results in more detail.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Thank you, Judy. Starting with second quarter results on Slide 6. Net sales of $3.7 billion were up 6.7% and organic sales were up 9.5%, driven by strong performance in all business lines. Adjusted operating profit was up $49 million at actual FX and $60 million at constant currency. Drop through on higher volume, productivity, and pricing in both segments, and commodity tailwinds were partially offset by inflationary pressures, including annual wage increases, unfavorable new equipment mix, and higher corporate costs. Adjusted EPS increased 7% or $0.06, reflecting $0.11 of benefit from operations. This strong operational performance and accretion from a lower share count were partially offset by a $0.03 headwind from foreign exchange translation and a $0.03 tax headwind as a result of a tough compare. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter at $409 million or 109% conversion, up $83 million. The increase versus prior year was driven by higher net income and improved changes in working capital. Moving to Slide 7. In the second quarter, as we noted previously, new equipment orders faced a tough compare and were down 12% at constant currency. New equipment backlog, however, continues to trend higher, and was up 5% at constant currency versus the prior year and up 3% sequentially, with all regions being up, providing visibility for sales in the second half and beyond. Globally, pricing on new equipment orders was up low-single digit, building on solid pricing improvements from the middle of 2022. Pricing trends improved mid-single digits or better year-over-year in all regions excluding China. While pricing was down low-single digits in China due to deflationary pressure and the softer market, we maintained price-cost neutrality by focusing on material productivity. New equipment organic sales were up nearly 10% in the quarter with all regions contributing. APAC grew double digits, driven by strong performance in Korea and India; EMEA grew high-single digits, primarily from Southern Europe; the Americas grew high-single digits as job site delays and field inefficiencies eased; and China delivered mid-single-digit growth by executing on a stable backlog. Overall, we saw solid execution across all regions. Adjusted operating profit was up $15 million at constant currency. The benefits from higher volume, price beginning to flow from the backlog, strong productivity and better-than-anticipated commodity tailwinds were partially offset by continued unfavorable regional and product mix, transactional FX and higher SG&A expense. Now turning to service segment results on Slide 8. Maintenance units were up 4.2%, with growth in all regions, led by China, where we achieved another quarter of high-teens portfolio growth. Modernization backlog expanded by 14%, with growth across all regions, driven by strong orders growth of 16% in the quarter. Service organic sales grew 9.4%, the highest rate since spin with growth in all business lines. Maintenance and repair grew 9.1% from better-than-expected repair volume. Our portfolio continued to expand 4.2% and we achieved strong pricing, up 4 points on a like-for-like basis. With strong backlog conversion in the quarter, modernization sales were up 10.9%, with particularly strong performance in Asia, including China. Service profit was up $52 million at constant currency as the benefit from higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity were partially offset by annual wage increases and higher material costs. Margins expanded 50 basis points, in line with our full year guidance. Overall, we're pleased with our first half results, where we gained approximately 50 basis points of new equipment share, grew the portfolio again over 4%, increased organic sales by 6.6%, and improved operating profit by $67 million at constant currency, while continuing to grow our backlog in both new equipment and modernization. This provides good growth visibility over the next several quarters. With that, moving to Slide 9 and the revised outlook. Starting with sales. With strong service momentum, we are raising outlook and now expect total Otis organic sales to be up 4.5% to 6% versus the prior guide of 4% to 6%. Adjusted operating profit growth at constant currency is expected to be in the range of $155 million to $175 million, and approximately $15 million increase at the midpoint versus the prior guide, linked to the better-than-expected service volume. Service margins are still expected to expand about 50 basis points to 24% and we anticipate new equipment margins to expand 20 basis points to 6.8%. Overall, margins are expected to be up approximately 30 basis points to 16%, the high end of the previous range. Adjusted EPS is expected to be up 9% to 10% versus the prior year, within the range of $3.45 to $3.50, and approximately $0.03 increase at the midpoint versus the prior outlook, largely the result of strong operational performance. Due to our continued cash mobilization activities, we have increased our share repurchase target to $800 million, and the outlook for free cash flow is $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion or roughly 110% conversion. Now taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 10. There is no change to the overall new equipment outlook. By region, we still expect the Americas and EMEA to be up mid-single digits, consistent with our prior guide. Within Asia, Asia Pacific is performing better than anticipated, led by India, which we expect to offset a decline in China due to the continuing weak demand environment. Turning to service. Organic sales are now expected to improve by 50 basis points versus the prior outlook to a range of 6% to 7%, with improvement in all business lines. We're increasing the outlook for maintenance and repair organic sales, now expected to be up 5.5% to 6.5% in '23, driven by the strong first half repair volume. Supported by a robust backlog, which is up mid-teens, we are increasing our modernization organic sales outlook to be in the range of 7% to 9%. Moving to Slide 11. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 9% to 10% in the range of $3.45 to $3.50, a $0.31 increase for the full year with $0.29 coming from operations. Overall, with a strong first half behind us, we are well positioned to improve our outlook and deliver solid second half financial performance on the strength of a service-driven business model and focus on operational excellence. With that, Liz, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel, your line is now open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. Hope everyone's well. So, I guess, first of all, on the new equipment margins, the clip to the 40 basis points high end, down 20 basis points, all right, it' a small move, but you haven't changed your growth outlook. It doesn't feel like the mix [geographically changes] (ph). I'm just wondering what sort of driving that sort of more kind of moderate view, if you will, on margin? And are we still on track for that price-cost tailwind in the back half of the year?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Hey, thanks, Nigel, for the question. I guess the first one is what we've done is we just tightened the new equipment margin to 20 basis points. So, as you noted, right, we haven't changed our sales outlook for new equipment. But within that, China, which we thought was going to be flattish for the year, is going to be down low-single digits. And as you're aware, China is a higher new equipment profit margin market, but we're able to offset that with definitely better commodity tailwinds, initially we were expecting about $25 million, $30 million, now about $40 million. Pricing, definitely in the second half is going to be better than the first half. You put the two together, I think we tightened to about 20 -- which more than offset China, so which is why we tightened to 20 basis points on the new equipment side.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That's very clear. And then my follow-up is on the [Uprise] (ph) program, the $150 million of cost. Maybe just a bit more detail on where you see the opportunities to further streamline the cost base? How much of that $150 million do you think will come to the bottom-line versus being reinvested? And then, is this additive to your other programs? I'm thinking things like the modernization margin initiatives, service productivity initiatives, is this additive to those programs?\nJudy Marks: Yes, Nigel, let me take that. And we're calling it UpLift. I think you called it Uprise.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Sorry.\nJudy Marks: But let me take that. First and foremost, I think it's really important for people to understand why we're doing this now, and then I'll get to kind of where the cost takeout is going to be, which is mainly in G&A. So, it will be additive to our other productivity initiatives as well as our modernization growth. But where it comes from is, we spun a little over three-plus years ago. And since that time, the team and our colleagues, I mean, tremendous thanks to them, we've gained share in new equipment, we've driven growth, expanded operating profit margins, we've returned $1 billion in cash to our shareholders, and quarter-after-quarter, we've executed our strategy and performed. And I think it's important to know that we're approaching UpLift from a position of strength. I think it's incumbent on leaders to prepare the company, to take us to the next level. And that's what we're doing as an executive leadership team across the company. So, we're going to focus really on three areas. The operating model itself to give us more speed and agility. We're tremendously distributed organization with our 1,400 branch offices, serving our customers globally. We want that speed and agility to be more customer-centric. We're going to streamline processes, that's going to be extremely important. I think it's something we've learned coming out of spin and now through performance that we can be more consistent geographically and we can streamline our processes from financial processes all the way through to really how we sell to customers, and we're looking forward to that. And the third element is taking advantage of our scale and acting as an enterprise and implementing some pretty significant focus on supply chain and especially indirect. So, you add those three together, it adds up to the $150 million we're going to return, which is predominantly through G&A. Again, it's additive to what we're doing. Anything above that we generate, we are planning on reinvesting in our business to give us new capabilities, new competencies, to continue to invest in innovation. We brought more products to market since spin than we have for many years. We're going to continue to do that as we create the connected Otis of the future and take us to the next level.\nNigel Coe: Okay, great. UpLift. I got it. Okay. Thanks.\nJudy Marks: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Just maybe the first question around the market outlook and the backlog. Because you took down the market outlook in various regions, but the sales guide obviously intact and the backlog is still growing, even with orders down. So, just trying to understand sort of looking ahead, should we expect the backlog to start to shrink sequentially as that end market pressure starts to be exerted? And do you expect to sort of a lower backlog entering 2024, because of the market pressure you called out?\nJudy Marks: Yes, well, I'll let Anurag answer the backlog, but let me just really straight on hit, we do not expect a lower backlog as we exit '23 and enter '24. Really pleased with the 5% backlog growth. And if you go to our first appendix chart, we have a record backlog, which gives us really good line-of-sight for our future and really helped us drive the sales growth that you saw the organic growth in both segments. But let me talk to the market and then I'll turn backlog over to Anurag, just so you get -- to give you a little more color. Let me start in Asia Pac. We expect the market itself on new equipment to still grow mid-single digits. We're seeing really strong markets. We're actually seeing double-digit demand in India and really pleased with how our teams responding there. But think of Asia Pac continuing at mid-single. The Americas, what we saw in the first half at the market level in units, was the first half was down mid-teens. Our view is the second half is going to be flattish to slightly down. So, the full year will be down high-single for the market itself. The units are slowing, but the Americas market itself was sequentially flat. So, we're watching all the indicators, obviously, talking to our customers, looking at Dodge, looking at ABI, but again, watching the Americas carefully and happy to talk about the orders there, as well as we go through these questions. In EMEA, we say that we're going to be down high-single digit for the rest of '23. We're watching the rate impact, a little bit of a sluggish market especially in Northern Europe, I think Germany, France and U.K. being weaker, and it's delays in decision-making uncertainty. The proposals are still going in. The customers, it's a matter of when they're going to make those decisions. Spain and Italy are pretty resilient. And for the segment itself the Middle East is up low-single digits. We're going into Europe with a strong backlog for the second half. And again, when you look at our backlog, we're looking out 18 to 24 months with a backlog of this scale. On China, the market itself, we're calling down 10%. We started -- April momentum was good, May was weaker, and we really exited Q2 with the volumes being down in the market itself. So that lack of acceleration that we had been planning on for the book-and-ship business in the second half really has taken us to the lower end of the range. The only thing I'll remind everybody, again, that new equipment market outlook is very different from the service outlook, which is still solid. It's growing mid-single digit, again, led by Asia, low-single digit in developed markets. Anurag, do you want to talk to backlog?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Absolutely. Thanks, Judy. Even if we assume there is no orders growth, we would expect our backlog to be up low-single digit by the end of the year. And the reason for that, Julian, is because we tend to book more orders in any given year than we ship as some of the orders are larger projects and multi-year in nature. So clearly, I mean, it's not a right analogy, but if you look at our book-to-bill, it's definitely been far higher than 1. So, we booked definitely more orders than we ship over year. Well, let's even if -- assume if conditions worsen from here and there is a new equipment orders even slightly decline to even mid-single digit, I think we will end the year with backlog at least being higher. More importantly, if you look at our backlog mix today, in Americas, it's still fairly high, which is a multiyear backlog that we have. Asia Pacific is fairly good. And that should convert into revenues next year, where China being the highest book-to-ship. So, it gives us kind of confidence as we go into next year to see our new equipment revenue growing in line of medium-term guidance.\nJudy Marks: Yes, even in EMEA, Julian, our backlog is up modestly both versus last year and versus last quarter. So, we're really -- we're watching the backlog closely. We've always shared with our shareholders that you should watch us at year-end, it's the best indicator for our next year in terms of top-line and bottom-line. And that's -- we expect this year to be no different.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much. And then just a quick follow-up as that was a very thorough answer. Just looking at seasonality within the second half, normally your earnings are down slightly sequentially in Q4. I think consensus as you sort of up in Q4 sequentially. So maybe just, is there anything different you're calling out on sort of Q3 versus Q4 earnings this year because of the price-cost or something like that?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. So, if you kind of look at the second half of the year, for the first six months, we did about $1.72 of EPS, which means $1.76 in the back half, and I think it's pretty equally split between Q3 and Q4, Julian, in terms of our EPS split. If you look at new equipment, and I'll just start with new equipment and go on to service, we expect about 3%-ish growth in the second half of the year. I think it should be kind of equal between the two quarters around that. We're going to see commodity tailwind pricing at the tune of about $30 million, $40 million. Obviously, a little bit of that is more towards Q4 than Q3, but the margin rate, which should be above 7%, should be between -- in Q3, Q4 should be no difference between that. Now, if you look at the service, we're doing $40 million, $50 million of operating profit increase every quarter. We expect that again in Q3 and Q4. Maintenance continues to do well with the pricing as well as the portfolio growth and we're converting the mod backlog. So, I think we're in a pretty good run rate over there. And obviously, there's a little bit more of corporate expense headwind in Q3 versus Q4. So, you put all puts and takes over there, I think the cadence between Q3, Q4 from an EPS perspective should be pretty similar.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hello?\nJudy Marks: Hey, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, sorry, I thought I got cut off there for a second. Just a question on China. So, this market is seemingly getting revised down. Just this, whatever recovery was going to come, seems to be deferred. There seems a mixed messaging on stimulus. I mean, I guess, first of all, what's your view on how that market will evolve in '24? And on the services side, isn't there a bit of like a lag as to when you can go after converting those into service agreements? So, like we should be thinking about those opportunities as a two-year lag to the market? And at what stage, if this market remains down, do you have to get a little more aggressive to tweak up that equation of units coming up for conversion versus conversion? Because obviously, if the market is down 10%, and a couple of years later, you're still growing your conversion, that could still mean negative units under management, if this thing kind of continues to bleed lower. Just curious how you're evaluating that equation.\nJudy Marks: Yes, let me try and address kind of multiple items there. First, let me start with the service business. This was the eighth straight quarter we had mid- to high-teens portfolio growth in China. And Sally Loh now leads our China organization, and she is really been driving that. We are now at 350,000 units on our portfolio in China, which is a pretty big step up from when we made this commitment to grow our service business. And it is driving returns and we're increasing the conversion rates as we go. Our China, even though, the segment was down 10% in the second quarter, Steve, we were down 5%. So, yet another quarter of market share gain in new equipment, which bodes well for the two-year warranty and then for the conversions for us as well. Because even though there may be less units, our strategy to open service depots, to have the ability to drive the service conversion, shipping Gen3s with Otis ONE connected is -- at the same time, we're accelerating our conversion rates versus what we had traditionally had in the past. So, even if the volume goes down a little, our rates will offset that. So that doesn't really get me concerned. In terms of what we really changed in the second half, it was -- we had expected things to tick up, especially on the book-and-bill business -- book-and-ship business, excuse me. And as we exited the second half, we just hadn't seen the momentum. Now like you, we've heard out of Monday out of the [indiscernible] a different tone. We have to see what that translates to. I'm cautiously optimistic that once that tone is set from Beijing. There is positive potential that -- especially in the larger tier cities really starts happening and sentiment changes. But our outlook did not assume that. If and when that happens, again being cautiously optimistic, obviously, we're prepared for it. We've got the capacity, we've got the sales channel, and we've got the product and innovation to be able to deliver as soon as that picks up. The state-owned enterprises are still doing well. They're still growing. They are buying the land, and that's why again, we think we've done really well with our strategy on key accounts and growing share.\nSteve Tusa: Great, thanks. And then just one last one for Anurag. With orders down potentially here in the second half, how should we think about the progress flow or the contract liability flow through the cash flow statement?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes, it's -- I mean, with orders being down, obviously, the some -- if orders were to be down -- firstly, we're not saying orders are going to be down in the second half of the year, obviously, it will come with lower advance payments for sure. However, as you can -- we've built up a fair amount of receivables in the first because of the higher revenue and that should kind of unwind into the second half of the year, right? So from a cash perspective, I think we will be fine over there, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Great. Thanks a lot.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nJudy Marks: Hey, Jeff.\nJeffrey Sprague: Just coming back around the price, Anurag, I think you gave us some good color on price, on orders on new equipment. Just wondering if you could give us a little color on what's coming through in revenues at this point on new equipment side and how that might build over the next two or three quarters.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Great. So, if you look at -- let me start with the second quarter first now. On the new equipment side, we saw about $5 million of pricing coming through to the bottom-line, and which was encouraging. We did expect more of it to come in the second half. And in the second half, we expect about $20 million of that to come through. So, if you look back now, it's been six consecutive quarters of price increases that we've done, and our backlog margin is up by over 100 basis points today. And if we kind of go through the course -- by the end of the year, we should see that backlog margin tick up a little bit more as we flush out some of the older orders with the older prices and the new -- and this mid-single digit price increase continues. If that happens, every 100 basis points of backlog price increase should go to about 50 basis points or about $30 million, $40 million for next year. So, we should kind of see that come through more next year. So, I think we're just beginning to see the price of new equipment coming into the revenue and that should tick up for the next few quarters.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great. And then maybe we could just get a little more color on mods. Obviously, it's very robust and creates some margin headwind as you do that work. You seem to be kind of managing that quite effectively. But my question is really more around what the back-end is looking like on the mods? Are you seeing higher service retention on the back-end, higher revenue per unit on the back-end? Just how kind of the mods is really playing into your overall service portfolio growth strategy?\nJudy Marks: Yes, Jeff. Listen, we really pleased with mod and how it's developing. And I think it's something -- I know it's something we're going to be talking about for many quarters to come as we've added it actually as a fifth strategic imperative at our company just last month or in May and very much focused on making it more like our new equipment business, which means you're going to see margins expand even though right now it's dilutive in the service segment. So, pleased with the quarter. Again, our fourth consecutive quarter of orders up over 10%, strong backlog. I would call, Asia as the standout in mod. We had great volume and some major projects in Asia Pacific in the quarter, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, India. And China is on a highly accelerating path due to their MX volume or MX mod product we have, and you're going to continue to see that grow as units continue to age in China. So, we're optimistic about mod. As I said in the last call, we're going to approach it by taking everything we've learned in new equipment and service and making it more production-ready versus custom. And I think that's going to benefit us in terms of margin expansion as we drive more revenue through it. Once we do a mod, our ability to retain that and put that -- keep that on Otis service is in the high 90%-s. So, much more significant than the conversion rates even than our industry-leading retention rate. So that's why mod is important to us. It not only gives us additional customer intimacy, both for the units that were on our portfolio, it lets us bring other units back to our portfolio, drives great customer value, energy efficiency, gets them ready for another multiple years, especially as you think about all the buildings now that are being repurposed. There's a huge amount opportunity for us as well with the offices changing to multi-use. So, mod is going to be something we talk about for a while going -- for almost consistently now every quarter, and you're going to see us continue to deliver on that, both in the orders, the backlog and then, most importantly, starting that service clock all over again.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Housden with RBC Capital Markets.\nNick Housden: Yes. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. So, it's been another strong performance from repair. I was wondering if you could just remind us how much of maintenance and repair is the repair piece specifically? And how sustainable the growth is? Because I think it's been a couple of quarters now where the growth has surprised to the upside. So, I'm wondering if maybe it's just a structurally stronger market than you maybe thought previously. That's the first one. Thanks.\nJudy Marks: Yes, Nick, good to hear from you. Hey, we don't disclose the difference between maintenance and repair. Really strong repair this quarter. And we keep waiting for the quarter where it's going to slow down. When you go back probably six quarters, we saw a bounce back when office use started picking up post COVID, because we had a little bit of a downturn in the early COVID days. So, it's been a good strong six to eight quarters. But again, as people potentially put off some discretionary mod decisions, your units are still aging and need even more repair. So, really pleased with repair globally. It was strong in every region. And we're not sure how long this can keep up. So, we think we've got it tuned appropriately in the outlook, but I'll let Anurag talk to that from an outlook perspective.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. Just a couple of points to add over there. I think the team has really executed very well on the repair side. I mean, after two years of double-digit growth, as we entered this year, we thought that repair would be a low-single digit growth. So, if you look at our outperformance on the service business, I think it's largely because of repair. Our maintenance portfolio is growing at 4.2%. We have price on a like-to-like basis of 4%. If you adjust for mix and churn, it's 200 basis points and maybe maintenance is more than high-single digits. So, repair is definitely growing double digit in the first half of the year. And it's not only because of coming back to work, just executing on a very good strategy over there. On the second half, the reason you see a step down in the service revenue is because maintenance continues to grow at the same clip, modernization backlog converts, as we're just assuming repair is going to be flattish. Now, we may be a little bit cautious over there. If we continue to execute well, there could be a little bit more upside in the second half of the year.\nNick Housden: That's great. And then, maybe just on Otis ONE. Can you just provide us with an update on your kind of general efforts on connectivity and how that's feeding into some of the metrics like retention and conversion, whether there's been any impact on pricing or profitability, and kind of when we might see that if we haven't already? Because I know you've got a slightly different strategy to one of your peers who's maybe pricing for it a bit more directly already. So, just curious to hear how the IoT operation is going.\nJudy Marks: Yes. We're really pleased. The Otis ONE units are making a difference. We are shipping all of our Gen3s with Otis ONE and our new Gen3 Core will have that in North America, the new product we announced this quarter. We're driving a much larger volume of Otis ONE this year because of all the shipments that are happening and because of all the conversions in China that are happening. So, where in the past, we would tell you about $100,000 a year, that number is going to be up significantly more in 2023, which is what continues us along that journey in our medium-term guide. Right now, we've got over 800,000 of our units connected, in general, more than just Otis ONE, but now Otis ONE is picking up a bigger proportion of that. And you'll see far more than 100,000 units this year connecting. It is making a difference. If you look at China alone, I would tell you it's the part of their significant service productivity, the majority of that is being driven by Otis ONE. Our running on arrivals are down across the globe, and that we are getting -- any time we have a connected product, our ability not just to convert, but to retain that especially from the ISPs, who really -- they don't want to come into an Otis elevator that's got an eView screen and figure out how to maintain that, and they can't offer that same connectivity. So, we provide all those numbers on an annual basis. We'll do that in fourth quarter, but it is an integral part of our strategy. It is working. It's helping us with service pricing. And as Anurag said on service pricing, like-for-like, we're up 4 points. So, we're up from last year. And honestly, I've got to give EMEA incredible kudos. They're up mid-single digits this year in service pricing. And Bernardo and the team there are doing a great job on that. But a big part of that's being connected. I was in Portugal a few weeks ago with our team, more than half of their portfolios connected and their service margins are outstanding. So, it makes a difference. Our strategy, again, to define that connection versus having people -- customers opt in from a subscription, we're getting subscription services too. But again, we chose to invest the CapEx and we chose how we were going to deploy Otis ONE, and I would tell you, you're seeing it in our service margins.\nNick Housden: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning, all.\nJudy Marks: Hey, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Judy, I want to pick up on a couple of things you already touched on, and I apologize, I jumped on a little late, so you might have covered this on the China question. But how are you seeing the divergence between national accounts and maybe more of the volume business in terms of where the weakness or where the pricing pressure is coming, obviously, kind of downstream implications for what that conversion will look like?\nJudy Marks: Yes. No, fair question, Josh. Listen, we call them key accounts, which are the large developers. Our team has continued to develop those key accounts. And as a matter of fact, our portion of national or key accounts that are now state-owned enterprises is significantly larger than the private developers. So that's really making a difference for us. The Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities continue to outperform not just the segment, but also outperform for Otis versus the lower-tier cities. But in the lower tier cities, it was volume for us. And our team performed pretty well. As you look at the second quarter, the positive segments in China were the same as the first quarter, infrastructure and industrial, and the weakness was more in resi and commercial. But I think we -- I like the strategy we're on, again, having those state-owned enterprises. And then we're seeing what's going to happen again with the government policy, with the tone that's being set, and then how these policy eases, whether it's mortgages, lending rates, or again, houses -- just the whole philosophy of housing is for living versus investment. That phrase was no longer used on Monday after many years. So, we're watching it carefully. We think we've got the right tuning for the second half if there is an upturn with either stimulus or just sentiment helping on volumes, we're ready and you'll see it flow through.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then just shifting over to the mod business and Jeff's question. I know you guys have aspirations to bring up those margins over time. Obviously, your conversion rates or your attachment rates are good on the back end. Is this a function of scale and sort of ramping up volume on this more standard workforce business versus customization? Is it more price discipline? Sort of what are the key either milestones or initiatives that you need to do to bring the margins to add up? Or is it simply just a waiting game of getting us through the backlog?\nAnurag Maheshwari: A great question, Josh. And I think you answered it, it's a bit of everything, right? So, if you kind of look at our mod business, just to level set everyone, firstly, it is our lowest margin segment today even relative to new equipment and, obviously, repair and maintenance. But as we standardize the products, as we build scale, and as we kind of get a more sustained go-to-market strategy, we're already seeing those margins pick up because we're getting scale. So we are fairly confident that the trajectory that we are on right now that you should see mod margins pick up over the next six to nine months, and we will take the new equipment margin as well. So, it's on a good track right now.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Great color. Thanks, guys. Best of luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo.\nJoe O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nJudy Marks: Yes, thanks, Joe.\nJoe O'Dea: I wanted to start just on the -- circling back on the orders, backlog, kind of revenue dynamic, and just to understand really what you think about in terms of the revenue implications with some of the changes in the end market views for the year obviously, not impacting how you're thinking about '23. I'm not even really sure if it's impacting how you're thinking about '24. And so just as you think through what's happening out there, and I'm not sure how much of this is supply chain improving, project execution improving, folks that don't need to maybe order as far in advance versus things like interest rates and credit. And so, as you just think about the past few months and then the revised views on some of the demand trends in the markets, if you can sort of translate that to any kind of revenue implications right now?\nJudy Marks: Yes. So, let me just touch on a few at the top level. Supply chain is improving, and you're seeing that come through with the volumes we're being able to ship, and that's been helpful. As Anurag said in his opening remarks, commodities are improving as well. We had about a $15 million tailwind in the second quarter, and we've upped our outlook for commodities as well. So, price is up, commodities is up, supply chain is improving, that's all fairly positive. Our backlog, again, is at a record. And we -- it really will see us through 2024 with some certainty, with probably the question mark being on China, and when China bounces back and/or at what level. Our China team has done an incredible job on material productivity. And even though pricing is extremely competitive in China, we have hit at least price-cost neutral, the price-cost is slightly positive in China through the first half of the year. So that's going to -- if the market doesn't change and there's no stimulus, we'll adapt and continue to change our cost structure. If it does come back, we're ready.\nJoe O'Dea: And then -- thanks. Go ahead.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Go ahead, Joe.\nJoe O'Dea: I just wanted to touch on the pricing comment as well. And so just trajectory of pricing in China, has there been any indication of stabilization recently? And then, also in developed markets, are you seeing any pricing implications just from maybe a little bit lower demand patterns as well as costs starting to improve?\nJudy Marks: So China pricing is very competitive, but no one has yet taken it down to being unrealistic or undisciplined. So it is the most challenging place for us to get price, and I think that's -- you see that market wide. Everywhere else in the matured and the emerging markets, we're seeing good price, and we're seeing rational competitors doing the same things.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. exactly. I mean we are still seeing mid-single digit price increases in EMEA and Americas and low- to mid-single digit in Asia. Now, if commodity costs do come down and material productivity comes down, you could see a little bit more pricing coming down. But the key metric here is price-cost. And I think we're going to be neutral or positive, as of now, we are, and let's see how this trend continues. But so far, it seems quite rational.\nJoe O'Dea: Thank you.\nJudy Marks: Liz?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: Hey, good morning, guys.\nJudy Marks: Good morning.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Hey, good morning.\nGautam Khanna: Just to follow up on just the dynamics on '24, I was curious, do you have an early read of where pricing might head portfolio-wide in '24 relative to '23? And then, secondly, have you seen any indications of backlog stretching, whether it's decommits or just timelines extending across any of these markets where orders have been a bit softer? Thanks.\nJudy Marks: Yes. So, decommits don't really happen based on kind of non-refundable deposits in our business. So, people don't double order and there's not a lot -- we do measure jobs that -- and we keep a careful eye on jobs that decommit. It's a very small low-single digit at most percentage globally of the 10,000 installations that are going on somewhere in the world every day. Are there times -- and we experienced this in the past where there have been some labor challenges from other trades and jobs have slowed down, that seems to have gone away in the Americas. So, we're not seeing that stretch out. So, we either see it got them at the beginning when we've done a proposal, we've been verbally awarded, but it doesn't go to a booking when we get that deposit because of potentially rates and things like that, and we're watching that carefully as well. I think it's too early for us to talk about '24 pricing. We're going to focus on the second half and keep building our backlog strong and executing on that backlog.\nGautam Khanna: Thanks.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Judy Marks for closing remarks.\nJudy Marks: Thanks, Liz. Our results in the first half reflect the continued execution of our strategy as we remain focused on ensuring we continue delivering value for our shareholders in the balance of 2023 and beyond. Thank you all for joining the call today, and please stay safe and well.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Otis delivered a strong second quarter and a successful first half of the year. In Q2, we grew organic sales high-single digits in both segments, expanded adjusted operating profit margin 20 basis points, and achieved 7% adjusted EPS growth. This performance again demonstrates the strength of our strategy and our ability to execute and deliver. We have momentum going into the second half and beyond, as new equipment share was up slightly in the quarter and up about 50 basis points in the first half, we grew our maintenance portfolio 4.2%, and continue to grow our new equipment and modernization backlogs. We generated $409 million in free cash flow in the quarter, and returned $175 million to shareholders through share repurchases, taking year-to-date repurchases to $350 million. From an innovation standpoint, this quarter we launched our latest elevator in North America the Gen3 Core, designed specifically to address the needs of customers in the large two to six storey building segment. Gen3 Core is built off the proven design and flat-belt technology of Otis' Gen2 family, while also being equipped with Otis ONE, our IoT platform. Gen3 Core will be manufactured in Florence, South Carolina, and sales will begin this fall. Here are some exciting customer highlights from the second quarter. In Montreal, Otis Canada was selected to provide 28 units, including 11 SkyRise units to the Ho\u0302pital Vaudreuil-Soulanges. Hospitals require reliable transportation between floors at all times and we're excited to be a part of this important healthcare initiative expected to open in 2026. It's our latest collaboration in Canada with General Contractor Pomerleau. In Egypt, Otis will provide a total of 57 units for the Iconic Tower in El Alamein, including SkyRise and Gen2 elevators as well as our Link escalators. At 267 meters, this will be the second tallest tower in Egypt and will offer more than 200,000 square meters of housing as well as services and leisure. In China, another 280 elevators and escalators from Otis will keep people moving along Tianjin Metro's new Line 7. This project will bring the total number of Otis units on the city's expanding subway network to more than 1,800. Since it opened, Otis equipment has kept Tianjin Metro passengers on the move, and has been a critical part of the country's transportation network since 1984. And as the Indian government continues to invest in transportation infrastructure, Otis will install 255 units, including our heavy-duty public escalators and Gen2 elevators, for the new Bhopal and Indoor Metro. This is the first metro line in the state of Madhya Pradesh and is expected to serve 500,000 passengers daily. All the equipment will be manufactured at our factory in Bengaluru. We made progress on our ESG priorities, and in the second quarter, received Zero Waste to Landfill Certification for all three of our Spanish factories from AENOR, the Spanish Association for Standardization and Certification. This is important progress towards our goal of achieving a 100% factory eligibility for Zero Waste to Landfill Certification by 2025. In addition, our factory in San Sebastian, Spain received its LEED Platinum certification, the first factory in Spain to receive this designation. The facility opened last year and was designed to reduce environmental impact in the construction and operations through materials used in its waste control system. San Sebastian is our fifth factory to achieve LEED certification. We continue pursuing ways we can improve our environmental impact, which is an increasing focus of our colleagues, customers and shareholders. Moving to Slide 4, Q2 results and 2023 outlook. Overall, organic sales increased 9.5% with all geographic regions exhibiting strong new equipment organic sales growth in the quarter. And in service, all lines of business contributed to our best service organic sales growth performance since spin. We grew our adjusted new equipment backlog at constant currency by 5% compared to prior year and 3% to the prior quarter, despite a tough compare on new equipment orders, which were down 12%. We continued a strong trend in modernization with orders up 16% at constant currency and backlog up 14% in the second quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of 10% or greater mod orders growth. We grew adjusted operating profit by $60 million and expanded margin by 20 basis points. We generated $409 million of free cash flow, a conversion rate of 109% of GAAP net income. Before sharing our updated 2023 outlook, let me update you on our current geographic outlook for new equipment markets. In Asia Pacific, there's no change to our previous outlook. We expect the new equipment market to grow mid-single digits or better, led by India. In EMEA, the market is now expected to be down high-single digits in 2023, worse than our prior expectations of down low- to mid-single digits. This decline is driven by Northern Europe as customer delays in buying decisions persist. The Americas market has weakened over the past few months and we now expect it to be down high-single digits in units. From an end-market perspective, this decline is driven by multifamily residential coming down from a high level over the past two years, slightly offset by a more resilient commercial market. And finally, in China, we now expect the market to be down 10% compared to our prior guide of down 5% to 10%. This decline is primarily driven by a lack of momentum as we exited the second quarter at a weaker run rate than we had anticipated. Despite the weakening of the new equipment markets globally, we've maintained a strong backlog, giving us good visibility to future sales growth. On the service side, there is no change to our outlook for global installed base growth of roughly 5%, led by Asia. Our strong performance in the second quarter and the progress we've made on our strategic imperatives gives us confidence to improve our 2023 outlook. Organic sales are now expected to be in the range of 4.5% to 6%, with net sales in a range of $14 billion to $14.3 billion. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be $2.25 billion to $2.28 billion, up $155 million to $175 million at constant currency. Adjusted operating profit at actual currency is expected to be up $125 million to $155 million, including a $20 million to $30 million headwind from foreign exchange translation. We're raising our guidance for adjusted EPS, and it's now expected in range of $3.45 to $3.50, up 9% to 10% versus the prior year. Lastly, our expectation for free cash flow remains unchanged at about $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion or approximately 105% to 115% conversion of GAAP net income. We continue to prioritize returning cash to shareholders, and I'm pleased to share we're increasing our share repurchases this year to $800 million. Turning to Slide 5. As announced earlier today, we're launching a program called UpLift to transform our operating model, to continue to drive sustainable profitable growth within our business. After three-plus years as a public company in which we've grown new equipment share, expanded operating margins, grown EPS, built a formidable backlog and returned approximately $2.7 billion in cash to shareholders, we're designing Otis for the next phase to ensure high performance and resiliency regardless of the economic environment we may face in the future. We're launching UpLift to drive efficiency across the organization while continuing to prioritize the customer experience. Going forward, we expect our sales specialization to continue to accelerate our growth, our innovation cycles to continue at a rapid pace, and our customer intimacy to continue unabated. Our management team is laser-focused on ensuring that our operating performance can achieve a new higher-performance tier through the transformation of our financial processes, improving our supply chain procurement and rightsizing our cost base where needed among other aspects of the program. Throughout the next two years, we expect the program to generate approximately $150 million in savings, as we drive efficiency across the organization. Our plan is to update our shareholders at regular intervals on the progress we're making with this program and ultimately you'll see the results in better performance, growth, operating profit and returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Anurag to walk through our Q2 results in more detail. Yes, Nigel, let me take that. And we're calling it UpLift. I think you called it Uprise. But let me take that. First and foremost, I think it's really important for people to understand why we're doing this now, and then I'll get to kind of where the cost takeout is going to be, which is mainly in G&A. So, it will be additive to our other productivity initiatives as well as our modernization growth. But where it comes from is, we spun a little over three-plus years ago. And since that time, the team and our colleagues, I mean, tremendous thanks to them, we've gained share in new equipment, we've driven growth, expanded operating profit margins, we've returned $1 billion in cash to our shareholders, and quarter-after-quarter, we've executed our strategy and performed. And I think it's important to know that we're approaching UpLift from a position of strength. I think it's incumbent on leaders to prepare the company, to take us to the next level. And that's what we're doing as an executive leadership team across the company. So, we're going to focus really on three areas. The operating model itself to give us more speed and agility. We're tremendously distributed organization with our 1,400 branch offices, serving our customers globally. We want that speed and agility to be more customer-centric. We're going to streamline processes, that's going to be extremely important. I think it's something we've learned coming out of spin and now through performance that we can be more consistent geographically and we can streamline our processes from financial processes all the way through to really how we sell to customers, and we're looking forward to that. And the third element is taking advantage of our scale and acting as an enterprise and implementing some pretty significant focus on supply chain and especially indirect. So, you add those three together, it adds up to the $150 million we're going to return, which is predominantly through G&A. Again, it's additive to what we're doing. Anything above that we generate, we are planning on reinvesting in our business to give us new capabilities, new competencies, to continue to invest in innovation. We brought more products to market since spin than we have for many years. We're going to continue to do that as we create the connected Otis of the future and take us to the next level. Thanks. Yes, well, I'll let Anurag answer the backlog, but let me just really straight on hit, we do not expect a lower backlog as we exit '23 and enter '24. Really pleased with the 5% backlog growth. And if you go to our first appendix chart, we have a record backlog, which gives us really good line-of-sight for our future and really helped us drive the sales growth that you saw the organic growth in both segments. But let me talk to the market and then I'll turn backlog over to Anurag, just so you get -- to give you a little more color. Let me start in Asia Pac. We expect the market itself on new equipment to still grow mid-single digits. We're seeing really strong markets. We're actually seeing double-digit demand in India and really pleased with how our teams responding there. But think of Asia Pac continuing at mid-single. The Americas, what we saw in the first half at the market level in units, was the first half was down mid-teens. Our view is the second half is going to be flattish to slightly down. So, the full year will be down high-single for the market itself. The units are slowing, but the Americas market itself was sequentially flat. So, we're watching all the indicators, obviously, talking to our customers, looking at Dodge, looking at ABI, but again, watching the Americas carefully and happy to talk about the orders there, as well as we go through these questions. In EMEA, we say that we're going to be down high-single digit for the rest of '23. We're watching the rate impact, a little bit of a sluggish market especially in Northern Europe, I think Germany, France and U.K. being weaker, and it's delays in decision-making uncertainty. The proposals are still going in. The customers, it's a matter of when they're going to make those decisions. Spain and Italy are pretty resilient. And for the segment itself the Middle East is up low-single digits. We're going into Europe with a strong backlog for the second half. And again, when you look at our backlog, we're looking out 18 to 24 months with a backlog of this scale. On China, the market itself, we're calling down 10%. We started -- April momentum was good, May was weaker, and we really exited Q2 with the volumes being down in the market itself. So that lack of acceleration that we had been planning on for the book-and-ship business in the second half really has taken us to the lower end of the range. The only thing I'll remind everybody, again, that new equipment market outlook is very different from the service outlook, which is still solid. It's growing mid-single digit, again, led by Asia, low-single digit in developed markets. Anurag, do you want to talk to backlog? Yes, even in EMEA, Julian, our backlog is up modestly both versus last year and versus last quarter. So, we're really -- we're watching the backlog closely. We've always shared with our shareholders that you should watch us at year-end, it's the best indicator for our next year in terms of top-line and bottom-line. And that's -- we expect this year to be no different. Hey, Steve. Yes, let me try and address kind of multiple items there. First, let me start with the service business. This was the eighth straight quarter we had mid- to high-teens portfolio growth in China. And Sally Loh now leads our China organization, and she is really been driving that. We are now at 350,000 units on our portfolio in China, which is a pretty big step up from when we made this commitment to grow our service business. And it is driving returns and we're increasing the conversion rates as we go. Our China, even though, the segment was down 10% in the second quarter, Steve, we were down 5%. So, yet another quarter of market share gain in new equipment, which bodes well for the two-year warranty and then for the conversions for us as well. Because even though there may be less units, our strategy to open service depots, to have the ability to drive the service conversion, shipping Gen3s with Otis ONE connected is -- at the same time, we're accelerating our conversion rates versus what we had traditionally had in the past. So, even if the volume goes down a little, our rates will offset that. So that doesn't really get me concerned. In terms of what we really changed in the second half, it was -- we had expected things to tick up, especially on the book-and-bill business -- book-and-ship business, excuse me. And as we exited the second half, we just hadn't seen the momentum. Now like you, we've heard out of Monday out of the [indiscernible] a different tone. We have to see what that translates to. I'm cautiously optimistic that once that tone is set from Beijing. There is positive potential that -- especially in the larger tier cities really starts happening and sentiment changes. But our outlook did not assume that. If and when that happens, again being cautiously optimistic, obviously, we're prepared for it. We've got the capacity, we've got the sales channel, and we've got the product and innovation to be able to deliver as soon as that picks up. The state-owned enterprises are still doing well. They're still growing. They are buying the land, and that's why again, we think we've done really well with our strategy on key accounts and growing share. Hey, Jeff. Yes, Jeff. Listen, we really pleased with mod and how it's developing. And I think it's something -- I know it's something we're going to be talking about for many quarters to come as we've added it actually as a fifth strategic imperative at our company just last month or in May and very much focused on making it more like our new equipment business, which means you're going to see margins expand even though right now it's dilutive in the service segment. So, pleased with the quarter. Again, our fourth consecutive quarter of orders up over 10%, strong backlog. I would call, Asia as the standout in mod. We had great volume and some major projects in Asia Pacific in the quarter, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, India. And China is on a highly accelerating path due to their MX volume or MX mod product we have, and you're going to continue to see that grow as units continue to age in China. So, we're optimistic about mod. As I said in the last call, we're going to approach it by taking everything we've learned in new equipment and service and making it more production-ready versus custom. And I think that's going to benefit us in terms of margin expansion as we drive more revenue through it. Once we do a mod, our ability to retain that and put that -- keep that on Otis service is in the high 90%-s. So, much more significant than the conversion rates even than our industry-leading retention rate. So that's why mod is important to us. It not only gives us additional customer intimacy, both for the units that were on our portfolio, it lets us bring other units back to our portfolio, drives great customer value, energy efficiency, gets them ready for another multiple years, especially as you think about all the buildings now that are being repurposed. There's a huge amount opportunity for us as well with the offices changing to multi-use. So, mod is going to be something we talk about for a while going -- for almost consistently now every quarter, and you're going to see us continue to deliver on that, both in the orders, the backlog and then, most importantly, starting that service clock all over again. Yes, Nick, good to hear from you. Hey, we don't disclose the difference between maintenance and repair. Really strong repair this quarter. And we keep waiting for the quarter where it's going to slow down. When you go back probably six quarters, we saw a bounce back when office use started picking up post COVID, because we had a little bit of a downturn in the early COVID days. So, it's been a good strong six to eight quarters. But again, as people potentially put off some discretionary mod decisions, your units are still aging and need even more repair. So, really pleased with repair globally. It was strong in every region. And we're not sure how long this can keep up. So, we think we've got it tuned appropriately in the outlook, but I'll let Anurag talk to that from an outlook perspective. Yes. We're really pleased. The Otis ONE units are making a difference. We are shipping all of our Gen3s with Otis ONE and our new Gen3 Core will have that in North America, the new product we announced this quarter. We're driving a much larger volume of Otis ONE this year because of all the shipments that are happening and because of all the conversions in China that are happening. So, where in the past, we would tell you about $100,000 a year, that number is going to be up significantly more in 2023, which is what continues us along that journey in our medium-term guide. Right now, we've got over 800,000 of our units connected, in general, more than just Otis ONE, but now Otis ONE is picking up a bigger proportion of that. And you'll see far more than 100,000 units this year connecting. It is making a difference. If you look at China alone, I would tell you it's the part of their significant service productivity, the majority of that is being driven by Otis ONE. Our running on arrivals are down across the globe, and that we are getting -- any time we have a connected product, our ability not just to convert, but to retain that especially from the ISPs, who really -- they don't want to come into an Otis elevator that's got an eView screen and figure out how to maintain that, and they can't offer that same connectivity. So, we provide all those numbers on an annual basis. We'll do that in fourth quarter, but it is an integral part of our strategy. It is working. It's helping us with service pricing. And as Anurag said on service pricing, like-for-like, we're up 4 points. So, we're up from last year. And honestly, I've got to give EMEA incredible kudos. They're up mid-single digits this year in service pricing. And Bernardo and the team there are doing a great job on that. But a big part of that's being connected. I was in Portugal a few weeks ago with our team, more than half of their portfolios connected and their service margins are outstanding. So, it makes a difference. Our strategy, again, to define that connection versus having people -- customers opt in from a subscription, we're getting subscription services too. But again, we chose to invest the CapEx and we chose how we were going to deploy Otis ONE, and I would tell you, you're seeing it in our service margins. Hey, Josh. Yes. No, fair question, Josh. Listen, we call them key accounts, which are the large developers. Our team has continued to develop those key accounts. And as a matter of fact, our portion of national or key accounts that are now state-owned enterprises is significantly larger than the private developers. So that's really making a difference for us. The Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities continue to outperform not just the segment, but also outperform for Otis versus the lower-tier cities. But in the lower tier cities, it was volume for us. And our team performed pretty well. As you look at the second quarter, the positive segments in China were the same as the first quarter, infrastructure and industrial, and the weakness was more in resi and commercial. But I think we -- I like the strategy we're on, again, having those state-owned enterprises. And then we're seeing what's going to happen again with the government policy, with the tone that's being set, and then how these policy eases, whether it's mortgages, lending rates, or again, houses -- just the whole philosophy of housing is for living versus investment. That phrase was no longer used on Monday after many years. So, we're watching it carefully. We think we've got the right tuning for the second half if there is an upturn with either stimulus or just sentiment helping on volumes, we're ready and you'll see it flow through. Yes, thanks, Joe. Yes. So, let me just touch on a few at the top level. Supply chain is improving, and you're seeing that come through with the volumes we're being able to ship, and that's been helpful. As Anurag said in his opening remarks, commodities are improving as well. We had about a $15 million tailwind in the second quarter, and we've upped our outlook for commodities as well. So, price is up, commodities is up, supply chain is improving, that's all fairly positive. Our backlog, again, is at a record. And we -- it really will see us through 2024 with some certainty, with probably the question mark being on China, and when China bounces back and/or at what level. Our China team has done an incredible job on material productivity. And even though pricing is extremely competitive in China, we have hit at least price-cost neutral, the price-cost is slightly positive in China through the first half of the year. So that's going to -- if the market doesn't change and there's no stimulus, we'll adapt and continue to change our cost structure. If it does come back, we're ready. So China pricing is very competitive, but no one has yet taken it down to being unrealistic or undisciplined. So it is the most challenging place for us to get price, and I think that's -- you see that market wide. Everywhere else in the matured and the emerging markets, we're seeing good price, and we're seeing rational competitors doing the same things. Liz? Good morning. Yes. So, decommits don't really happen based on kind of non-refundable deposits in our business. So, people don't double order and there's not a lot -- we do measure jobs that -- and we keep a careful eye on jobs that decommit. It's a very small low-single digit at most percentage globally of the 10,000 installations that are going on somewhere in the world every day. Are there times -- and we experienced this in the past where there have been some labor challenges from other trades and jobs have slowed down, that seems to have gone away in the Americas. So, we're not seeing that stretch out. So, we either see it got them at the beginning when we've done a proposal, we've been verbally awarded, but it doesn't go to a booking when we get that deposit because of potentially rates and things like that, and we're watching that carefully as well. I think it's too early for us to talk about '24 pricing. We're going to focus on the second half and keep building our backlog strong and executing on that backlog. Thanks, Liz. Our results in the first half reflect the continued execution of our strategy as we remain focused on ensuring we continue delivering value for our shareholders in the balance of 2023 and beyond. Thank you all for joining the call today, and please stay safe and well."

            "content": "Thank you, Judy. Starting with second quarter results on Slide 6. Net sales of $3.7 billion were up 6.7% and organic sales were up 9.5%, driven by strong performance in all business lines. Adjusted operating profit was up $49 million at actual FX and $60 million at constant currency. Drop through on higher volume, productivity, and pricing in both segments, and commodity tailwinds were partially offset by inflationary pressures, including annual wage increases, unfavorable new equipment mix, and higher corporate costs. Adjusted EPS increased 7% or $0.06, reflecting $0.11 of benefit from operations. This strong operational performance and accretion from a lower share count were partially offset by a $0.03 headwind from foreign exchange translation and a $0.03 tax headwind as a result of a tough compare. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter at $409 million or 109% conversion, up $83 million. The increase versus prior year was driven by higher net income and improved changes in working capital. Moving to Slide 7. In the second quarter, as we noted previously, new equipment orders faced a tough compare and were down 12% at constant currency. New equipment backlog, however, continues to trend higher, and was up 5% at constant currency versus the prior year and up 3% sequentially, with all regions being up, providing visibility for sales in the second half and beyond. Globally, pricing on new equipment orders was up low-single digit, building on solid pricing improvements from the middle of 2022. Pricing trends improved mid-single digits or better year-over-year in all regions excluding China. While pricing was down low-single digits in China due to deflationary pressure and the softer market, we maintained price-cost neutrality by focusing on material productivity. New equipment organic sales were up nearly 10% in the quarter with all regions contributing. APAC grew double digits, driven by strong performance in Korea and India; EMEA grew high-single digits, primarily from Southern Europe; the Americas grew high-single digits as job site delays and field inefficiencies eased; and China delivered mid-single-digit growth by executing on a stable backlog. Overall, we saw solid execution across all regions. Adjusted operating profit was up $15 million at constant currency. The benefits from higher volume, price beginning to flow from the backlog, strong productivity and better-than-anticipated commodity tailwinds were partially offset by continued unfavorable regional and product mix, transactional FX and higher SG&A expense. Now turning to service segment results on Slide 8. Maintenance units were up 4.2%, with growth in all regions, led by China, where we achieved another quarter of high-teens portfolio growth. Modernization backlog expanded by 14%, with growth across all regions, driven by strong orders growth of 16% in the quarter. Service organic sales grew 9.4%, the highest rate since spin with growth in all business lines. Maintenance and repair grew 9.1% from better-than-expected repair volume. Our portfolio continued to expand 4.2% and we achieved strong pricing, up 4 points on a like-for-like basis. With strong backlog conversion in the quarter, modernization sales were up 10.9%, with particularly strong performance in Asia, including China. Service profit was up $52 million at constant currency as the benefit from higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity were partially offset by annual wage increases and higher material costs. Margins expanded 50 basis points, in line with our full year guidance. Overall, we're pleased with our first half results, where we gained approximately 50 basis points of new equipment share, grew the portfolio again over 4%, increased organic sales by 6.6%, and improved operating profit by $67 million at constant currency, while continuing to grow our backlog in both new equipment and modernization. This provides good growth visibility over the next several quarters. With that, moving to Slide 9 and the revised outlook. Starting with sales. With strong service momentum, we are raising outlook and now expect total Otis organic sales to be up 4.5% to 6% versus the prior guide of 4% to 6%. Adjusted operating profit growth at constant currency is expected to be in the range of $155 million to $175 million, and approximately $15 million increase at the midpoint versus the prior guide, linked to the better-than-expected service volume. Service margins are still expected to expand about 50 basis points to 24% and we anticipate new equipment margins to expand 20 basis points to 6.8%. Overall, margins are expected to be up approximately 30 basis points to 16%, the high end of the previous range. Adjusted EPS is expected to be up 9% to 10% versus the prior year, within the range of $3.45 to $3.50, and approximately $0.03 increase at the midpoint versus the prior outlook, largely the result of strong operational performance. Due to our continued cash mobilization activities, we have increased our share repurchase target to $800 million, and the outlook for free cash flow is $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion or roughly 110% conversion. Now taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 10. There is no change to the overall new equipment outlook. By region, we still expect the Americas and EMEA to be up mid-single digits, consistent with our prior guide. Within Asia, Asia Pacific is performing better than anticipated, led by India, which we expect to offset a decline in China due to the continuing weak demand environment. Turning to service. Organic sales are now expected to improve by 50 basis points versus the prior outlook to a range of 6% to 7%, with improvement in all business lines. We're increasing the outlook for maintenance and repair organic sales, now expected to be up 5.5% to 6.5% in '23, driven by the strong first half repair volume. Supported by a robust backlog, which is up mid-teens, we are increasing our modernization organic sales outlook to be in the range of 7% to 9%. Moving to Slide 11. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 9% to 10% in the range of $3.45 to $3.50, a $0.31 increase for the full year with $0.29 coming from operations. Overall, with a strong first half behind us, we are well positioned to improve our outlook and deliver solid second half financial performance on the strength of a service-driven business model and focus on operational excellence. With that, Liz, please open the line for questions. Hey, thanks, Nigel, for the question. I guess the first one is what we've done is we just tightened the new equipment margin to 20 basis points. So, as you noted, right, we haven't changed our sales outlook for new equipment. But within that, China, which we thought was going to be flattish for the year, is going to be down low-single digits. And as you're aware, China is a higher new equipment profit margin market, but we're able to offset that with definitely better commodity tailwinds, initially we were expecting about $25 million, $30 million, now about $40 million. Pricing, definitely in the second half is going to be better than the first half. You put the two together, I think we tightened to about 20 -- which more than offset China, so which is why we tightened to 20 basis points on the new equipment side. Absolutely. Thanks, Judy. Even if we assume there is no orders growth, we would expect our backlog to be up low-single digit by the end of the year. And the reason for that, Julian, is because we tend to book more orders in any given year than we ship as some of the orders are larger projects and multi-year in nature. So clearly, I mean, it's not a right analogy, but if you look at our book-to-bill, it's definitely been far higher than 1. So, we booked definitely more orders than we ship over year. Well, let's even if -- assume if conditions worsen from here and there is a new equipment orders even slightly decline to even mid-single digit, I think we will end the year with backlog at least being higher. More importantly, if you look at our backlog mix today, in Americas, it's still fairly high, which is a multiyear backlog that we have. Asia Pacific is fairly good. And that should convert into revenues next year, where China being the highest book-to-ship. So, it gives us kind of confidence as we go into next year to see our new equipment revenue growing in line of medium-term guidance. Yes. So, if you kind of look at the second half of the year, for the first six months, we did about $1.72 of EPS, which means $1.76 in the back half, and I think it's pretty equally split between Q3 and Q4, Julian, in terms of our EPS split. If you look at new equipment, and I'll just start with new equipment and go on to service, we expect about 3%-ish growth in the second half of the year. I think it should be kind of equal between the two quarters around that. We're going to see commodity tailwind pricing at the tune of about $30 million, $40 million. Obviously, a little bit of that is more towards Q4 than Q3, but the margin rate, which should be above 7%, should be between -- in Q3, Q4 should be no difference between that. Now, if you look at the service, we're doing $40 million, $50 million of operating profit increase every quarter. We expect that again in Q3 and Q4. Maintenance continues to do well with the pricing as well as the portfolio growth and we're converting the mod backlog. So, I think we're in a pretty good run rate over there. And obviously, there's a little bit more of corporate expense headwind in Q3 versus Q4. So, you put all puts and takes over there, I think the cadence between Q3, Q4 from an EPS perspective should be pretty similar. Yes, it's -- I mean, with orders being down, obviously, the some -- if orders were to be down -- firstly, we're not saying orders are going to be down in the second half of the year, obviously, it will come with lower advance payments for sure. However, as you can -- we've built up a fair amount of receivables in the first because of the higher revenue and that should kind of unwind into the second half of the year, right? So from a cash perspective, I think we will be fine over there, Steve. Yes, thanks. Great. So, if you look at -- let me start with the second quarter first now. On the new equipment side, we saw about $5 million of pricing coming through to the bottom-line, and which was encouraging. We did expect more of it to come in the second half. And in the second half, we expect about $20 million of that to come through. So, if you look back now, it's been six consecutive quarters of price increases that we've done, and our backlog margin is up by over 100 basis points today. And if we kind of go through the course -- by the end of the year, we should see that backlog margin tick up a little bit more as we flush out some of the older orders with the older prices and the new -- and this mid-single digit price increase continues. If that happens, every 100 basis points of backlog price increase should go to about 50 basis points or about $30 million, $40 million for next year. So, we should kind of see that come through more next year. So, I think we're just beginning to see the price of new equipment coming into the revenue and that should tick up for the next few quarters. Yes. Just a couple of points to add over there. I think the team has really executed very well on the repair side. I mean, after two years of double-digit growth, as we entered this year, we thought that repair would be a low-single digit growth. So, if you look at our outperformance on the service business, I think it's largely because of repair. Our maintenance portfolio is growing at 4.2%. We have price on a like-to-like basis of 4%. If you adjust for mix and churn, it's 200 basis points and maybe maintenance is more than high-single digits. So, repair is definitely growing double digit in the first half of the year. And it's not only because of coming back to work, just executing on a very good strategy over there. On the second half, the reason you see a step down in the service revenue is because maintenance continues to grow at the same clip, modernization backlog converts, as we're just assuming repair is going to be flattish. Now, we may be a little bit cautious over there. If we continue to execute well, there could be a little bit more upside in the second half of the year. A great question, Josh. And I think you answered it, it's a bit of everything, right? So, if you kind of look at our mod business, just to level set everyone, firstly, it is our lowest margin segment today even relative to new equipment and, obviously, repair and maintenance. But as we standardize the products, as we build scale, and as we kind of get a more sustained go-to-market strategy, we're already seeing those margins pick up because we're getting scale. So we are fairly confident that the trajectory that we are on right now that you should see mod margins pick up over the next six to nine months, and we will take the new equipment margin as well. So, it's on a good track right now. Go ahead, Joe. Yes. exactly. I mean we are still seeing mid-single digit price increases in EMEA and Americas and low- to mid-single digit in Asia. Now, if commodity costs do come down and material productivity comes down, you could see a little bit more pricing coming down. But the key metric here is price-cost. And I think we're going to be neutral or positive, as of now, we are, and let's see how this trend continues. But so far, it seems quite rational. Hey, good morning."

Presentation materials are available for download from Otis' website at www.otis.com.  I'll now turn it over to Michael Rednor, Senior Director of Investor Relations.\nMichael Rednor : Thank you, [Didi]. Welcome to Otis' First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Judy Marks, Chair, CEO and President; and Anurag Maheshwari, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and significant nonrecurring items.  A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis' SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We hope everyone listening is safe and well. Starting with first quarter highlights on Slide 3. Otis delivered a solid first quarter to start 2023, driving strong financial performance and executing on our capital allocation strategy despite continued market uncertainty. We achieved organic sales growth, driven by our service business, and expanded adjusted service operating profit margins by 40 basis points, leading to mid-single-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Service segment performance, in addition to our maintenance portfolio growth of more than 4%, reinforces the strength of our business model. We continue to execute our balanced capital allocation strategy with $175 million of share repurchases in the first quarter. Yesterday, we announced a 17.2% increase to our quarterly dividend. Since spin, we have increased our dividend 70%, emphasizing the importance we place on disciplined capital management and delivering value to our shareholders. In the Americas, building on our strong track record of major project execution and service across Canada, Otis was selected by the Montreal Metro System to replace escalators at 17 stations, while providing units for 5 new blue line stations. In total, 97 Otis escalators will keep metro passengers on the move daily. In China, FA Metro placed a new order of 250 Otis ONE connected escalators and elevators across 3 new lines. Real-time data insights, remote monitoring and predictive maintenance will all help bring the FA Metro into the future and add to our growing infrastructure installed base. In Germany, Otis has been selected by Cigna Group to modernize the iconic Dusseldorf Department Store Carsch Haus as part of a larger renovation. Otis will provide 17 units, including our energy-efficient link escalators and Gen2 stream elevators with regen drives. The elevators will also feature e-view in car displays. After the modernization is completed in 2024, Otis will service the units as part of our long-standing framework contract with [indiscernible] Group, which operates Carsch Haus and other leading department stores in Germany. In South Korea, we're providing 51 of our signature Gen2 elevators for the Sunshine [indiscernible] luxury apartment complex. The campus includes more than 2,000 units and buildings up to 29 stories. And we continue to drive progress toward our ESG goals as shared in our 2022 ESG report published earlier in April. Just this month, we announced the installation of solar panels at our Nippon Otis Logistics and Engineering Center in Japan. This upgrade is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the facility by 27% compared to 2022, and represents our eighth manufacturing site globally with solar panel arrays. Moving to Slide 4, Q1 results and 2023 outlook. New equipment orders were up 7.4%, driven by strong growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific, and we ended the quarter with adjusted backlog up 10% at constant currency. We continue to drive share gains in new equipment with 70 basis points of improvement in the quarter, led by our outperformance in China, where our orders were down modestly in a market where we estimate was down approximately 10%. We continue to perform well across all other regions. We're especially encouraged by our modernization performance in the quarter with nearly 30% orders growth driven by strong performance in the Americas and Asia. This growth is driven by our continued rollout of standardized packages for our mod offerings, coupled with improvements in our sales force coverage. Our mod backlog is up double digits in all regions, as mod demand continues to remain robust. Organic sales were up 3.6%, and adjusted operating profit was up $7 million at constant currency, driven by performance in the Service segment. Before I discuss our 2023 financial outlook, let me briefly update you on our global market outlook, which largely remains unchanged. Entering the year, we expected global new equipment to be down mid-single digits to approximately 900,000 units, largely due to China, which we expected to be down 5% to 10%, and our outlook in that key region remains the same. We also expected Asia Pac to be up mid-single digits or better, and both the Americas and EMEA to be flat.  With the first quarter in the books, we now expect Asia Pac to come in closer to high single digits, offsetting a reduction in our EMEA outlook, which we now expect to be down low to mid-single digits. Our outlook for global installed base growth remains unchanged at roughly 5%, which will add close to 1 million maintenance units, bringing the installed base to roughly 21 million units with high-single-digit growth in Asia and low-single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA. Turning to Otis' 2023 financial outlook. We now expect net sales to be in the range of $13.9 billion to $14.2 billion, up 2.5% to 4.5% versus the prior year, which is a 75-basis-point improvement from the prior outlook at the midpoint, driven by FX. We still expect organic sales to be up 4% to 6%, with new equipment up 3% to 5% and Service up 5% to 7%. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $90 million to $150 million at actual currency and up $130 million to $175 million at constant currency, with adjusted EPS in the range of $3.40 to $3.50, a 7% to 10% increase versus the prior year and an approximately $0.03 improvement from the prior outlook at the midpoint. We expect free cash flow to come in as we guided in February, in a range of $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion with 105% to 115% conversion of GAAP net income. We remain disciplined in our capital allocation strategy, and we'll continue to return the vast majority of our cash generation to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We will also continue advancing our bolt-on M&A strategy to add density to our growing maintenance portfolio.  With that, I'll turn it over to Anurag to walk through our Q1 results and full year outlook in more detail.\nAnurag Maheshwari : Thank you, Judy. Starting with first quarter results on Slide 5. We delivered net sales of $3.3 billion, with organic sales up 3.6%. This represents our tenth consecutive quarter of organic growth with better-than-expected performance in both segments. Adjusted operating profit was down $19 million at actual FX and up $7 million at constant currency. Drop-through on higher service volume, favorable service pricing and traction reproductivity in both segments were partially offset by inflationary pressures, including annual wage increases, new equipment mix and higher corporate costs. Adjusted EPS growth of $0.04 in the quarter was driven by stronger operational performance, continued tax rate improvement and a lower share count. Accretion from the Zardoya transaction offsets the $0.04 of foreign exchange headwind. Moving to Slide 6. Q1 new equipment orders were up 7.4%, led by Asia Pacific and the Americas, up 27% and 15%, respectively, with modest growth of 1 point in EMEA, more than offsetting a 3% decline in orders in China. Strong orders growth has contributed to our adjusted new equipment backlog increasing 10% at constant currency, with growth in Americas, APAC and EMEA. China backlog was roughly flat. Our strong backlog provides new equipment sales visibility for the balance of the year as well as over the medium term. Globally, pricing on new equipment orders was up mid-single digits, leading to sequential backlog margin improvement in all regions. We benefited from pricing increases of approximately 10% in the Americas and mid-single digit in both EMEA and APAC. While pricing in China remains competitive, down low single digits, we are driving material productivity to achieve slight price/cost favorability in the region while continuing to increase our share. New Equipment organic sales were roughly flat in the quarter, with 22% growth in Asia Pacific, driven by strong performance in India and Korea, and high single-digit growth in EMEA, largely from Southern Europe. This growth was offset by a mid-single-digit decline in the Americas due to job site delays and supply chain impacts and a 10% decline in China as expected, driven by the lower demand environment. Adjusted operating profit declined $24 million at actual FX and $19 million at constant currency as strong material productivity was more than offset by the impact of unfavorable regional and product mix. Turning to Service segment results on Slide 7. Maintenance portfolio units were up 4.2%, with recaptured units more than offsetting cancellations. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating portfolio growth, with China delivering another quarter of IT's portfolio growth. Modernization orders grew nearly 30%, our third consecutive quarter of more than 10% growth, driven by several major project wins, the continued success of our mod packages and good momentum in proposal activity from improved sales coverage. Our modernization business continues to perform well across all regions, with backlog up 13% at constant currency. Service organic sales of 6.3% was modestly ahead of expectations. Maintenance and repair grew 7%, driven by solid repair volume, strong portfolio growth and 3.5 points of maintenance pricing improvement on a like-for-like basis. Organic modernization sales were up 3.3% in the quarter, driven by EMEA and Asia, partially offset by the timing of major project execution in the Americas. Service operating profit at constant currency was up $40 million and margins expanded 40 basis points. Drop-through on higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity more than offset the headwinds from annual wage increases and higher material costs. Moving to Slide 8 and the revised outlook. Overall, we are off to a solid start in 2023, delivering strong orders, sales and portfolio growth, while expanding service margins to drive mid-single-digit EPS growth in the quarter despite continued macroeconomic uncertainty. This strong start gives us confidence to reiterate our February outlook for organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit at constant currency and adjusted profit margins at both the Otis and the segment level. We are improving our adjusted operating profit outlook by $20 million versus the prior guide, now expected to be up $90 million to $150 million from a smaller foreign exchange headwind. This FX change results in an approximately $0.03 increase in adjusted EPS at the midpoint. Our free cash flow outlook remains unchanged at $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion for the full year. In the first quarter, free cash flow came in at $253 million, with working capital use of cash of roughly $125 million, largely due to payables. We expect this to unwind as we execute on our new equipment backlog throughout the year. Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9. Our outlook remains consistent with the prior guide across all regions and segments, with new equipment up 3% to 5% and Service up 5% to 7%, driving total Otis organic sales growth of 4% to 6% for the year. New Equipment organic sales growth will be driven by the Americas, APAC and EMEA, as we execute on the strong backlog built over the past few years. We still expect to achieve roughly flat new equipment sales in China given the quarter ending backlog and favorable compares into year-end. On the Service side, we expect to build on our performance in the first quarter with growth in repair work moderating and modernization accelerating. Overall, we would expect to see consistent growth at around the midpoint of our guide each quarter. Moving to our adjusted EPS outlook on Slide 10. We now expect 7% to 10% growth, reflecting an approximately $0.03 increase from the prior guide at the midpoint. We anticipate second quarter EPS to be flattish year-over-year as strong operational performance is offset by last year's lower tax rate. The continued strong growth in our Service segment, coupled with pricing and commodity tailwinds and new equipment, will drive the acceleration in our second half EPS growth. For FX, we are now assuming full year rates of 1.06 and 6.93 for the euro and CNY respectively. Overall, we are encouraged by our first quarter results and well positioned to deliver solid financial performance for the balance of the year by executing on our new equipment backlog, accelerating our service portfolio growth and focusing on operational execution to offset macro headwinds.  With that, Didi, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey Sprague : And just a couple of quick ones here from me. First, just on mods. Interestingly, Schindler pointed the soft mods this last week you and co. are saying they're strong, always thought of a little bit more of a discretionary aspect to kind of mod work. So maybe you could just give a little bit of color on what's -- is there anything in particular driving the strength there? Your visibility beyond kind of the current orders you booked? And is there sort of a kind of pent-up demand to catch up on mods still from the delays we had back in COVID?\nJudy Marks: Jeff, it's Judy. Listen, the mod business itself, I think you're going to see sustained and accelerating opportunities. It comes from macro 7 million of the 20 million units are 20 years or older in the world. It comes slightly from things that didn't happen during COVID, which you call pent-up demand, but it's really now coming from a realization that elevators are aging. Repairs, as you've seen, we've had a really strong repair book. So people have been putting off modernization, and now they are coming to those important decisions. So at the macro level, globally, we saw a mod up in all 4 regions, strong order book this quarter, 29%, backlog up 13%. I think you can -- you're going to continue to see that, not just quarter-over-quarter, but year-over-year as the mod opportunity becomes larger. At a micro level, I'll just share a short story with you because part of mod is discretionary but part of it is a rational decision our customers are making. I'll give you an example, in North America, where we have almost 25-year-old, 2- to 6-story hydraulic units installed throughout the country, we have a circuit board there where the parts have become end-of-life and obsolete. So we went out to all of our customers because so many of these customers, they only have 1 unit, and they can't afford for it to shut down and not have access to an obsolete part. So for our customers, we went out with digital marketing campaign and just said, listen, for a few hours, we'll pre-plan, preschedule this, turnkey, 1 fixed price, let us come and make sure you avoid any shutdowns and extend the life of your elevator. Response has been fantastic. So part of mod is aging, Part of it is opportunity creation, but you're going to see it continue to pick up over time.\nJeffrey Sprague : Great. And just on the growth in service units, great to see, and you're kind of checking the box there on strategic plan, it sounds like. I just missed, unless you didn't say it, the growth in service and maintenance units in China specifically and any other just kind of regional color that you might have on that?\nJudy Marks: Yes. We had growth across the board. So all 4 regions grew. China had its seventh straight quarter, it grew high-teens but seventh straight quarter high-teens growth. So Asia-Pac and China up more significantly than the mature markets which we would say is probably low-single.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Steve Tusa of Morgan Stanley. \nSteve Tusa : Yes, sorry. Can you guys maybe just talk about how you're looking at the China market now and maybe just the sequential trends on earnings into the second half of the year? And anything moving around at all on you guys?\nJudy Marks: Yes. Thanks, Steve, and we fully recognize JPMorgan. So let me be clear there. So Steve, I had the -- and I'm going to say honor of finally being on the ground again in China. So what I'm going to share is a little personal, having spent 10 days there earlier -- late last month, early this month. And just really getting a sense of the economy. And I can tell you, you can feel it in the 4 cities I was in and with our colleagues. It's in a state of recovery, and my view is primed for economic development, no matter whether it was a government official I met or with our customers, we do believe the second half recovery will come and will come strongly. The government is being very supportive in their policies, whether it's mortgage rates or other things. So kind of where we started the year is what we're still seeing.  We thought the market would be down 10%. We were down 3% in orders. So clear market share gain by Sally and team in China. But the strength in the market in the first quarter, just see the segments, infrastructure and industrials were up, industrial buildings. There was weakness in resi and the commercial market. But we are still expecting the market recovery. And I'm feeling good about the health of our business. To be able to see the progress our team has made throughout the COVID years, whether it's in the automation and Industry 4.0 in our factories, the acceptance by our customers of our new product introductions, the relationships, I got to meet our agents and distributors, I'm very positive on a China recovery in the second half. Obviously, we want to see what the second quarter holds and when that inflection point is going to happen, but all signals look positive for China recovery second half and then obviously that continuing into the out years.\nSteve Tusa : And then just, does that change at all, I guess, I missed the first part of the call, but any of the market outlook, any of the market outlook you gave on the fourth quarter call, any of those change?\nJudy Marks: Yes. So as we shared last quarter, we said China would be down 10% of the market. Americas would be flattish. We're seeing Asia Pac continuing to grow more to high single digit, and we think that offsets maybe a little more negative now with EMEA down low to mid-single digits.\nSteve Tusa : Okay.\nJudy Marks: And I will Anurag answer the second part.\nAnurag Maheshwari : Yes. Steve. Just on the sequential earnings into the second half of the year, so second half, we have to grow EPS after about $0.25 a $0.05 of that will come from tax because we do face a headwind of $0.05 in quarter 2 because we had a big benefit in quarter 2 of last year. That unwinds in the second half of the year. So that will give us $0.05. So the $0.20 that we have to grow is about $120 million operationally we are growing service at about in the first quarter $40 million. So that run rate kind of continues into the second half of the year at a mid-single-digit growth. So that's about $80 million. And the remaining $40 million will come from new equipment. In the second half, I mean, quarter 1 new equipment was kind of flattish. Quarter 2 is returning back to growth. In the second half, we expect mid-single-digit growth, about 5%, 6% on the new equipment side, with volume and some of the price increases that we booked last year will flow through to the bottom line, about $20-ish million from there. Commodity tailwind of $20 million in the second half. So you add that of new equipment should be up about $40 million. So that's our sequential road map, about $80 million from Service, $40 million from New Equipment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe : So obviously, nice job on orders. The Americas was surprisingly strong and some of your competitors have been highlighting we have in the Americas. So maybe just talk about kind of what drove the growth and what you're seeing right now in multifamily and maybe commercial?\nJudy Marks: Yes. So kudos to Jim and the team, I mean, the Americas after a really strong '22 to come in up 15% this quarter and rolling 12 months being strong as well, over 18%, just really highlights, we've got a big backlog to work off in the Americas and our team knows it. Listen, we saw the Americas itself, the year is playing out as we thought it would. Nonresi is actually better this first quarter. Infrastructure and commercial were up and multifamily was down, coming off some really tough compares, if you think about where multifamily has been the past few years. I will tell you, Nigel, that we got a real tough compare in the Americas coming up in the second quarter because last year's second quarter, we were up 54% in the Americas. So we're going to do the best we can to try to match that, but it's going to be a tough compare. We still expect a flattish market through year-end. We think we're in a really good position. You saw the Montreal program we won, which was a major project in the first quarter, and that will take us a few years to perform on. But both the volume business and the major projects did really well in the Americas, both Latin and North America for the first quarter.\nNigel Coe : Great. That's great color. And in terms of China, your comments on China founded really constructive. Pricing down low single digits, but I think it was trending pretty flat through 2022. So just -- what gives you confidence that we're not going to see the bottle for the pricing in China? And then when you talk about the inflection in the second half of the year, are we talking about a break back into positive year-to-year growth in orders? Or are we talking about getting that bad in the second half?\nJudy Marks: Let me take the pricing question. We are seeing rational pricing. I know we've shared that about 90% of the new equipment orders that happen in China now happen with the top 10 OEMs, and they're all being rational. And we get to see that, especially on public infrastructure bids. So not to say there's not a bid or to someone really wants because of density and they'll do something. But we're seeing rational pricing in China. It's always the most competitive there in pricing of anywhere in the world, and which means we've got to continue to drive our costs down. And that's where, so far, we've seen the material productivity far better in China than we have everywhere else in the world. Part of that's commodity's coming down, but part of that is through great supply chain management, negotiation and our engineering team continuing to take cost out with our manufacturing team. So we're seeing rational. We don't anticipate that changing, but obviously, we're keeping an eye on that.\nAnurag Maheshwari : Yes. And I mean, the 2 levers, as Judy mentioned, that we take a look at is definitely price/cost and the share of segment. So far, we're balancing it quite well. The market is disciplined, and we continue to look into that and make sure that, that is the toggle that we are playing against. Now in terms of orders, if you look at the market, the market was down in the first quarter. We are guiding it to be down 5% or 10% for the year. So clearly, the market is going to pick up in the second half of the year off a low compare as well from last year. And even if the -- as you know, share growth in the second half of the year, you should see orders in China picking up in the second half of the year, but, obviously, we're going to continue executing the strategy that we are doing right now and feel pretty good about the China orders in the second half of the year.\nNigel Coe : Okay.\nA \u2013Judy Marks: Yes. Nigel, the only thing I\u2019ll add is our relationships and our length of those relationships with our 2,200 agents and distributors continues to mature. And we do expect those to yield as we continue to go on for both our brands. We\u2019re going to continue to ensure that we have the best products. We introduced a new product in China, a new rope connected product in the first quarter that\u2019s picking up nicely in the market. So our team \u2013 they\u2019ve got sales coverage. We know where we need to be on price. We\u2019ve got the right products and all that, we really expect to happen in the second half to show those results.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell : Just wanted to start with the EMEA market outlook. So yes, you and some of your peers sort of lowering the market outlook this year. Just wondered, any specific verticals or regions within Europe that's driving that on the new equipment side? How should we think about those EMEA orders playing out over the balance of this year? And I suppose the last time we had a sort of a soft construction market there for any prolonged period, we saw the bleed through into service pricing at some point. Just maybe remind us kind of your confidence this time or even with a softer new equipment market there, the service price should hold up?\nJudy Marks: Thanks, Julian. So yes, we're saying EMEA now is going to be down low- to mid-single digit. Obviously, we're watching rates and impact on building permits and starts. But in the first quarter, our team in Southern Europe performed incredibly well. Spain, Italy, extremely resilient. Where we saw some of the weakness was really Germany and the U.K. and then the Middle East was up probably low single digits. So it's really a mix and we're going to continue to monitor and watch that. When we think back in time, I look at 2 key metrics. One is pricing and service pricing like-for-like in the last quarter, we were up 3.5 points, and our Europe business was up mid-single digits. So Bernardo and the team have been passing price through. We've had those inflationary clauses in, and the team's been passing service price through, which is really good to see because the majority of our European contracts do come due, service contracts come due in the first half of the year, with most in the first quarter. The other part would be all the constructors from 15 years ago who moved into service and became independent service providers, we don't see that labor. If you look at even unemployment is at fairly low levels in Spain and in other locations in Western Europe. So we don't see those -- that available workforce starting up as independent service providers. And the other difference now is what we call Otis One, and the fact that when you have a connected elevator, it's not easy to start up as an independent right now or to grow your share. So I think all that combines to set us up to a very different Europe. But again, we think we're being responsible looking at the market at low to mid-single, potentially down for the year.\nJulian Mitchell : And then just my follow-up would be around the Slide 10. You've got that helpful EPS bridge. So just if I look at the operational portion within that, you highlight there kind of wage and material inflation and then mix and churn as headwinds that were not there on the bridge that you've given back in January for the year ahead. So just wondered if that's just some extra detail? Did you see something change in your outlook for those 2 items for 2023? And how we're thinking about those 2 items as you go through the year?\nAnurag Maheshwari : Julian, thanks for the question. In February, when we gave guidance, we had a page on each of the segments, on New Equipment and Service. And at that point in time, we had highlighted mix and churn as 1 of the headwinds. And we just collapsed it into this chart right now. There's been no change in our thinking since the beginning of the year. When we talk about mix and churn, we essentially -- and the New Equipment side, the mix was coming from -- as you know, China is our most profitable New Equipment margin market. So -- and the other markets are growing faster. So New Equipment side, that is the mix from the regional perspective. And obviously, we've built a very good backlog. We won a lot of share, but it's a combination of volume and major projects and these major projects, through they come with a very good portfolio stickiness, they are low New Equipment margin. So on the mix side, I would say, on New Equipment, it's more region and projects similar to what we had called out in the last call. Nothing has changed from there. In Service, it's the same thing, which you've seen in the past couple of years, China growing faster. And obviously, churn is more around the cancellation units, which come with a little bit higher margin. So nothing really changed over there. Same thing for labor and wage inflation, right? It's -- so far, our labor negotiations are trending really, really well. We thought it would be low to mid-single-digit. In most of the European markets it's playing out that way and same on the material. So if I kind of take a step back, if you look at price over gross cost and mix and churn, we should be about $75 million positive for the year. That would contribute to half of the operating profit that you see in the bar, so price minus gross cost of material labor inflation and adjusting for mix and churn.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jack Ayers of Cowen.\nJack Ayers : This is Jack on for Gautam. I wanted to dig into service and apologies, I joined the call fairly late here. But if you could kind of just touch on the monetization orders up 29%. It seems extremely strong, which is encouraging. And then just piggybacking off that last comment, just the sort of the maintenance units up 4.2%, obviously, really strong again. Kind of just what's happening there this quarter from like a retention/conversion mix sort of churn perspective? Just any color there around Service would be really helpful.\nJudy Marks: Jack, yes, modernization, let me just reinforce what I said, which is, it's going to continue to be a contributor to our business, and the market itself is going to continue to grow, not just quarter-over-quarter, but the market itself will be growing year-over-year as more and more units age based on when they were put into service. We've got 7 million of the 20 million units are over 20 years old. So I think you can look for the modernization market to remain and actually become more attractive. And obviously, we're very focused on performing that in a more -- a way that allows us to approach customers with kits that gives us productivity and that gives them their modernization in a quicker time period.  So you're going to see modernization be talked about more, but also take the best of what we've learned since spin in terms of our new equipment strategy and growing share there and being able to do things at scale, merging that with our service excellence and our productivity we've gained there. And when we put those 2 together and attack the mod market with a growing market, we think that's going to be a positive contributor for many -- for much time to come.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Nick Housden of RBC.\nNick Housden : I think you mentioned maintenance pricing was at about 3.5% like-for-like. I'm just wondering if that rate should accelerate as we move through the year just on the basis that you've been implementing the service escalation clauses in Q1 and maybe that 3.5% is a reflection the agreements that you had last year. So if you could provide some color on that, that would be helpful.\nJudy Marks: Yes. Nick. Go ahead. Go ahead.\nAnurag Maheshwari : Yes. Thanks for the question, Nick. Firstly, extremely encouraged by the way we started off in quarter 1 on the 3.5% like-to-like. As Judy mentioned, Europe is mid-single digits. It's probably one of the higher price increases we've seen in Europe for a while, and it's ticking because everyone else is kind of driving the price over there. If you move into Q2, obviously, more units get converted, come up for renegotiation as well. So we should see that kind of stepping up a little bit as we go there on the 3.5%. So overall, what we said in -- when we give the full year guide was that we expect it to be up 3.5%, 4%. Mix and churn would take about 200 to 250 basis points, so about 1.5% net. We -- as of now, where we stand, we feel pretty good about 150 basis points of pricing adjusting for mix insurance for the rest of the year.\nJudy Marks: And, Nick, in China, the margin drivers are less about price. They're really more about productivity, volume, density and Otis One and all of those are good contributors for us.\nNick Housden : Great. That's very helpful. Then my second question, sticking with Service. Great to see that you're up to 4.2% unit growth. So that's been accelerating pretty much for 3 years at this point. You mentioned that the market is growing at about 5%, about 1 million units on a $20 million installed base. So if I look at that 4.2%, you could still argue that that's maybe slightly underperforming. Do you think that you can actually close that gap? Or is there may be a mix effect that means that you, as the largest OEM in terms of service units, should maybe be underperforming a bit?\nJudy Marks: I think we can and we should close that gap. That's the challenge we've given to our team, and that's why you see the much higher growth rates in Asia, especially China, for our service portfolio. Now it creates a mix, but we'll deal with that mix challenge as we get it. But yes, we can and should be closing that gap.\nAnurag Maheshwari : Yes. And just to add to that, right, I mean, not too long ago, we were growing at 1%. The team is kind of -- that was called for action, teams focused on it. The wheel just started churning. We were at 4.1%, up 4.2%, we should close the gap. And the gap is we won some good new equipment share. That will get converted -- that will come into the conversion cycle. Our conversion rates are going up, and we're going to keep looking at deploying IoT to ensure that our retention rates stay high. So it's using conversion as a lever, using retention as a lever to get us up to the mid-single-digit growth. And while doing that, we want to ensure that we also maintain the profitability for it, right? So at some point in time, this -- you will see from margins, it does come back to absolute profit growth, but that's where we want to take it to.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the conference back to Judy Marks for closing remarks.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Didi, and thank you all for joining us. And let me also add a thanks to all of our colleagues for your continued excellent performance in quarter one and for serving our customers so well. Our solid first quarter results demonstrate the continued power of our business model and set us up well for the future. We will remain focused on executing throughout the remainder of the year in order to capitalize on our first quarter successes and continue to drive shareholder value.  Thank you for joining us everyone. Stay safe and well.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

Otis delivered a solid first quarter to start 2023, driving strong financial performance and executing on our capital allocation strategy despite continued market uncertainty. We achieved organic sales growth, driven by our service business, and expanded adjusted service operating profit margins by 40 basis points, leading to mid-single-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Service segment performance, in addition to our maintenance portfolio growth of more than 4%, reinforces the strength of our business model. We continue to execute our balanced capital allocation strategy with $175 million of share repurchases in the first quarter. Yesterday, we announced a 17.2% increase to our quarterly dividend. Since spin, we have increased our dividend 70%, emphasizing the importance we place on disciplined capital management and delivering value to our shareholders. In the Americas, building on our strong track record of major project execution and service across Canada, Otis was selected by the Montreal Metro System to replace escalators at 17 stations, while providing units for 5 new blue line stations. In total, 97 Otis escalators will keep metro passengers on the move daily. In China, FA Metro placed a new order of 250 Otis ONE connected escalators and elevators across 3 new lines. Real-time data insights, remote monitoring and predictive maintenance will all help bring the FA Metro into the future and add to our growing infrastructure installed base. In Germany, Otis has been selected by Cigna Group to modernize the iconic Dusseldorf Department Store Carsch Haus as part of a larger renovation. Otis will provide 17 units, including our energy-efficient link escalators and Gen2 stream elevators with regen drives. The elevators will also feature e-view in car displays. After the modernization is completed in 2024, Otis will service the units as part of our long-standing framework contract with [indiscernible] Group, which operates Carsch Haus and other leading department stores in Germany. In South Korea, we're providing 51 of our signature Gen2 elevators for the Sunshine [indiscernible] luxury apartment complex. The campus includes more than 2,000 units and buildings up to 29 stories. And we continue to drive progress toward our ESG goals as shared in our 2022 ESG report published earlier in April. Just this month, we announced the installation of solar panels at our Nippon Otis Logistics and Engineering Center in Japan. This upgrade is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the facility by 27% compared to 2022, and represents our eighth manufacturing site globally with solar panel arrays. Moving to Slide 4, Q1 results and 2023 outlook. New equipment orders were up 7.4%, driven by strong growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific, and we ended the quarter with adjusted backlog up 10% at constant currency. We continue to drive share gains in new equipment with 70 basis points of improvement in the quarter, led by our outperformance in China, where our orders were down modestly in a market where we estimate was down approximately 10%. We continue to perform well across all other regions. We're especially encouraged by our modernization performance in the quarter with nearly 30% orders growth driven by strong performance in the Americas and Asia. This growth is driven by our continued rollout of standardized packages for our mod offerings, coupled with improvements in our sales force coverage. Our mod backlog is up double digits in all regions, as mod demand continues to remain robust. Organic sales were up 3.6%, and adjusted operating profit was up $7 million at constant currency, driven by performance in the Service segment. Before I discuss our 2023 financial outlook, let me briefly update you on our global market outlook, which largely remains unchanged. Entering the year, we expected global new equipment to be down mid-single digits to approximately 900,000 units, largely due to China, which we expected to be down 5% to 10%, and our outlook in that key region remains the same. We also expected Asia Pac to be up mid-single digits or better, and both the Americas and EMEA to be flat.  With the first quarter in the books, we now expect Asia Pac to come in closer to high single digits, offsetting a reduction in our EMEA outlook, which we now expect to be down low to mid-single digits. Our outlook for global installed base growth remains unchanged at roughly 5%, which will add close to 1 million maintenance units, bringing the installed base to roughly 21 million units with high-single-digit growth in Asia and low-single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA. Turning to Otis' 2023 financial outlook. We now expect net sales to be in the range of $13.9 billion to $14.2 billion, up 2.5% to 4.5% versus the prior year, which is a 75-basis-point improvement from the prior outlook at the midpoint, driven by FX. We still expect organic sales to be up 4% to 6%, with new equipment up 3% to 5% and Service up 5% to 7%. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $90 million to $150 million at actual currency and up $130 million to $175 million at constant currency, with adjusted EPS in the range of $3.40 to $3.50, a 7% to 10% increase versus the prior year and an approximately $0.03 improvement from the prior outlook at the midpoint. We expect free cash flow to come in as we guided in February, in a range of $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion with 105% to 115% conversion of GAAP net income. We remain disciplined in our capital allocation strategy, and we'll continue to return the vast majority of our cash generation to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We will also continue advancing our bolt-on M&A strategy to add density to our growing maintenance portfolio.  With that, I'll turn it over to Anurag to walk through our Q1 results and full year outlook in more detail. Jeff, it's Judy. Listen, the mod business itself, I think you're going to see sustained and accelerating opportunities. It comes from macro 7 million of the 20 million units are 20 years or older in the world. It comes slightly from things that didn't happen during COVID, which you call pent-up demand, but it's really now coming from a realization that elevators are aging. Repairs, as you've seen, we've had a really strong repair book. So people have been putting off modernization, and now they are coming to those important decisions. So at the macro level, globally, we saw a mod up in all 4 regions, strong order book this quarter, 29%, backlog up 13%. I think you can -- you're going to continue to see that, not just quarter-over-quarter, but year-over-year as the mod opportunity becomes larger. At a micro level, I'll just share a short story with you because part of mod is discretionary but part of it is a rational decision our customers are making. I'll give you an example, in North America, where we have almost 25-year-old, 2- to 6-story hydraulic units installed throughout the country, we have a circuit board there where the parts have become end-of-life and obsolete. So we went out to all of our customers because so many of these customers, they only have 1 unit, and they can't afford for it to shut down and not have access to an obsolete part. So for our customers, we went out with digital marketing campaign and just said, listen, for a few hours, we'll pre-plan, preschedule this, turnkey, 1 fixed price, let us come and make sure you avoid any shutdowns and extend the life of your elevator. Response has been fantastic. So part of mod is aging, Part of it is opportunity creation, but you're going to see it continue to pick up over time. Yes. We had growth across the board. So all 4 regions grew. China had its seventh straight quarter, it grew high-teens but seventh straight quarter high-teens growth. So Asia-Pac and China up more significantly than the mature markets which we would say is probably low-single. Yes. Thanks, Steve, and we fully recognize JPMorgan. So let me be clear there. So Steve, I had the -- and I'm going to say honor of finally being on the ground again in China. So what I'm going to share is a little personal, having spent 10 days there earlier -- late last month, early this month. And just really getting a sense of the economy. And I can tell you, you can feel it in the 4 cities I was in and with our colleagues. It's in a state of recovery, and my view is primed for economic development, no matter whether it was a government official I met or with our customers, we do believe the second half recovery will come and will come strongly. The government is being very supportive in their policies, whether it's mortgage rates or other things. So kind of where we started the year is what we're still seeing.  We thought the market would be down 10%. We were down 3% in orders. So clear market share gain by Sally and team in China. But the strength in the market in the first quarter, just see the segments, infrastructure and industrials were up, industrial buildings. There was weakness in resi and the commercial market. But we are still expecting the market recovery. And I'm feeling good about the health of our business. To be able to see the progress our team has made throughout the COVID years, whether it's in the automation and Industry 4.0 in our factories, the acceptance by our customers of our new product introductions, the relationships, I got to meet our agents and distributors, I'm very positive on a China recovery in the second half. Obviously, we want to see what the second quarter holds and when that inflection point is going to happen, but all signals look positive for China recovery second half and then obviously that continuing into the out years. Yes. So as we shared last quarter, we said China would be down 10% of the market. Americas would be flattish. We're seeing Asia Pac continuing to grow more to high single digit, and we think that offsets maybe a little more negative now with EMEA down low to mid-single digits. And I will Anurag answer the second part. Yes. So kudos to Jim and the team, I mean, the Americas after a really strong '22 to come in up 15% this quarter and rolling 12 months being strong as well, over 18%, just really highlights, we've got a big backlog to work off in the Americas and our team knows it. Listen, we saw the Americas itself, the year is playing out as we thought it would. Nonresi is actually better this first quarter. Infrastructure and commercial were up and multifamily was down, coming off some really tough compares, if you think about where multifamily has been the past few years. I will tell you, Nigel, that we got a real tough compare in the Americas coming up in the second quarter because last year's second quarter, we were up 54% in the Americas. So we're going to do the best we can to try to match that, but it's going to be a tough compare. We still expect a flattish market through year-end. We think we're in a really good position. You saw the Montreal program we won, which was a major project in the first quarter, and that will take us a few years to perform on. But both the volume business and the major projects did really well in the Americas, both Latin and North America for the first quarter. Let me take the pricing question. We are seeing rational pricing. I know we've shared that about 90% of the new equipment orders that happen in China now happen with the top 10 OEMs, and they're all being rational. And we get to see that, especially on public infrastructure bids. So not to say there's not a bid or to someone really wants because of density and they'll do something. But we're seeing rational pricing in China. It's always the most competitive there in pricing of anywhere in the world, and which means we've got to continue to drive our costs down. And that's where, so far, we've seen the material productivity far better in China than we have everywhere else in the world. Part of that's commodity's coming down, but part of that is through great supply chain management, negotiation and our engineering team continuing to take cost out with our manufacturing team. So we're seeing rational. We don't anticipate that changing, but obviously, we're keeping an eye on that. Thanks, Julian. So yes, we're saying EMEA now is going to be down low- to mid-single digit. Obviously, we're watching rates and impact on building permits and starts. But in the first quarter, our team in Southern Europe performed incredibly well. Spain, Italy, extremely resilient. Where we saw some of the weakness was really Germany and the U.K. and then the Middle East was up probably low single digits. So it's really a mix and we're going to continue to monitor and watch that. When we think back in time, I look at 2 key metrics. One is pricing and service pricing like-for-like in the last quarter, we were up 3.5 points, and our Europe business was up mid-single digits. So Bernardo and the team have been passing price through. We've had those inflationary clauses in, and the team's been passing service price through, which is really good to see because the majority of our European contracts do come due, service contracts come due in the first half of the year, with most in the first quarter. The other part would be all the constructors from 15 years ago who moved into service and became independent service providers, we don't see that labor. If you look at even unemployment is at fairly low levels in Spain and in other locations in Western Europe. So we don't see those -- that available workforce starting up as independent service providers. And the other difference now is what we call Otis One, and the fact that when you have a connected elevator, it's not easy to start up as an independent right now or to grow your share. So I think all that combines to set us up to a very different Europe. But again, we think we're being responsible looking at the market at low to mid-single, potentially down for the year. Jack, yes, modernization, let me just reinforce what I said, which is, it's going to continue to be a contributor to our business, and the market itself is going to continue to grow, not just quarter-over-quarter, but the market itself will be growing year-over-year as more and more units age based on when they were put into service. We've got 7 million of the 20 million units are over 20 years old. So I think you can look for the modernization market to remain and actually become more attractive. And obviously, we're very focused on performing that in a more -- a way that allows us to approach customers with kits that gives us productivity and that gives them their modernization in a quicker time period.  So you're going to see modernization be talked about more, but also take the best of what we've learned since spin in terms of our new equipment strategy and growing share there and being able to do things at scale, merging that with our service excellence and our productivity we've gained there. And when we put those 2 together and attack the mod market with a growing market, we think that's going to be a positive contributor for many -- for much time to come. Yes. Nick. Go ahead. Go ahead. And, Nick, in China, the margin drivers are less about price. They're really more about productivity, volume, density and Otis One and all of those are good contributors for us. I think we can and we should close that gap. That's the challenge we've given to our team, and that's why you see the much higher growth rates in Asia, especially China, for our service portfolio. Now it creates a mix, but we'll deal with that mix challenge as we get it. But yes, we can and should be closing that gap. Thank you, Didi, and thank you all for joining us. And let me also add a thanks to all of our colleagues for your continued excellent performance in quarter one and for serving our customers so well. Our solid first quarter results demonstrate the continued power of our business model and set us up well for the future. We will remain focused on executing throughout the remainder of the year in order to capitalize on our first quarter successes and continue to drive shareholder value.  Thank you for joining us everyone. Stay safe and well."

            "content": "Thank you, Judy. Starting with first quarter results on Slide 5. We delivered net sales of $3.3 billion, with organic sales up 3.6%. This represents our tenth consecutive quarter of organic growth with better-than-expected performance in both segments. Adjusted operating profit was down $19 million at actual FX and up $7 million at constant currency. Drop-through on higher service volume, favorable service pricing and traction reproductivity in both segments were partially offset by inflationary pressures, including annual wage increases, new equipment mix and higher corporate costs. Adjusted EPS growth of $0.04 in the quarter was driven by stronger operational performance, continued tax rate improvement and a lower share count. Accretion from the Zardoya transaction offsets the $0.04 of foreign exchange headwind. Moving to Slide 6. Q1 new equipment orders were up 7.4%, led by Asia Pacific and the Americas, up 27% and 15%, respectively, with modest growth of 1 point in EMEA, more than offsetting a 3% decline in orders in China. Strong orders growth has contributed to our adjusted new equipment backlog increasing 10% at constant currency, with growth in Americas, APAC and EMEA. China backlog was roughly flat. Our strong backlog provides new equipment sales visibility for the balance of the year as well as over the medium term. Globally, pricing on new equipment orders was up mid-single digits, leading to sequential backlog margin improvement in all regions. We benefited from pricing increases of approximately 10% in the Americas and mid-single digit in both EMEA and APAC. While pricing in China remains competitive, down low single digits, we are driving material productivity to achieve slight price/cost favorability in the region while continuing to increase our share. New Equipment organic sales were roughly flat in the quarter, with 22% growth in Asia Pacific, driven by strong performance in India and Korea, and high single-digit growth in EMEA, largely from Southern Europe. This growth was offset by a mid-single-digit decline in the Americas due to job site delays and supply chain impacts and a 10% decline in China as expected, driven by the lower demand environment. Adjusted operating profit declined $24 million at actual FX and $19 million at constant currency as strong material productivity was more than offset by the impact of unfavorable regional and product mix. Turning to Service segment results on Slide 7. Maintenance portfolio units were up 4.2%, with recaptured units more than offsetting cancellations. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating portfolio growth, with China delivering another quarter of IT's portfolio growth. Modernization orders grew nearly 30%, our third consecutive quarter of more than 10% growth, driven by several major project wins, the continued success of our mod packages and good momentum in proposal activity from improved sales coverage. Our modernization business continues to perform well across all regions, with backlog up 13% at constant currency. Service organic sales of 6.3% was modestly ahead of expectations. Maintenance and repair grew 7%, driven by solid repair volume, strong portfolio growth and 3.5 points of maintenance pricing improvement on a like-for-like basis. Organic modernization sales were up 3.3% in the quarter, driven by EMEA and Asia, partially offset by the timing of major project execution in the Americas. Service operating profit at constant currency was up $40 million and margins expanded 40 basis points. Drop-through on higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity more than offset the headwinds from annual wage increases and higher material costs. Moving to Slide 8 and the revised outlook. Overall, we are off to a solid start in 2023, delivering strong orders, sales and portfolio growth, while expanding service margins to drive mid-single-digit EPS growth in the quarter despite continued macroeconomic uncertainty. This strong start gives us confidence to reiterate our February outlook for organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit at constant currency and adjusted profit margins at both the Otis and the segment level. We are improving our adjusted operating profit outlook by $20 million versus the prior guide, now expected to be up $90 million to $150 million from a smaller foreign exchange headwind. This FX change results in an approximately $0.03 increase in adjusted EPS at the midpoint. Our free cash flow outlook remains unchanged at $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion for the full year. In the first quarter, free cash flow came in at $253 million, with working capital use of cash of roughly $125 million, largely due to payables. We expect this to unwind as we execute on our new equipment backlog throughout the year. Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9. Our outlook remains consistent with the prior guide across all regions and segments, with new equipment up 3% to 5% and Service up 5% to 7%, driving total Otis organic sales growth of 4% to 6% for the year. New Equipment organic sales growth will be driven by the Americas, APAC and EMEA, as we execute on the strong backlog built over the past few years. We still expect to achieve roughly flat new equipment sales in China given the quarter ending backlog and favorable compares into year-end. On the Service side, we expect to build on our performance in the first quarter with growth in repair work moderating and modernization accelerating. Overall, we would expect to see consistent growth at around the midpoint of our guide each quarter. Moving to our adjusted EPS outlook on Slide 10. We now expect 7% to 10% growth, reflecting an approximately $0.03 increase from the prior guide at the midpoint. We anticipate second quarter EPS to be flattish year-over-year as strong operational performance is offset by last year's lower tax rate. The continued strong growth in our Service segment, coupled with pricing and commodity tailwinds and new equipment, will drive the acceleration in our second half EPS growth. For FX, we are now assuming full year rates of 1.06 and 6.93 for the euro and CNY respectively. Overall, we are encouraged by our first quarter results and well positioned to deliver solid financial performance for the balance of the year by executing on our new equipment backlog, accelerating our service portfolio growth and focusing on operational execution to offset macro headwinds.  With that, Didi, please open the line for questions. Yes. Steve. Just on the sequential earnings into the second half of the year, so second half, we have to grow EPS after about $0.25 a $0.05 of that will come from tax because we do face a headwind of $0.05 in quarter 2 because we had a big benefit in quarter 2 of last year. That unwinds in the second half of the year. So that will give us $0.05. So the $0.20 that we have to grow is about $120 million operationally we are growing service at about in the first quarter $40 million. So that run rate kind of continues into the second half of the year at a mid-single-digit growth. So that's about $80 million. And the remaining $40 million will come from new equipment. In the second half, I mean, quarter 1 new equipment was kind of flattish. Quarter 2 is returning back to growth. In the second half, we expect mid-single-digit growth, about 5%, 6% on the new equipment side, with volume and some of the price increases that we booked last year will flow through to the bottom line, about $20-ish million from there. Commodity tailwind of $20 million in the second half. So you add that of new equipment should be up about $40 million. So that's our sequential road map, about $80 million from Service, $40 million from New Equipment. Yes. And I mean, the 2 levers, as Judy mentioned, that we take a look at is definitely price/cost and the share of segment. So far, we're balancing it quite well. The market is disciplined, and we continue to look into that and make sure that, that is the toggle that we are playing against. Now in terms of orders, if you look at the market, the market was down in the first quarter. We are guiding it to be down 5% or 10% for the year. So clearly, the market is going to pick up in the second half of the year off a low compare as well from last year. And even if the -- as you know, share growth in the second half of the year, you should see orders in China picking up in the second half of the year, but, obviously, we're going to continue executing the strategy that we are doing right now and feel pretty good about the China orders in the second half of the year. Julian, thanks for the question. In February, when we gave guidance, we had a page on each of the segments, on New Equipment and Service. And at that point in time, we had highlighted mix and churn as 1 of the headwinds. And we just collapsed it into this chart right now. There's been no change in our thinking since the beginning of the year. When we talk about mix and churn, we essentially -- and the New Equipment side, the mix was coming from -- as you know, China is our most profitable New Equipment margin market. So -- and the other markets are growing faster. So New Equipment side, that is the mix from the regional perspective. And obviously, we've built a very good backlog. We won a lot of share, but it's a combination of volume and major projects and these major projects, through they come with a very good portfolio stickiness, they are low New Equipment margin. So on the mix side, I would say, on New Equipment, it's more region and projects similar to what we had called out in the last call. Nothing has changed from there. In Service, it's the same thing, which you've seen in the past couple of years, China growing faster. And obviously, churn is more around the cancellation units, which come with a little bit higher margin. So nothing really changed over there. Same thing for labor and wage inflation, right? It's -- so far, our labor negotiations are trending really, really well. We thought it would be low to mid-single-digit. In most of the European markets it's playing out that way and same on the material. So if I kind of take a step back, if you look at price over gross cost and mix and churn, we should be about $75 million positive for the year. That would contribute to half of the operating profit that you see in the bar, so price minus gross cost of material labor inflation and adjusting for mix and churn. Yes. Thanks for the question, Nick. Firstly, extremely encouraged by the way we started off in quarter 1 on the 3.5% like-to-like. As Judy mentioned, Europe is mid-single digits. It's probably one of the higher price increases we've seen in Europe for a while, and it's ticking because everyone else is kind of driving the price over there. If you move into Q2, obviously, more units get converted, come up for renegotiation as well. So we should see that kind of stepping up a little bit as we go there on the 3.5%. So overall, what we said in -- when we give the full year guide was that we expect it to be up 3.5%, 4%. Mix and churn would take about 200 to 250 basis points, so about 1.5% net. We -- as of now, where we stand, we feel pretty good about 150 basis points of pricing adjusting for mix insurance for the rest of the year. Yes. And just to add to that, right, I mean, not too long ago, we were growing at 1%. The team is kind of -- that was called for action, teams focused on it. The wheel just started churning. We were at 4.1%, up 4.2%, we should close the gap. And the gap is we won some good new equipment share. That will get converted -- that will come into the conversion cycle. Our conversion rates are going up, and we're going to keep looking at deploying IoT to ensure that our retention rates stay high. So it's using conversion as a lever, using retention as a lever to get us up to the mid-single-digit growth. And while doing that, we want to ensure that we also maintain the profitability for it, right? So at some point in time, this -- you will see from margins, it does come back to absolute profit growth, but that's where we want to take it to."

Presentation materials are available for download from Otis' website at www.otis.com. I'll now turn it over to Michael Rednor, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rednor: Thank you, Christa. Welcome to Otis' third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Judy Marks, Chair, CEO and President; and Cristina Mendez, Executive Vice President & CFO. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations excluding restructuring and significant nonrecurring items. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis' SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide additional details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, afternoon, and evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope all are safe and well. Starting with Q3 highlights on slide 3, Otis returned to topline growth in the third quarter as we continued to demonstrate the strength of our Service-driven business model with solid third quarter results. In Service, we delivered high single digit growth in Q3, bringing year-to-date service organic sales to 6.4% with all lines of business contributing. We achieved maintenance portfolio growth of 4.2% and our modernization backlog increased 12% at constant currency. Through the first nine months of 2024, we have expanded overall adjusted operating profit margin by 60 basis points and achieved adjusted EPS growth of 8.2%. In Q3, we generated $381 million in adjusted free cash flow and completed $200 million in share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've generated approximately $900 million in adjusted free cash flow and returned $800 million through share repurchases as we execute on our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Otis had several exciting accomplishments recently. For example, our manufacturing hub in Korea obtained ISO 50001 certification. Otis now has 11 manufacturing sites certified through the global standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and improving energy management. In addition, we announced the expansion of our Bengaluru manufacturing facility. This will increase our capacity and capabilities to help meet the growing residential, commercial, and infrastructure demand for elevators and escalators in India, while also expanding our localized manufacturing strategy in the country. And last, earlier this month, we're proud to name one of the world's Best Employers by Forbes Magazine for the third year in a row, reflecting our commitment to our colleagues' wellbeing. Moving to our orders performance on slide 4. New Equipment orders were down 3% in the third quarter, a sequential improvement versus the first two quarters of the year, despite continued challenging market conditions. Excluding China, orders increased approximately 10%. Orders returned to growth in the Americas, growing more than 20%, with excellent performance in North America, while APAC delivered high single digit growth driven by continued strength in Japan and Southeast Asia. Orders declined by high single digits in EMEA due to continued weakness in Western and Northern Europe, bringing orders to 8% year-to-date after a strong first half. A greater than 20% decline in China was a result of continued economic softness in the region. Our New Equipment backlog at constant currency was down 3% versus the prior year. Although similar to last quarter, the New Equipment backlog excluding China was up low single digits. This quarter marked two consecutive years of delivering 4% or greater maintenance portfolio growth in each quarter. And last, within Service, modernization orders increased 3% as we faced a challenging compare from the prior year in major project bookings. And we expect to see a bounce back to solid mod orders growth in the fourth quarter. With mod orders, year-to-date, up approximately 10%, our modernization backlog increased 12% at constant currency versus the prior year. As our colleagues across the globe continue to deliver, we have several customer highlights to share from the third quarter. In Melbourne, Australia, Otis will modernize 30 elevators at 101 Collins Street in the Central Business District. Our Skyrise and Gen3 modernization-specific products will be featured along with our signature ReGen drives and the Otis ONE IoT platform. Otis installed the building's original elevators in 1989 and has maintained them for the past 35 years. In the United States, we're proud to support the expansion of the St. Luke's University Health Anderson Campus Hospital in Bethlehem Township, Pennsylvania. Otis will install nine elevators, including five Gen3 Peak and one Gen3 Edge unit, for a new five floor addition. The St. Luke's organization has been a valued customer for more than 10 years. In the Nordics, our local teams have worked closely with customers to add more than 400 units to the portfolio. In Denmark, we've recaptured 275 units with Zomaya, a leading construction and housing business. And in Sweden, we've recaptured 132 units at Vallingby Shopping Center, a customer making a welcome return to Otis after 10 years. Reflecting the continued strength of the infrastructure vertical, Otis was selected to provide more than 340 escalators and Gen3 elevators for the Tianjin Metro in China as part of the Metro's new Line 8 and Binhai one line. This brings the total number of Otis units in the city's expanding Metro network to more than 2,000. Tianjin Metro has been using Otis equipment for almost three decades. Turning to Q3 results on slide 5. Otis delivered net sales of $3.5 billion with organic sales up approximately 1%. Adjusted operating profit, excluding a $4 million foreign exchange headwind was up $8 million driven by the Service segment. Third quarter adjusted EPS grew approximately 1% or $0.01 in a quarter against a tough compare of approximately 19% EPS growth in the third quarter of the prior year. Operational performance was partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds. This brings year-to-date adjusted EPS growth to 8.2%. With that, I'll turn it over to Cristina to walk through our results in more detail.\nCristina Mendez: Thank you, Judy. Starting with Q3 segment sales performance on slide 6, total organic sales growth of 1.2% in the quarter was driven by Service, which was up 7.7%. New Equipment organic sales were down 8.2%, driven by a greater than 20% decline in China as market conditions remain weak, excluding China, New Equipment sales increased low single digits. The decline in China was partially upset by low single digit growth in APAC, driven by a strength in Japan and Taiwan, as well as low single digit growth in the Americas. EMEA was roughly flat, as a strength in Southern Europe was upset by Western and Central Europe. New Equipment pricing was up low single digits in all regions outside of China. Similar to last quarter, China continues to be under severe price pressure, with continuous declines of approximately 10% year-over-year, although pricing was relatively flat sequentially. Service sales were $2.2 billion, with organic sales growth of 7.7%, as we delivered on our expected acceleration from the mid-single digit growth in the first two quarters of the year. We grew in all regions and in all lines of business. Maintenance and Repair increased over 6% in the quarter, supported by continued strong portfolio growth, maintenance pricing up around four points, excluding the impact of mix and churn, and a ramp up in repair volumes. Modernization organic sales accelerated in the quarter, up about 14% bringing year-to-date organic sales to approximately 10% with excellent growth in Asia-Pacific which was up 20% including contributions widely across geographies. Turning to Q3 segment operating profit performance on slide 7. New Equipment operating profit of $84 million was down $20 million at constant currency as tailwind from pricing that continues to flow from the backlog productivity including the benefits of Uplift and lower commodity costs were more than offset by the impacts of lower volume and regional and product mixed headwinds. Operating profit margins came in at 6.4%. Year-to-date, New Equipment sales are down over $250 million and operating profit has declined by $20 million at constant currency versus the prior year. In China, New Equipment has been a revenue headwind for approximately $400 million. That would imply a profit headwind of about $100 million, which we have largely mitigated through solid productivity and the benefit of commodity and pricing tailwinds. Service operating profit of $555 million increased $40 million at constant currency. As dropped through on higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity, including benefits from Uplift, more than offset annual wage inflation. As a result, operating profit margins remained strong at 24.8%, even while facing a difficult prior year compare, where margins expanded 90 basis points in the third quarter of 2023. Year-to-date, operating profit margins have expanded 60 basis points to 24.6%. With the benefit of our various Uplift initiatives, we dropped year-to-date adjusted SG&A, lower by $18 million, while improving as a percentage of sales by 10 basis points year-over-year. On a slight organic sales growth, these cost initiatives are helping to mitigate labor inflation headwinds. Supported by a sustained strong performance in the Service segment, we achieved total operating profit margins of 16.9% in the quarter. Adjusted EPS grew 1% or $0.01 in the third quarter, with our operational performance and a lower share count contributing positively. Moving to cash, we generated $381 million of adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter and we saw sequential improvement in cash from operations within the quarter. We continue to work to drive cash flow into yearend despite the various macro and mixed challenges that we are facing across our business, most notably in China due to the lower New Equipment orders. Overall, year-to-date, we grew organic sales 1.2% with mid-single digit or greater growth in all regions outside of China. With Service as the driver, we have delivered 60 basis points of margin expansion, 8.2% adjusted EPS growth while returning $800 million to shareholders through shared buybacks. We move into the final quarter of the year with continued focus on operational experience across the business while working to offset the macro headwinds we are facing. Let me now turn it back to Judy to discuss our 2024 outlook.\nJudy Marks: Now on slide 8. Before discussing our updated 2024 financial outlook, let me first update you on our industry outlook, including giving some color on how we anticipate 2025 markets to shape up. On the positive side, we now expect the Americas to be roughly flat, up from the prior outlook as customer demand signals are showing signs of improvement. We expect China to be down approximately 15% and this takes our Asia outlook down to a roughly 10% decline. There is no change to our New Equipment outlook in EMEA or APAC. Overall, we expect global New Equipment units to be down high single digits for 2024. Offsetting the pressure on New Equipment markets, the Service market remains resilient, and we expect the global install base to grow mid-single digits this year as units that were booked a few years ago are coming off warranty and converted into the service base. Looking towards 2025, we expect the global New Equipment market to improve despite the New Equipment softness in China. We anticipate the combined Americas, EMEA, and APAC New Equipment markets should be up low single digits in units. China remains a question mark, but at this point, we currently anticipate a decline somewhere in the range of 5% to 10% in units, clearly dependent on the impact of government stimulus measures. Overall, across all regions, we currently anticipate a sequential improvement in New Equipment market growth rates next year versus this year's rates. On the Service side, the installed base should continue to grow at around mid-single digits, a clear demonstration of the resiliency of the industry. We anticipate the modernization market will continue to grow strongly in all four regions. Turning to our financial outlook for 2024, we now expect sales of approximately $14.2 billion with organic sales growth of approximately 1.5%. Service remains strong across all lines of business for both growth and profit, and Cristina will get more color on this in a moment. Our sales outlook is at the low end of our prior expectations, with the change driven specifically by China New Equipment. Adjusted operating profit is now expected to be up approximately $105 million in actual currency and up about $140 million at constant currency, with the change from our prior outlook similarly driven by China New Equipment. We anticipate adjusted EPS to come in around $3.85, up approximately 9%, driven by strong operational performance and the benefit from a lower share count and continuous improvement in the reduction of our tax rate. We expected adjusted free cash flow to come within a range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion and plan to return the cash we generate this year to shareholders through dividends and $1 billion in share repurchases. We continue to make steady progress with our Uplift program, which is helping to drive a more efficient organization and deliver more value to customers while mitigating some challenges we face for the past few quarters throughout the globe. Overall, our service driven business model and overall company strategy remain on track and we will continue to deliver value to shareholders including the 9% EPS growth we anticipate this year. Now let me hand it to Cristina to discuss our outlook in more detail.\nCristina Mendez: Thank you, Judy. Taking a more detailed look at our outlook and starting with sales on slide 9. Total organic sales are expected to be up approximately 1.5% driven by solid performance in our Service segment. We expect New Equipment organic sales to be down mid to high single digits driven by a decline in China due to the challenging market conditions that Judy mentioned earlier. Total Asia is expected to be down high teens in 2024 with a strong high single digit growth in Asia Pacific, more than offset by severe declines in China. Our outlook for the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific are unchanged from the prior guidance. Overall, the New Equipment segment has performed weaker than we expected this year, driven by the market situation in China. However, the rest of the world has performed better than we projected at the start of the year and we anticipate the combined growth of Americas, EMEA, and APAC to be mid-single digit up for 2024. Our Service segment continues to perform quite well and has been largely in line with our expectations as we have gone through the year. In line with our prior guidance, we anticipate Service organic sales to grow a bit more than 6.5%. This includes Maintenance and Repair growth of approximately 6% and Modernization growth of at least 9% at or above the high end of our prior range. We anticipate continued modernization sales momentum in the fourth quarter due to the timing of project execution from the backlog. We expect this to be the third year in a row of Service organic sales growth of 6% or better, offsetting the severe headwinds we have faced in New Equipment over the past years, and demonstrating the power and resiliency of our business model. Turning to slide 10, at constant currency, operating profit is expected to grow approximately $140 million. In Service, performance this year has been excellent year-to-date, and we expect operating profit margin to expand approximately 75 basis points for the full year, driven by volume, productivity aided by Uplift, and continued solid pricing. For New Equipment, operating profit margins have now expected to contract 50 basis points versus the prior year. Tailwinds from productivity, including benefits from Uplift, commodities, and pricing from the backlog are being more than offset by volume and mixed headwinds emanating from lower China New Equipment sales as a result of continued market weakness. So the updated outlook assumes a similar fourth quarter organic growth rate in New Equipment to what we saw in the third quarter. And on constant current currency basis, we would anticipate a similar dollar declining New Equipment profit of around $20 million to $25 million with a slightly larger headwind at actual currency. We expect overall adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 70 basis points driven by Service performance. The update to our outlook is exclusively driven by the changing New Equipment sales driven by China volumes. And we are mitigating this headwind through Service volumes, productivity, and pricing. Turning to cash flow, we expect to achieve adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. The lower operating profit outlook, coupled with fewer down payments from China New Equipment order volumes, are impacting our expected cash flow for the year. We continue to focus on what we can control to improve working capital, and we expect strong free cash flow ramp up in Q4, similar to last year. Moving to the 2024 EPS bridge on slide 11. We expect to deliver adjusted EPS of approximately $3.85. This is $0.31 of EPS growth versus the prior year, or approximately 9%, largely driven by operational performance. At constant currency, we expect approximately $0.36 of operating profit growth outside of China, while we anticipate China to be a headwind of about $0.10 to $0.15 for the year. Reductions in the effective tax rate and a lower share count are anticipated to offset headwinds from higher interest expense and foreign exchange. Minority interest expense naturally moves lower due to the weaker China performance. Let me now give you some additional commentary on two areas. First, China, and second, how we see 2025 shaping up at this point. On China, although we have largely been able to mitigate the significant China impact on adjusted EPS year-to-date, in our EPS bridge, we have included a small range of China outcomes to give some additional color due to the continued uncertainty in the market. As we exited Q3, the New Equipment backlog in China is down mid-teens, and the book and ship business remain under pressure. While math has been set on the policy front in terms of possible stimulus in the region, and we remain optimistic for a policy follow-through, as we see it here today, unless the region begins to accelerate into yearend, we could see it being upwards of a $0.05 additional headwind to EPS. Lower China volumes and the mixed impacts naturally puts pressure on the exit run rate margin for New Equipment into 2025. Now, let me talk a bit about 2025, starting with Service. We expect the Service business to continue performing well next year, with mid-single digit or better topline growth and continued margin expansion. While we expect to achieve approximately 75 basis points of margin expansion this year, we said at our Investor Day in February that the Service business over the medium term would achieve 50 basis points or slightly more of margin expansion annually. So as you think about the two years combined, we would expect to be somewhere between 100 and 125 basis points of margin expansion within the Service segment. On New Equipment , as in the past few years, excluding China, we feel good about the rest of the world combined, growing low single digits or better in 2025. While there are still a few months to go, which will determine exactly the orders in Q4 and our ending backlog heading into 2025, if we assume that the backlog ends this year, down low single digits, that would be a fairly good starting guidepost for New Equipment top line in 2025. As Judy mentioned earlier, China remains uncertain for the New Equipment segment for both sales and profit. As without policy change and a stimulus action, we would expect our second half margin rate in New Equipment to persist throughout 2025. The margin rate within New Equipment is being impacted by the meaningful shift in regional mix, with more than 75% of the New Equipment revenue now being driven by sales outside of China. We will continue to work to offset the headwinds that this poses through productivity, while continuing to drive the UpLift program and right sizing our cost, to align with the current market conditions. In closing, our results from the first nine months demonstrate our ability to deliver on our service-driven business model. We continue to focus on what we can control, including growing our portfolio, executing on our expanding modernization backlog, and continuing to drive productivity throughout the organization, including UpLift initiatives. We continue to drive results through the remaining of the year to set us up well to perform in 2025. With that, Christa, please open the line for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, and I hope all is well. Thanks for the details on FY25, Cristina. So it seems that China fundamentals are starting to really sort of deteriorate. And I'm just wondering the message has been obviously pricing pressure has been offset by deflationary import costs. So I'm just wondering if the OE pressure we're seeing right now, whether that's really a function of lower China margins, not just the mix of China. And I'm just wondering if the pricing is getting irrational and whether there's any changes in strategy over the next year, one or two years within China.\nJudy Marks: Yes, thanks, Nigel. And good morning. Listen, the New Equipment market, as you heard myself and Cristina say in China, remains weak. It was down 15% this quarter, similar to second quarter. And we think that's how the year is actually going to finish. We are constantly trading off volume, price and liquidity to make sure that our China business remains strong as we go into 2025. We now believe that China segment for 2024 will be at about 415,000 units. As we've looked and as we've shared our New Equipment revenue is down fairly significantly double digit. Our Service revenue is flattish to up slightly. Our portfolio units are still up high teens. So the pivot and the strategy we've been making to Service is working about a third of our revenue now in China is Service. And as you heard Cristina say, we're down $400 million in revenue year-to-date in China. We are going to put in our guide, we're going to be down a $0.5 billion of revenue in China this year and still have organic top line growth for the company. Now, when we look structurally at China, our New Equipment total contribution is really only down a couple of points. So we are still seeing the deflationary environment. We're optimizing commodities to the best of our ability and really trying for and focused on delivering down a few points, even though pricing remains competitive, it has always been competitive in China on New Equipment. We are not seeing irrational pricing. We're seeing sustained competitive pricing and a 415,000 unit market, to me, is still a healthy market in terms of segment size for us to secure the business we want. The Mod market is growing and is picking up nicely and you'll see us drive Mod margin expansion as we grow scale there. Our Mod orders year-to-date in China are positive. October was very positive, but for the quarter, it was not at the level we wanted, and there was a little bit of resistance as people were waiting to understand more about the equipment renewal incentives that had been announced early in the quarter with not a lot of specificity. We're seeing that pickup. That was prior to the bigger stimulus that was announced later in the quarter. Our Service units are up yet again, high teens. The Service revenue was up 1%. So our business in China is reshaping. It's, if you think, down a $0.5 billion, $500 million. That's the lowest revenue we've had in China since we've reported in 2017, which was in our Form 10. We did a look back two years, and yet as you look at the contribution even that our China team has made, it is not at that level of drop. So we're watching mix carefully. Obviously, the other three regions are adding significantly to the mix and the margin and the top line on New Equipment, and the Service business, including in China, is doing very well.\nNigel Coe: Okay, that's great, Judy. That's great color. Thanks very much. And then just a quick one on Service, the flat Service margins year-to-year. Obviously, you've kept the Service outlook unchanged. Was that sort of your plan for the quarter? And maybe just obviously the Mod mix would have been adverse. So just maybe just a bit more color on terms of the operating average within Service\u2019s and whether the labor inflation is actually getting a bit worse there in terms of impacting the margins, perhaps.\nCristina Mendez: Hi, Nigel. This is Cristina. So on Service margins, they are coming broadly in line with expectations. And in fact, when you see sequentially, they are going up. It was 24.7% in Q2, 24.8% in Q4. And this is thanks to the flow through of good volumes. And you have seen that there was a good ramp up of Service\u2019s in the quarter, coming mainly from the timing of repair and modernization. And we also have a very good performance in price. Price was up in the quarter, approximately four points, including the impact of mix and churn. And we also have productivity and Uplift measure, and all of this is compensating wage inflation that is rolling line with expectation. So I would say very steady state performance in Service, in line with expectations, and this can be even an opportunity for Q4, as we see modernization is ramping up very nicely.\nJudy Marks: Yes, Nigel, the other thing, if you recall last quarter, we anticipated Repair picking up in the second half of the year and Mod conversion picking up in the second half of the year. Both of those are contributing nicely. Repair was up 10%, really led by the Americas. And Mod, if you look at really how we performed on the delivery side of Mod, we were over 13% in terms of sales. That's going to continue with our backlog up 12%. We keep anticipating Repair to come to normalize, so like a point above Maintenance. But it looks like we'll wrap this year and fourth quarter again with strong Repair, similar to third quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey Sprague: Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone is well. Hey, Judy, can you also just drill a little bit into mod China? And I guess the specific angle on my question is kind of if we think about mods globally or certainly rest the world, right? We're thinking historically a little bit below New Equipment with the trajectory above New Equipment as you realign the business. Does that playbook exist in the same way, shape, and form in China?\nJudy Marks: Yes, it does, Jeff, and good morning. So mod margins in China look attractive, like New Equipment margins do in China, relative to the rest of the world. So and we're seeing that play out this year as well. It's early days for mod in China, obviously a younger portfolio, but a portfolio that will accelerate and grow more rapidly when you think about CAGR versus anywhere else in the world. So we're in a unique position to do mod, an industrialized mod with our kits from the start. There's not a lot of old units to modernize in mod. So most of these are our Gen2 units, which means we're going to get the benefits of scale, commodities. We're already handling Gen3 mod on our Gen3 line in our factories in China. So I'm very optimistic about mod in China in terms of available segment, in terms of demand, in terms of rapid growth. And again, what we've seen early orders in October in mod is very promising. This equipment renewal program that I spoke about, just to give you a little context, was announced, I think, in the July time frame. It was for everything from appliances to cars, but elevators and escalators were included, which we thought was very important. The challenge is, obviously, with all these getting the rules out locally, and that has taken a little time. And the reason why I believe our mod orders weren't as strong as they needed to be in the third quarter. You're going to see mod bounce back nicely. We've already seen it in October in China. You're going to see more significant mod orders. As we came into this quarter globally, our mod orders were up for seven or eight quarters double digit. You will see a return to double digit in the fourth quarter. And then the rest of the world, we saw some timing issues in mod in the third quarter, in terms of some major projects. Those have moved to the fourth quarter, but we expect those to come in. And we did have a slight compare with a couple projects in the Middle East from Q3 last year that were pretty significant mod projects. So we'll be back to double digit in the fourth quarter, which means the backlog will remain strong going into next year. And I think what you've now seen is we've proven the conversion. The mod margin for the third quarter in a row, globally, was better than the New Equipment margin. So the strategy we put in place last year to industrialize mod, we're seeing that take hold. And we're seeing mod margins now greater than New Equipment. And we do have line of sight to the 10% mod margins we anticipate in the medium term.\nJeffrey Sprague: And then just really big picture on China as we sort of step back, right, going from, I don't know, call 650,000 to 415,000 which you characterize are still healthy, I just wonder like big picture though, is that the right number, right? I think the second biggest market in the world is India at like 75,000, right? So if China is overbuilt and the population is shrinking, doesn't that number just have to actually grind lower over a number of additional years?\nJudy Marks: I think there's a potential for it to grind lower, as you say, Jeff, but it's going to grind lower at a lower rate. You've taken a third of the volume out from 650,000 to 415,000 and next year when we are looking at, again, without stimulus impact down 5% to 10%, what that means is we're actually going to see sequential growth improvement in New Equipment in \u201825 at Otis over \u201824 because of the China not decaying or decreasing as much as it did this year. So when we look at the compares and sit here this time next year, we actually, and we'll give you the guide clearly in late January with all the specifics, but we actually see sequential top line growth improvement in \u201825. We're going to see it in Service and we're going to see it in New Equipment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Maybe I just had one clarification on the sort of fourth quarter operating profit dynamics. So I think you've guided the full year up about $140 million at constant currency. That's on slide 11 and 10. And then I think the nine months was up $96 million on slide 20. So you have this sort of $40 million plus increase year-on-year in Q4, but I think New Equipment's down 20 or 30 in Q4. So it's just sort of a bigger Uplift in service, it looks like, just maybe help us understand kind of what's driving that. And it looks like the sort of general seasonality in the Q4 guide is a bit stronger than your normal seasonality on profits.\nCristina Mendez: Hi Julian, this is Cristina and it's a very good analysis. So as you have said, year-to-date, we have grown operating profit at constant currency of about $96 million, which means margin expansion of $60 million. And when you look into Q4, we expect Service to continue performing very strong, topline to continue growing on the back of good ramp up of repair and modernization. And a good flow through of operating profit with additional margin expansion. Margin is expected in Service to be above 25% in Q4. But it's not driven by seasonality, it's just driven by the performance of execution, ramping up the topline and continually working on productivity. On the other side, on New Equipment , we expect Q4 to be more or less at the same level of topline decline as in Q3, approximately minus 8%. And that means a flow through into operating profit with operating profit margin below 5% because we have the volume and the mix effect. And additionally, we see price and commodities gradually fading out in Q4. But overall, we compensate the declining New Equipment with a very strong performance in Service in order to deliver, as you rightly said, approximately $40 million - $50 million operating profit growth in the quarter.\nJudy Marks: Yes, and that 25% rate is very achievable based on everything we're seeing, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much for that detail. And then maybe for the 2025 equipment margin outlook, I think, Judy, you had talked about the sort of New Equipment margin when you're thinking about next year and realize it's early, but a good placeholder might be sort of margins next year in New Equipment similar to this second half. So I think it's sort of third quarter, you're running at third and fourth quarter, you're running at sort of mid-single digits there, 6% Q3, and it sounds like 5% or less in Q4 for New Equipment. So sort of five-ish percent margin in 2025 for New Equipment, as it looks today. Just help us understand kind of what's that assuming maybe for pricing and are you planning or starting to enact further cost out measures? There's the Uplift program sort of working through in its second year. Anything happening on there to try and get the sort of nose up on New Equipment margins?\nJudy Marks: Yes, without guiding, I think you're very accurate in terms of what you're seeing for \u201825 New Equipment margins, again, driven by the impact of mix as China contribution is less. And the rest of the world is now, as Cristina said, over 75% of the revenue for New Equipment. Just so you get a sense, China is going to finish this year all in at 13%, a little over 13% of our revenue. So it's really changed the dynamic. But our Uplift program is on track. Last quarter you saw we updated the outlook and the run rate. And that is holding well, and that will continue to deliver in 2025. And we've planned on that. Before I turn this over to Cristina on maybe a little more color, why don't I just give you a how to sales and the top line look for 2025. So in New Equipment, again, excluding China, our New Equipment backlogs up low single digits. Right now our New Equipment backlogs down three total. And we'll see where the fourth quarter ends up in terms of orders. Our New Equipment topline, we'd expect low single digit growth next year for everywhere outside of China. In China, we would expect along the lines that we saw this year. But we'll, we have to wait and see. We haven't pre-programmed any stimulus. I think we're all waiting to see what happens in next week at the end of the week with the National People's Congress. And we are prepared for the stimulus, whether it comes in New Equipment or mod. We have the capacity; we have the capabilities both in our factory and in our field. So New Equipment i.e. all in the growth we think will be down low to mid-single digits, kind of plus or minus where the backlog comes in at the end of the year. On Service topline, really, really strong service portfolio growth. And if I could just take a minute, we talk about this 4.2% a lot, and we've had eight straight quarters or two years of that. What I think it's important for everyone to understand is with the largest service portfolio in the globe at 2.3 million units growing to almost 2.4 million by yearend, we're adding 25,000 units every quarter to our service portfolio. And as we shared at Investor Day, our average service customer has four units. So we're adding 25,000 customers, which is why we have such faith in our service-driven business model. That drives maintenance, that drives repair, and it drives additional density for us that gives us productivity, all of which support, again, this high margin service business. And with our retention rate at almost 94%, It also then drives that continuous relationship for 15, 20, 30 years that gives us the modernization business. So service next year as we look at it, maintenance and repair are going to be driven by that strong portfolio growth and very solid repair volumes. We've been getting price on service this year, as Cristina said, like for like pricing increased four points. We're watching inflation, but we will get price next year. Will it be at the same level? Depends where we are in the world with inflation, but we will get price on the maintenance side and the portfolio growth. It'll be a tailwind in \u201825. Repair volume, very strong. As I said, north of 10% growth. We still see solid repair backlog going into next year. Expect that to normalize, but you've heard me say that every year so, but we do expect it to normalize. And mod, as we exit right now, the third quarter backlog is up 12%, and we're looking at 9%, high single digit plus. That's what you should expect next year too, if not better because the mod backlog is growing. So I just wanted to give you some color on the portfolio itself and on the top line, which is why as we look out in \u201825 and even \u201826 beyond as we look at the medium term, this near-term New Equipment in China doesn't get me concerned because we're still growing mid-teen plus, if not high-teen portfolio in China, and the rest of the world is growing our portfolio low single digit. So we don't see that there being a knock-on effect a few years out because we have time to work it, we have time to do recaptures, and we are focused on improving our retention rates, our conversion rates are doing much better in China, and the like. Let me turn it over, Cristina, for you on any other comments on profit.\nCristina Mendez: Yes, no, thank you, Judy. And let me comment, Julian, on the profit side, and you had a very good analysis. So as you did recapping the topline, we expect next year low single digit up, that is sequentially slightly better because of less decline or lower declining new equipment. But now on the margin side, Service will continue with margin expansion you recall that we said back in February in our Investor Day that Service was going to grow 50 basis point of annual margin expansion, this year we have overdriven, we are 75 basis point but when you put together \u201824 and \u201925, we expect margin expansion of around 100 - 125 points in service. On the other side, new equipment, as you rightly said we have the effect of volumes are mixed but additionally as I mentioned before next year the commodities and price tailwinds that we have benefited this year are going to gradually fade out. So all of these together would mean that the second half of the year [inaudible] rate is going to persist in 2025 and it would mean approximately 50 to 100 basis point of margin decline, but when you put everything together, we have a stronger service segment, a weaker new equipment but overall operating profit is expected to grow mid-single digit next year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe O\u2019Dea with Wells Fargo.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you elaborate a little bit more on Americas and Europe and the growth that you're seeing in the backlog and price versus volume and I think just as we consider multifamily pressure and office pressure but the growth that you're seeing in an outlook for growth into next year? Trying to understand kind of market versus share gain and other factors at play.\nJudy Marks: Yes, thanks Joe. Listen, in the Americas, I'm really pleased this for -- this is really the first quarter, we're seeing really early projects moving forward again with green shoots. We all know the indicators, ABI and Dodge, I won't repeat them for you. And I know we like to think some are leading, some are lagging. I think that you're going to see this all settle out over the next 12 to 18 months. We are definitely seeing improvement in the new equipment market segment in Q3. You saw our orders were up 23%. We knew we needed that. We said we'd come back in the second half, and we delivered. And actually, in North America, we increased our pricing. It was the best we did anywhere in third quarter. It was low single digit, but it was the best anywhere in the quarter in the world. If you look at Americas for the year, year-to-date, we're down 9.5% in orders. But if you eliminate that large infrastructure job we won in Canada in the first quarter of \u201823, we have shown nice sequential growth quarter after quarter, and we're really seeing more new equipment market stability. And again, we get this from our sales teams. As they're talking to customers, the sentiment has gotten a lot better after the Fed changed the rates. We've got a really strong backlog in the Americas, a good 18-month plus line of sight to perform, even though our backlog's down, because our sales have been up significantly. Our new equipment sales in the Americas came in 6% for the quarter. It was hotter than the prior low single-digit and mid-single digit for the full year. We expect the fourth quarter to be mid-single digit as well. Service sales in the America portfolios up low single digit. Repairs were great in the third quarter, about 10%. They're there year-to-date, and we anticipate that continuing into the fourth quarter. Mod orders for the Americas were up mid-single digit, both in the quarter and year-to-date. We expect that to continue. And Mod sales were up low teams for the quarter, and year-to-date, they're up high single digit. So we believe the Americas market itself has stabilized, and our performance is doing much better. And when we look at -- this is a little different commentary than you heard last quarter. When we look at the different verticals, this quarter, we still had the best verticals were infrastructure and industrial buildings, but all of the verticals were up this quarter in North America, which to us is a real inflection point. If I go to EMEA, what we're seeing in the market itself is, it's challenging, but we're performing very well. Middle East is doing very well. South Europe is strong. North Europe's a little weaker. Spain and Africa are doing very well. And even Central Europe for us this quarter did very well, despite the market uncertainty and environment in Germany. We're seeing pressure in France, but our backlog in EMEA is solid. New equipment year-to-date is up 8%. So even though the quarter was down in orders, strong first half by EMEA, the team is performing very well. Our 12-month roll in EMEA orders is up 7.8%, and I really believe we're outperforming the market there. Our backlog is up over last year in EMEA, and our Gen3 60 product is rolling out very well. So a little different commentary this quarter, inflection we were seeing in the Americas, and I think we're outperforming in EMEA in a challenging environment.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: That's a really helpful commentary, and obviously sort of mixed trends that we see in some of the leading indicators, so appreciate it. And then just wanted to ask on cost structure as it relates to China and you're thinking about that market sizing moving forward. Obviously, some of the buildout that you did there to serve that market, but as you think about it today and the potential for volumes in this range for a while, how do you think about costs or those things we could hear more about as we get into next year?\nJudy Marks: You will definitely hear more about costs coming out in China, and this is for two reasons. One, we would do this based on the market, but second, with our Uplift program, we're changing the way we work to be more customer-centric, to have common processes everywhere, to have the ability to actually continue to drive significant growth. But in China, we're looking at everything from our operational footprint. We have moved our modernization into our new equipment factories, so any facilities that used to do modernization don't do that anymore, and we're obviously looking at our workforce. I have to give Sally and the team incredible credit for operating under some pretty tough economic times right now. As I said, I think in my first answer, we're trying to balance rational volume with pricing and with our customers' abilities to pay. That's what's really driving our cash guide coming down. We're not going to take business just for the sake of volume to fill factories or to keep the field gainfully employed. We're taking what we believe is smart business that will put us in a strong position to continue to grow our service business in China and get ready for that nascent mod business to really take off. When I think about mod and new equipment, I can't tell you where that crossover is going to happen yet, but when you think about the price of a unit in mod is about the same as the price of a unit in new equipment everywhere in the globe, including China, where our mod margins are highest. And so as that picks up, right now we have 415,000 units in the new equipment segment this year in China. As that mod market picks up, we will hit 415,000 units sometime this decade, just as the mod segment. I can't peg when that's going to be, but we're actually going to have a larger market to serve in China and around the world than we have today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I mean, I appreciate all the color on China potential range of outcomes next year. But Judy, I would just be interested in your perspective on the stimulus actions we've seen in China so far. Anything more that you're watching that could come here in the coming weeks or months and ultimately just kind of what it means for China construction. Thank you.\nJudy Marks: Yes, thanks, Chris. Listen, we are encouraged by what's been announced to date. The key is going to be the implementation methods, the regulations. We're in a regulated environment and how the local governments use the potential liquidity, debt relief, all of that. The announcements that were made are positive. To us, it's now the how. We believe the first indication of this and we talk, yes, we've talked to the party secretaries because we're focused on economic development. We want to grow in China and we will grow in China despite this $0.5 billion of revenue. You will watch our service and our mod business continue to grow and we'll stabilize this new equipment business. Our early look is with the stimulus, with the aging population, we think this is going to actually accelerate modernization more. It's going to allow with the 5,100 white projects for projects to get finished which will give us more confidence in liquidity with some of our customers as well and our key accounts. But the first time I think we're going to know more, Chris, is there's a special meeting in the National People's Congress, the most senior members next week, within a readout next Friday, November 8. So we'll see what happens there. I will be on the ground in China in November. I think it's important to be able to talk to our customers, to be able to talk to our colleagues and thank them for their dedication under this stressful time. And they are delivering. When you think about the decline we've had in the topline, and yet our focus on continuing to deliver for our customers and grow our service business. So I think we'll all know more. We do not anticipate that impacting fourth quarter financials, even if rules come out. If it does, I'll be happy to share that with you in our fourth quarter earnings. We see this more as a potential for \u201825. But in all the color Cristina and I have given you today, because we're not going to guide for \u201825 yet, we have not anticipated any positive impact of the stimulus on China. So when we say down five to 10 next year for China new equipment at the segment level for units available in the market, that does not anticipate any stimulus. Same with the modernization market. There's 10 million units available for service. We added mid to, our service growth this quarter was high teens. So now in China we're up to 425,000 units in our service portfolio. That's still 4% share. We got plenty more we can recapture, plenty more to convert. So we are hopeful, but we need to understand the implementation rules. And most importantly, our customers and the local governments need to do that.\nChris Snyder: Appreciate that. If I could just follow up on the Americas. You talked about customer better demand signals from customers, if we look at the orders in Americas, it's obviously very sharp rate of change, Q3 up 20, first half down 20. Are you starting to see that better customer demand in Q3, or is that Q3 order number really just a function of comps? And then that improvement is really maybe a Q4 into \u201825 driver. Thank you.\nJudy Marks: There were certainly some comps. I want to be clear about that. But we are seeing between proposal activity, and we had a lot, and you know, Chris, we get a down payment when we sign an order everywhere in the world, but especially in the Americas, and it's not something that is really negotiable or that we give back if a project gets canceled. So our customers have to have that conviction that their project's going to go. And we had a lot that were just really close, but waiting, I think waiting to hear what the Fed was doing, waiting to see what the economy was doing. But as I said, for all the segments, we're talking commercial, office, residential, infrastructure, and industrial to have turned positive in the market in the third quarter. It's more than comps. Our team's performing, and you can expect that kind of positive performance, regardless of comps, fourth quarter and into next year.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Patrick Bowman with JP Morgan Chase.\nPatrick Bowman: Hi, good morning, Judy, Cristina. Thanks for letting me squeeze in here. Just had one, maybe two, but first one on free cash flow, the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion this year. Can you talk about what working capital drags embedded in that and parse that out in terms of drivers, maybe size the China down payment drag you called out or anything else unusual depressing this year that should flip around next year to give you better growth? Because I'd assume, and you could correct me if I'm wrong, that free cash flow growth next year should be better than kind of the mid-single digit you expect on operating profits. So just wanted to check on the dynamics there.\nCristina Mendez: Hi, Pat, this is Cristina. And so yes, you are right, the production of the guide to $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion is related to the down payments and the new equipment order situation in China. But overall, when you see our cash flow performance year-to-date, we have generated an adjusted net income of $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion, and $900 million year-to-date cash flow. That means that year-to-date we have built up approximately $250 million working capital. And there are two reasons for that. One is the business mix. On the one side, new equipment declining, especially because of China, and we don't get the down payments. But on the other side, we are growing in service. And the collection time in service is later because we collect when we execute the job, for example on repair. We also have some payables impact because of the ramp up of modernization because of payments to suppliers while we execute the projects but we expect these business mix to stabilize now in Q4 will start collecting the good ramp up of topline in Q3 now in Q4 and overall the $200 million working capital is going to be unwound. So the expectation in the guide is to deliver in Q4 approximately $550 million cash flow that is more less the same level of cash flow we delivered last year in Q3. And then to your question in to 2025, yes, you are right, we should expect that as we stabilize the business mix cash flows to pick up at a faster pay than operating profit flows.\nJudy Marks: And Patrick from a capital allocation perspective, if you think about it, we're going to do a $1 billion of share buybacks and $600 million roughly of dividend versus this $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, we have the ability to do that because teams done a great job bringing our cash balance down probably since the first time significantly since spin from a $1 billion to almost $800 million. So we are working every element of this to be able to share to obviously share this cash back with our shareholders.\nPatrick Bowman: Makes sense and so conversion next year should be back above a 100% of adjusted earnings?\nJudy Marks: At least a 100%. We will guide in January.\nPatrick Bowman: That make sense and then last one just on service margins, if you could talk about just the factors around why the margin expansion for next year would slow to something less than 50 basis points relative to the 75, you're guiding for this year. Just any color on the factors that were better than expected this year that will reverse I guess next year to make it closer than 50 over the two year period.\nCristina Mendez: Yes, at the end, we are not guiding now is we are just providing some color of the trends and the 50 basis points is what we committed back in the Investors Day and this is going to come and of course on top of that we continue working on the same actions we have implemented this year in terms of price, productivity and Uplift. And we will target to overdrive, but for the time being it is what we can mention.\nPatrick Bowman: Understood and modernization business, those margins are expected to continue expanding as part of that guide for next year.\nCristina Mendez: Yes, you'll see that in January, yes.\nOperator: And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question and answer session. And I would now like to turn the call over to Judy Marks for closing remarks.\nJudy Marks: Thank you, Christa. Our solid results in the first nine months of the year demonstrate the resiliency of our service driven business model. We remain focused on mitigating macro headwinds and further driving shareholder value in order to deliver a strong final quarter and beyond. Our growth in modernization, maintenance, and repair, and the overall service portfolio validates that our flywheel continues to fuel profitable growth. As I close the call, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Mike for his many contributions to Otis and wish him success in his new role. Stay safe and well, everyone. Thank you for joining.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

Starting with Q3 highlights on slide 3, Otis returned to topline growth in the third quarter as we continued to demonstrate the strength of our Service-driven business model with solid third quarter results. In Service, we delivered high single digit growth in Q3, bringing year-to-date service organic sales to 6.4% with all lines of business contributing. We achieved maintenance portfolio growth of 4.2% and our modernization backlog increased 12% at constant currency. Through the first nine months of 2024, we have expanded overall adjusted operating profit margin by 60 basis points and achieved adjusted EPS growth of 8.2%. In Q3, we generated $381 million in adjusted free cash flow and completed $200 million in share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've generated approximately $900 million in adjusted free cash flow and returned $800 million through share repurchases as we execute on our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Otis had several exciting accomplishments recently. For example, our manufacturing hub in Korea obtained ISO 50001 certification. Otis now has 11 manufacturing sites certified through the global standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and improving energy management. In addition, we announced the expansion of our Bengaluru manufacturing facility. This will increase our capacity and capabilities to help meet the growing residential, commercial, and infrastructure demand for elevators and escalators in India, while also expanding our localized manufacturing strategy in the country. And last, earlier this month, we're proud to name one of the world's Best Employers by Forbes Magazine for the third year in a row, reflecting our commitment to our colleagues' wellbeing. Moving to our orders performance on slide 4. New Equipment orders were down 3% in the third quarter, a sequential improvement versus the first two quarters of the year, despite continued challenging market conditions. Excluding China, orders increased approximately 10%. Orders returned to growth in the Americas, growing more than 20%, with excellent performance in North America, while APAC delivered high single digit growth driven by continued strength in Japan and Southeast Asia. Orders declined by high single digits in EMEA due to continued weakness in Western and Northern Europe, bringing orders to 8% year-to-date after a strong first half. A greater than 20% decline in China was a result of continued economic softness in the region. Our New Equipment backlog at constant currency was down 3% versus the prior year. Although similar to last quarter, the New Equipment backlog excluding China was up low single digits. This quarter marked two consecutive years of delivering 4% or greater maintenance portfolio growth in each quarter. And last, within Service, modernization orders increased 3% as we faced a challenging compare from the prior year in major project bookings. And we expect to see a bounce back to solid mod orders growth in the fourth quarter. With mod orders, year-to-date, up approximately 10%, our modernization backlog increased 12% at constant currency versus the prior year. As our colleagues across the globe continue to deliver, we have several customer highlights to share from the third quarter. In Melbourne, Australia, Otis will modernize 30 elevators at 101 Collins Street in the Central Business District. Our Skyrise and Gen3 modernization-specific products will be featured along with our signature ReGen drives and the Otis ONE IoT platform. Otis installed the building's original elevators in 1989 and has maintained them for the past 35 years. In the United States, we're proud to support the expansion of the St. Luke's University Health Anderson Campus Hospital in Bethlehem Township, Pennsylvania. Otis will install nine elevators, including five Gen3 Peak and one Gen3 Edge unit, for a new five floor addition. The St. Luke's organization has been a valued customer for more than 10 years. In the Nordics, our local teams have worked closely with customers to add more than 400 units to the portfolio. In Denmark, we've recaptured 275 units with Zomaya, a leading construction and housing business. And in Sweden, we've recaptured 132 units at Vallingby Shopping Center, a customer making a welcome return to Otis after 10 years. Reflecting the continued strength of the infrastructure vertical, Otis was selected to provide more than 340 escalators and Gen3 elevators for the Tianjin Metro in China as part of the Metro's new Line 8 and Binhai one line. This brings the total number of Otis units in the city's expanding Metro network to more than 2,000. Tianjin Metro has been using Otis equipment for almost three decades. Turning to Q3 results on slide 5. Otis delivered net sales of $3.5 billion with organic sales up approximately 1%. Adjusted operating profit, excluding a $4 million foreign exchange headwind was up $8 million driven by the Service segment. Third quarter adjusted EPS grew approximately 1% or $0.01 in a quarter against a tough compare of approximately 19% EPS growth in the third quarter of the prior year. Operational performance was partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds. This brings year-to-date adjusted EPS growth to 8.2%. With that, I'll turn it over to Cristina to walk through our results in more detail. Now on slide 8. Before discussing our updated 2024 financial outlook, let me first update you on our industry outlook, including giving some color on how we anticipate 2025 markets to shape up. On the positive side, we now expect the Americas to be roughly flat, up from the prior outlook as customer demand signals are showing signs of improvement. We expect China to be down approximately 15% and this takes our Asia outlook down to a roughly 10% decline. There is no change to our New Equipment outlook in EMEA or APAC. Overall, we expect global New Equipment units to be down high single digits for 2024. Offsetting the pressure on New Equipment markets, the Service market remains resilient, and we expect the global install base to grow mid-single digits this year as units that were booked a few years ago are coming off warranty and converted into the service base. Looking towards 2025, we expect the global New Equipment market to improve despite the New Equipment softness in China. We anticipate the combined Americas, EMEA, and APAC New Equipment markets should be up low single digits in units. China remains a question mark, but at this point, we currently anticipate a decline somewhere in the range of 5% to 10% in units, clearly dependent on the impact of government stimulus measures. Overall, across all regions, we currently anticipate a sequential improvement in New Equipment market growth rates next year versus this year's rates. On the Service side, the installed base should continue to grow at around mid-single digits, a clear demonstration of the resiliency of the industry. We anticipate the modernization market will continue to grow strongly in all four regions. Turning to our financial outlook for 2024, we now expect sales of approximately $14.2 billion with organic sales growth of approximately 1.5%. Service remains strong across all lines of business for both growth and profit, and Cristina will get more color on this in a moment. Our sales outlook is at the low end of our prior expectations, with the change driven specifically by China New Equipment. Adjusted operating profit is now expected to be up approximately $105 million in actual currency and up about $140 million at constant currency, with the change from our prior outlook similarly driven by China New Equipment. We anticipate adjusted EPS to come in around $3.85, up approximately 9%, driven by strong operational performance and the benefit from a lower share count and continuous improvement in the reduction of our tax rate. We expected adjusted free cash flow to come within a range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion and plan to return the cash we generate this year to shareholders through dividends and $1 billion in share repurchases. We continue to make steady progress with our Uplift program, which is helping to drive a more efficient organization and deliver more value to customers while mitigating some challenges we face for the past few quarters throughout the globe. Overall, our service driven business model and overall company strategy remain on track and we will continue to deliver value to shareholders including the 9% EPS growth we anticipate this year. Now let me hand it to Cristina to discuss our outlook in more detail. Yes, thanks, Nigel. And good morning. Listen, the New Equipment market, as you heard myself and Cristina say in China, remains weak. It was down 15% this quarter, similar to second quarter. And we think that's how the year is actually going to finish. We are constantly trading off volume, price and liquidity to make sure that our China business remains strong as we go into 2025. We now believe that China segment for 2024 will be at about 415,000 units. As we've looked and as we've shared our New Equipment revenue is down fairly significantly double digit. Our Service revenue is flattish to up slightly. Our portfolio units are still up high teens. So the pivot and the strategy we've been making to Service is working about a third of our revenue now in China is Service. And as you heard Cristina say, we're down $400 million in revenue year-to-date in China. We are going to put in our guide, we're going to be down a $0.5 billion of revenue in China this year and still have organic top line growth for the company. Now, when we look structurally at China, our New Equipment total contribution is really only down a couple of points. So we are still seeing the deflationary environment. We're optimizing commodities to the best of our ability and really trying for and focused on delivering down a few points, even though pricing remains competitive, it has always been competitive in China on New Equipment. We are not seeing irrational pricing. We're seeing sustained competitive pricing and a 415,000 unit market, to me, is still a healthy market in terms of segment size for us to secure the business we want. The Mod market is growing and is picking up nicely and you'll see us drive Mod margin expansion as we grow scale there. Our Mod orders year-to-date in China are positive. October was very positive, but for the quarter, it was not at the level we wanted, and there was a little bit of resistance as people were waiting to understand more about the equipment renewal incentives that had been announced early in the quarter with not a lot of specificity. We're seeing that pickup. That was prior to the bigger stimulus that was announced later in the quarter. Our Service units are up yet again, high teens. The Service revenue was up 1%. So our business in China is reshaping. It's, if you think, down a $0.5 billion, $500 million. That's the lowest revenue we've had in China since we've reported in 2017, which was in our Form 10. We did a look back two years, and yet as you look at the contribution even that our China team has made, it is not at that level of drop. So we're watching mix carefully. Obviously, the other three regions are adding significantly to the mix and the margin and the top line on New Equipment, and the Service business, including in China, is doing very well. Yes, Nigel, the other thing, if you recall last quarter, we anticipated Repair picking up in the second half of the year and Mod conversion picking up in the second half of the year. Both of those are contributing nicely. Repair was up 10%, really led by the Americas. And Mod, if you look at really how we performed on the delivery side of Mod, we were over 13% in terms of sales. That's going to continue with our backlog up 12%. We keep anticipating Repair to come to normalize, so like a point above Maintenance. But it looks like we'll wrap this year and fourth quarter again with strong Repair, similar to third quarter. Yes, it does, Jeff, and good morning. So mod margins in China look attractive, like New Equipment margins do in China, relative to the rest of the world. So and we're seeing that play out this year as well. It's early days for mod in China, obviously a younger portfolio, but a portfolio that will accelerate and grow more rapidly when you think about CAGR versus anywhere else in the world. So we're in a unique position to do mod, an industrialized mod with our kits from the start. There's not a lot of old units to modernize in mod. So most of these are our Gen2 units, which means we're going to get the benefits of scale, commodities. We're already handling Gen3 mod on our Gen3 line in our factories in China. So I'm very optimistic about mod in China in terms of available segment, in terms of demand, in terms of rapid growth. And again, what we've seen early orders in October in mod is very promising. This equipment renewal program that I spoke about, just to give you a little context, was announced, I think, in the July time frame. It was for everything from appliances to cars, but elevators and escalators were included, which we thought was very important. The challenge is, obviously, with all these getting the rules out locally, and that has taken a little time. And the reason why I believe our mod orders weren't as strong as they needed to be in the third quarter. You're going to see mod bounce back nicely. We've already seen it in October in China. You're going to see more significant mod orders. As we came into this quarter globally, our mod orders were up for seven or eight quarters double digit. You will see a return to double digit in the fourth quarter. And then the rest of the world, we saw some timing issues in mod in the third quarter, in terms of some major projects. Those have moved to the fourth quarter, but we expect those to come in. And we did have a slight compare with a couple projects in the Middle East from Q3 last year that were pretty significant mod projects. So we'll be back to double digit in the fourth quarter, which means the backlog will remain strong going into next year. And I think what you've now seen is we've proven the conversion. The mod margin for the third quarter in a row, globally, was better than the New Equipment margin. So the strategy we put in place last year to industrialize mod, we're seeing that take hold. And we're seeing mod margins now greater than New Equipment. And we do have line of sight to the 10% mod margins we anticipate in the medium term. I think there's a potential for it to grind lower, as you say, Jeff, but it's going to grind lower at a lower rate. You've taken a third of the volume out from 650,000 to 415,000 and next year when we are looking at, again, without stimulus impact down 5% to 10%, what that means is we're actually going to see sequential growth improvement in New Equipment in \u201825 at Otis over \u201824 because of the China not decaying or decreasing as much as it did this year. So when we look at the compares and sit here this time next year, we actually, and we'll give you the guide clearly in late January with all the specifics, but we actually see sequential top line growth improvement in \u201825. We're going to see it in Service and we're going to see it in New Equipment. Yes, and that 25% rate is very achievable based on everything we're seeing, Julian. Yes, without guiding, I think you're very accurate in terms of what you're seeing for \u201825 New Equipment margins, again, driven by the impact of mix as China contribution is less. And the rest of the world is now, as Cristina said, over 75% of the revenue for New Equipment. Just so you get a sense, China is going to finish this year all in at 13%, a little over 13% of our revenue. So it's really changed the dynamic. But our Uplift program is on track. Last quarter you saw we updated the outlook and the run rate. And that is holding well, and that will continue to deliver in 2025. And we've planned on that. Before I turn this over to Cristina on maybe a little more color, why don't I just give you a how to sales and the top line look for 2025. So in New Equipment, again, excluding China, our New Equipment backlogs up low single digits. Right now our New Equipment backlogs down three total. And we'll see where the fourth quarter ends up in terms of orders. Our New Equipment topline, we'd expect low single digit growth next year for everywhere outside of China. In China, we would expect along the lines that we saw this year. But we'll, we have to wait and see. We haven't pre-programmed any stimulus. I think we're all waiting to see what happens in next week at the end of the week with the National People's Congress. And we are prepared for the stimulus, whether it comes in New Equipment or mod. We have the capacity; we have the capabilities both in our factory and in our field. So New Equipment i.e. all in the growth we think will be down low to mid-single digits, kind of plus or minus where the backlog comes in at the end of the year. On Service topline, really, really strong service portfolio growth. And if I could just take a minute, we talk about this 4.2% a lot, and we've had eight straight quarters or two years of that. What I think it's important for everyone to understand is with the largest service portfolio in the globe at 2.3 million units growing to almost 2.4 million by yearend, we're adding 25,000 units every quarter to our service portfolio. And as we shared at Investor Day, our average service customer has four units. So we're adding 25,000 customers, which is why we have such faith in our service-driven business model. That drives maintenance, that drives repair, and it drives additional density for us that gives us productivity, all of which support, again, this high margin service business. And with our retention rate at almost 94%, It also then drives that continuous relationship for 15, 20, 30 years that gives us the modernization business. So service next year as we look at it, maintenance and repair are going to be driven by that strong portfolio growth and very solid repair volumes. We've been getting price on service this year, as Cristina said, like for like pricing increased four points. We're watching inflation, but we will get price next year. Will it be at the same level? Depends where we are in the world with inflation, but we will get price on the maintenance side and the portfolio growth. It'll be a tailwind in \u201825. Repair volume, very strong. As I said, north of 10% growth. We still see solid repair backlog going into next year. Expect that to normalize, but you've heard me say that every year so, but we do expect it to normalize. And mod, as we exit right now, the third quarter backlog is up 12%, and we're looking at 9%, high single digit plus. That's what you should expect next year too, if not better because the mod backlog is growing. So I just wanted to give you some color on the portfolio itself and on the top line, which is why as we look out in \u201825 and even \u201826 beyond as we look at the medium term, this near-term New Equipment in China doesn't get me concerned because we're still growing mid-teen plus, if not high-teen portfolio in China, and the rest of the world is growing our portfolio low single digit. So we don't see that there being a knock-on effect a few years out because we have time to work it, we have time to do recaptures, and we are focused on improving our retention rates, our conversion rates are doing much better in China, and the like. Let me turn it over, Cristina, for you on any other comments on profit. Yes, thanks Joe. Listen, in the Americas, I'm really pleased this for -- this is really the first quarter, we're seeing really early projects moving forward again with green shoots. We all know the indicators, ABI and Dodge, I won't repeat them for you. And I know we like to think some are leading, some are lagging. I think that you're going to see this all settle out over the next 12 to 18 months. We are definitely seeing improvement in the new equipment market segment in Q3. You saw our orders were up 23%. We knew we needed that. We said we'd come back in the second half, and we delivered. And actually, in North America, we increased our pricing. It was the best we did anywhere in third quarter. It was low single digit, but it was the best anywhere in the quarter in the world. If you look at Americas for the year, year-to-date, we're down 9.5% in orders. But if you eliminate that large infrastructure job we won in Canada in the first quarter of \u201823, we have shown nice sequential growth quarter after quarter, and we're really seeing more new equipment market stability. And again, we get this from our sales teams. As they're talking to customers, the sentiment has gotten a lot better after the Fed changed the rates. We've got a really strong backlog in the Americas, a good 18-month plus line of sight to perform, even though our backlog's down, because our sales have been up significantly. Our new equipment sales in the Americas came in 6% for the quarter. It was hotter than the prior low single-digit and mid-single digit for the full year. We expect the fourth quarter to be mid-single digit as well. Service sales in the America portfolios up low single digit. Repairs were great in the third quarter, about 10%. They're there year-to-date, and we anticipate that continuing into the fourth quarter. Mod orders for the Americas were up mid-single digit, both in the quarter and year-to-date. We expect that to continue. And Mod sales were up low teams for the quarter, and year-to-date, they're up high single digit. So we believe the Americas market itself has stabilized, and our performance is doing much better. And when we look at -- this is a little different commentary than you heard last quarter. When we look at the different verticals, this quarter, we still had the best verticals were infrastructure and industrial buildings, but all of the verticals were up this quarter in North America, which to us is a real inflection point. If I go to EMEA, what we're seeing in the market itself is, it's challenging, but we're performing very well. Middle East is doing very well. South Europe is strong. North Europe's a little weaker. Spain and Africa are doing very well. And even Central Europe for us this quarter did very well, despite the market uncertainty and environment in Germany. We're seeing pressure in France, but our backlog in EMEA is solid. New equipment year-to-date is up 8%. So even though the quarter was down in orders, strong first half by EMEA, the team is performing very well. Our 12-month roll in EMEA orders is up 7.8%, and I really believe we're outperforming the market there. Our backlog is up over last year in EMEA, and our Gen3 60 product is rolling out very well. So a little different commentary this quarter, inflection we were seeing in the Americas, and I think we're outperforming in EMEA in a challenging environment. You will definitely hear more about costs coming out in China, and this is for two reasons. One, we would do this based on the market, but second, with our Uplift program, we're changing the way we work to be more customer-centric, to have common processes everywhere, to have the ability to actually continue to drive significant growth. But in China, we're looking at everything from our operational footprint. We have moved our modernization into our new equipment factories, so any facilities that used to do modernization don't do that anymore, and we're obviously looking at our workforce. I have to give Sally and the team incredible credit for operating under some pretty tough economic times right now. As I said, I think in my first answer, we're trying to balance rational volume with pricing and with our customers' abilities to pay. That's what's really driving our cash guide coming down. We're not going to take business just for the sake of volume to fill factories or to keep the field gainfully employed. We're taking what we believe is smart business that will put us in a strong position to continue to grow our service business in China and get ready for that nascent mod business to really take off. When I think about mod and new equipment, I can't tell you where that crossover is going to happen yet, but when you think about the price of a unit in mod is about the same as the price of a unit in new equipment everywhere in the globe, including China, where our mod margins are highest. And so as that picks up, right now we have 415,000 units in the new equipment segment this year in China. As that mod market picks up, we will hit 415,000 units sometime this decade, just as the mod segment. I can't peg when that's going to be, but we're actually going to have a larger market to serve in China and around the world than we have today. Yes, thanks, Chris. Listen, we are encouraged by what's been announced to date. The key is going to be the implementation methods, the regulations. We're in a regulated environment and how the local governments use the potential liquidity, debt relief, all of that. The announcements that were made are positive. To us, it's now the how. We believe the first indication of this and we talk, yes, we've talked to the party secretaries because we're focused on economic development. We want to grow in China and we will grow in China despite this $0.5 billion of revenue. You will watch our service and our mod business continue to grow and we'll stabilize this new equipment business. Our early look is with the stimulus, with the aging population, we think this is going to actually accelerate modernization more. It's going to allow with the 5,100 white projects for projects to get finished which will give us more confidence in liquidity with some of our customers as well and our key accounts. But the first time I think we're going to know more, Chris, is there's a special meeting in the National People's Congress, the most senior members next week, within a readout next Friday, November 8. So we'll see what happens there. I will be on the ground in China in November. I think it's important to be able to talk to our customers, to be able to talk to our colleagues and thank them for their dedication under this stressful time. And they are delivering. When you think about the decline we've had in the topline, and yet our focus on continuing to deliver for our customers and grow our service business. So I think we'll all know more. We do not anticipate that impacting fourth quarter financials, even if rules come out. If it does, I'll be happy to share that with you in our fourth quarter earnings. We see this more as a potential for \u201825. But in all the color Cristina and I have given you today, because we're not going to guide for \u201825 yet, we have not anticipated any positive impact of the stimulus on China. So when we say down five to 10 next year for China new equipment at the segment level for units available in the market, that does not anticipate any stimulus. Same with the modernization market. There's 10 million units available for service. We added mid to, our service growth this quarter was high teens. So now in China we're up to 425,000 units in our service portfolio. That's still 4% share. We got plenty more we can recapture, plenty more to convert. So we are hopeful, but we need to understand the implementation rules. And most importantly, our customers and the local governments need to do that. There were certainly some comps. I want to be clear about that. But we are seeing between proposal activity, and we had a lot, and you know, Chris, we get a down payment when we sign an order everywhere in the world, but especially in the Americas, and it's not something that is really negotiable or that we give back if a project gets canceled. So our customers have to have that conviction that their project's going to go. And we had a lot that were just really close, but waiting, I think waiting to hear what the Fed was doing, waiting to see what the economy was doing. But as I said, for all the segments, we're talking commercial, office, residential, infrastructure, and industrial to have turned positive in the market in the third quarter. It's more than comps. Our team's performing, and you can expect that kind of positive performance, regardless of comps, fourth quarter and into next year. And Patrick from a capital allocation perspective, if you think about it, we're going to do a $1 billion of share buybacks and $600 million roughly of dividend versus this $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, we have the ability to do that because teams done a great job bringing our cash balance down probably since the first time significantly since spin from a $1 billion to almost $800 million. So we are working every element of this to be able to share to obviously share this cash back with our shareholders. At least a 100%. We will guide in January. Thank you, Christa. Our solid results in the first nine months of the year demonstrate the resiliency of our service driven business model. We remain focused on mitigating macro headwinds and further driving shareholder value in order to deliver a strong final quarter and beyond. Our growth in modernization, maintenance, and repair, and the overall service portfolio validates that our flywheel continues to fuel profitable growth. As I close the call, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Mike for his many contributions to Otis and wish him success in his new role. Stay safe and well, everyone. Thank you for joining."

            "content": "Thank you, Judy. Starting with Q3 segment sales performance on slide 6, total organic sales growth of 1.2% in the quarter was driven by Service, which was up 7.7%. New Equipment organic sales were down 8.2%, driven by a greater than 20% decline in China as market conditions remain weak, excluding China, New Equipment sales increased low single digits. The decline in China was partially upset by low single digit growth in APAC, driven by a strength in Japan and Taiwan, as well as low single digit growth in the Americas. EMEA was roughly flat, as a strength in Southern Europe was upset by Western and Central Europe. New Equipment pricing was up low single digits in all regions outside of China. Similar to last quarter, China continues to be under severe price pressure, with continuous declines of approximately 10% year-over-year, although pricing was relatively flat sequentially. Service sales were $2.2 billion, with organic sales growth of 7.7%, as we delivered on our expected acceleration from the mid-single digit growth in the first two quarters of the year. We grew in all regions and in all lines of business. Maintenance and Repair increased over 6% in the quarter, supported by continued strong portfolio growth, maintenance pricing up around four points, excluding the impact of mix and churn, and a ramp up in repair volumes. Modernization organic sales accelerated in the quarter, up about 14% bringing year-to-date organic sales to approximately 10% with excellent growth in Asia-Pacific which was up 20% including contributions widely across geographies. Turning to Q3 segment operating profit performance on slide 7. New Equipment operating profit of $84 million was down $20 million at constant currency as tailwind from pricing that continues to flow from the backlog productivity including the benefits of Uplift and lower commodity costs were more than offset by the impacts of lower volume and regional and product mixed headwinds. Operating profit margins came in at 6.4%. Year-to-date, New Equipment sales are down over $250 million and operating profit has declined by $20 million at constant currency versus the prior year. In China, New Equipment has been a revenue headwind for approximately $400 million. That would imply a profit headwind of about $100 million, which we have largely mitigated through solid productivity and the benefit of commodity and pricing tailwinds. Service operating profit of $555 million increased $40 million at constant currency. As dropped through on higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity, including benefits from Uplift, more than offset annual wage inflation. As a result, operating profit margins remained strong at 24.8%, even while facing a difficult prior year compare, where margins expanded 90 basis points in the third quarter of 2023. Year-to-date, operating profit margins have expanded 60 basis points to 24.6%. With the benefit of our various Uplift initiatives, we dropped year-to-date adjusted SG&A, lower by $18 million, while improving as a percentage of sales by 10 basis points year-over-year. On a slight organic sales growth, these cost initiatives are helping to mitigate labor inflation headwinds. Supported by a sustained strong performance in the Service segment, we achieved total operating profit margins of 16.9% in the quarter. Adjusted EPS grew 1% or $0.01 in the third quarter, with our operational performance and a lower share count contributing positively. Moving to cash, we generated $381 million of adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter and we saw sequential improvement in cash from operations within the quarter. We continue to work to drive cash flow into yearend despite the various macro and mixed challenges that we are facing across our business, most notably in China due to the lower New Equipment orders. Overall, year-to-date, we grew organic sales 1.2% with mid-single digit or greater growth in all regions outside of China. With Service as the driver, we have delivered 60 basis points of margin expansion, 8.2% adjusted EPS growth while returning $800 million to shareholders through shared buybacks. We move into the final quarter of the year with continued focus on operational experience across the business while working to offset the macro headwinds we are facing. Let me now turn it back to Judy to discuss our 2024 outlook. Thank you, Judy. Taking a more detailed look at our outlook and starting with sales on slide 9. Total organic sales are expected to be up approximately 1.5% driven by solid performance in our Service segment. We expect New Equipment organic sales to be down mid to high single digits driven by a decline in China due to the challenging market conditions that Judy mentioned earlier. Total Asia is expected to be down high teens in 2024 with a strong high single digit growth in Asia Pacific, more than offset by severe declines in China. Our outlook for the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific are unchanged from the prior guidance. Overall, the New Equipment segment has performed weaker than we expected this year, driven by the market situation in China. However, the rest of the world has performed better than we projected at the start of the year and we anticipate the combined growth of Americas, EMEA, and APAC to be mid-single digit up for 2024. Our Service segment continues to perform quite well and has been largely in line with our expectations as we have gone through the year. In line with our prior guidance, we anticipate Service organic sales to grow a bit more than 6.5%. This includes Maintenance and Repair growth of approximately 6% and Modernization growth of at least 9% at or above the high end of our prior range. We anticipate continued modernization sales momentum in the fourth quarter due to the timing of project execution from the backlog. We expect this to be the third year in a row of Service organic sales growth of 6% or better, offsetting the severe headwinds we have faced in New Equipment over the past years, and demonstrating the power and resiliency of our business model. Turning to slide 10, at constant currency, operating profit is expected to grow approximately $140 million. In Service, performance this year has been excellent year-to-date, and we expect operating profit margin to expand approximately 75 basis points for the full year, driven by volume, productivity aided by Uplift, and continued solid pricing. For New Equipment, operating profit margins have now expected to contract 50 basis points versus the prior year. Tailwinds from productivity, including benefits from Uplift, commodities, and pricing from the backlog are being more than offset by volume and mixed headwinds emanating from lower China New Equipment sales as a result of continued market weakness. So the updated outlook assumes a similar fourth quarter organic growth rate in New Equipment to what we saw in the third quarter. And on constant current currency basis, we would anticipate a similar dollar declining New Equipment profit of around $20 million to $25 million with a slightly larger headwind at actual currency. We expect overall adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 70 basis points driven by Service performance. The update to our outlook is exclusively driven by the changing New Equipment sales driven by China volumes. And we are mitigating this headwind through Service volumes, productivity, and pricing. Turning to cash flow, we expect to achieve adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. The lower operating profit outlook, coupled with fewer down payments from China New Equipment order volumes, are impacting our expected cash flow for the year. We continue to focus on what we can control to improve working capital, and we expect strong free cash flow ramp up in Q4, similar to last year. Moving to the 2024 EPS bridge on slide 11. We expect to deliver adjusted EPS of approximately $3.85. This is $0.31 of EPS growth versus the prior year, or approximately 9%, largely driven by operational performance. At constant currency, we expect approximately $0.36 of operating profit growth outside of China, while we anticipate China to be a headwind of about $0.10 to $0.15 for the year. Reductions in the effective tax rate and a lower share count are anticipated to offset headwinds from higher interest expense and foreign exchange. Minority interest expense naturally moves lower due to the weaker China performance. Let me now give you some additional commentary on two areas. First, China, and second, how we see 2025 shaping up at this point. On China, although we have largely been able to mitigate the significant China impact on adjusted EPS year-to-date, in our EPS bridge, we have included a small range of China outcomes to give some additional color due to the continued uncertainty in the market. As we exited Q3, the New Equipment backlog in China is down mid-teens, and the book and ship business remain under pressure. While math has been set on the policy front in terms of possible stimulus in the region, and we remain optimistic for a policy follow-through, as we see it here today, unless the region begins to accelerate into yearend, we could see it being upwards of a $0.05 additional headwind to EPS. Lower China volumes and the mixed impacts naturally puts pressure on the exit run rate margin for New Equipment into 2025. Now, let me talk a bit about 2025, starting with Service. We expect the Service business to continue performing well next year, with mid-single digit or better topline growth and continued margin expansion. While we expect to achieve approximately 75 basis points of margin expansion this year, we said at our Investor Day in February that the Service business over the medium term would achieve 50 basis points or slightly more of margin expansion annually. So as you think about the two years combined, we would expect to be somewhere between 100 and 125 basis points of margin expansion within the Service segment. On New Equipment , as in the past few years, excluding China, we feel good about the rest of the world combined, growing low single digits or better in 2025. While there are still a few months to go, which will determine exactly the orders in Q4 and our ending backlog heading into 2025, if we assume that the backlog ends this year, down low single digits, that would be a fairly good starting guidepost for New Equipment top line in 2025. As Judy mentioned earlier, China remains uncertain for the New Equipment segment for both sales and profit. As without policy change and a stimulus action, we would expect our second half margin rate in New Equipment to persist throughout 2025. The margin rate within New Equipment is being impacted by the meaningful shift in regional mix, with more than 75% of the New Equipment revenue now being driven by sales outside of China. We will continue to work to offset the headwinds that this poses through productivity, while continuing to drive the UpLift program and right sizing our cost, to align with the current market conditions. In closing, our results from the first nine months demonstrate our ability to deliver on our service-driven business model. We continue to focus on what we can control, including growing our portfolio, executing on our expanding modernization backlog, and continuing to drive productivity throughout the organization, including UpLift initiatives. We continue to drive results through the remaining of the year to set us up well to perform in 2025. With that, Christa, please open the line for questions. Thank you. Hi, Nigel. This is Cristina. So on Service margins, they are coming broadly in line with expectations. And in fact, when you see sequentially, they are going up. It was 24.7% in Q2, 24.8% in Q4. And this is thanks to the flow through of good volumes. And you have seen that there was a good ramp up of Service's in the quarter, coming mainly from the timing of repair and modernization. And we also have a very good performance in price. Price was up in the quarter, approximately four points, including the impact of mix and churn. And we also have productivity and Uplift measure, and all of this is compensating wage inflation that is rolling line with expectation. So I would say very steady state performance in Service, in line with expectations, and this can be even an opportunity for Q4, as we see modernization is ramping up very nicely. Hi Julian, this is Cristina and it's a very good analysis. So as you have said, year-to-date, we have grown operating profit at constant currency of about $96 million, which means margin expansion of $60 million. And when you look into Q4, we expect Service to continue performing very strong, topline to continue growing on the back of good ramp up of repair and modernization. And a good flow through of operating profit with additional margin expansion. Margin is expected in Service to be above 25% in Q4. But it's not driven by seasonality, it's just driven by the performance of execution, ramping up the topline and continually working on productivity. On the other side, on New Equipment , we expect Q4 to be more or less at the same level of topline decline as in Q3, approximately minus 8%. And that means a flow through into operating profit with operating profit margin below 5% because we have the volume and the mix effect. And additionally, we see price and commodities gradually fading out in Q4. But overall, we compensate the declining New Equipment with a very strong performance in Service in order to deliver, as you rightly said, approximately $40 million - $50 million operating profit growth in the quarter. Yes, no, thank you, Judy. And let me comment, Julian, on the profit side, and you had a very good analysis. So as you did recapping the topline, we expect next year low single digit up, that is sequentially slightly better because of less decline or lower declining new equipment. But now on the margin side, Service will continue with margin expansion you recall that we said back in February in our Investor Day that Service was going to grow 50 basis point of annual margin expansion, this year we have overdriven, we are 75 basis point but when you put together \u201824 and '25, we expect margin expansion of around 100 - 125 points in service. On the other side, new equipment, as you rightly said we have the effect of volumes are mixed but additionally as I mentioned before next year the commodities and price tailwinds that we have benefited this year are going to gradually fade out. So all of these together would mean that the second half of the year [inaudible] rate is going to persist in 2025 and it would mean approximately 50 to 100 basis point of margin decline, but when you put everything together, we have a stronger service segment, a weaker new equipment but overall operating profit is expected to grow mid-single digit next year. Hi, Pat, this is Cristina. And so yes, you are right, the production of the guide to $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion is related to the down payments and the new equipment order situation in China. But overall, when you see our cash flow performance year-to-date, we have generated an adjusted net income of $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion, and $900 million year-to-date cash flow. That means that year-to-date we have built up approximately $250 million working capital. And there are two reasons for that. One is the business mix. On the one side, new equipment declining, especially because of China, and we don't get the down payments. But on the other side, we are growing in service. And the collection time in service is later because we collect when we execute the job, for example on repair. We also have some payables impact because of the ramp up of modernization because of payments to suppliers while we execute the projects but we expect these business mix to stabilize now in Q4 will start collecting the good ramp up of topline in Q3 now in Q4 and overall the $200 million working capital is going to be unwound. So the expectation in the guide is to deliver in Q4 approximately $550 million cash flow that is more less the same level of cash flow we delivered last year in Q3. And then to your question in to 2025, yes, you are right, we should expect that as we stabilize the business mix cash flows to pick up at a faster pay than operating profit flows. Yes, at the end, we are not guiding now is we are just providing some color of the trends and the 50 basis points is what we committed back in the Investors Day and this is going to come and of course on top of that we continue working on the same actions we have implemented this year in terms of price, productivity and Uplift. And we will target to overdrive, but for the time being it is what we can mention. Yes, you'll see that in January, yes."

Presentation materials are available for download from Otis' website at www.otis.com. I'll now turn it over to Michael Rednor, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMichael Rednor: Thank you, Sarah. Welcome to Otis' second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Judy Marks, Anurag Maheshwari, and Cristina Mendez. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and significant non-recurring items. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis' SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy.\nJudith Marks: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, afternoon and evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope all are safe and well. I'd like to welcome Cristina Mendez, who is joining us this morning on our earnings call. Cristina is an experienced executive, who's been leading our finance team as CFO in the EMEA region for the past 2.5 years, while also leading our global finance transformation under our uplift program. I look forward to my partnership with Cristina to drive growth, operational execution and value for our customers, colleagues and shareholders. I want to also take this opportunity to thank Anurag for his leadership and for all his contributions to our company, our services growth and in championing our long-term strategy. Now for earnings, starting with Q2 highlights on Slide 3. Otis delivered a solid second quarter in the face of current economic challenges within China as the Service segment continued to drive strong performance. Service organic sales grew mid-single digits. Overall adjusted profit margin expanded by 110 basis points, and adjusted EPS grew 15%, marking our fourth consecutive quarter of 10% or greater adjusted EPS growth. With Service as our primary growth driver, we have set ourselves up well for the future by delivering maintenance portfolio growth of 4.2%, and building our modernization backlog by 17% in the quarter. As a result of our steady business execution and capital allocation strategies, we generated $353 million in adjusted free cash flow and returned $300 million to shareholders through share repurchases in the quarter, taking year-to-date repurchases to $600 million. In June, we published our 2023 ESG report, outlining our progress towards our 13 ESG goals, explaining how this progress advances our business strategy while driving value for stakeholders. Importantly, this report includes a detailed description of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. And we've continued to make progress towards our goals in 2024, including recently receiving ISO 45001 certification, the international standard that specifies the requirements and good practices for effective occupational health and safety management systems at our factory in Sao Bernardo, Brazil. Moving to our orders performance on Slide 4. New Equipment orders were down 11% in the second quarter. High-single digit growth in EMEA, driven by mid-teens growth in the Middle East and low to mid-single digit growth in Asia-Pacific was more than offset by a mid-teens decline in the Americas and a double-digit decline in China. Our New Equipment backlog at constant currency was down 3% versus the prior year. In the Americas, we are seeing the impact of elevated interest rates on our new equipment orders. In China, economic softness severely impacted our new equipment orders while orders grew in both Asia-Pacific due to continued strength in the region, and EMEA as our investment in product and coverage continues to perform well. In our Services segment, progress continued to pace with portfolio growth above 4% for the seventh consecutive quarter, along with 14% modernization orders growth and continued growth in our modernization backlog, which increased 17% at constant currency. We had several exciting customer highlights in the second quarter, thanks to the dedication of our colleagues across all of our regions. In India, at the heart of the city of Delhi, Otis will install 12 SkyRise units at the iconic Unity The Amaryllis Versace. Designed by Versace Home, this luxury development is one of the tallest residential buildings in Delhi. We continue to perform well in the Infrastructure segment as evidenced by our next three major project highlights. In the United States, Otis is supporting the expansion of Terminal 3 West at San Francisco International Airport. As part of this project, Otis will install 15 new Gen 3 elevators and 13 Link escalators while modernizing two elevators. SFO served more than 50 million passengers in 2023 and these upgrades will increase overall passenger capacity and international access. In Germany, we are installing eight escalators for our long established customer, the City of Stuttgart will dismantle the non-Otis escalators that are currently in use and install our heavy traffic public escalators at four metro stations in the city center. In China, we've continued our more than 30-year relationship with the Shanghai Metro, booking several contracts in the quarter that total more than 475 units, including 311 escalators and moving walks for Line 23; 32 elevators and 115 escalators for the new Chongqing Line and 19 elevators for an extension of Line 12. Turning to Q2 results on Slide 5. Otis delivered net sales of $3.6 billion with organic sales down 1%. Adjusted operating profit -- excluding a $15 million foreign exchange headwind was up $38 million, driven by the Service segment. Adjusted EPS grew approximately 15% or $0.14 in the quarter driven by strong operational performance and improvement in our tax rate, benefits from minority interest and a lower share count offset headwinds from foreign exchange translation and an increase in interest expense. With that, I'll turn it over to Anurag to walk through our results in more detail.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Thank you, Judy. Starting with Q2 segment sales performance on Slide 6. Total organic sales were down 1% in the quarter, driven by new equipment, which was down 9% compared to the prior year. APAC grew approximately 10%, driven by strong performances in Southeast Asia and India, while the Americas grew low-single digits. EMEA experienced a low-single digit decline due to continued weakness in Central Europe, while China declined double-digits, largely due to the deterioration in market conditions. New Equipment pricing was strong outside of China, up low to mid-single digits. China remains under intense price pressure. And although pricing in China was down year-over-year, it came in approximately flat sequentially, while the cost environment remains deflationary. Service sales were $2.2 billion with organic sales growth of 5.1%, marking over three years of mid-single digit or greater growth in every quarter. We grew in all regions and all lines of business, including approximately 5% in maintenance and repair as a result of strong portfolio growth, solid repair volumes and maintenance pricing, which was up 3.5 points excluding the impact of mix and churn. Driven by continued double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific, MOD organic sales increased about 6% in the quarter and 8% in the first half. Turning to Q2 segment operating performance on Slide 7. New Equipment operating profit of $110 million was down $6 million at constant currency, mainly due to the impacts of lower volume and mix headwinds. Pricing outside of China, productivity, including benefits from uplift and commodity tailwinds largely offset the volume and mix impacts netting to improved margins of 30 basis points to 7.7%, ahead of our expectation. Service operating profit of $538 million increased $51 million at constant currency as drop through on higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity, including benefits from uplift more than offset annual wage inflation. This led to margin expansion of 110 basis points in the quarter. Our focus on cost control, alongside the ramp of uplift initiatives drove lower SG&A absolute dollars, while improving our adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales by 30 basis points year-over-year. For the first half, despite an inflationary environment, our SG&A dollars reduced by approximately $30 million and improved by 30 basis points as a percent of sales. We are very pleased with our progress and uplift across the three levers we've outlined with benefits ramping quicker than anticipated. Our streamlined functional structure is yielding productivity benefits while allowing us to leverage our global scale to drive cost savings, especially with our digital technology operations and other indirect spend. With solid Service performance and while navigating a challenging New Equipment environment, we expanded overall operating profit margins by 110 basis points and grew adjusted EPS $0.14 or 15%. Shifting to cash. Despite lower New Equipment orders, we generated $353 million of free cash flow in the second quarter and we expect to largely reverse the working capital build by year end. Overall, we had a very strong first half performance overcoming weakness in the China market. We grew organic sales 1.2%, led by performance in the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, which were up mid-single digits as well as strength in our Service segment. This growth in conjunction with good traction on uplift, productivity, pricing and commodity tailwinds helped us expand margins by 100 basis points and grow EPS 13% positioning us well for the second half. Let me now turn it back to Judy to discuss our 2024 outlook.\nJudith Marks: Now on Slide 8. Before turning to our updated 2024 financial outlook, let me briefly update you on our industry outlook. For the New Equipment market, our expectations for the Americas and EMEA remain unchanged, down low-single digit in units. We now expect Asia to be down high-single digits in units versus the prior outlook of down mid-single digits, driven by weakness in China. There is no change to our outlook for Asia Pacific as the region has continued to perform well. We're revising China to be down 10% to down 15% as activity is weaker than we previously expected. While New Equipment markets remain under pressure, we continue to see strength in the service market, with low single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA, and mid-single digit growth in Asia. The global installed base is expected to grow mid-single digits in 2024, adding roughly 1 million units from units that were installed within the last two years and are now rolling off the warranty period. Turning to Otis' 2024 financial outlook. We now expect sales in the range of $14.3 billion to $14.5 billion, with organic sales growth of 1% to 3%. While we see continued strength in the Service business for the remainder of the year, this decrease in organic sales versus our prior outlook is driven by New Equipment, which Anurag will discuss in a moment. Adjusted operating profit is in line with prior expectations still expected to be up $135 million to $175 million at actual currency and up $160 million to $190 million at constant currency. Adjusted EPS is now expected in the range of $3.85 to $3.90, up 9% to 10%, with $0.02 improvement versus the low end of the prior guide, driven by strong operational performance and the benefit from a lower share count. We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to come within a range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. Before handing it back to Anurag to outline the 2024 segment outlook in more detail, let me turn to Slide 9 to provide an update on Project Uplift and our progress to-date. We now anticipate run rate savings of $175 million by mid-2025, as we have made solid progress executing on the program. Two areas where we're seeing additional benefit versus our prior expectations are through further streamlining of our global operating model, and incremental optimization of indirect spend in areas such as digital technology and infrastructure. As we exit 2024, our anticipated in-year savings are now slated to be approximately $60 million with a 2024 exit run rate of approximately $100 million. Overall, program is on track, we're performing well versus our internal benchmarks and time line, and we look forward to sharing additional updates with you in the coming quarters. Anurag, over to you.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Thank you, Judy. Taking a more detailed look at our outlook and starting with sales on Slide 10. We now expect total organic sales to be up 1% to 3%. Overall, New Equipment organic sales are now expected to be down mid-single digits from market driven decline in China, which we now expect to be down approximately 20%. The outlook for the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific remains unchanged, up mid-single digits combined. Service organic sales are anticipated to grow 6% to 7%, in line with prior guidance. This includes maintenance and repair within a range of 5.5% to 6.5% and for modernization, we anticipate growth of 8% to 9% and solid orders momentum and an expanding backlog provide good line of sight to achieve approximately 10% growth in the second half. Turning to Slide 11. At constant currency, operating profit should grow $160 million to $190 million, unchanged versus prior expectations with improving contributions from service and productivity, including Uplift offsetting New Equipment volume and mix headwinds. In Service, we now expect operating profit margin to expand approximately 75 basis points, an increase of 25 basis point versus the prior guide, driven by solid volumes and even better productivity. For New Equipment, despite the weakness in China, operating profit margin is expected to be roughly flat versus the prior year, a change versus our prior estimate of flat to up 10 basis points. Productivity and pricing are offsetting the added volume and mix impact from a weaker China outlook. We now expect overall adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 80 basis points as a result of Service volume, productivity and pricing tailwinds. This represents a 30 basis point improvement versus our prior outlook. Turning to cash flow. We expect to achieve adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, with net income growth, partially offset by changes in working capital. Moving to the 2024 EPS bridge on Slide 12. We have raised the low end of our outlook for adjusted EPS by $0.02 to a range of $3.85 to $3.90. At the midpoint, this is $0.34 of EPS growth versus the prior year, driven by operational performance. At constant currency, we expect approximately $0.32 of operating profit growth, level loaded between the first and the second half. Reductions in the effective tax rate and the lower share count more than offset headwinds from higher interest expense and ForEx. In closing, first half results demonstrate our ability to continue performing despite macro headwinds. There is a lot in our control in the second half, and we are focused on growing our portfolio, leveraging our expanding MOD backlog while ramping on the Uplift program and driving productivity throughout the organization. This sets us up well to achieve our full year outlook of approximately 10% EPS growth in line with our medium term guide. With that, Sarah, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, Judy, Anurag and Cristina.\nJudith Marks: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeffrey Sprague: Good morning. I guess, first Anurag, we're going to miss you, but I'm guessing we're not really going to miss you, but do you have anything to say about what your plans are?\nAnurag Maheshwari: There is more to come here. We\u2019re focused on closing the earnings call right now and a smooth transition with Cristina. Thanks for the question, Jeff.\nJeffrey Sprague: Awesome. Judy, can we drill a little bit more just into China? Obviously, it's kind of readily apparent, things are just challenging there from a macro standpoint. But I think you noted Service was growing mid-single digit in Asia. I don't know if you said China, if you did, I missed it. So maybe just give us a little bit more color on sort of the counter actions you're taking there to kind of support and drive profitability in country?\nJudith Marks: Yeah. Thanks, Jeff, and great to be with you this morning. Our Service business in China, specifically, units are up high-teens for another quarter. MOD orders are up high-single digit. MOD sales are up double-digit. And we're really pleased with the pivot we've made. And now this is now a multiyear strategy we've been implementing to have a greater focus and yield in China on Service. Almost a third of our revenue now in China is in Service, and that's twice what it was when we spun. Our portfolio has more than doubled and is up again this quarter, as I said, high-teens. So our service strategy is coming up nicely, and we're seeing the acceleration of MOD in China and anticipate that to continue to move double-digit as we look out into the medium term for China. The New Equipment market does remain weak. We called it down 15% for the second quarter after being down 10% in the first quarter. But with what we know on the ground from Sally and the team for the full year, we're saying it's going to be down 10% to 15%. Our team has done a really nice job in being able to manage the cost side in a very competitive market, but that market this year, we're saying for China is going to be between 425,000 and 450,000 units. Again, focused on growing Service, continuing to drive out cost in a deflationary environment, but always balancing price and volume so that we make sure that our backlog remains healthy in China. 425,000 to 450,000 units is still a very nicely sized market, but this is the third year of decreases. And I think our strategy and implementation has pivoted to service to be able to reflect that. It's why we took our guide down in terms of top line revenue now to be organic, 1% to 3%, that is all driven by this New Equipment decline there. But as you could see with our profitability this quarter for the first half, even our profit margin expansion in New Equipment, despite being down several hundred million dollars of revenue, you're seeing the resilience in not just our service driven model, but I think you're seeing again, sustained quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year performance in those items that we control.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great. Thank you for all that color. Appreciate it. I\u2019ll pass the baton.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, and Anurag, you'll be missed. But again, I'm pretty sure you're going to pop up somewhere soon. Cristina, congratulations on the promotion. So just want to pick up on the baton on the China question. I'm just wondering, is there any change in your strategy, which has been clearly focused on gaining share? And is there now more of a focus on preserving margin there? And I'm just curious on the NCI kind of expense being flat at $100 million, that seems to indicate that China EBIT is actually hold up rather well. So just curious, if there's a change in strategy and that comment on margins?\nJudith Marks: Yeah. Let me take the first one, and I'll turn it over to Anurag, although, we're kind of fighting over the second one because we both want to answer it. So Nigel, it's no change in strategy. What you're probably not seeing behind the scenes is, how our team has, again, continued to pivot. We continue to do product introductions and we continue to drive delivery in terms of our orders through our agents and distributors. Our agents and distributors, again, think about 2,400 of them. A lot of them have also taken on modernization as well. So we've expanded their remit, so that we continue to prepare for the future, which is going to be a more MOD heavy future regardless of what happens structurally on the new equipment side. So the strategies, it's on track. We know what we're doing there. We talk about -- we've had significant China share gains since spin, but we're not going to take on loss making units for the sake of share gain, and that's something I've been telling you now quarter-after-quarter and we're going to be consistent with that methodology versus giving up price and then having that negative piece in the backlog. We just don't think that's -- we don't need that for our business, and we don't think it's wise. But Anurag let me -- let you touch on the second half.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yeah. Thanks, Judy. So Nigel, if you look at the new equipment market in China, it is clearly challenging. And the revenue in the second quarter was down as well double-digit, as we said. Okay. The reason you don't see on the NCI line is because we're able to manage the volume headwind through productivity through growing our Service business. And it's not only all across all the other regions, it's also in China as well. So we do what we can control. So from a margin perspective and a profit perspective, we've been able to preserve it.\nJudith Marks: Yeah. The last thing I'll add on NCI is our Middle East business has picked up at a very good pace. It's one of several highlights for EMEA, and you see EMEA orders are up, EMEA is strong in revenue, and EMEA is a large modernization opportunity for us, including the Middle East. Outside of China, the majority of our remaining NCI is in the Middle East, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That's great. Thanks. That's great color. And then one quick one for Anurag. I want to make sure that he works before he leaves. So the free cash flow clipped down to 1.5, 1.6. (ph) Is that a function really of the new equipment weakness we're seeing, and therefore, we've seen kind of a headwind on advance payable -- advanced deposits from customers. Is that really what's happening here? Was there something else we need to consider?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yeah. Thanks. I think you got it pretty much, but let me give a little bit more color, right? In the first half, we built about $300 million of working capital and primarily due to two reasons. The first reason what you mentioned, New Equipment orders, we typically receive down payments and that auto environment has obviously been challenging for the first half. The second, which I think is the largest driver is that the Service business grew faster than the New Equipment business, and we tend to be cash ahead of New Equipment while we collect in Service after we perform the work. These two other drivers, which got us to build $300 million of working capital. So for the back half of the year, we expect to generate about $825 (ph) million in GAAP net income. And if we reverse about $200 million or more in working capital, that will get us closer to the $1.6 billion. We, of course, will look to do better like the same way as we did in the second half of last year and especially on receivables and in the New Equipment orders do a little bit better than expected then this could be a source of upside, and we could get us to about $1.6 billion of free cash.\nNigel Coe: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning and congratulations to Anurag and Cristina. Maybe just my first question is really on that New Equipment organic sales outlook sort of globally and then more with a focus on the Americas, I suppose, not so much to China. So the backlog, I think, was down 3% year-on-year in June, your sales are down, I think, in the back half in New Equipment, mid-single digits. But I wondered kind of how much of a lead time now we're getting from that backlog into your revenues for 2025? If I look at the Americas, for example, your TTM (ph) orders were down mid-teens in New Equipment, but you're still guiding revenue this year up mid-single. So in something like the Americas, does the confluence of those two things mean 25 sales in New Equipment are almost certainly down a reasonable amount. And then, any sort of broader global color on that?\nJudith Marks: Sure, Julian. I think it's a great question and very, very -- it's the right analysis. Let me first give you an overview of New Equipment backlog around the globe, and then let me specifically dive into the Americas. We were down 3% and our 12 month rolling New Equipment orders are obviously down 7.7%. The Americas backlog though is up low-single digit. EMEA is up low-single digit. Asia-Pac is up mid-teens and China is down, obviously, which is driving Asia down for the broader picture. Our New Equipment outlook right now is to exit 2024 at the company level, flattish to slightly down as we expect backlog could fall in the second half, but it's really going to get defined by the New Equipment second half orders. And our line of sight to second half orders looks strong, especially in the Americas and some other regions. And let me just tell you, we have about an 18 month line of sight to the Americas, the majority of it being North America in terms of performing our backlog. And as I said, the Americas backlog is up low-single digit. The New Equipment sales in the Americas came in as expected in the second quarter low-single digit year-on-year comps as well as major projects. We anticipate that picking up in the second half. We also anticipate the New Equipment orders in the second half for the Americas to be positive. We can see that based on proposal activity. We can see that based on awards we have that haven't yet been booked and we believe you'll see that starting to come through in the third quarter.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just maybe a more sort of near-term fiddly question, just maybe for Anurag, as we think about that second half outlook, do we just assume kind of sequentially EPS is down both quarters, Q3 and Q4 to a similar degree. Any sort of color on that second half intra-quarter split?\nAnurag Maheshwari: So I'll just start off with the first half, second half, and Cristina can give more color on Q3 as well. So we've done about $1.94 of EPS in the first half and a midpoint of the guidance $3.88, so which implies another $1.94 in the second half, right? So from an operational perspective, it's equal between the first half and the second half. Cristina, give a little bit more color on Q3.\nCristina Mendez: Yeah. Thank you, Anurag. Happy to give you some color on the Q1. So with interest expenses at the current run rate and tax rate growing to 27% in Q3. We would expect roughly EPS flat in the quarter, that would mean that full year EPS will go up $0.34. That is the midpoint of the guide, and that means $0.12 (ph) up in the first half, probably flat in Q3 and just over a dime in Q4.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nJudith Marks: Yeah. And Julian, let me just correct myself quickly. The backlog total ex-China is up low-single digit, but the Americas backlog is down.\nJulian Mitchell: Got it. Thankyou.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, good morning.\nJudith Marks: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Again, Anurag, thanks for all the help, and congrats on all the promotions there to everybody. Just a question on China. What are you guys seeing price wise there and at what stage does that start to impact backlog margin? And then, is there any risk that market gets to the point where it starts impacting services growth is, you basically just your pipeline there of installs that then come off warranty a couple of years later start to be a headwind to services growth. I know it's still a small part of the global portion, but just those two questions, price and margins and then when it starts to impact services growth?\nJudith Marks: Yeah. Well, let me take price and when it impacts services, and I'll let Anurag comment on margins. It is a very competitive environment in China. Pricing is challenged and is down, I would say, roughly 10%. But the costs are coming down. So again, in a deflationary environment, whether it's commodities, whether it's the productivity that we're doing, we're pulling costs out, we've got tailwinds on commodities, and we're driving productivity. So we'll continue to monitor that, Steve. I think we are seeing -- we've been saying it's competitive there now for three years on pricing. I don't anticipate that changing, but our team continues to respond well on the cost side. In terms of how that converts, when you look at our service portfolio in China, again, we're now -- we said last quarter, we were over 400,000 units. We're now about 415,000 units, growing nicely. A lot of that's conversion and our conversion rates are doing well in China. We're pleased with that continuing to move up as we've set in our medium-term guide. But part of that's also recapturing and adding on non-Otis units. So at 425,000 units, we've got a little 4% market share. So there's ample opportunity for us to bring non-Otis units and Otis units that aren't under our portfolio back. So all those activities are going to happen simultaneously, and we believe we can continue mid-teens to high-teens growth in China portfolio for the medium-term. So I don't -- we don't believe that's going to roll into a service impact for us. Anurag?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yeah. Thanks. So as Judy mentioned, right, so one of the biggest drivers for us is going to be on the margin side, volume for sure on Service. If you look at the market over the past three years, it's been down. But the reason our portfolio grew is because of conversion rates improving. And there's still more to come on the conversion rates as it goes around. So I think we feel fairly confident on the volume growth over there. On the cost side, clearly, the earlier question that Nigel asked as well, the reason why the NCI was where it was is because of the how we able to maintain our profitability is looking at our cost base. One is we are fortunate in China to be in a deflationary economy in terms of supply chain, so that helps us. But also, we've looked at the footprint that we have, both in terms of the branches in terms of facilities, and we'll continue to take a look at it to kind of bring the cost down. So we feel a combination of volume and productivity. And on the cost side, will help us keep the margins or maybe expand the margins going forward.\nSteve Tusa: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJoseph O'Dea: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the Modernization backlog. And if you could talk about the pricing within that backlog and what kind of line of sight you have to continued margin expansion in MOD, any quantification of that that over the next few quarters?\nJudith Marks: Yeah, Joe. Listen, we added Modern -- delivering Modernization value as a fifth strategic imperative last year to really mobilize the company to industrialize how we're doing MOD and to take us from a position that you know where MOD margins were below new equipment to a place where not only would they meet new equipment margins but exceed them. We did that last quarter and first quarter. We've repeated that this quarter with our medium-term guide to get MOD margins up to at least double-digit and 10% as a starting point. We are on that trajectory. I'm pleased with that progress. The orders for MOD are continued to do well. Our company is responding very well. We're putting together the right kits to meet the customer needs as the demand signal is growing significantly. What we need to do is take those orders and that backlog, which is up 17%, and the orders were up 13.8% with growth in all regions. And we need to -- while we're continuing to grow orders, we need to grow our conversion to sales in Modernization. And we need to pick up that pace with installers. We need to pick up that pace with the kits now being supplied from our new industrialized processes. It's early days there, but you're going to continue to see that. So margins heading in the right direction on the trajectory we had shared, and we continue to see the MOD strategy is intact, and you're going to continue to see significant Modernization growth quarter-after-quarter, and I believe, year-after-year as we go through in the medium term and beyond.\nJoseph O'Dea: And then can you just talk to China kind of cycle perspective when you talk about a market 425,000, 450,000 units and down for a few years now. Just kind of any indications you see around where that can go? How you get comfortable with, at least at a volume level, market doesn't get much worse?\nJudith Marks: Yeah. So again, it's been three straight years. We peaked at about 650,000 units a year, and now we're guiding to 425,000 to 450,000 for this year, which is a pretty significant drop and yet if you look at our team's profitability across these three years and the return from our China team, I couldn't be more proud of how they've taken cost out, they're continuing to look at areas, uplift, structural facilities, branch structure, organization as Anurag alluded to. So we've dealt with that well while simultaneously growing our Service business. So you're going to see more and more service there over time. Listen, I can't and won't call a bottom. I don't know what that is. The Chinese government has put into play many simultaneous activities to try to stimulate both local government financing as recent as the third plenary as well as the PBOC reduced rates this week. There are multiple activities. To date, we have not seen that change consumer sentiment or the buying sentiment in properties yet. There is still a demand for hundreds of millions of Chinese residents to move from rural to urban. So we don't believe that will change, that's the plan and the path that the Chinese government has been on now for two decades, and we believe that's going to continue. And we think we've got the right strategy, and we've sized the business and moved more to Service and Modernization to be able to handle that. I will share, Joe, we -- earlier this week, we actually hosted Premier Li at one of our facilities in TEDA (ph) in the Tianjin region. It was a proud moment for us to host the Premier. And what we focused on, as you can imagine, was beyond all of the automation we have and how Otis has been a part of China will be celebrating 40 years there this fall. We did focus on urban renewal and modernization and our ability to continue to drive energy-efficient solutions, especially as China modernizes. 10 million units in the installed base in China that are now aging and it\u2019s going to create a significant modernization demand that we are preparing for, and I would tell you, we\u2019re ready for now.\nJoseph O'Dea: That\u2019s great color. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nJustin Pellegrino: Good morning, everybody. This is Justin Pellegrino on for Rob and congratulations to Cristina and Anurag again. Our question is kind of around MODs as well and there's been continued impressive growth. Can you just put that in context of sales effort? Is that more outreach? And I know, Judy, you touched on looking for better conversions? Is it more market awareness of the product? Can you just tell us what's kind of driving that impressive growth? Thanks.\nJudith Marks: Yeah. I mean one of the clear areas, Justin, is just literally aging equipment and obsolescence and demand. I mean, of the 20 million plus, 22 million units in the installed base, over 7 million are 20 plus years older and many of those 30 plus years older. The largest market for that right now is in EMEA, and we're excited with our offerings there. What makes us different now is, we're getting away from custom MOD and bespoke MOD and industrializing this. And when we introduced our Gen 3 product to the market a year or two ago, we did it with the vision that we would have that offering modular available across the globe, a connected offering that would not just fulfill New Equipment drives whether it\u2019s Gen 360 in EMEA and now China, but Gen 3 globally that we could then also package as a modernization opportunity. So as we brought out these products, the beauty of it is, as we\u2019re educating the New Equipment sales team, we\u2019re educating the MOD sales team. And as our installation crews from New Equipment are more familiar with Gen 3, now they\u2019re doing Gen 3 Mod. So we\u2019re attacking every part of this while attacking the cost side because now we\u2019re buying Gen 3 at scale from our sub-suppliers and the manufacturing elements we do ourselves, and all of it is coming together nicely, which is driving the margins. But from a sales standpoint, we\u2019ve simplified it. We have these relationships with customers. Think about our service portfolio at 2.3 million units, just on our portfolio. We have relationships with these service customers every day. Those are our MOD customers. And when we go on portfolio most of that work we can talk about. We can help them capital plan. We can create if there\u2019s obsolescence. We can be more \u2013 it can be more proactive than reactive and all of that is coming together at a time when the demand is growing. So we\u2019re ready for this. And I think you\u2019re seeing \u2013 I know you\u2019re seeing those results in MOD and you\u2019re going to continue to see them.\nJustin Pellegrino: Wonderful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Houston with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nNicholas Housden: Yeah. Hi, Judy, Anurag, Cristina. Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to ask about the maintenance and repair business, so the 4.9% organic growth, I mean, it's not a bad number overall, but it does look like the slowest growth in quite a few quarters. So I'm just wondering, if you can maybe provide some color about what's going on there and whether it's maybe some of the above trend growth that we've been seeing in the repair business coming off? Thanks.\nJudith Marks: Yeah. I think you somewhat answered it, Nick. We have been seeing double-digit repair business now for three years. Originally, it was the post-COVID snapback, but then we've just seen really healthy repair growth. We believe that growth is going to grow again in the second quarter -- second half of the year. So it's not lumpy, but on occasion, again, we've guided in the past that as maintenance grows, you should think of repair growth is one point higher than that. That would say as our portfolio grows 4% plus, repair should grow 5% plus. We've been exceeding 10% now for almost three years in repairs. So I think it's fair to think a little high-single digit more for the second half, and that's a fair expectation.\nNicholas Housden: Okay. Great.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yeah. The only thing I -- just one thing, if I could just add to that, is if you look at, it\u2019s a comp from last year, where the second quarter was the highest in terms of repair growth. Repair, as Judy has mentioned is still growing at very good high-single digit, if not double-digit in the back half of the year.\nNicholas Housden: Okay. Great. And then, Judy, I think you mentioned 10% lower prices in China, I'm guessing year-over-year. Is that a like-for-like comment or is that price and mix? Because I think the 10% number is similar to what one of the competitors called out recently.\nJudith Marks: Yeah. Its year-over-year and it's like-for-like.\nNicholas Housden: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nJack Ayers: Hi, guys. How is it going? This is Jack Ayers on for Gautam today. And Anurag and Cristina, yeah, congrats everyone on the transitions here. It's been a pleasure working with you, Anurag. So a quick question, just, Judy, if you can maybe square up on some of the new equipment order trends just by geography, totally understand China and America weakness. But looks pretty good in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, ex-China. So maybe if you can maybe just square us just the divergence there. And then back to the pricing comment. I guess is that 10% down like-for-like. Is that just kind of like organic pricing down? Are you seeing any poor actors maybe trying to gain share or maybe just hit on the ISPs, if that's kind of influencing pricing trends in China? Just any color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nJudith Marks: Yeah, Jack. On your second question, the ISPs don't play in the New Equipment pricing. So we're not seeing any one -- any of the other OEMs from what we can see in the market operating any differently than we've seen them operate in the past. Let me give you some color, though, on EMEA and APAC because they deserve that color. It's been really nice to see in a challenging EMEA market, we're performing really well in terms of orders. Obviously, watching interest rates and everything going on there. But for the quarter, our Central Europe business performed well. Our Southern Europe business performed well, and our Middle East business has performed very well. France and U.K. were a little weaker, but the backlog is solid -- and there -- you've now seen, whether it's 12 months, last quarter, this quarter, our EMEA team is doing a really nice job, again, in a challenging market when you think about other macro trends that we don't control. Our Asia-Pacific business in the second quarter, we saw some slowing in India, but that was because of the ongoing elections, that is going to pick up significantly for the second half of the year. Korea still some challenges. Taiwan, a little down, but our orders were up in Japan and Australasia and the backlog is up very healthy. So we expect Americas to snap back in third quarter and second half of the year in orders, we expect continued significant orders growth in Asia-Pacific. And our EMEA team, again, whether it's by our operating units, by our sales team, major projects, volume business, our Gen 360 products doing very well, and I'm really pleased on the infrastructure segments globally. You saw the three we called out, whether it's Shanghai Metro, Stuttgart or San Francisco, there are many more infrastructure jobs that we've been winning, and that gives us the opportunity, whether it's, again, low-rise, mid-rise, high-rise or escalators it's our full product line. And with those infrastructure jobs, we tend to get longer service commitments as well. So all of those trends, again, Americas will snap back. China will remain challenged and the other two businesses will continue to perform well as we see the second half of the year. And as I shared, I think it was one of the early questions, and maybe it was even Julian is, this is where we'll know how 25 looks. So we'll know based on backlog, how we look in '25 and '26 a little, as we exit \u201824 based on those orders in the backlog for the second half.\nJack Ayers: Okay. Great. Thanks, Judy. Appreciate it.\nJudith Marks: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Miguel Borrega with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\nMiguel Borrega: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. And the first one on New Equipments. Can you give us some kind of color on why the margin expanded despite revenues being down 9%. Is this purely on the back of a better mix with China down double-digits and Americas up or is there was something else within Q2 that lifted the margin? I would imagine China margin is not up. And you mentioned New Equipment pricing outside of China being up low to mid-single digits. Did that contribute to a higher New Equipment margin outside of China?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Thanks for the question. So firstly, just to ground everyone, China New Equipment is our largest margin region in Otis. So it's actually, when China volume goes down, it's a mixed headwind for us. It's not a mix tailwind for us, where team was able to offset the mix which is quite substantial for the quarter because if you look at a revenue down a couple of hundred million dollars and that to essentially in China on the New Equipment side, and that causes about a $40 million, $50 million headwind. We were able to offset that because of pricing in our backlog from the other regions, which was positive, commodities, productivity and the benefits of uplift. So we control what we can control. And as we've gone through this call, China is an important New Equipment market. We all appreciate that. But I think the other regions plus productivity have been more than able to offset that as a result of what you saw the margin expansion.\nJudith Marks: Yeah. Good afternoon, Miguel. This is Judy. Just one other thing, I think it's important to know is that, as we look at China for this year, China revenue all in versus Otis revenue will be 15% or less. So it's continued, what that says is, we're going to grow organically 1% to 3% in revenue. And that means the other three regions are growing, while China and the denominator is growing, while China continues to obviously run into some economic headwinds, especially, in New Equipment.\nMiguel Borrega: That's great. Thank you. And then the second one, just to understand a little bit better the organic growth in maintenance 4.9%, given that the portfolio growth was 4.2%. So aside from repairs, is there anything else that contributed to the slower growth relative to the other quarters? The 70 basis points above portfolio growth, can you provide some color on price mix and churn and how has that changed over the previous quarters?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yeah. The portfolio growth 4.2% consistent in previous quarters. The pricing 3.5%, adjusting from -- without mix and churn, that's also pretty consistent. The reason it's a little bit on a relative level at 4.9% slower growth is because of the comp from the previous year, driven by repair business. So if you look at -- as we go into the second half, portfolio will continue to grow at 4% plus, pricing looks good, repair should be back to high-single digit, double-digit and a combination of that will get us towards the 6.5%, 7%.\nMiguel Borrega: Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call to Judy for closing remarks.\nJudith Marks: Thank you, Sarah. Our results in the first half reflect the strength of our service driven business model, as we remain focused on delivering value for our shareholders in the balance of 2024 and beyond. I want to once again thank Anurag and wish him well in his future endeavors, while also expressing my excitement to partner with Cristina as together, we both look forward to meeting with investors and analysts in the near future. Everyone, please stay safe and well. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Judith Marks",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good morning, afternoon and evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope all are safe and well. I'd like to welcome Cristina Mendez, who is joining us this morning on our earnings call. Cristina is an experienced executive, who's been leading our finance team as CFO in the EMEA region for the past 2.5 years, while also leading our global finance transformation under our uplift program. I look forward to my partnership with Cristina to drive growth, operational execution and value for our customers, colleagues and shareholders. I want to also take this opportunity to thank Anurag for his leadership and for all his contributions to our company, our services growth and in championing our long-term strategy. Now for earnings, starting with Q2 highlights on Slide 3. Otis delivered a solid second quarter in the face of current economic challenges within China as the Service segment continued to drive strong performance. Service organic sales grew mid-single digits. Overall adjusted profit margin expanded by 110 basis points, and adjusted EPS grew 15%, marking our fourth consecutive quarter of 10% or greater adjusted EPS growth. With Service as our primary growth driver, we have set ourselves up well for the future by delivering maintenance portfolio growth of 4.2%, and building our modernization backlog by 17% in the quarter. As a result of our steady business execution and capital allocation strategies, we generated $353 million in adjusted free cash flow and returned $300 million to shareholders through share repurchases in the quarter, taking year-to-date repurchases to $600 million. In June, we published our 2023 ESG report, outlining our progress towards our 13 ESG goals, explaining how this progress advances our business strategy while driving value for stakeholders. Importantly, this report includes a detailed description of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. And we've continued to make progress towards our goals in 2024, including recently receiving ISO 45001 certification, the international standard that specifies the requirements and good practices for effective occupational health and safety management systems at our factory in Sao Bernardo, Brazil. Moving to our orders performance on Slide 4. New Equipment orders were down 11% in the second quarter. High-single digit growth in EMEA, driven by mid-teens growth in the Middle East and low to mid-single digit growth in Asia-Pacific was more than offset by a mid-teens decline in the Americas and a double-digit decline in China. Our New Equipment backlog at constant currency was down 3% versus the prior year. In the Americas, we are seeing the impact of elevated interest rates on our new equipment orders. In China, economic softness severely impacted our new equipment orders while orders grew in both Asia-Pacific due to continued strength in the region, and EMEA as our investment in product and coverage continues to perform well. In our Services segment, progress continued to pace with portfolio growth above 4% for the seventh consecutive quarter, along with 14% modernization orders growth and continued growth in our modernization backlog, which increased 17% at constant currency. We had several exciting customer highlights in the second quarter, thanks to the dedication of our colleagues across all of our regions. In India, at the heart of the city of Delhi, Otis will install 12 SkyRise units at the iconic Unity The Amaryllis Versace. Designed by Versace Home, this luxury development is one of the tallest residential buildings in Delhi. We continue to perform well in the Infrastructure segment as evidenced by our next three major project highlights. In the United States, Otis is supporting the expansion of Terminal 3 West at San Francisco International Airport. As part of this project, Otis will install 15 new Gen 3 elevators and 13 Link escalators while modernizing two elevators. SFO served more than 50 million passengers in 2023 and these upgrades will increase overall passenger capacity and international access. In Germany, we are installing eight escalators for our long established customer, the City of Stuttgart will dismantle the non-Otis escalators that are currently in use and install our heavy traffic public escalators at four metro stations in the city center. In China, we've continued our more than 30-year relationship with the Shanghai Metro, booking several contracts in the quarter that total more than 475 units, including 311 escalators and moving walks for Line 23; 32 elevators and 115 escalators for the new Chongqing Line and 19 elevators for an extension of Line 12. Turning to Q2 results on Slide 5. Otis delivered net sales of $3.6 billion with organic sales down 1%. Adjusted operating profit -- excluding a $15 million foreign exchange headwind was up $38 million, driven by the Service segment. Adjusted EPS grew approximately 15% or $0.14 in the quarter driven by strong operational performance and improvement in our tax rate, benefits from minority interest and a lower share count offset headwinds from foreign exchange translation and an increase in interest expense. With that, I'll turn it over to Anurag to walk through our results in more detail. Now on Slide 8. Before turning to our updated 2024 financial outlook, let me briefly update you on our industry outlook. For the New Equipment market, our expectations for the Americas and EMEA remain unchanged, down low-single digit in units. We now expect Asia to be down high-single digits in units versus the prior outlook of down mid-single digits, driven by weakness in China. There is no change to our outlook for Asia Pacific as the region has continued to perform well. We're revising China to be down 10% to down 15% as activity is weaker than we previously expected. While New Equipment markets remain under pressure, we continue to see strength in the service market, with low single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA, and mid-single digit growth in Asia. The global installed base is expected to grow mid-single digits in 2024, adding roughly 1 million units from units that were installed within the last two years and are now rolling off the warranty period. Turning to Otis' 2024 financial outlook. We now expect sales in the range of $14.3 billion to $14.5 billion, with organic sales growth of 1% to 3%. While we see continued strength in the Service business for the remainder of the year, this decrease in organic sales versus our prior outlook is driven by New Equipment, which Anurag will discuss in a moment. Adjusted operating profit is in line with prior expectations still expected to be up $135 million to $175 million at actual currency and up $160 million to $190 million at constant currency. Adjusted EPS is now expected in the range of $3.85 to $3.90, up 9% to 10%, with $0.02 improvement versus the low end of the prior guide, driven by strong operational performance and the benefit from a lower share count. We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to come within a range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. Before handing it back to Anurag to outline the 2024 segment outlook in more detail, let me turn to Slide 9 to provide an update on Project Uplift and our progress to-date. We now anticipate run rate savings of $175 million by mid-2025, as we have made solid progress executing on the program. Two areas where we're seeing additional benefit versus our prior expectations are through further streamlining of our global operating model, and incremental optimization of indirect spend in areas such as digital technology and infrastructure. As we exit 2024, our anticipated in-year savings are now slated to be approximately $60 million with a 2024 exit run rate of approximately $100 million. Overall, program is on track, we're performing well versus our internal benchmarks and time line, and we look forward to sharing additional updates with you in the coming quarters. Anurag, over to you. Good morning, Jeff. Yeah. Thanks, Jeff, and great to be with you this morning. Our Service business in China, specifically, units are up high-teens for another quarter. MOD orders are up high-single digit. MOD sales are up double-digit. And we're really pleased with the pivot we've made. And now this is now a multiyear strategy we've been implementing to have a greater focus and yield in China on Service. Almost a third of our revenue now in China is in Service, and that's twice what it was when we spun. Our portfolio has more than doubled and is up again this quarter, as I said, high-teens. So our service strategy is coming up nicely, and we're seeing the acceleration of MOD in China and anticipate that to continue to move double-digit as we look out into the medium term for China. The New Equipment market does remain weak. We called it down 15% for the second quarter after being down 10% in the first quarter. But with what we know on the ground from Sally and the team for the full year, we're saying it's going to be down 10% to 15%. Our team has done a really nice job in being able to manage the cost side in a very competitive market, but that market this year, we're saying for China is going to be between 425,000 and 450,000 units. Again, focused on growing Service, continuing to drive out cost in a deflationary environment, but always balancing price and volume so that we make sure that our backlog remains healthy in China. 425,000 to 450,000 units is still a very nicely sized market, but this is the third year of decreases. And I think our strategy and implementation has pivoted to service to be able to reflect that. It's why we took our guide down in terms of top line revenue now to be organic, 1% to 3%, that is all driven by this New Equipment decline there. But as you could see with our profitability this quarter for the first half, even our profit margin expansion in New Equipment, despite being down several hundred million dollars of revenue, you're seeing the resilience in not just our service driven model, but I think you're seeing again, sustained quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year performance in those items that we control. Yeah. Let me take the first one, and I'll turn it over to Anurag, although, we're kind of fighting over the second one because we both want to answer it. So Nigel, it's no change in strategy. What you're probably not seeing behind the scenes is, how our team has, again, continued to pivot. We continue to do product introductions and we continue to drive delivery in terms of our orders through our agents and distributors. Our agents and distributors, again, think about 2,400 of them. A lot of them have also taken on modernization as well. So we've expanded their remit, so that we continue to prepare for the future, which is going to be a more MOD heavy future regardless of what happens structurally on the new equipment side. So the strategies, it's on track. We know what we're doing there. We talk about -- we've had significant China share gains since spin, but we're not going to take on loss making units for the sake of share gain, and that's something I've been telling you now quarter-after-quarter and we're going to be consistent with that methodology versus giving up price and then having that negative piece in the backlog. We just don't think that's -- we don't need that for our business, and we don't think it's wise. But Anurag let me -- let you touch on the second half. Yeah. The last thing I'll add on NCI is our Middle East business has picked up at a very good pace. It's one of several highlights for EMEA, and you see EMEA orders are up, EMEA is strong in revenue, and EMEA is a large modernization opportunity for us, including the Middle East. Outside of China, the majority of our remaining NCI is in the Middle East, Nigel. Sure, Julian. I think it's a great question and very, very -- it's the right analysis. Let me first give you an overview of New Equipment backlog around the globe, and then let me specifically dive into the Americas. We were down 3% and our 12 month rolling New Equipment orders are obviously down 7.7%. The Americas backlog though is up low-single digit. EMEA is up low-single digit. Asia-Pac is up mid-teens and China is down, obviously, which is driving Asia down for the broader picture. Our New Equipment outlook right now is to exit 2024 at the company level, flattish to slightly down as we expect backlog could fall in the second half, but it's really going to get defined by the New Equipment second half orders. And our line of sight to second half orders looks strong, especially in the Americas and some other regions. And let me just tell you, we have about an 18 month line of sight to the Americas, the majority of it being North America in terms of performing our backlog. And as I said, the Americas backlog is up low-single digit. The New Equipment sales in the Americas came in as expected in the second quarter low-single digit year-on-year comps as well as major projects. We anticipate that picking up in the second half. We also anticipate the New Equipment orders in the second half for the Americas to be positive. We can see that based on proposal activity. We can see that based on awards we have that haven't yet been booked and we believe you'll see that starting to come through in the third quarter. Yeah. And Julian, let me just correct myself quickly. The backlog total ex-China is up low-single digit, but the Americas backlog is down. Hi, Steve. Yeah. Well, let me take price and when it impacts services, and I'll let Anurag comment on margins. It is a very competitive environment in China. Pricing is challenged and is down, I would say, roughly 10%. But the costs are coming down. So again, in a deflationary environment, whether it's commodities, whether it's the productivity that we're doing, we're pulling costs out, we've got tailwinds on commodities, and we're driving productivity. So we'll continue to monitor that, Steve. I think we are seeing -- we've been saying it's competitive there now for three years on pricing. I don't anticipate that changing, but our team continues to respond well on the cost side. In terms of how that converts, when you look at our service portfolio in China, again, we're now -- we said last quarter, we were over 400,000 units. We're now about 415,000 units, growing nicely. A lot of that's conversion and our conversion rates are doing well in China. We're pleased with that continuing to move up as we've set in our medium-term guide. But part of that's also recapturing and adding on non-Otis units. So at 425,000 units, we've got a little 4% market share. So there's ample opportunity for us to bring non-Otis units and Otis units that aren't under our portfolio back. So all those activities are going to happen simultaneously, and we believe we can continue mid-teens to high-teens growth in China portfolio for the medium-term. So I don't -- we don't believe that's going to roll into a service impact for us. Anurag? Yeah, Joe. Listen, we added Modern -- delivering Modernization value as a fifth strategic imperative last year to really mobilize the company to industrialize how we're doing MOD and to take us from a position that you know where MOD margins were below new equipment to a place where not only would they meet new equipment margins but exceed them. We did that last quarter and first quarter. We've repeated that this quarter with our medium-term guide to get MOD margins up to at least double-digit and 10% as a starting point. We are on that trajectory. I'm pleased with that progress. The orders for MOD are continued to do well. Our company is responding very well. We're putting together the right kits to meet the customer needs as the demand signal is growing significantly. What we need to do is take those orders and that backlog, which is up 17%, and the orders were up 13.8% with growth in all regions. And we need to -- while we're continuing to grow orders, we need to grow our conversion to sales in Modernization. And we need to pick up that pace with installers. We need to pick up that pace with the kits now being supplied from our new industrialized processes. It's early days there, but you're going to continue to see that. So margins heading in the right direction on the trajectory we had shared, and we continue to see the MOD strategy is intact, and you're going to continue to see significant Modernization growth quarter-after-quarter, and I believe, year-after-year as we go through in the medium term and beyond. Yeah. So again, it's been three straight years. We peaked at about 650,000 units a year, and now we're guiding to 425,000 to 450,000 for this year, which is a pretty significant drop and yet if you look at our team's profitability across these three years and the return from our China team, I couldn't be more proud of how they've taken cost out, they're continuing to look at areas, uplift, structural facilities, branch structure, organization as Anurag alluded to. So we've dealt with that well while simultaneously growing our Service business. So you're going to see more and more service there over time. Listen, I can't and won't call a bottom. I don't know what that is. The Chinese government has put into play many simultaneous activities to try to stimulate both local government financing as recent as the third plenary as well as the PBOC reduced rates this week. There are multiple activities. To date, we have not seen that change consumer sentiment or the buying sentiment in properties yet. There is still a demand for hundreds of millions of Chinese residents to move from rural to urban. So we don't believe that will change, that's the plan and the path that the Chinese government has been on now for two decades, and we believe that's going to continue. And we think we've got the right strategy, and we've sized the business and moved more to Service and Modernization to be able to handle that. I will share, Joe, we -- earlier this week, we actually hosted Premier Li at one of our facilities in TEDA (ph) in the Tianjin region. It was a proud moment for us to host the Premier. And what we focused on, as you can imagine, was beyond all of the automation we have and how Otis has been a part of China will be celebrating 40 years there this fall. We did focus on urban renewal and modernization and our ability to continue to drive energy-efficient solutions, especially as China modernizes. 10 million units in the installed base in China that are now aging and it's going to create a significant modernization demand that we are preparing for, and I would tell you, we're ready for now. Yeah. I mean one of the clear areas, Justin, is just literally aging equipment and obsolescence and demand. I mean, of the 20 million plus, 22 million units in the installed base, over 7 million are 20 plus years older and many of those 30 plus years older. The largest market for that right now is in EMEA, and we're excited with our offerings there. What makes us different now is, we're getting away from custom MOD and bespoke MOD and industrializing this. And when we introduced our Gen 3 product to the market a year or two ago, we did it with the vision that we would have that offering modular available across the globe, a connected offering that would not just fulfill New Equipment drives whether it's Gen 360 in EMEA and now China, but Gen 3 globally that we could then also package as a modernization opportunity. So as we brought out these products, the beauty of it is, as we're educating the New Equipment sales team, we're educating the MOD sales team. And as our installation crews from New Equipment are more familiar with Gen 3, now they're doing Gen 3 Mod. So we're attacking every part of this while attacking the cost side because now we're buying Gen 3 at scale from our sub-suppliers and the manufacturing elements we do ourselves, and all of it is coming together nicely, which is driving the margins. But from a sales standpoint, we've simplified it. We have these relationships with customers. Think about our service portfolio at 2.3 million units, just on our portfolio. We have relationships with these service customers every day. Those are our MOD customers. And when we go on portfolio most of that work we can talk about. We can help them capital plan. We can create if there's obsolescence. We can be more \u2013 it can be more proactive than reactive and all of that is coming together at a time when the demand is growing. So we're ready for this. And I think you're seeing \u2013 I know you're seeing those results in MOD and you're going to continue to see them. Yeah. I think you somewhat answered it, Nick. We have been seeing double-digit repair business now for three years. Originally, it was the post-COVID snapback, but then we've just seen really healthy repair growth. We believe that growth is going to grow again in the second quarter -- second half of the year. So it's not lumpy, but on occasion, again, we've guided in the past that as maintenance grows, you should think of repair growth is one point higher than that. That would say as our portfolio grows 4% plus, repair should grow 5% plus. We've been exceeding 10% now for almost three years in repairs. So I think it's fair to think a little high-single digit more for the second half, and that's a fair expectation. Yeah. Its year-over-year and it's like-for-like. Yeah, Jack. On your second question, the ISPs don't play in the New Equipment pricing. So we're not seeing any one -- any of the other OEMs from what we can see in the market operating any differently than we've seen them operate in the past. Let me give you some color, though, on EMEA and APAC because they deserve that color. It's been really nice to see in a challenging EMEA market, we're performing really well in terms of orders. Obviously, watching interest rates and everything going on there. But for the quarter, our Central Europe business performed well. Our Southern Europe business performed well, and our Middle East business has performed very well. France and U.K. were a little weaker, but the backlog is solid -- and there -- you've now seen, whether it's 12 months, last quarter, this quarter, our EMEA team is doing a really nice job, again, in a challenging market when you think about other macro trends that we don't control. Our Asia-Pacific business in the second quarter, we saw some slowing in India, but that was because of the ongoing elections, that is going to pick up significantly for the second half of the year. Korea still some challenges. Taiwan, a little down, but our orders were up in Japan and Australasia and the backlog is up very healthy. So we expect Americas to snap back in third quarter and second half of the year in orders, we expect continued significant orders growth in Asia-Pacific. And our EMEA team, again, whether it's by our operating units, by our sales team, major projects, volume business, our Gen 360 products doing very well, and I'm really pleased on the infrastructure segments globally. You saw the three we called out, whether it's Shanghai Metro, Stuttgart or San Francisco, there are many more infrastructure jobs that we've been winning, and that gives us the opportunity, whether it's, again, low-rise, mid-rise, high-rise or escalators it's our full product line. And with those infrastructure jobs, we tend to get longer service commitments as well. So all of those trends, again, Americas will snap back. China will remain challenged and the other two businesses will continue to perform well as we see the second half of the year. And as I shared, I think it was one of the early questions, and maybe it was even Julian is, this is where we'll know how 25 looks. So we'll know based on backlog, how we look in '25 and '26 a little, as we exit \u201824 based on those orders in the backlog for the second half. You bet. Yeah. Good afternoon, Miguel. This is Judy. Just one other thing, I think it's important to know is that, as we look at China for this year, China revenue all in versus Otis revenue will be 15% or less. So it's continued, what that says is, we're going to grow organically 1% to 3% in revenue. And that means the other three regions are growing, while China and the denominator is growing, while China continues to obviously run into some economic headwinds, especially, in New Equipment. Thank you, Sarah. Our results in the first half reflect the strength of our service driven business model, as we remain focused on delivering value for our shareholders in the balance of 2024 and beyond. I want to once again thank Anurag and wish him well in his future endeavors, while also expressing my excitement to partner with Cristina as together, we both look forward to meeting with investors and analysts in the near future. Everyone, please stay safe and well. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Thank you, Judy. Starting with Q2 segment sales performance on Slide 6. Total organic sales were down 1% in the quarter, driven by new equipment, which was down 9% compared to the prior year. APAC grew approximately 10%, driven by strong performances in Southeast Asia and India, while the Americas grew low-single digits. EMEA experienced a low-single digit decline due to continued weakness in Central Europe, while China declined double-digits, largely due to the deterioration in market conditions. New Equipment pricing was strong outside of China, up low to mid-single digits. China remains under intense price pressure. And although pricing in China was down year-over-year, it came in approximately flat sequentially, while the cost environment remains deflationary. Service sales were $2.2 billion with organic sales growth of 5.1%, marking over three years of mid-single digit or greater growth in every quarter. We grew in all regions and all lines of business, including approximately 5% in maintenance and repair as a result of strong portfolio growth, solid repair volumes and maintenance pricing, which was up 3.5 points excluding the impact of mix and churn. Driven by continued double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific, MOD organic sales increased about 6% in the quarter and 8% in the first half. Turning to Q2 segment operating performance on Slide 7. New Equipment operating profit of $110 million was down $6 million at constant currency, mainly due to the impacts of lower volume and mix headwinds. Pricing outside of China, productivity, including benefits from uplift and commodity tailwinds largely offset the volume and mix impacts netting to improved margins of 30 basis points to 7.7%, ahead of our expectation. Service operating profit of $538 million increased $51 million at constant currency as drop through on higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity, including benefits from uplift more than offset annual wage inflation. This led to margin expansion of 110 basis points in the quarter. Our focus on cost control, alongside the ramp of uplift initiatives drove lower SG&A absolute dollars, while improving our adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales by 30 basis points year-over-year. For the first half, despite an inflationary environment, our SG&A dollars reduced by approximately $30 million and improved by 30 basis points as a percent of sales. We are very pleased with our progress and uplift across the three levers we've outlined with benefits ramping quicker than anticipated. Our streamlined functional structure is yielding productivity benefits while allowing us to leverage our global scale to drive cost savings, especially with our digital technology operations and other indirect spend. With solid Service performance and while navigating a challenging New Equipment environment, we expanded overall operating profit margins by 110 basis points and grew adjusted EPS $0.14 or 15%. Shifting to cash. Despite lower New Equipment orders, we generated $353 million of free cash flow in the second quarter and we expect to largely reverse the working capital build by year end. Overall, we had a very strong first half performance overcoming weakness in the China market. We grew organic sales 1.2%, led by performance in the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, which were up mid-single digits as well as strength in our Service segment. This growth in conjunction with good traction on uplift, productivity, pricing and commodity tailwinds helped us expand margins by 100 basis points and grow EPS 13% positioning us well for the second half. Let me now turn it back to Judy to discuss our 2024 outlook. Thank you, Judy. Taking a more detailed look at our outlook and starting with sales on Slide 10. We now expect total organic sales to be up 1% to 3%. Overall, New Equipment organic sales are now expected to be down mid-single digits from market driven decline in China, which we now expect to be down approximately 20%. The outlook for the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific remains unchanged, up mid-single digits combined. Service organic sales are anticipated to grow 6% to 7%, in line with prior guidance. This includes maintenance and repair within a range of 5.5% to 6.5% and for modernization, we anticipate growth of 8% to 9% and solid orders momentum and an expanding backlog provide good line of sight to achieve approximately 10% growth in the second half. Turning to Slide 11. At constant currency, operating profit should grow $160 million to $190 million, unchanged versus prior expectations with improving contributions from service and productivity, including Uplift offsetting New Equipment volume and mix headwinds. In Service, we now expect operating profit margin to expand approximately 75 basis points, an increase of 25 basis point versus the prior guide, driven by solid volumes and even better productivity. For New Equipment, despite the weakness in China, operating profit margin is expected to be roughly flat versus the prior year, a change versus our prior estimate of flat to up 10 basis points. Productivity and pricing are offsetting the added volume and mix impact from a weaker China outlook. We now expect overall adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 80 basis points as a result of Service volume, productivity and pricing tailwinds. This represents a 30 basis point improvement versus our prior outlook. Turning to cash flow. We expect to achieve adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, with net income growth, partially offset by changes in working capital. Moving to the 2024 EPS bridge on Slide 12. We have raised the low end of our outlook for adjusted EPS by $0.02 to a range of $3.85 to $3.90. At the midpoint, this is $0.34 of EPS growth versus the prior year, driven by operational performance. At constant currency, we expect approximately $0.32 of operating profit growth, level loaded between the first and the second half. Reductions in the effective tax rate and the lower share count more than offset headwinds from higher interest expense and ForEx. In closing, first half results demonstrate our ability to continue performing despite macro headwinds. There is a lot in our control in the second half, and we are focused on growing our portfolio, leveraging our expanding MOD backlog while ramping on the Uplift program and driving productivity throughout the organization. This sets us up well to achieve our full year outlook of approximately 10% EPS growth in line with our medium term guide. With that, Sarah, please open the line for questions. There is more to come here. We're focused on closing the earnings call right now and a smooth transition with Cristina. Thanks for the question, Jeff. Yeah. Thanks, Judy. So Nigel, if you look at the new equipment market in China, it is clearly challenging. And the revenue in the second quarter was down as well double-digit, as we said. Okay. The reason you don't see on the NCI line is because we're able to manage the volume headwind through productivity through growing our Service business. And it's not only all across all the other regions, it's also in China as well. So we do what we can control. So from a margin perspective and a profit perspective, we've been able to preserve it. Yeah. Thanks. I think you got it pretty much, but let me give a little bit more color, right? In the first half, we built about $300 million of working capital and primarily due to two reasons. The first reason what you mentioned, New Equipment orders, we typically receive down payments and that auto environment has obviously been challenging for the first half. The second, which I think is the largest driver is that the Service business grew faster than the New Equipment business, and we tend to be cash ahead of New Equipment while we collect in Service after we perform the work. These two other drivers, which got us to build $300 million of working capital. So for the back half of the year, we expect to generate about $825 (ph) million in GAAP net income. And if we reverse about $200 million or more in working capital, that will get us closer to the $1.6 billion. We, of course, will look to do better like the same way as we did in the second half of last year and especially on receivables and in the New Equipment orders do a little bit better than expected then this could be a source of upside, and we could get us to about $1.6 billion of free cash. So I'll just start off with the first half, second half, and Cristina can give more color on Q3 as well. So we've done about $1.94 of EPS in the first half and a midpoint of the guidance $3.88, so which implies another $1.94 in the second half, right? So from an operational perspective, it's equal between the first half and the second half. Cristina, give a little bit more color on Q3. Yeah. Thanks. So as Judy mentioned, right, so one of the biggest drivers for us is going to be on the margin side, volume for sure on Service. If you look at the market over the past three years, it's been down. But the reason our portfolio grew is because of conversion rates improving. And there's still more to come on the conversion rates as it goes around. So I think we feel fairly confident on the volume growth over there. On the cost side, clearly, the earlier question that Nigel asked as well, the reason why the NCI was where it was is because of the how we able to maintain our profitability is looking at our cost base. One is we are fortunate in China to be in a deflationary economy in terms of supply chain, so that helps us. But also, we've looked at the footprint that we have, both in terms of the branches in terms of facilities, and we'll continue to take a look at it to kind of bring the cost down. So we feel a combination of volume and productivity. And on the cost side, will help us keep the margins or maybe expand the margins going forward. Yeah. The only thing I -- just one thing, if I could just add to that, is if you look at, it's a comp from last year, where the second quarter was the highest in terms of repair growth. Repair, as Judy has mentioned is still growing at very good high-single digit, if not double-digit in the back half of the year. Thanks for the question. So firstly, just to ground everyone, China New Equipment is our largest margin region in Otis. So it's actually, when China volume goes down, it's a mixed headwind for us. It's not a mix tailwind for us, where team was able to offset the mix which is quite substantial for the quarter because if you look at a revenue down a couple of hundred million dollars and that to essentially in China on the New Equipment side, and that causes about a $40 million, $50 million headwind. We were able to offset that because of pricing in our backlog from the other regions, which was positive, commodities, productivity and the benefits of uplift. So we control what we can control. And as we've gone through this call, China is an important New Equipment market. We all appreciate that. But I think the other regions plus productivity have been more than able to offset that as a result of what you saw the margin expansion. Yeah. The portfolio growth 4.2% consistent in previous quarters. The pricing 3.5%, adjusting from -- without mix and churn, that's also pretty consistent. The reason it's a little bit on a relative level at 4.9% slower growth is because of the comp from the previous year, driven by repair business. So if you look at -- as we go into the second half, portfolio will continue to grow at 4% plus, pricing looks good, repair should be back to high-single digit, double-digit and a combination of that will get us towards the 6.5%, 7%."

That is the midpoint of the guide, and that means $0.12 (ph) up in the first half, probably flat in Q3 and just over a dime in Q4."

Presentation materials are available for download from Otis' website at www.otis.com. \n I'll now turn it over to Michael Rednor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nMichael Rednor: Thank you, Sarah. Welcome to Otis' First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Judy Marks, Chair, CEO and President; and Anurag Maheshwari, Executive Vice President and CFO. \n Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and significant nonrecurring items. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis' SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. \n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Judy. \nJudith Marks: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, afternoon and evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Starting on Slide 3. Otis started the year off with a solid first quarter, again confirming and demonstrating the continued strength of our Service-driven business model, as we outlined during our Investor Day in February. Through the hard work and commitment of our colleagues across the globe, we achieved mid-single-digit organic sales growth driven by our Service business. \n We expanded adjusting operating margins by 80 basis points with both Service and New Equipment operating profit margins expanding 70 and 20 basis points, respectively. With another quarter of maintenance portfolio growth above 4% and solid Modernization sales, we delivered 6.5% service organic sales growth. Mod orders increased 12.9% in the first quarter with growth across all regions while challenging market conditions in New Equipment continue. Delivering operational excellence across the organization drove 10% adjusted EPS growth. \n This quarter, we executed our capital strategy with excellence. We continue to work to repatriate cash from overseas and use it for the benefit of our shareholders. As such, we were able to repurchase $300 million of shares in the quarter. Additionally, yesterday, we announced a 14.7% increase to our quarterly dividend. We have nearly doubled our dividend since spin, emphasizing the importance we place on delivering shareholder value. \n We also made important progress towards our environmental goals. Earlier this month, the science-based targets initiative approved our near-term science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. This is a meaningful step on our sustainability journey, and our steady progress meeting our commitments will be shared in our next ESG report expected to be published later this year. \n Turning to our orders performance on Slide 4. New Equipment orders were down 10% in the first quarter as anticipated due to the tough compare versus the prior year. Double-digit growth in EMEA and mid-single-digit growth in Asia Pacific were more than offset by a double-digit decline in the Americas and high teens decline in China. Nevertheless, our New Equipment backlog at constant currency was roughly flat versus the prior year and up slightly versus the prior quarter. \n Service segment, we continue to deliver consistent solid performance with another quarter portfolio growth above 4% and demonstrating the value of Modernization as a new strategic imperative 13% orders growth and 15% backlog growth at constant currency, setting us up well for Modernization sales through the rest of the year and into 2025. \n Reflecting the hard work of our colleagues around the world, let me highlight a few orders we received during the quarter. In China, Otis Electric will provide 46 escalators and 9 elevators for an expansion of the Shenzhen Metro Line 5. The elevators and escalators will be installed at 3 new stations connecting to the city's grand theater, where passengers can transfer to 2 other metro lines. \n In Canada, Otis will provide 19 elevators at the South Niagara Hospital, a 12-story facility that will consolidate and expand acute care services in the region. It's designed to meet the Canada Green Building Council's lead silver standards and is an important step towards becoming the first well-certified hospital in Canada. These elevators will be equipped with Otis ONE, EMS Panorama and autonomous mobile robot system integration. \n In Japan, Otis is modernizing 6 elevators and 6 escalators at the Hamamatsu Act tower in Hamamatsu city. We look forward to continuing to service the 212-meter tall tower as we've done for nearly 3 decades. \n And in the United Kingdom, the National Health Service of Wales has been an Otis customer since 2018 and has recently renewed their service contract, covering 450 elevators across many health facilities in the country for an additional 5 years. Building upon our trusted relationship, we will now modernize 19 elevators at the University Hospital of Wales and Cardiff. \n Turning to Q1 results on Slide 5. We delivered net sales of $3.4 billion in the first quarter, with organic sales up 3.8%. Despite dynamic market conditions, we have delivered organic growth every quarter since the end of 2020. Adjusted operating profit, excluding a $7 million foreign exchange headwind, was up $50 million with both segments contributing. Adjusted EPS grew 10% or $0.08 in the quarter, driven by strong operational performance, improvement in the tax rate, early results from UpLift and the benefit of a lower share count offset headwinds from foreign exchange translation and increased interest expense. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Anurag to walk through our results in more detail. \nAnurag Maheshwari: Thank you, Judy. Starting with segment sales performance on Slide 6. Otis New Equipment organic sales were roughly flat in the first quarter when compared to the prior year. Americas grew mid-teens and solid backlog conversion, EMEA and Asia Pacific both grew low single digits, driven by growth in key markets, and China experienced a double-digit decline due to the lower backlog and weaker market conditions that Judy mentioned. \n New Equipment pricing was strong in the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific in the first quarter, up low to mid-single digits. In China, while the pricing environment remains challenging, we continue to drive productivity and capitalize on lower commodity prices. \n Service sales were $2.2 billion in the first quarter with organic sales growth of 6.5%, reflecting growth across all regions and in all lines of business and marking the 12th consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit or greater organic sales growth. \n Maintenance and repair continues to perform well, up 5.8% from portfolio growth, robust repair volumes and maintenance pricing, which was up more than 3 points excluding the impact of mix and churn. On Modernization, double-digit growth in China and Asia Pacific drove organic sales up approximately 10% in the quarter. \n Turning to segment operating performance on Slide 7. First quarter New Equipment operating profit of $71 million, was up $6 million at constant currency. Favorable pricing, productivity and commodity tailwinds more than offset mix headwinds and drove 20 basis points of margin expansion. \n Service operating profit of $523 million, was up $47 million at constant currency as drop-through on higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity more than offset annual wage inflation. This led to margin expansion of 70 basis points for the segment. \n Additionally, the ramp of UpLift initiatives alongside cost controls, improved our SG&A as a percent of sales by 50 basis points year-over-year. All in all, we expanded overall adjusted margins by 80 basis points and grew EPS 10%. \n Shifting to cash. We generated $155 million of adjusted free cash flow in the first quarter, reflecting a build in working capital following a snapback from a strong Q4 and the timing of billings in the quarter. \n We are off to a good start. The strength of our Service business, including the execution of a Modernization strategy, combined with productivity efforts and the UpLift program more than offset the subdued New Equipment markets. As a result and with good line of sight through the rest of the year, we are raising our profit guidance. \n I'll turn it back to Judy to discuss our 2024 outlook. \nJudith Marks: Now on Slide 8. Before I discuss our updated 2024 financial outlook, let me briefly update you on our global market outlook. \n For the New Equipment market, our expectations for the Americas and EMEA remain unchanged, down low-single-digit in units. We now expect Asia to be down mid-single digits in units versus the prior outlook of down low to mid-single digits due to weakness in China. There is no change to our outlook for Asia Pacific as India, Southeast Asia and the major infrastructure pipeline remained strong. We're revising China to be down high single digits to down 10% and as activity remains sluggish. \n Although New Equipment markets remain challenging, Service market strength continues with low single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA and mid-single-digit growth in Asia, driven by China. Installed base growth is driven by units that were booked roughly 2 years ago, installed over the past year or so and are now starting to roll off their warranty period. Therefore, we still anticipate the global installed base to add roughly 1 million units, a growth rate of mid-single digits. \n Turning to Otis' 2024 financial outlook. We expect net sales in the range of $14.5 billion to $14.8 billion, with organic sales growth of 3% to 5%, overall unchanged versus the prior outlook, although we made some modest changes within the segments, which Anurag will discuss in a moment. \n Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $135 million to $175 million at actual currency and up $160 million to $190 million at constant currency, up $10 million from the low end of the prior outlook. Adjusted EPS is now expected in the range of $3.83 to $3.90, up 8% to 10% with $0.03 improvement versus the low end of the prior guide. \n We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to come in at approximately $1.6 billion. In addition to returning nearly all free cash flow generated to shareholders, we're also performing well on our cash repatriation programs, and we are raising our target share repurchases to approximately $1 billion for 2024. \n In addition, we are acquiring the remaining minority interest in Nippon Otis in Japan for approximately $70 million with cash. This will be about $0.01 accretive to EPS in 2024 and another $0.01 in 2025. \n With that, let me hand it back to Anurag to outline the 2024 segment outlook in more detail. \nAnurag Maheshwari: Taking a more detailed look at our outlook and starting with sales on Slide 9. We expect total organic sales to remain consistent with our prior outlook. For New Equipment organic sales, we still expect to be roughly flat, with no change to our outlook in EMEA, up low single digits. However, driven by a weaker market, we now expect China New Equipment sales to be down approximately 10%, offset by better-than-expected backlog conversion in the Americas and Asia Pacific. \n Our Service in line with our prior guide, overall organic sales are anticipated to grow 6% to 7%, including maintenance and repair within a range of 5.5% to 6.5%. For Modernization, we anticipate organic sales growth of 8% to 9%, an increase versus the prior outlook of approximately 8% as we continue to execute on the expanding backlog. \n Turning to Slide 10. At constant currency, operating profit should grow $160 million to $190 million, an increase of $5 million at the midpoint versus prior expectations due to continued strong contributions from Service. On Service, we now expect operating profit margin at the high end of the prior guide, up approximately 50 basis points for the year due to solid first quarter performance. \n Our New Equipment net of the previously noted puts and takes, we still anticipate adjusted operating profit margin to be flat to up 10 basis points. Better flow-through of pricing from the backlog is offsetting the added mix impact from the weaker China outlook. We expect overall adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 50 basis points as a result of service volume, productivity and pricing tailwinds alongside ramping UpLift benefits. \n Turning to cash flow. There is no change to our outlook, and we expect to achieve adjusted free cash flow of $1.6 billion, largely driven by net income growth. In addition, our continued efforts on cash repatriation gives us confidence to repurchase $1 billion in shares up from $800 million previously. This, combined with the recently announced increase in our dividend, allow us to return approximately $1.6 billion of cash to shareholders, up from $1.35 billion in our prior outlook. \n Moving to the 2024 EPS bridge on Slide 11. We have raised the low end of our guidance for adjusted EPS by $0.03 to a range of $3.83 to $3.90. That is over $0.30 of EPS growth at the midpoint, driven almost entirely by growth in operating profit. \n Before we turn to questions, let me provide some more color on the second quarter. Starting with Otis. We expect New Equipment to be down mid- to high single digits, reflecting the more challenged market conditions, though with backlog holding steady sequentially. Within Service, maintenance portfolio growth should remain above 4% and Modernization growth or orders growth should remain above 10%. \n For sales, we expect New Equipment to be down roughly mid-single digits organically due to China headwinds and a tough compare with approximately 10% growth in the prior year. Service should continue at roughly the same organic growth rate as Q1, netting to low single-digit overall organic growth for the quarter. Based on the recent deterioration in FX rates, we anticipate a headwind when compared to the prior quarter, netting to roughly flat sales versus the prior year. \n Turning to profit. New Equipment margins are anticipated to come in right around 7%, while Service margins are anticipated to be roughly the same as Q1 or slightly higher. \n Below the line due to the timing of certain tax benefits, the tax rate is expected to come in around 20%, and this benefit in combination with the lower share count will more than offset the headwind from higher interest costs. Absent further ForEx volatility, this should lead to approximately $0.10 of EPS growth on another quarter up 10% or greater. This implies first half EPS growth of roughly $0.20. And when adjusted for the tax rate impact, EPS growth should be fairly level loaded between the first and second halves of the year, largely driven by operating profit growth. \n In closing, first quarter results further demonstrate our ability to execute our strategy to create momentum to perform for the remainder of the year. Growing our portfolio, leveraging our steady New Equipment and expanding more backlog and ramping on the UpLift program, alongside continued operational performance, set us up well to achieve our financial outlook and returned $1.6 billion cash back to shareholders. \n With that, Sarah, please open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. \nRobert Wertheimer: So my question is just around Mods, where sales and orders are showing obviously healthy double-digit-ish growth. Would you talk a little bit about margin in those orders in the backlogs and the drivers of it? I know you're working on standardizing production on the product and a bunch of stuff. I don't know if price is a positive driver there in the backlog as well as you kind of continue on that journey to bring margins up and above. And I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about what the environment is out there for that product? Is there a lot of customer pull on it? Do you have solid demand where you can kind of embrace pricing, maybe just the demand environment around that. \nJudith Marks: Sure. Thanks, Rob. Listen, Mod was up nicely in all regions. I think our strategy is on track. Our team is executing that strategy. And these are still early days in what will be probably more than a decade-long Mod growth market. So we're really encouraged by what we're seeing. Orders up almost 13% in the quarter, backlog up 15%. So now we're just building on quarter after quarter of double-digit growth.\n The standouts, we really saw in the quarter from the demand side, Asia Pacific and Americas, were up really nicely, but Asia Pacific was a standout and China did well, too, double digit. So everyone, again, all regions are up. We're seeing a mix of major projects and just really good volume package demand by customers and we're performing well. \n In terms of the margin, I'll turn it over to Anurag for help with the backlog, but what I think is important, what we shared at Investor Day was that we would shortly be surpassing -- Mod margins would be surpassing New Equipment margins. I'm really pleased to share that in Q1, we saw that inflection point and Mod margins are now higher than New Equipment margins. Anurag, I'll let you add some color? \nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. Thanks. Just to add to that, so a few quarters ago, we said that we -- it should be higher than the New Equipment margin. We are here right now, modestly higher, as Judy said, 1 quarter does not make a trend, but we are very encouraged by what we are seeing in terms of Mod margins. And as the year goes by, we should see more of the expansion on Mod margin and more differential between that and New Equipment. \n What's driving the Mod margin expansion is more of us becoming more productive on the cost side, right? The initiatives that we mentioned around standardization, be it across the supply chain, be it the factory, be it the product and doing field installation at a lower cost, all of this is helping out and it's really driving the margin expansion. So it's more on the product side that we control. But we've got to do a lot more than that and let's see how the year plays out, but very encouraged. \nJudith Marks: Yes. The last thing I'll add, Rob, is that Mod market has potential of several million units in every one of our regions. So this won't be lopsided growth. We anticipate significant growth by all regions. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays Capital. \nJulian Mitchell: Just wondered when you're looking the overall sort of global picture on New Equipment. The backlog was flat at constant currency year-on-year, with TTM orders down. It seems like TTM orders should be down again in the second quarter. Just wondered how you're thinking about the year as a whole, if you could frame up sort of any expectations in New Equipment around, say, book-to-bill and how we should think about the confidence in the New Equipment backlog not shrinking year-on-year over the balance of the year? \nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. Thanks, Julian, for the question. Listen, as we said, Mod was down about 10% in the first quarter, second quarter -- sorry, New Equipment was down 10% in the first quarter, expected to be down mid- to high single digit in the second quarter. So as the year kind of progresses, the compares do get better in the second half of the year because we started seeing the slowdown on the New Equipment side, especially in Americas and EMEA more towards starting from 2Q of last year. So let's see how that progresses. If we perform in line with what -- how the market does, the backlog of New Equipment could be down a couple of points. If we do better than the market, then it could be flattish. So there is a possibility that the New Equipment backlog as we end this year, could be flattish to down low single digits. \n And as we kind of mentioned at the Investor Day, if you look forward to the next few years, clearly, we're expecting New Equipment to be flattish. But where we see a lot of growth coming in is on the Mod side. And the Mod backlogs are up 15%. We continue to perform well in the Mod, New Equipment and Mod as we end the year, that backlog should be up low single digit as we enter into 2025. \nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. And then just maybe, my second question on the Service margins, very good performance in the first quarter, up 70 bps year-on-year. Based on what you said about the second quarter could be up similarly year-on-year sort of 60, 70 bps in Q2 and the first half. So that guide of plus 50 bps of margin for the year, is that just reflecting sort of it's still only April a long way to go? Or is there anything specific happening with costs or technician wages or something in the back half? Maybe just any update around that wage inflation headwind. \nJudith Marks: Yes. Let me unpack a few of those questions, Julian, and start with Service margins. It is early in the year, but what we're seeing, again, with the portfolio growth of 4 plus what we're getting in service pricing like-for-like over 3 points, we're feeling good there. We do have a mix coming into play a little bit as Mod revenue grows, and it grows a little faster than maintenance and repair. There's a little bit of a mix there that we've kind of factored in to that margin outlook. But we've done -- our team has done a fantastic job on the productivity side, especially in the field and on driving repairs and the repair backlog as well, especially in the Americas. So right now, we'll continue to watch it. We feel comfortable with at the 50 basis points. This is our 17th straight quarter of Service adjusted operating profit increasing, and it is the engine, as you know, to our model and our service-driven business model. Wage inflation, we're not seeing anything unusual. And obviously, we focus on productivity to offset that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: So as a proud watchman, I was very pleased to hear [indiscernible] called out a couple of times there, so thanks for that, Judy. So it's not -- it doesn't have happen very often in these calls. So... \nJudith Marks: I know. I'm fun selecting them, Nigel. \nNigel Coe: Yes. I appreciate that. The 2Q color, quite unusual for you guys to give so much color on the quarter. So just -- is this like a new world in here where you're going to give us a bit more kind of quarterly color? Or is there just some unusual stuff happening in the second quarter? Anurag, I think you wanted to call out? And then maybe just in the spirit of maybe helping us to fill out the model, perhaps below the segment line, I mean, tax rate seems to have come a bit lower, but anything on corporate expenses that we should bear in mind as well? \nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. Thanks for the question, Nigel. The reason we give a little bit -- we typically give quite good color on the New Equipment and Service outstanding for the quarter. You gave a little bit more color this time was exactly the question you asked was on the tax rate, which was much lower in the quarter coming in at 20% for the full year. The guide is roughly the same at 25.5%. But because of planning and discrete items, they shift quarter-to-quarter, so wanted to kind of highlight the fact that where tax was coming in for the quarter. And obviously, the team is doing a really good job in terms of managing it through the course and bringing it down in years to come. \n On the corporate expense, yes, it's going to be a few million dollars higher in the quarter, probably 0.9% to 1% of revenue. As we look at this year, nothing unusual there, except for ForEx, where we do have some ForEx headwinds and that does get reflected in our corporate expense, so that probably increases by 5 to 10 basis points. \nNigel Coe: Okay. That's really helpful. And then on the free cash flow, I understand it's mainly AR timing, but is there anything in the mix of business on Mod mix, so anything else that may be leading to a lengthening in the billing cycles, just curious seeing AR increasing from 4Q to 1Q. Anything to call out there? Or was it just timing? \nAnurag Maheshwari: It's essentially timing. I mean if you look back at the past few years, we have more than 100% conversion. We are confident that we will get to the 100% conversion this year. We built up a couple of hundred million dollars of working capital part, but a little bit of it was because of lower down payments due to lower New Equipment orders, but a larger part of it was just the timing of billings through the course of the quarter, where a lot happened in the month of March. We've already started unwinding that in the second quarter, we'll get to the $1.6 billion, and the confidence is reflected in the dividend and also increasing our share repurchase of $800 million to $1 billion. So no real structural change in terms of collection or in terms of cash flow generation. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: I think that there has been, from your peers a little bit of chatter around China and pricing there. Can you maybe just clarify what you're seeing on the ground? \nJudith Marks: Yes. Let me break it into New Equipment and Service pricing. China is by far the most competitive pricing market we are in anywhere in the globe, and it's the only region where we are not getting price for New Equipment. Now we've offset that with both productivity and a great job on commodities where we've seen -- we've locked in and we've seen steel prices, which are 80% of our commodity purchases come down. But it is extremely competitive. And we see that through the public bids, we see that through the volume bids, and we just see that through the segment. I mean the segment itself, the New Equipment market is weak. It's down 10% in the quarter, and we're calling it down high single digit to 10% for the year, and that's after really 2 years of it already being down. \n So if you ask us, Steve, we would tell you that the China segment for 2024 will be at about 450,000 units, and we expect New Equipment pricing to remain competitive. Again, focusing -- we focus, we brought in some new product innovations in the quarter, and we'll continue to exercise and work with our dealers and our agents and distributors and increase our sales channel and continue to grow share. \n On Service pricing. Service pricing, again, in China is kind of flattish. And -- but the drivers are less price in service and more on productivity, volume density and Otis ONE and Otis ONE is really a nice contributor for us. We grew our portfolio in China. We're now at 400,000 units and more than half cover with Otis ONE, and that's driving some significant productivity challenges. But we are -- price in China is challenging. \nC. Stephen Tusa: When you say challenging, I mean, can you give us a little bit of magnitude around that? I mean, is that down 5, down 10, like just any kind of magnitude on a year-over-year basis? \nJudith Marks: No. I mean it's been challenging. This is year 3 of challenging pricing there. Again, Sally and the team were just focused on productivity, on commodities, on everything we can in terms of getting cost out of our products even from an engineering perspective and installation. So I think we've done a really good job there staying as neutral as we can in terms of price cost. \nAnurag Maheshwari: And Steve, just to add to that, right, so because it's a deflationary economy so input costs are coming down. But if you look at the overall New Equipment backlog for us, even after having about $20 million of pricing tailwind in the quarter, flushing through the P&L, our backlog margin for New Equipment is still higher relative to last year. I mean Americas, EMEA at mid-single-digit price increases, Asia Pacific low. So really, really good progress in terms of backlog margin, building it up and flushing it through the P&L as well. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. \nJoseph O'Dea: Wanted to just start on your observations of ABI and Dodge Momentum, most recent prints, how that aligns with what you're seeing in the market, clearly, some softening in those lead indexes. While at the same time, your Americas New Equipment outlook actually improving a little bit since prior. And so whether this is the result of just kind of long lead times on projects or if there's any kind of incremental softening that you're seeing on the ground out there in North America? \nJudith Marks: Yes. So in North America, I would tell you that the New Equipment market segment that we saw in Q1, it remained weak but it was at a lesser pace than the weakness we saw in the second half of '23. And you saw we delivered -- we increased price and we delivered on the backlog significantly because our revenue was up 15%. Our orders challenge in the first quarter was a really tough compare. North America to us is Canada and the U.S. We had several major infrastructure orders in Canada first quarter last year. So I would tell you it's more of a compare. We are expecting more New Equipment stability in '24 than in '23. But the latest ABI data at 43.6%, I mean this is the lowest since December of 2020 and now another quarter of less than -- less below 50%, which means things are contracting similar Dodge is down. \n So we're watching it carefully, Joe. What I would tell you is all verticals this quarter in North America were down. Commercial was down more than resi. Resi is becoming more stable. And for the part of infrastructure where we compete and where we are successful, that has been more stable as well. \nJoseph O'Dea: That's helpful. And then just on capital deployment and increasing the share repurchase for the year, it sounds like some opportunities there related to repatriation. My question is just related to the M&A side of things, what you're seeing on opportunities there, the pipeline just expectations for being able to execute on any bolt-on opportunities this year? \nJudith Marks: Yes. Well, as Anurag shared on the cash repatriation, Kudos to our team, this is the first time I think we've made a significant decrease in our cash balance bringing it down from $1 billion to $900 million and continuing to focus on how we can do that since spin. So that's allowed us to repatriate $300 million and gave us the confidence between the cash and the repatriation to increase. This is the first time we're doing -- we've announced a share repurchase that starts with $1 billion since spin. So it's our fourth year repatriate of -- of cash buybacks -- of stock buybacks. But we're feeling confident there. \n In terms of M&A, the bolt-on business is still healthy. We've got a good book of business. It's just kind of timing when those get closed. We outlook every year, about $50 million to $100 million of bolt-ons. For us, they have to -- eventually, they have to be accretive. They have to as well be -- give us the density and be in the right locations and have one of our teams that knows how to integrate them well. And I think we've proven that year after year and decade after decade. \n In terms of anything else, generational, obviously, we've got a strong balance sheet. These opportunities don't come up frequently in the elevator and escalator market. And we will continue to evaluate anything that comes to market. But I -- again, being the leading provider, our service strategy is working, our capital strategy is working, our operational strategy is working. So we don't feel the need to have to do generational M&A, but of course, we'll take a look at it. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Housden with RBC Capital Markets. \nNicholas Housden: Just on the outlook for Modernization. The sales growth guidance was tweaked up to 8% to 9% growth but that's against a backlog that's up 15%. So I mean I'm just trying to understand what the relationship is between backlog growth and maybe the next 12 months of sales growth that we can expect to see there? Is it just to do with conversion times, why it wouldn't be a little bit higher than that? \nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes, you got it. It's more around the conversion time, right? So if you look at our Modernization sales growth, it's actually been picking up every quarter. There's no reason why it should not be going up double-digit in the next 3 to 4 quarters. And as the sales conversion catches up with our backlog. And part of it is the same thing which is driving a margin increase. I think it's more around standardization of products, reducing the lead time from the factory, reducing the lead time to install it. I think those are drivers which will help us get there. So it's ticking up in the right direction, but where it should kind of mirror is where the backlog grows at, and we should be there in the next few quarters. \nJudith Marks: Yes. Nich, what we've done is we've taken everything we've learned in New Equipment service over 4 years, whether that's go-to-market strategy, whether that's sales specialization driving common installation beyond industrializing the packages, supply chain and everything else. So we're really encouraged by the continued Mod trajectory. And as we said, we're going to continue to expand margins there and focus on backlog conversion. \nNicholas Housden: That's great. And then just on the Service pricing, I think a couple of times that it was 3 points in the quarter net, maybe I'm misremembering, but I think previously you commented saying that you were expecting 100 basis points of net pricing for 2024. So I'm just wondering where the extra 2 points has come from? \nAnurag Maheshwari: Just to clarify, the 300 basis points that we spoke excludes mix and churn. So it's a gross pricing. The net for the quarter was a little bit higher than being flattish over there, but it's consistent to what we are seeing in pricing in the Service business. So EMEA seeing mid-single-digit price increases. America is close to that. Asia Pacific has always been on the lower side. So from a pricing perspective, it's sticking well in the market, and we're seeing good traction over there. \n What's really helping our Service margins to grow besides that is clearly more on the productivity side. And with the productivity because of that, we kind of increase the profit on the Service business for the year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Miguel Borrega with BNP Paribas. \nMiguel Nabeiro Ensinas Serra Borrega: I've got 2 questions. The first one, just on China. For several quarters now, you mentioned 3 years in a row that you're seeing price pressure. I know you're offsetting with lower product costs, but where do you think the price -- that the floor of pricing is? When you look at your competitors that are putting pressure on pricing, how long do you think this will keep going? And then long-term, where do you think margins in China New Equipment will ultimately converge to if you think it'll end up at Western levels? That's my first question. \nJudith Marks: Yes. Let me start, and Anurag will add on the margin side. But Miguel, we -- listen, I'm not here to declare a trough. As soon as we see that in terms of the competitive pricing and the segment, we will share that but we're not predicting it this year as you can tell with our outlook. Again though, I can say, having been in China in March and meeting with multiple government officials as part of the China Development Forum, there are efforts underway. The government is taking action. It has not changed sentiment or the liquidity easing yet. But as that happens, obviously, our team will respond. They'll respond quickly, and we have the ability to see price inflect. I believe you will see us do that as we have led in pricing in China many times. Margins? \nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. Just exactly. It's a balance between the pricing and the share of segment, and I think we look at both. In terms of margins for us, if pricing is coming down in China, as we earlier mentioned, it's also commodity prices. We've seen tailwinds over there, and we're taking cost out and seeing more supply chain efficiencies. So we are maintaining our margin rates in China. And as we go forward, between price, between share, between margin, we're going to find a balance between all 3 of that so we can continue to grow our profitability as we move along. \nJudith Marks: Yes. And that's really what you're seeing, Miguel, with us [indiscernible] really now. Service now being 25% of our revenue in China and growing. The Mod element of that grew double digit last quarter. That's going to continue to grow and continue. So you'll see this trade we normally do between volume, price in every market, but in China, explicitly, we see it moving to becoming more of a mature market and reflecting that, especially in Service. \nMiguel Nabeiro Ensinas Serra Borrega: That's great. And then just a follow-up on capital allocation. So after you upped the dividend and buyback, I know you're buying the minorities in Japan. So does that mean there's not much out there? I know you talked about bolt-ons, but how would you think about potential targets in Southeast Asia, Japan also, what would be the rationale for buying more companies in Southeast Asia versus the rest of the world? \nJudith Marks: Well, our M&A approach for bolt-ons, no matter where it is, is a similar model. It's got to again be accretive to us. It's got to be in a place where we know how to integrate it, and it's got to happen in a location where it adds density to our routes. Now we're fortunate in most markets that, that works for people when they're ready to sell. But we're always interested in bolt-ons everywhere in the world. We ended up buying Schindler's portfolio in Japan in 2016, and that integration has gone extremely well. And our team has continued to grow our Service business in Japan, where conversion rates are highest in the world, call back rates are lowest in the world. So it's a high-quality, good margin business for us, and we thank our partners in Nippon Otis, but it was time we felt to -- like we've done with our disciplined capital everywhere else, for us to get our legal entities in order as well as get our balance sheet in order. So you'll see that in the NCI line in the future. And it just like we did Zardoya made sense to us. \n Other -- as I said, other larger properties will evaluate, but again, only where they make sense for Otis and for us, for us serving our customers as well as for our shareholders. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. \nGautam Khanna: I wanted to ask about India specifically, and just what -- it sounds like that's a source of strength still. If you could just talk about what the big drivers are there? And if you could dimensionalize how big that is relative to the rest of Asia-Pac? \nJudith Marks: Yes. I mean India -- yes, India -- Gautam, thanks. India is the highest growth market anywhere in the world. It's the #2 New Equipment globally after China, but it's got different attributes than China because the conversion rates look far more like mature markets like the Americas, like EMEA. We've been doing -- we installed our first unit in India in the 1890. So -- and we've had an operating company in India for a long time. We've got presence there. I really like our position there. We've got a factory there, so we have Made in India product across elevators and public and commercial escalators. The growth we're seeing is really in every area, but infrastructure is moving very rapidly. Obviously, large population that population, the rising middle class is driving not just urbanization, but demand for higher-end residential, especially multifamily, so -- and multi-use. So every vertical in India is growing, and we see that market growing double digit, and we are investing in it. We're investing in it in terms of adding colleagues and field colleagues. We've got them all over the country. \n Obviously, our factory is driving significant production increases quarter-over-quarter. Our supply chain continues to focus on local and developing more of that local supply chain. It is competitive. And we have to hit some competitive cost points, but our team has managed through that extremely effectively. But think of it as more -- even though it's a high-growth market, more of a mature market, where you don't have this thousands of ISPs, you have this ability to convert at the 90-plus level like a mature market, so our Service portfolio grows there as well. And we have a really strong team under SEBI's leadership in India that understands how to do business in India, do it well, do it right and quarter-after-quarter has just proven significant growth. We are very, very bullish on India. And we'll continue to invest there. \nGautam Khanna: That's helpful. And I just wondered if you could also just talk about supply chain generally. Where, if any, constraints still exist, and how your own lead times have changed over the last 3 months? \nJudith Marks: Yes. We -- the good news is we've worked through the majority of any of our supply chain issues. From a comfort perspective for you on commodities, we expect this year after last year, we drove about $44 million, $45 million of savings on commodities. This year, we're looking at $15 million to $20 million. We think we can get that on top of last year's. And the only reason I say $15 million to $20 million instead of $20 million as we've seen steel increase in certain parts of the world. But we are locked in terms of our commodities for the rest of this year from a productivity and a cost standpoint, fairly well, 60% locked, 80% on steel, our magnets are fully locked. So our supply chain team has done a great job through the challenges and now is optimizing. \n So it's not impacting deliveries at all. And really, there's no single call out. Are there still some people that are recovering some smaller suppliers there are but we've continued to focus on dual sourcing, resiliency in our supply chain. And I got to tell you, our factories on New Equipment this first quarter they delivered. \nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will turn the call to Judy for closing remarks. \nJudith Marks: Thank you, Sarah. We are quite pleased with our first quarter results as we make steady progress delivering value for our customers and shareholders throughout the remainder of the year and beyond. Everyone, thank you for joining us. Stay safe and well. Goodbye. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Judith Marks",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good morning, afternoon and evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Starting on Slide 3. Otis started the year off with a solid first quarter, again confirming and demonstrating the continued strength of our Service-driven business model, as we outlined during our Investor Day in February. Through the hard work and commitment of our colleagues across the globe, we achieved mid-single-digit organic sales growth driven by our Service business. \n We expanded adjusting operating margins by 80 basis points with both Service and New Equipment operating profit margins expanding 70 and 20 basis points, respectively. With another quarter of maintenance portfolio growth above 4% and solid Modernization sales, we delivered 6.5% service organic sales growth. Mod orders increased 12.9% in the first quarter with growth across all regions while challenging market conditions in New Equipment continue. Delivering operational excellence across the organization drove 10% adjusted EPS growth. \n This quarter, we executed our capital strategy with excellence. We continue to work to repatriate cash from overseas and use it for the benefit of our shareholders. As such, we were able to repurchase $300 million of shares in the quarter. Additionally, yesterday, we announced a 14.7% increase to our quarterly dividend. We have nearly doubled our dividend since spin, emphasizing the importance we place on delivering shareholder value. \n We also made important progress towards our environmental goals. Earlier this month, the science-based targets initiative approved our near-term science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. This is a meaningful step on our sustainability journey, and our steady progress meeting our commitments will be shared in our next ESG report expected to be published later this year. \n Turning to our orders performance on Slide 4. New Equipment orders were down 10% in the first quarter as anticipated due to the tough compare versus the prior year. Double-digit growth in EMEA and mid-single-digit growth in Asia Pacific were more than offset by a double-digit decline in the Americas and high teens decline in China. Nevertheless, our New Equipment backlog at constant currency was roughly flat versus the prior year and up slightly versus the prior quarter. \n Service segment, we continue to deliver consistent solid performance with another quarter portfolio growth above 4% and demonstrating the value of Modernization as a new strategic imperative 13% orders growth and 15% backlog growth at constant currency, setting us up well for Modernization sales through the rest of the year and into 2025. \n Reflecting the hard work of our colleagues around the world, let me highlight a few orders we received during the quarter. In China, Otis Electric will provide 46 escalators and 9 elevators for an expansion of the Shenzhen Metro Line 5. The elevators and escalators will be installed at 3 new stations connecting to the city's grand theater, where passengers can transfer to 2 other metro lines. \n In Canada, Otis will provide 19 elevators at the South Niagara Hospital, a 12-story facility that will consolidate and expand acute care services in the region. It's designed to meet the Canada Green Building Council's lead silver standards and is an important step towards becoming the first well-certified hospital in Canada. These elevators will be equipped with Otis ONE, EMS Panorama and autonomous mobile robot system integration. \n In Japan, Otis is modernizing 6 elevators and 6 escalators at the Hamamatsu Act tower in Hamamatsu city. We look forward to continuing to service the 212-meter tall tower as we've done for nearly 3 decades. \n And in the United Kingdom, the National Health Service of Wales has been an Otis customer since 2018 and has recently renewed their service contract, covering 450 elevators across many health facilities in the country for an additional 5 years. Building upon our trusted relationship, we will now modernize 19 elevators at the University Hospital of Wales and Cardiff. \n Turning to Q1 results on Slide 5. We delivered net sales of $3.4 billion in the first quarter, with organic sales up 3.8%. Despite dynamic market conditions, we have delivered organic growth every quarter since the end of 2020. Adjusted operating profit, excluding a $7 million foreign exchange headwind, was up $50 million with both segments contributing. Adjusted EPS grew 10% or $0.08 in the quarter, driven by strong operational performance, improvement in the tax rate, early results from UpLift and the benefit of a lower share count offset headwinds from foreign exchange translation and increased interest expense. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Anurag to walk through our results in more detail. Now on Slide 8. Before I discuss our updated 2024 financial outlook, let me briefly update you on our global market outlook. \n For the New Equipment market, our expectations for the Americas and EMEA remain unchanged, down low-single-digit in units. We now expect Asia to be down mid-single digits in units versus the prior outlook of down low to mid-single digits due to weakness in China. There is no change to our outlook for Asia Pacific as India, Southeast Asia and the major infrastructure pipeline remained strong. We're revising China to be down high single digits to down 10% and as activity remains sluggish. \n Although New Equipment markets remain challenging, Service market strength continues with low single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA and mid-single-digit growth in Asia, driven by China. Installed base growth is driven by units that were booked roughly 2 years ago, installed over the past year or so and are now starting to roll off their warranty period. Therefore, we still anticipate the global installed base to add roughly 1 million units, a growth rate of mid-single digits. \n Turning to Otis' 2024 financial outlook. We expect net sales in the range of $14.5 billion to $14.8 billion, with organic sales growth of 3% to 5%, overall unchanged versus the prior outlook, although we made some modest changes within the segments, which Anurag will discuss in a moment. \n Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $135 million to $175 million at actual currency and up $160 million to $190 million at constant currency, up $10 million from the low end of the prior outlook. Adjusted EPS is now expected in the range of $3.83 to $3.90, up 8% to 10% with $0.03 improvement versus the low end of the prior guide. \n We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to come in at approximately $1.6 billion. In addition to returning nearly all free cash flow generated to shareholders, we're also performing well on our cash repatriation programs, and we are raising our target share repurchases to approximately $1 billion for 2024. \n In addition, we are acquiring the remaining minority interest in Nippon Otis in Japan for approximately $70 million with cash. This will be about $0.01 accretive to EPS in 2024 and another $0.01 in 2025. \n With that, let me hand it back to Anurag to outline the 2024 segment outlook in more detail. Sure. Thanks, Rob. Listen, Mod was up nicely in all regions. I think our strategy is on track. Our team is executing that strategy. And these are still early days in what will be probably more than a decade-long Mod growth market. So we're really encouraged by what we're seeing. Orders up almost 13% in the quarter, backlog up 15%. So now we're just building on quarter after quarter of double-digit growth.\n The standouts, we really saw in the quarter from the demand side, Asia Pacific and Americas, were up really nicely, but Asia Pacific was a standout and China did well, too, double digit. So everyone, again, all regions are up. We're seeing a mix of major projects and just really good volume package demand by customers and we're performing well. \n In terms of the margin, I'll turn it over to Anurag for help with the backlog, but what I think is important, what we shared at Investor Day was that we would shortly be surpassing -- Mod margins would be surpassing New Equipment margins. I'm really pleased to share that in Q1, we saw that inflection point and Mod margins are now higher than New Equipment margins. Anurag, I'll let you add some color? Yes. The last thing I'll add, Rob, is that Mod market has potential of several million units in every one of our regions. So this won't be lopsided growth. We anticipate significant growth by all regions. Yes. Let me unpack a few of those questions, Julian, and start with Service margins. It is early in the year, but what we're seeing, again, with the portfolio growth of 4 plus what we're getting in service pricing like-for-like over 3 points, we're feeling good there. We do have a mix coming into play a little bit as Mod revenue grows, and it grows a little faster than maintenance and repair. There's a little bit of a mix there that we've kind of factored in to that margin outlook. But we've done -- our team has done a fantastic job on the productivity side, especially in the field and on driving repairs and the repair backlog as well, especially in the Americas. So right now, we'll continue to watch it. We feel comfortable with at the 50 basis points. This is our 17th straight quarter of Service adjusted operating profit increasing, and it is the engine, as you know, to our model and our service-driven business model. Wage inflation, we're not seeing anything unusual. And obviously, we focus on productivity to offset that. I know. I'm fun selecting them, Nigel. Yes. Let me break it into New Equipment and Service pricing. China is by far the most competitive pricing market we are in anywhere in the globe, and it's the only region where we are not getting price for New Equipment. Now we've offset that with both productivity and a great job on commodities where we've seen -- we've locked in and we've seen steel prices, which are 80% of our commodity purchases come down. But it is extremely competitive. And we see that through the public bids, we see that through the volume bids, and we just see that through the segment. I mean the segment itself, the New Equipment market is weak. It's down 10% in the quarter, and we're calling it down high single digit to 10% for the year, and that's after really 2 years of it already being down. \n So if you ask us, Steve, we would tell you that the China segment for 2024 will be at about 450,000 units, and we expect New Equipment pricing to remain competitive. Again, focusing -- we focus, we brought in some new product innovations in the quarter, and we'll continue to exercise and work with our dealers and our agents and distributors and increase our sales channel and continue to grow share. \n On Service pricing. Service pricing, again, in China is kind of flattish. And -- but the drivers are less price in service and more on productivity, volume density and Otis ONE and Otis ONE is really a nice contributor for us. We grew our portfolio in China. We're now at 400,000 units and more than half cover with Otis ONE, and that's driving some significant productivity challenges. But we are -- price in China is challenging. No. I mean it's been challenging. This is year 3 of challenging pricing there. Again, Sally and the team were just focused on productivity, on commodities, on everything we can in terms of getting cost out of our products even from an engineering perspective and installation. So I think we've done a really good job there staying as neutral as we can in terms of price cost. Yes. So in North America, I would tell you that the New Equipment market segment that we saw in Q1, it remained weak but it was at a lesser pace than the weakness we saw in the second half of '23. And you saw we delivered -- we increased price and we delivered on the backlog significantly because our revenue was up 15%. Our orders challenge in the first quarter was a really tough compare. North America to us is Canada and the U.S. We had several major infrastructure orders in Canada first quarter last year. So I would tell you it's more of a compare. We are expecting more New Equipment stability in '24 than in '23. But the latest ABI data at 43.6%, I mean this is the lowest since December of 2020 and now another quarter of less than -- less below 50%, which means things are contracting similar Dodge is down. \n So we're watching it carefully, Joe. What I would tell you is all verticals this quarter in North America were down. Commercial was down more than resi. Resi is becoming more stable. And for the part of infrastructure where we compete and where we are successful, that has been more stable as well. Yes. Well, as Anurag shared on the cash repatriation, Kudos to our team, this is the first time I think we've made a significant decrease in our cash balance bringing it down from $1 billion to $900 million and continuing to focus on how we can do that since spin. So that's allowed us to repatriate $300 million and gave us the confidence between the cash and the repatriation to increase. This is the first time we're doing -- we've announced a share repurchase that starts with $1 billion since spin. So it's our fourth year repatriate of -- of cash buybacks -- of stock buybacks. But we're feeling confident there. \n In terms of M&A, the bolt-on business is still healthy. We've got a good book of business. It's just kind of timing when those get closed. We outlook every year, about $50 million to $100 million of bolt-ons. For us, they have to -- eventually, they have to be accretive. They have to as well be -- give us the density and be in the right locations and have one of our teams that knows how to integrate them well. And I think we've proven that year after year and decade after decade. \n In terms of anything else, generational, obviously, we've got a strong balance sheet. These opportunities don't come up frequently in the elevator and escalator market. And we will continue to evaluate anything that comes to market. But I -- again, being the leading provider, our service strategy is working, our capital strategy is working, our operational strategy is working. So we don't feel the need to have to do generational M&A, but of course, we'll take a look at it. Yes. Nich, what we've done is we've taken everything we've learned in New Equipment service over 4 years, whether that's go-to-market strategy, whether that's sales specialization driving common installation beyond industrializing the packages, supply chain and everything else. So we're really encouraged by the continued Mod trajectory. And as we said, we're going to continue to expand margins there and focus on backlog conversion. Yes. Let me start, and Anurag will add on the margin side. But Miguel, we -- listen, I'm not here to declare a trough. As soon as we see that in terms of the competitive pricing and the segment, we will share that but we're not predicting it this year as you can tell with our outlook. Again though, I can say, having been in China in March and meeting with multiple government officials as part of the China Development Forum, there are efforts underway. The government is taking action. It has not changed sentiment or the liquidity easing yet. But as that happens, obviously, our team will respond. They'll respond quickly, and we have the ability to see price inflect. I believe you will see us do that as we have led in pricing in China many times. Margins? Yes. And that's really what you're seeing, Miguel, with us [indiscernible] really now. Service now being 25% of our revenue in China and growing. The Mod element of that grew double digit last quarter. That's going to continue to grow and continue. So you'll see this trade we normally do between volume, price in every market, but in China, explicitly, we see it moving to becoming more of a mature market and reflecting that, especially in Service. Well, our M&A approach for bolt-ons, no matter where it is, is a similar model. It's got to again be accretive to us. It's got to be in a place where we know how to integrate it, and it's got to happen in a location where it adds density to our routes. Now we're fortunate in most markets that, that works for people when they're ready to sell. But we're always interested in bolt-ons everywhere in the world. We ended up buying Schindler's portfolio in Japan in 2016, and that integration has gone extremely well. And our team has continued to grow our Service business in Japan, where conversion rates are highest in the world, call back rates are lowest in the world. So it's a high-quality, good margin business for us, and we thank our partners in Nippon Otis, but it was time we felt to -- like we've done with our disciplined capital everywhere else, for us to get our legal entities in order as well as get our balance sheet in order. So you'll see that in the NCI line in the future. And it just like we did Zardoya made sense to us. \n Other -- as I said, other larger properties will evaluate, but again, only where they make sense for Otis and for us, for us serving our customers as well as for our shareholders. Yes. I mean India -- yes, India -- Gautam, thanks. India is the highest growth market anywhere in the world. It's the #2 New Equipment globally after China, but it's got different attributes than China because the conversion rates look far more like mature markets like the Americas, like EMEA.

But we are locked in terms of our commodities for the rest of this year from a productivity and a cost standpoint, fairly well, 60% locked, 80% on steel, our magnets are fully locked. So our supply chain team has done a great job through the challenges and now is optimizing. \n So it's not impacting deliveries at all. And really, there's no single call out. Are there still some people that are recovering some smaller suppliers there are but we've continued to focus on dual sourcing, resiliency in our supply chain.

We are quite pleased with our first quarter results as we make steady progress delivering value for our customers and shareholders throughout the remainder of the year and beyond. Everyone, thank you for joining us. Stay safe and well. Goodbye."

            "content": "Thank you, Judy. Starting with segment sales performance on Slide 6. Otis New Equipment organic sales were roughly flat in the first quarter when compared to the prior year. Americas grew mid-teens and solid backlog conversion, EMEA and Asia Pacific both grew low single digits, driven by growth in key markets, and China experienced a double-digit decline due to the lower backlog and weaker market conditions that Judy mentioned. \n New Equipment pricing was strong in the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific in the first quarter, up low to mid-single digits. In China, while the pricing environment remains challenging, we continue to drive productivity and capitalize on lower commodity prices. \n Service sales were $2.2 billion in the first quarter with organic sales growth of 6.5%, reflecting growth across all regions and in all lines of business and marking the 12th consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit or greater organic sales growth. \n Maintenance and repair continues to perform well, up 5.8% from portfolio growth, robust repair volumes and maintenance pricing, which was up more than 3 points excluding the impact of mix and churn. On Modernization, double-digit growth in China and Asia Pacific drove organic sales up approximately 10% in the quarter. \n Turning to segment operating performance on Slide 7. First quarter New Equipment operating profit of $71 million, was up $6 million at constant currency. Favorable pricing, productivity and commodity tailwinds more than offset mix headwinds and drove 20 basis points of margin expansion. \n Service operating profit of $523 million, was up $47 million at constant currency as drop-through on higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity more than offset annual wage inflation. This led to margin expansion of 70 basis points for the segment. \n Additionally, the ramp of UpLift initiatives alongside cost controls, improved our SG&A as a percent of sales by 50 basis points year-over-year. All in all, we expanded overall adjusted margins by 80 basis points and grew EPS 10%. \n Shifting to cash. We generated $155 million of adjusted free cash flow in the first quarter, reflecting a build in working capital following a snapback from a strong Q4 and the timing of billings in the quarter. \n We are off to a good start. The strength of our Service business, including the execution of a Modernization strategy, combined with productivity efforts and the UpLift program more than offset the subdued New Equipment markets. As a result and with good line of sight through the rest of the year, we are raising our profit guidance. \n I'll turn it back to Judy to discuss our 2024 outlook. Taking a more detailed look at our outlook and starting with sales on Slide 9. We expect total organic sales to remain consistent with our prior outlook. For New Equipment organic sales, we still expect to be roughly flat, with no change to our outlook in EMEA, up low single digits. However, driven by a weaker market, we now expect China New Equipment sales to be down approximately 10%, offset by better-than-expected backlog conversion in the Americas and Asia Pacific. \n Our Service in line with our prior guide, overall organic sales are anticipated to grow 6% to 7%, including maintenance and repair within a range of 5.5% to 6.5%. For Modernization, we anticipate organic sales growth of 8% to 9%, an increase versus the prior outlook of approximately 8% as we continue to execute on the expanding backlog. \n Turning to Slide 10. At constant currency, operating profit should grow $160 million to $190 million, an increase of $5 million at the midpoint versus prior expectations due to continued strong contributions from Service. On Service, we now expect operating profit margin at the high end of the prior guide, up approximately 50 basis points for the year due to solid first quarter performance. \n Our New Equipment net of the previously noted puts and takes, we still anticipate adjusted operating profit margin to be flat to up 10 basis points. Better flow-through of pricing from the backlog is offsetting the added mix impact from the weaker China outlook. We expect overall adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 50 basis points as a result of service volume, productivity and pricing tailwinds alongside ramping UpLift benefits. \n Turning to cash flow. There is no change to our outlook, and we expect to achieve adjusted free cash flow of $1.6 billion, largely driven by net income growth. In addition, our continued efforts on cash repatriation gives us confidence to repurchase $1 billion in shares up from $800 million previously. This, combined with the recently announced increase in our dividend, allow us to return approximately $1.6 billion of cash to shareholders, up from $1.35 billion in our prior outlook. \n Moving to the 2024 EPS bridge on Slide 11. We have raised the low end of our guidance for adjusted EPS by $0.03 to a range of $3.83 to $3.90. That is over $0.30 of EPS growth at the midpoint, driven almost entirely by growth in operating profit. \n Before we turn to questions, let me provide some more color on the second quarter. Starting with Otis. We expect New Equipment to be down mid- to high single digits, reflecting the more challenged market conditions, though with backlog holding steady sequentially. Within Service, maintenance portfolio growth should remain above 4% and Modernization growth or orders growth should remain above 10%. \n For sales, we expect New Equipment to be down roughly mid-single digits organically due to China headwinds and a tough compare with approximately 10% growth in the prior year. Service should continue at roughly the same organic growth rate as Q1, netting to low single-digit overall organic growth for the quarter. Based on the recent deterioration in FX rates, we anticipate a headwind when compared to the prior quarter, netting to roughly flat sales versus the prior year. \n Turning to profit. New Equipment margins are anticipated to come in right around 7%, while Service margins are anticipated to be roughly the same as Q1 or slightly higher. \n Below the line due to the timing of certain tax benefits, the tax rate is expected to come in around 20%, and this benefit in combination with the lower share count will more than offset the headwind from higher interest costs. Absent further ForEx volatility, this should lead to approximately $0.10 of EPS growth on another quarter up 10% or greater. This implies first half EPS growth of roughly $0.20. And when adjusted for the tax rate impact, EPS growth should be fairly level loaded between the first and second halves of the year, largely driven by operating profit growth. \n In closing, first quarter results further demonstrate our ability to execute our strategy to create momentum to perform for the remainder of the year. Growing our portfolio, leveraging our steady New Equipment and expanding more backlog and ramping on the UpLift program, alongside continued operational performance, set us up well to achieve our financial outlook and returned $1.6 billion cash back to shareholders. \n With that, Sarah, please open the line for questions. Yes. Thanks. Just to add to that, so a few quarters ago, we said that we -- it should be higher than the New Equipment margin. We are here right now, modestly higher, as Judy said, 1 quarter does not make a trend, but we are very encouraged by what we are seeing in terms of Mod margins. And as the year goes by, we should see more of the expansion on Mod margin and more differential between that and New Equipment. \n What's driving the Mod margin expansion is more of us becoming more productive on the cost side, right? The initiatives that we mentioned around standardization, be it across the supply chain, be it the factory, be it the product and doing field installation at a lower cost, all of this is helping out and it's really driving the margin expansion. So it's more on the product side that we control. But we've got to do a lot more than that and let's see how the year plays out, but very encouraged. Yes. Thanks, Julian, for the question. Listen, as we said, Mod was down about 10% in the first quarter, second quarter -- sorry, New Equipment was down 10% in the first quarter, expected to be down mid- to high single digit in the second quarter. So as the year kind of progresses, the compares do get better in the second half of the year because we started seeing the slowdown on the New Equipment side, especially in Americas and EMEA more towards starting from 2Q of last year. So let's see how that progresses. If we perform in line with what -- how the market does, the backlog of New Equipment could be down a couple of points. If we do better than the market, then it could be flattish. So there is a possibility that the New Equipment backlog as we end this year, could be flattish to down low single digits. \n And as we kind of mentioned at the Investor Day, if you look forward to the next few years, clearly, we're expecting New Equipment to be flattish. But where we see a lot of growth coming in is on the Mod side. And the Mod backlogs are up 15%. We continue to perform well in the Mod, New Equipment and Mod as we end the year, that backlog should be up low single digit as we enter into 2025. Yes. Thanks for the question, Nigel. The reason we give a little bit -- we typically give quite good color on the New Equipment and Service outstanding for the quarter. You gave a little bit more color this time was exactly the question you asked was on the tax rate, which was much lower in the quarter coming in at 20% for the full year. The guide is roughly the same at 25.5%. But because of planning and discrete items, they shift quarter-to-quarter, so wanted to kind of highlight the fact that where tax was coming in for the quarter. And obviously, the team is doing a really good job in terms of managing it through the course and bringing it down in years to come. \n On the corporate expense, yes, it's going to be a few million dollars higher in the quarter, probably 0.9% to 1% of revenue. As we look at this year, nothing unusual there, except for ForEx, where we do have some ForEx headwinds and that does get reflected in our corporate expense, so that probably increases by 5 to 10 basis points. It's essentially timing. I mean if you look back at the past few years, we have more than 100% conversion. We are confident that we will get to the 100% conversion this year. We built up a couple of hundred million dollars of working capital part, but a little bit of it was because of lower down payments due to lower New Equipment orders, but a larger part of it was just the timing of billings through the course of the quarter, where a lot happened in the month of March. We've already started unwinding that in the second quarter, we'll get to the $1.6 billion, and the confidence is reflected in the dividend and also increasing our share repurchase of $800 million to $1 billion. So no real structural change in terms of collection or in terms of cash flow generation. And Steve, just to add to that, right, so because it's a deflationary economy so input costs are coming down. But if you look at the overall New Equipment backlog for us, even after having about $20 million of pricing tailwind in the quarter, flushing through the P&L, our backlog margin for New Equipment is still higher relative to last year. I mean Americas, EMEA at mid-single-digit price increases, Asia Pacific low. So really, really good progress in terms of backlog margin, building it up and flushing it through the P&L as well. Yes, you got it. It's more around the conversion time, right? So if you look at our Modernization sales growth, it's actually been picking up every quarter. There's no reason why it should not be going up double-digit in the next 3 to 4 quarters. And as the sales conversion catches up with our backlog. And part of it is the same thing which is driving a margin increase. I think it's more around standardization of products, reducing the lead time from the factory, reducing the lead time to install it. I think those are drivers which will help us get there. So it's ticking up in the right direction, but where it should kind of mirror is where the backlog grows at, and we should be there in the next few quarters. Just to clarify, the 300 basis points that we spoke excludes mix and churn. So it's a gross pricing. The net for the quarter was a little bit higher than being flattish over there, but it's consistent to what we are seeing in pricing in the Service business. So EMEA seeing mid-single-digit price increases. America is close to that. Asia Pacific has always been on the lower side. So from a pricing perspective, it's sticking well in the market, and we're seeing good traction over there. \n What's really helping our Service margins to grow besides that is clearly more on the productivity side. And with the productivity because of that, we kind of increase the profit on the Service business for the year. Yes. Just exactly. It's a balance between the pricing and the share of segment, and I think we look at both. In terms of margins for us, if pricing is coming down in China, as we earlier mentioned, it's also commodity prices. We've seen tailwinds over there, and we're taking cost out and seeing more supply chain efficiencies. So we are maintaining our margin rates in China. And as we go forward, between price, between share, between margin, we're going to find a balance between all 3 of that so we can continue to grow our profitability as we move along."
