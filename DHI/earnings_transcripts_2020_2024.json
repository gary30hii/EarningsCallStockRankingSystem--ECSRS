At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. An interactive question-and-answer session will call the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Thank you.

After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Jessica. And good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. D.R. Horton team faced the year with a strong fourth quarter, which included an 81% increase in net sales orders to 23,726 homes and a 60% increase in consolidated pretax income of $1.1 billion and a 27% increase in revenues to $6.4 billion. Our pretax profit margin for the quarter improved 340 basis points to 16.5%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 66% to $2.24. For the year, consolidated pretax income increased 40% to $3 billion on $20.3 billion of revenues. Our pretax profit margin for the year improved 260 basis points to 14.7%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 49% to $6.41. We closed a record 65,388 homes this year, an increase of over 8,400 homes or 15% from last year. Our homebuilding return on inventory was 24.6%, and our return on equity was 22.1%. These results reflect the strength of our homebuilding and financial service teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton's scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Our homebuilding cash flow from operations of 2020 was $1.9 billion. Over the past 5 years, we have generated over $5 billion of cash flow from homebuilding operations, while growing our consolidated revenues by 88% and our earnings per share by 216%. During this time, we also more than doubled our book value and reduced our homebuilding leverage to 17.5%, while significantly increasing our returns on inventory and equity. Housing market conditions are currently very strong and our teams are focused on maximizing returns, while increasing our market share. However, we remain cautious regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other external factors may have on the economy and our operations in the future. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and experienced team\u2019s position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales base and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments in each of our communities based on local housing market conditions. With 38,000 homes in inventory, an ample supply of lots and continued strong sales trends in October, we are well positioned for another great year in 2021. Mike?\nMike Murray: Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 66% to $2.24 per share, and for the year, diluted earnings per share increased 49% to $6.41. Net income for the quarter increased 64% to $829 million, and for the year, net income increased 47% to $2.4 billion. Our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results include income tax benefits of $15.8 million and $93.4 million related to federal energy efficient homes tax credits that were retroactively reinstated earlier in the year. Our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 28% and to $6.1 billion on 20, 248 homes closed, up from $4.8 billion on 16,024 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $302,600, up slightly from last year, while the average size of our homes closed was down 3%, reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 81% to 23,726 homes, and the value of those orders was $7.3 billion, up 84% from $4 billion in the prior year. We sold 10,596 more homes this quarter than the same quarter last year. This positions D.R. Horton to achieve further gains in market share and scale as we deliver during fiscal 2021. Our average number of active selling communities increased 3% from the prior year and was up 2% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the fourth quarter was $307,600, up 2% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the fourth quarter was 19%, down from 23% in the prior year quarter. We believe the increase in demand in the second half of our fiscal year was fueled by increased buyer urgency due to lower interest rates, a limited supply of homes at affordable price points and, to some extent, pent-up demand from the pandemic slowdown earlier this year. We were and remain well positioned for this increased demand with our affordable product offerings, lot supply and housing inventories. We continued to see strong increases in net sales orders of greater than 50% in October compared to the same month last year. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 22.7%, up 110 basis points sequentially from the June quarter and up 170 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. The sequential increase in our gross margin from June to September exceeded our expectations and was primarily due to the strength of the overall housing market, which resulted in some pricing power and lower sales incentives. On a per square foot basis, our revenues increased approximately 4% sequentially, while our stick and brick cost per square foot increased 1.5% and our lot cost increased 6%. We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace relative to our lot supply and production capacity in each of our communities to optimize the return on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. We expect both our construction and lot costs, and our home prices will increase on a basis in our homes closed next quarter. And we expect a further reduction in the average size of our homes closed. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the first quarter, to be around 23%. Bill?\nBill Wheat: In the fourth quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenues was 7.6%, down 90 basis points from 8.5% in the prior year quarter. For the year, homebuilding SG&A expense was 8.2%, down 50 basis points from 8.7% in 2019. Our homebuilding SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenues is at its lowest point in our history, and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring our infrastructure appropriately supports our business. Mike?\nMike Murray: We ended the year with 38,000 homes in inventory. 14,900 of our total homes were unsold, of which 1,900 were completed. We also had 1,800 model homes, at the end of the year. Due to our strong sales increases in the second half of the year, especially for homes which were available for quick delivery. Our level of unsold and completed unsold homes is lower than recent years. As we mentioned on our last call, we have accelerated our pace of home starts across most of our communities to ensure we maintain an adequate number of homes available to meet demand. We made good progress to increase our homes and inventory during the fourth quarter. And we expect to increase them further, during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. At September 30th, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 377,000 lots, of which, 30% were owned and 70% were controlled new purchase contracts. 30% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 50% of our controlled lots are or will be finished, when we purchase them. Our current lot portfolio continues to provide us a strong competitive position, allowing us to start construction on more homes. David?\nDavid Auld: Our fourth quarter homebuilding investment in lots, land and development totaled $1.6 billion, of which $690 million was for finished lots, $500 million was for land and $380 million was for land development, $330 million of our land and lot purchases in the fourth quarter were for Forestar. After briefly slowing our investments in lots, land and development earlier this year and the beginning weeks of the pandemic, we have since increased our pace of investment to ensure we maintain an adequate lot supply to support our strong sales and home construction pace. As a result for the year, we invested $5 billion in lots, land and development. Mike?\nMike Murray: In October, we acquired the homebuilding operations of Braselton Homes, the largest homebuilder in Corpus Christi, Texas for $23 million in cash. The assets acquired included approximately 90 inventory homes, 95 finished lots, control of 840 additional lots new purchase contracts, and a sales order backlog of 125 homes. We welcome the Braselton team to the D.R. Horton family. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Forestar, our majority owned subsidiary, is a publicly traded residential lot manufacturer, operating in 49 markets across 21 states. Our strategic relationship with Forestar as a well capitalized lot supplier across much of our operating footprint is serving us well and is presenting opportunities for both companies to gain market share. Forestar is delivering on its high-growth expectations with revenue growth of more than 100% and net income growth of 84% in fiscal year 2020, while they continued to build out their national operating platform. At September 30th, Forestar's lot position consisted of 60,500 lots, of which 42,400 are owned and 18,100 are controlled through purchase contracts. 72% of Forestar's owned lots are already under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under our master supply agreement. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and has approximately $740 million of liquidity, which includes $400 million of unrestricted cash and $340 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. At September 30, Forestar's net debt to capital ratio was 22.1%, and their next senior note maturity is in 2024. With low leverage, ample liquidity and its relationship with D.R. Horton, Forestar is in a very strong position to navigate through changing economic conditions and continue to grow their business. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Financial services pretax income in the fourth quarter increased 100% to $121 million with a pretax profit margin of 54.9% compared to $61 million and 44.8% in the prior year quarter. For the year, financial services pretax income was $245 million on $585 million of revenue, representing a 41.9% pretax profit margin. Despite the disruption in the secondary mortgage markets earlier this year caused by COVID-19 and the uncertainty of the impact of the Cares Act, our mortgage company has continued selling the mortgages it originates at strong net gains. We began retaining servicing rights on a portion of our FHA and VA loan originations in the third quarter due to lower valuations offered by mortgage servicers. Servicing values have since improved, and we expect to sell these rights to third parties. We will continue to monitor developments in the mortgage market and adjust our operations to adapt to changes in market conditions. For the quarter, 98% of our mortgage companies were in originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 69% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 50% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 719 average loan-to-value ratio of 90%. First-time homebuyers represented 58% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, up from 50% in the prior year quarter. Mike?\nMike Murray: DHI Communities is our multi-family rental company focused on suburban garden-style apartments that had five projects under active construction and one project that was substantially complete at the end of the year. These projects represent 1,730 multifamily units, including 1,430 units under active construction and 300 completed units. DHI Communities sold two projects during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021, we expect to begin marketing two or three projects for sale. However, we will be flexible on the timing of these sales based on market conditions. We expect new apartment sales to occur in the first quarter. DHI Communities assets totaled $246 million at September 30. As we mentioned on our last call, we are also continuing to evaluate our opportunities in the single-family rental home market. During fiscal 2020, several of our homebuilding divisions began constructing and leasing homes as single-family rental properties. At September 30th, 2020, our homebuilding fixed assets included $87.2 million related to our single-family rental platform, representing 10 communities totaling 740 single-family rental homes in finished lots, of which 440 of these homes are complete. After each of these rental communities is constructed and achieves a stabilized level of leased occupancy, we expect to market and sell the entire community. We expect our total investment in our single and multifamily rental platforms to more than double by the end of fiscal 2021. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. During fiscal 2020, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $1.9 billion and our cumulative cash generated from homebuilding operations for the past five years totals $5.2 billion. At September 30th, we had $4.4 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $2.6 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.8 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facilities. Our homebuilding leverage was 17.5% at fiscal year end, with $2.4 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding and $400 million of senior note maturities in the next 12 months. Subsequent to year end, we issued $500 million of 1.4% homebuilding senior notes due in October 2027. We plan to continue maintaining higher homebuilding cash balances than in prior years to support the increased scale and activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust changing conditions and opportunities. At September 30th, our stockholders' equity was $11.8 billion, and book value per share was $32.53, up 20% from a year ago. For the year, our return on equity was 22.1%, an improvement of 490 basis points from 17.2% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $63.7 million. For the year, we paid cash dividends of $256 million and repurchased 7 million shares of common stock for $360.4 million. We did not repurchase any shares during the third and fourth quarters, but we expect to resume share repurchases during fiscal 2021. Our outstanding share count is down 1% from a year ago, and we currently have an outstanding share repurchase authorization of $535 million. Based on our financial position and outlook for fiscal 2021, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 14% to $0.20 per share. We currently expect to pay dividends of approximately $290 million in fiscal 2021. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Based on today's market conditions and looking forward to the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect to generate consolidated revenues of $5.4 to $5.6 billion and our homes closed to be in a range between 17,500 and 18,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the first quarter to be around 23% and homebuilding SG&A in the first quarter to be approximately 8.9% of homebuilding revenues. We anticipate a financial services pretax profit margin in the first quarter of 35% to 40%, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24%. Looking further out, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues for the full fiscal year of 2021 of $24 billion to $25 billion and to close between 77,000 and 80,000 homes. We forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2021 of approximately 24%, and we currently expect our outstanding share count at the end of fiscal 2021 to be approximately flat with the end of fiscal 2020. We expect to generate positive cash flow from our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2021. However, we are not providing specific guidance for the level of our homebuilding cash flow in fiscal 2021 at this time as we prioritize investing in attractive return opportunities in our homebuilding business. Augmenting our housing and land and lot inventories, after much better-than-expected demand this year and potential M&A. After reinvesting in our homebuilding business, our cash flow priorities include significantly increasing our investment in both our multi and single family rental platform, maintaining our conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying a dividend, which was just recently increased and repurchasing shares to keep our outstanding share count flat year-over-year. David?\nDavid Auld: In closing, our results reflect the strength of our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and affordable product offering across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions, and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your reference during 2020 have been remarkable. We are proud of your work ethic and your positive spirit as you safely continue helping our customers close on their much anticipated new homes. We closed the most homes in a year in our company's history and are incredibly well positioned to continue improving our operations in 2021. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from John Lovallo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Lovallo: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is, you reached 70% options even faster than we anticipated and there was a pretty nice jump from around 65.7% in the third quarter. The question is, I mean, do you expect to be able to kind of grind higher from here or was there something unique in the quarter that allowed you to step-up that option percentage?\nDavid Auld: John, I would say there isn't anything unique. It's just the continuation of hard work and focus. And yes, our expectation is we will continue to grind higher.\nJessica Hansen: It's really a combination of both Forestar's growth and our increased relationships with third party developers. They're both driving that percentage higher.\nMike Murray: And John, as we said, from quarter-to-quarter, you could see some volatility, some quarters could be up, some could be slightly down, it can bounce around a little, but the general trend will be continuing to grind higher.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay. That's really helpful. And then in terms of the liquidity position, you guys announced the dividend raise today and the fact that you'll buy back shares to keep the count \u2013 the share count flat and also your plans to reinvest in the business. But $2.6 billion of cash is a lot. I mean is there any reason why you wouldn't become more aggressive on buybacks?\nBill Wheat: We'll evaluate that, compared to the alternative opportunities in the business. But clearly, with the returns we're seeing in the business today and the demand that we're seeing. We have a need to reinvest in our homebuilding business significantly to put our homes and inventory at a level to meet demand, and have our position and position to meet demand as well. As we look at our cash balances, our scale and our volume and level of activity in our business, is significantly higher than it was even just 2 or 3 years ago. And so we do expect to maintain a higher cash balance going forward, than we have historically. I think you will expect to see from us, at a minimum at quarter end will always be in homebuilding cash greater than $1 billion. But I think most often, you'll see our cash balance between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. And just for a frame of reference, we feel like that's an appropriate level of cash to maintain in the homebuilding business to support our activity. Because just as a frame of reference, on a monthly basis, our cash spend for our accounts payable, for our home construction, land and land development, payroll taxes, basically, all of our cash expenses range between $1.7 billion and $2 billion every single month. So maintaining $2 billion of cash is not excessive. I really feel like it's an appropriate level for our business. And also gives us flexibility then, when we see changing market conditions or opportunities, to adjust and take advantage of those.\nJohn Lovallo: That's very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Kim: Great. Thanks a lot, guys, impressive quarter, exciting times. My first question relates to production rates. And in particular, I was looking at your homes under construction, which were up 34% year-over-year, if you include model homes. And then, relative to that 17,500 to 18, 000 closings number in 1Q, which seemed a little low to me. But your, - given your backlog, I mean, I assume that they don't close in 1Q but close in 2Q. But talking about this, homes under construction up 34%, is that kind of rate 30% to 40%, let's call it, growth in homes under construction, a sustainable rate in your eyes for, let's say, the next six months? Or is that something you were able to do kind of as a first sprint, but that's not in your view, sustainable, be curious to see what you say about that?\nMike Murray: Good morning, Steve. We anticipate, the homes we've gotten started in the fourth quarter are really going to help us deliver the backlog and deliver new spec sales in Q1 and then into Q2. But because we started so many homes in Q4, they're not as far along in the production process, as they normally would be. So they're perhaps a little younger than the average balance might have been. Plus, we just had fewer completed homes in inventory, at the end of September this year, than we did last year. So it's going to take a while to complete our homes and deliver in Q1 or Q2. I think we'll see an elevated level of homes in inventory going into the next quarter. And then we're going to monitor for what we see in spring selling conditions. And we'll adjust to meet demand. Right now, we feel really good about the outlook for the market. And see a lots in front of us and the production capabilities to continue starting homes, and delivering to the higher demand levels.\nStephen Kim: Great. So in that response, I really didn't get a sense of that the growth that we saw in the homes under construction was something that overly stretching your capacity. So I mean, you're going to gauge market conditions. But in terms of your ability to scale, I'm not getting the sense that you've sort of overstretched yourself. Correct me, if that's an incorrect translation of what you said.\nDavid Auld: Steve, it's David. Everything we do, we think about scalable, sustainable of being a major factor in the thought process. So our lot position, our forward lot position, the deals we control and have being delivered to us, best I've ever seen. The market is the best I've ever seen. But a one quarter pop and starts doesn't help. So if you can't sustain it, it really adds a little value.\nStephen Kim: Yes. And you've been really clear about that. Thanks for that.\nDavid Auld: We feel very, very good about where we are and what the market is giving us.\nStephen Kim: That's encouraging. My second question relates to gross margin. The gross margin you put up in 4Q, if I'm not mistaken, was the strongest you've seen since 2006, and it certainly seems like there's a pretty significant upward trajectory in that gross margin with a lot of momentum. You guided three months ago to a gross margin level substantially lower than what you actually did, not complaining. But I would just be curious as to what the drivers to the excess or the overage or the outperformance in the gross margin was -- and particularly, how it came in over the course of the quarter that led you to be so pleasantly surprised and us too?\nBill Wheat: It's a combination of several factors, Steve. It did exceed our expectations. When we spoke - last spoke in July, we were seeing unusual demand into the summer. But I think we still had some question as to how long it might sustain. And fortunately, for the market, we continue to see very strong demand all the way through the end of our September quarter, and of course, we commented through October. So we had certainly more pricing power throughout the quarter as we were selling through our spec inventory than we had anticipated. We also had some anticipation that we might see a bit more cost increases come through than we have thus far. Those are still coming. We see those coming in the next quarter, but we did not see as much cost increases in our stick and brick as we would have anticipated in July.\nStephen Kim: That's great. Sounds like Brad and the team are doing a good job as everybody else is, too. So thanks very much guys. Good quarter.\nBill Wheat: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks. Good morning everybody. I wanted to ask about the breadth of demand when the pandemic started and your business started to improve a lot of chatter about the low-end and spec homes trading at a premium. As you've looked over the last quarter or two, have you begun to see that broaden, David, into both 2-V builds and into other segments, including sort of the Emerald brand, Freedom brand and the higher end of the Horton brand?\nDavid Auld: Carl, we've seen better demand across the spectrum. Having a house that you're going to deliver in 30 days, I did think put you in a very strong position to drive value for the shareholders. So as Mike said, our inventory is much younger. But the demand is out too. It's - I don't know if I've - how many times I've said it but in 32 years, best market I've seen. And it does feel sustainable, unlike what was the fast demand in the last big up-cycle.\nCarl Reichardt: Thank you. And then Jessica, you mentioned towards the end of your remarks about more substantial investment in multifamily and single-family rental. And then I think you mentioned M&A. And given the cash balance and the returns you're seeing in housing generally. Can you talk a little bit about the opportunities that you see in multifamily and single family rental? And has anything changed in the M&A environment that makes you more interested besides the fact that returns are great right now on homebuilding?\nJessica Hansen: No, I think we've taken a balanced approach across our business, and I did mention that we're first and foremost focused on reinvesting in our homebuilding business, because we see very attractive return opportunities. But the great thing about what we've done with our business model, as you know, Carl, over the past few years, generating over $5 billion of cash flow in the last five years, gives us a lot of opportunity to not only reinvest in the homebuilding business, but also invest in these other opportunities that we also do think will over time be returns accretive as well. Both multifamily, single-family, we look to those as very strong opportunities. We did take a brief pause on some of that earlier in the year, but now that the market has recovered and really the pandemic slowdown didn't last nearly as long as I think anybody would have expected. We're back to investing in both of those businesses as we would have originally expected. I think Mike said in his prepared remarks, we would expect to double our investment in both of those platforms in fiscal 2021 as compared to the end of fiscal 2020. And then M&A, you've heard us talk about, I think, every single quarter. It's something we continue to be interested in. But with our footprint, our platform, our people, we are in a very strong position to where we can organically grow and deliver on our growth expectations, continuing to consolidate share regardless of M&A, so we can be very opportunistic on that front. But we are interested in continuing to explore those opportunities. If we find the right builder, the right team, the right platform, of course, at the right price. But it can be a very great way to enter a new market, as you saw us do this quarter with a relatively small acquisition we did that gave us interest in trend, excuse me, into a new market in Texas and Corpus Christi.\nDavid Auld: And I'd just add on to that, Carl, that we see the rental operations, those businesses. Yes, we have capital that we see to invest or will we find that there's a real synergistic operating platform with our homebuilding builders. And we've seen that in the sourcing of opportunities as well as the execution of construction and just our general approach and focus on the business. So we've been really excited about the opportunities and the returns we see on the horizon there.\nMike Murray: And Carl, I'll just add, again, back to the scalable, sustainable program. Large percentage of the population in the US, they never got to own a hold, sad is it has to say. And I do think having the capabilities to execute on the rental side does derisk our operating platform somewhat and will add a significant value to the shareholders as we build that platform out.\nCarl Reichardt: I appreciate it. Thanks a lot folks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.\nAlan Ratner: Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on the phenomenal quarter and results. My first question is just thinking about the volume growth rate. Traditionally, I've always kind of thought about the trend in your spec inventory is a pretty good barometer of where you see the order book growing over the next quarter or two. And it seems like recently, there's been a fairly wide disconnect there with spec inventory trending lower year-over-year and order growth hitting new all-time highs for you guys. So it seems like you're seeing a greater percentage of your business now on the to be built side as opposed to spec, just looking at current order activity. So first, I was curious if you could quantify what that mix looks like. And also, how high do you \u2013 are you comfortable taking that to-be-built component of your business going forward, recognizing that it's probably pretty tough to keep pace with the spec starts and the demand today.\nMike Murray: Yes. I would pick up the last comment you made, that it is very tough to keep up with demand today. If we start a home, we see that there's demand for it and it's absorbed in the marketplace. With regard to our to be built sales, we're still seeing about the same proportion of our sales coming through in the to be built. I would say that it is higher as an absolute number being higher because our total sales demand is much higher than it has been. But we continue to focus on starting our specs and starting out to-be-built and then limiting the sales availability for to-be-built in various decorates, being sure that we have the capacity to start that home within a reasonable time frame that it's within our control to do so and not to leave it out there for a long period of time.\nJessica Hansen: And so a lot of the houses we're starting today are just pre-planned production starts that were how we were going to start anyway. So we don't necessarily think about them as it to-be-built. It's still very efficient. We're just selling into that pace before we've actually started that home. It's not necessarily a pickup and build jobs it takes a little bit more of a build time and offers more customization or option.\nMike Murray: With the sales office a few months ago and the agent I was talking to said that, foundation is the new carpet. And that as soon as we get a foundation going in, there's tremendous demand that people want to get onto that house and be in line by it.\nAlan Ratner: Got you. That's very helpful context. And second, we've heard from a lot of your competitors about the need to intentionally slow sales activity for a multitude of reasons, either closing out of communities faster than expected, difficulty sourcing labor, difficulty sourcing materials, not wanting to extend the backlog too far where you don't have visibility into costs. So I'm just curious, it doesn't seem like you guys are doing that, at least not on a widespread basis. But do you envision having to potentially do that in the near term-based on where your supply side and the demand side is today? Or do you think you can continue selling to demand really indefinitely based on what you see in the market today?\nDavid Auld: We approach it from a subdivision-by-subdivision standpoint. And where we have the lots out in front, we build to a pace that maximizes our returns both on equity and inventory. And it's \u2013 it\u2019s really driven by the individual divisions and the markets that they operate in. I can tell you, we have projects where we've raised pricing an attempt to slow down sales and didn't see much of a change in the sales pace. So it really is driven by the production capability of that division in that submarket as to whether they can deliver more homes or they need to slow it down. There is some tweaking of that out in the field, obviously. I mean it's \u2013 you're at the back end of a subdivision, you want to drive the highest margin you can. But if you're on the front end or in the middle of a big, big community, which we have numerous big, big communities, you've got to be very careful with your price appreciation on your sales pace. Because nothing stops us like letting, one guy buy at one price and then having to incentivize or drop the price on somebody else down - in three, four months down the road. So it's - we call it odd not site [ph] in various project-by-project, division-by-division. And we trust our operators out there, who make those decisions. And it's been working for us for a very, very long time.\nJessica Hansen: And Alan, in spite of extraordinarily increased demand and up sales this quarter, we did see our community count go up, 3% on a year-over-year basis and 2% sequentially, which is really the first time we've seen a meaningful change in our community count. And that's in spite of 80-plus percent increase in sales this quarter. We've been talking for a long time. So all, I think, that comes up on every call, about when is the community count coming, and we've got the lots. And the community is ready to go. And they're going to continue to replenish our community count and bring new communities online, which is going to help us support our continued growth in fiscal 2021.\nAlan Ratner: Great.\nDavid Auld: Alan, everything we've done, since the last down market has been to derisk our land and loss of ply. And we are uniquely positioned with a very long runway on land and lots. And it's surprising, as it seems. But every time I go out, I see at least one or two deals in the division, that's better than anything else they have today. And that's the result of focusing on the relationships within these markets and treating these trade partners and land sellers, like partners and like, they are integral part of our business. They are an integral part of our derisk, derisking our balance sheet, generating cash flow and positioning us to grow and gain market share, at a pace that is driven by the market, not by our inability to deliver to that.\nAlan Ratner: That's great. Thanks a lot guys. Best of luck.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Rehaut: Hi. Thanks. Good morning everyone. And again, congrats on the results, I wanted to hit on, a little bit of a bigger picture question. I think when you look at how the stocks have pulled back a little bit off their highs in the last month or so, various reasons for that. And particularly with the vaccine out and thoughts - investor thoughts around maybe a market rotation and a return to normal in various ways, I think the debate over the next, call it, three to six months is going to be whether or not current sales pace is peak, whether or not fiscal 2021, earnings is peak. I'd love your thoughts on that. And obviously, from a cyclical standpoint, we're just barely getting back to long-term averages in terms of housing starts. But how do you think about, the sustainability of sales pace that you're currently seeing? If there are any governors on that, again, with regards to the prior question around perhaps restricting sales and allowing your construction pace to catch up. But how do you think about where you are in the cycle, where you are versus peak earnings and the ability to sustain. It's not exactly at current sales paces, but thereabouts to allow your earnings to go higher over the next few years?\nDavid Auld: Mike, it feels like there is runway in this market. And I say that because when I'm out talking to the really the division managers within these markets. They talk about employment growth. They talk about population growth. They talk about the positioning that they have. And I just don't get a sense that this is a frenzy or overheated environment out there, where people are speculating on housing. It's family formation, it's downsizing, it's a lot of different things that I believe, anyway are long-term demographic shifts. And when I look at where we are, and what we're doing and our product positioning and our cross point positioning are incredibly deep, very talented, long-tenured employees. It just feels like it's - we got - this market still has\u2026\nMike Murray: And Mike, from a positioning standpoint, we positioned ourselves to be in a very strong and flexible position to adjust to anything that does change. As we look at the broader market, inventory levels are still tight relative to demand. As you mentioned, we're still not back to even normalized levels over the long-term of normalized housing starts. And so from that standpoint, we just want to stay as flexible as we can. We've been through cycles. We recognize there will be times when the cycle turns, and we're going to be in a very strong position to adjust to that. We would never plan out our business model to show an 81% sales increase in one quarter, but we do position ourselves to grow consistently and gain market share. And right now, we're in a very strong market where overall growth rates are stronger than we've seen, and so we're outperforming that. When things moderate to slightly lower levels than they are today, our expectation is we'll be in a position to outperform that. But with a lower risk profile and the ability to preserve the downside on earnings when things do come under pressure at whatever point that is. But again, right now, we see a good market right in front of us, and we're going to make sure we stay positioned with affordable homes and our production in front of what we see the demand to be.\nMichael Rehaut: Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate that. I guess second question, if possible, look to delve in a little bit more and revisit some of the order trend, trend lines that you've been seeing in the last few months. I think you started out the quarter up around 50% or maybe above 50%. I forget the exact language. You ended the quarter with a growth of 81%. I'd love to get the breakout of August and September, if possible. And with October up also around 50%, it implies, obviously, a deceleration from ridiculously strong number, I presume. Just wanted to get your sense, again, gross margins up roughly 150 basis points over two quarters. If you go into first quarter from third quarter, your inventory has sold down dramatically. I just wonder as well around if either some of the price increases that have come through or again, in certain instances, maybe you're just holding back a little bit on sales growth or order taking to allow a catch-up here. If that's how we're supposed to understand where we are in terms of the current order trend because obviously, going from something, obviously, well north of 80% for the last couple of months on average, back down to 50%, just trying to think through the drivers of that.\nJessica Hansen: Sure, Mike. So we're not giving specific monthly quarter trends. But we did say back in July, that our July sales were up greater than 50%. Bill mentioned that our October sales are up greater than 50%. And they're not up as high as the fourth quarter as a whole. So you came back into August and September where we're stronger. But as Bill already alluded to, we don't ever have a business plan that our sales are going to grow 81% on an annual rate or really even in the quarter. So it really continues to be a balance community by community. And so there's still some communities that are performing at very, very strong order rates and there are some where we've taken some price because of our - either our housing or our lot position and has slowed the sales pace to some extent to where we've settled out somewhere between that $50 million to $81 [ph]. What we've guided to for the full year for closing is to be at 18% to 22%. We'll see how the spring unfolds. It doesn't mean we can't do better than that based on how we're starting off the year, our houses, our lot position, our product, our people, all of this things we believe put us in a very strong position to consistently outperform the market again in fiscal 2021. But with it only being one-month into the year, that's where we feel comfortable headed for the year.\nBill Wheat: But our first quarter guidance for closings is up mid-30s.\nJessica Hansen: Yes.\nBill Wheat: And so we see stronger growth than that in the first quarter, the short-term visibility. And then longer term, we'll see what sales demand and positioning are as we get into the spring.\nMichael Rehaut: So just to understand then, what you're saying is that the upside in -- that the upside potential case for closings growth in 2021 could be driven off of a continued robust order pace in the first half and not necessarily production constraints?\nJessica Hansen: Correct.\nBill Wheat: Don't hear us say we have significant production constraints. There are always some, but we feel very good about our positioning and ability to continue to increase production and sustain production levels.\nMichael Rehaut: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the percentage of lots controlled through contracts up to 70%. I know you talked about it earlier. I heard you say that it's basically a reflection of kind of the long-term strategy coming to fruition, I guess. But I mean just how quickly you moved up in that percentage in this unusual year. My question is, if there's any kind of measure of risk mitigation that is signaled into how you view the sustainability of housing demand? And I guess the terms on these lot contracts have changed at all or gotten any less favorable perhaps to D.R. Horton on balance?\nDavid Auld: Well, again, because of our scale and absorption pace per community, we get favorable terms in the market. The land price has gone up, absolutely, they have, but when the seller is looking at his risk side equation. Do you want investment-grade high absorbing company buying your lots or do you want somebody else buy? And that has worked to our advantage as we have continued year after year after year after year to build relationships with these people. So from a risk standpoint, having a set price, you're drawing a lot at some point in the future is significantly less risky than on the land. So \u2013 and it's also just a much more efficient use of capital. So that's something that we're going to continue to work on and I think get better at.\nJessica Hansen: And really, it's been our focus this entire cycle is to push that percentage up. So that percentage increasing is not a read on the market. It's just a read on our continued success in building those relationships, Forestar developing its platform and putting this in a very strong capital-efficient way to run our balance sheet. Yes, does it de-risk us to the downside to some extent, but it's really more about the capital efficiency and driving improved returns.\nMatthew Bouley: Okay. Understood. Thank you both for that. Second one, just back on the gross margin. I think I heard you say that perhaps cost inflation in the quarter maybe didn't come in to the extent you initially expected. And correct me, if I misheard that, but just thinking about the volatility in lumber prices and how that typically runs through your P&L a little quicker than others. Can you just comment to what extent lumber was a still more of that headwind to come in Q4 and if there is still more of that headwind to come in Q1? Just kind of what's assumed around how that flows through? Thank you.\nBill Wheat: Yes, Matt. We would expect that we had a little bit of that headwind in Q4 in the September quarter. But I think we'll see more of it in most of our lumber headwind hit and pass-through in the December quarter, and that was factored into our margin outlook of around 23% for the quarter.\nMatthew Bouley: Understood. Thanks, everyone.\nBill Wheat: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Bosshard: Good morning.\nDavid Auld: Good morning, Eric.\nEric Bosshard: Two things curious about. First of all, on the cost and input side of the equation, sticks and bricks and labor and land, curious in terms of what you're seeing and anticipate in terms of not only cost but availability. You could just speak to both sides of that, where we are and what you see in the next call it, six or six months?\nMike Murray: Yes. We have seen and we telegraphed that we've seen some cost inflationary pressures on some of the lumber, a bit of the other materials and certainly, labor but with our market scale, deep long-term relationships, our production approach and orientation of the business, we're able to work with our local trade suppliers. Aggregate the only market share, but also aggregate labor share in a given market. And by maintaining a sustainable starts pace that allows them to plan their business as well. And it's \u2013 again, it's like what David mentioned to you before on the \u2013 the lot developers. Would they rather work with a production-oriented investment-grade building platform, for somebody else? And oftentimes, we're able to do attract and retain labor through market cycles. I mean, we have consistently paid our bills on time, and worked with these folks as partners through market up cycles and down cycles. And there is long memories here and long relationships. So we're able to get the labor to our job sites. We expect we will have pricing changes. It will go up and it will go down. But we expect to have the FLA [ph] brought our job sites.\nBill Wheat: From a material standpoint, as we've said and, is very clearly known in the industry, there are increases that are occurring. And we're anticipating that. All of that is anticipated in our forward margin guide, which we're anticipating a slight improvement in our gross margin going into Q1. From an availability standpoint, there are periodic shortages of certain products in various areas. And so our operators and our national purchasing team is working with our suppliers on, addressing those, making substitutions where we need to, in order to address those. But nothing that is causing significant holdbacks on our production. Right now, current shortage of the day is windows. And so we're seeing probably more issues with windows than anything else. But again, it's just part of the business, part of where we are in the process and addressing those as we need to.\nDavid Auld: And I'll say that, everything we've been working on, market share gains, liquidity, derisking the balance sheet. All those things help in any market, but it's a true advantage and a good market.\nEric Bosshard: Great. That's helpful. And then, just to follow-up, the gap between orders and backlog and deliveries is as wide as it's been. Do you have any -- I assume the delivery number is as good as it can be, in terms of what you can do. Do you have any concern about the sustainability of orders and backlog, I guess, trying to get to the patients of your customers to wait for, what's probably a little bit more of an extended delivery schedule than they might normally be used to with, your company?\nBill Wheat: I think if you look over time, you may see that we have buyers in backlog a little bit longer, during our production cycle, because we've been selling some of our production earlier, in its production cycle. But compared to there are alternatives in the marketplace today, I think you'll consistently find that we're delivering homes faster, than any of the alternatives that are available to those individuals today.  So over time, it may change a little bit, but the relative comparison as to what else is available at that point in time, when you make the buy decision, as opposed to as much a repeat customer in a short time frame, it's a different customer comparing competing alternatives.\nEric Bosshard: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Baumgarten with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the margins, the gross margins, they've stepped up pretty nicely in the fourth quarter and then you guided for the first quarter. How should we think about the sustainability of those as we move through the year? And maybe some of the puts and takes you may be looking out to going forward?\nJessica Hansen: I think we've generally talked about some of the puts and takes. I mean there's three big buckets, right? They go in to [indiscernible] certainly and our labor and our materials and really all three are a headwind today, but we've been able to offset that with price. And I think also manage our increases in lot labor and material is probably better than the industry as a whole because of our scale, both locally and nationally. So the market conditions are to hold and remain a bit robust as we move throughout the spring. We would hope there is some upside to our margin as we move throughout the year. But it's really too early for us to put any color around what the margin looks like for the full fiscal year of 2021 until we see the spring selling season, which is why we're really only specifically guiding to the Q1 gross margin around 23%.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay. Great. And then just any commentary on cycle times? Have they changed much? Have you seen any lengthening over the last three or so months?\nMike Murray: Actually, been very impressed with their opinions that they've been able to hold and even compress our EBIT cycle times in the build process. We always set goals to get better in our operations every day and pleased to see that the teams have delivered on that.\nAdam Baumgarten: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nTruman Patterson: Hey. Good morning everyone. Nice results. Just had a couple questions that I wanted a little more clarity on. Jessica, community count, could you give an outlook for fiscal 2021? And I know you all don't necessarily view community count as a great indicator, if you will. So I'm really hoping to understand, at the local level, are there any muni permitting constraints, any horizontal lot development constraints, zoning board issues, et cetera? Or is it pretty much business as usual and then on - I believe you all already gave a number, but I didn't hear it. Could you give us the number of finished lots you have currently? And then also the number that are under development?\nJessica Hansen: Sure. So our finished lot count that was - we didn't give the actual count, but we said 30%. So 34,000 of our owned lots are finished. And then another 50% of our controlled lots are - will be finished when we purchase them. So that'd be roughly 132,000 lots. So roughly 170,000 lots in total that either are or will be finished once we purchase them. In terms of community count, as I mentioned, it was up 3% year-over-year, 2% sequentially. Really, with the size of our platform and the number of absolute communities we already have, we don't generally anticipate it moving much more than that. It's probably up no more than a low single digit percentage and there can be some quarter-to-quarter variability to that as well. But I think we do believe as we move throughout fiscal 2021. On average, our community count will be up slightly.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Okay. Thank you for that. And then finally, on some labor constraints, your backlog units are up 96%, I think. Are you all finding enough labor to actually get all these homes started? I know you all build up your guidance from the community and the division level. Are there any areas where you're seeing a large degree of labor constraints or on the flip side? Are you having any local areas where you're seeing I will just called an abundance of labor currently?\nDavid Auld: I wouldn't characterize anything as an abundance of labor. But I would say - the thing we look at to monitor that is our overall cycle times. And we did actually see those hold and compress here very recently. So we're very pleased with that. That's telling us that we're getting labor on the job sites and getting the homes completed. And the composition of our homes inventory to be more favoring the backlog is simply a function of demand. It's not taking us longer to build the houses. We're just selling them earlier in the production process than we might have a year ago.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Thank you.\nMike Murray: I'll just add driving efficiency for the last 10, 11 years is the reason we're able to deliver the houses we're selling. We are - we try to create simple processes that expand our labor base without expanding the number of people, and we are benefiting from that today.\nJessica Hansen: Paul, we'll go ahead and give our closing remarks then.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Paul. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in January to share our first quarter results. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton team. Not only were you the first homebuilder to close more than 50,000 homes in a year, you are now the first to close greater than 60,000 homes and are solidly on the way to being the first to close 80,000 homes in a year. You're truly the best in the industry, D.R. Horton and this entire executive team continues to be hollered and honored to represent you on these calls. Stay safe, stay strong. Talk to you in January.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.",

            "name": "Mike Murray",
            "content": "Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 66% to $2.24 per share, and for the year, diluted earnings per share increased 49% to $6.41. Net income for the quarter increased 64% to $829 million, and for the year, net income increased 47% to $2.4 billion. Our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results include income tax benefits of $15.8 million and $93.4 million related to federal energy efficient homes tax credits that were retroactively reinstated earlier in the year. Our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 28% and to $6.1 billion on 20, 248 homes closed, up from $4.8 billion on 16,024 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $302,600, up slightly from last year, while the average size of our homes closed was down 3%, reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill? We ended the year with 38,000 homes in inventory. 14,900 of our total homes were unsold, of which 1,900 were completed. We also had 1,800 model homes, at the end of the year. Due to our strong sales increases in the second half of the year, especially for homes which were available for quick delivery. Our level of unsold and completed unsold homes is lower than recent years. As we mentioned on our last call, we have accelerated our pace of home starts across most of our communities to ensure we maintain an adequate number of homes available to meet demand. We made good progress to increase our homes and inventory during the fourth quarter. And we expect to increase them further, during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. At September 30th, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 377,000 lots, of which, 30% were owned and 70% were controlled new purchase contracts. 30% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 50% of our controlled lots are or will be finished, when we purchase them. Our current lot portfolio continues to provide us a strong competitive position, allowing us to start construction on more homes. David? In October, we acquired the homebuilding operations of Braselton Homes, the largest homebuilder in Corpus Christi, Texas for $23 million in cash. The assets acquired included approximately 90 inventory homes, 95 finished lots, control of 840 additional lots new purchase contracts, and a sales order backlog of 125 homes. We welcome the Braselton team to the D.R. Horton family. Bill? DHI Communities is our multi-family rental company focused on suburban garden-style apartments that had five projects under active construction and one project that was substantially complete at the end of the year. These projects represent 1,730 multifamily units, including 1,430 units under active construction and 300 completed units. DHI Communities sold two projects during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021, we expect to begin marketing two or three projects for sale. However, we will be flexible on the timing of these sales based on market conditions. We expect new apartment sales to occur in the first quarter. DHI Communities assets totaled $246 million at September 30. As we mentioned on our last call, we are also continuing to evaluate our opportunities in the single-family rental home market. During fiscal 2020, several of our homebuilding divisions began constructing and leasing homes as single-family rental properties. At September 30th, 2020, our homebuilding fixed assets included $87.2 million related to our single-family rental platform, representing 10 communities totaling 740 single-family rental homes in finished lots, of which 440 of these homes are complete. After each of these rental communities is constructed and achieves a stabilized level of leased occupancy, we expect to market and sell the entire community. We expect our total investment in our single and multifamily rental platforms to more than double by the end of fiscal 2021. Bill? And John, as we said, from quarter-to-quarter, you could see some volatility, some quarters could be up, some could be slightly down, it can bounce around a little, but the general trend will be continuing to grind higher. Good morning, Steve. We anticipate, the homes we've gotten started in the fourth quarter are really going to help us deliver the backlog and deliver new spec sales in Q1 and then into Q2. But because we started so many homes in Q4, they're not as far along in the production process, as they normally would be. So they're perhaps a little younger than the average balance might have been. Plus, we just had fewer completed homes in inventory, at the end of September this year, than we did last year. So it's going to take a while to complete our homes and deliver in Q1 or Q2. I think we'll see an elevated level of homes in inventory going into the next quarter. And then we're going to monitor for what we see in spring selling conditions. And we'll adjust to meet demand. Right now, we feel really good about the outlook for the market. And see a lots in front of us and the production capabilities to continue starting homes, and delivering to the higher demand levels. And Carl, I'll just add, again, back to the scalable, sustainable program. Large percentage of the population in the US, they never got to own a hold, sad is it has to say. And I do think having the capabilities to execute on the rental side does derisk our operating platform somewhat and will add a significant value to the shareholders as we build that platform out. Yes. I would pick up the last comment you made, that it is very tough to keep up with demand today. If we start a home, we see that there's demand for it and it's absorbed in the marketplace. With regard to our to be built sales, we're still seeing about the same proportion of our sales coming through in the to be built. I would say that it is higher as an absolute number being higher because our total sales demand is much higher than it has been. But we continue to focus on starting our specs and starting out to-be-built and then limiting the sales availability for to-be-built in various decorates, being sure that we have the capacity to start that home within a reasonable time frame that it's within our control to do so and not to leave it out there for a long period of time. With the sales office a few months ago and the agent I was talking to said that, foundation is the new carpet. And that as soon as we get a foundation going in, there's tremendous demand that people want to get onto that house and be in line by it. And Mike, from a positioning standpoint, we positioned ourselves to be in a very strong and flexible position to adjust to anything that does change. As we look at the broader market, inventory levels are still tight relative to demand. As you mentioned, we're still not back to even normalized levels over the long-term of normalized housing starts. And so from that standpoint, we just want to stay as flexible as we can. We've been through cycles. We recognize there will be times when the cycle turns, and we're going to be in a very strong position to adjust to that. We would never plan out our business model to show an 81% sales increase in one quarter, but we do position ourselves to grow consistently and gain market share. And right now, we're in a very strong market where overall growth rates are stronger than we've seen, and so we're outperforming that. When things moderate to slightly lower levels than they are today, our expectation is we'll be in a position to outperform that. But with a lower risk profile and the ability to preserve the downside on earnings when things do come under pressure at whatever point that is. But again, right now, we see a good market right in front of us, and we're going to make sure we stay positioned with affordable homes and our production in front of what we see the demand to be. Yes. We have seen and we telegraphed that we've seen some cost inflationary pressures on some of the lumber, a bit of the other materials and certainly, labor but with our market scale, deep long-term relationships, our production approach and orientation of the business, we're able to work with our local trade suppliers.

I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. D.R. Horton team faced the year with a strong fourth quarter, which included an 81% increase in net sales orders to 23,726 homes and a 60% increase in consolidated pretax income of $1.1 billion and a 27% increase in revenues to $6.4 billion. Our pretax profit margin for the quarter improved 340 basis points to 16.5%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 66% to $2.24. For the year, consolidated pretax income increased 40% to $3 billion on $20.3 billion of revenues. Our pretax profit margin for the year improved 260 basis points to 14.7%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 49% to $6.41. We closed a record 65,388 homes this year, an increase of over 8,400 homes or 15% from last year. Our homebuilding return on inventory was 24.6%, and our return on equity was 22.1%. These results reflect the strength of our homebuilding and financial service teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton's scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Our homebuilding cash flow from operations of 2020 was $1.9 billion. Over the past 5 years, we have generated over $5 billion of cash flow from homebuilding operations, while growing our consolidated revenues by 88% and our earnings per share by 216%. During this time, we also more than doubled our book value and reduced our homebuilding leverage to 17.5%, while significantly increasing our returns on inventory and equity. Housing market conditions are currently very strong and our teams are focused on maximizing returns, while increasing our market share. However, we remain cautious regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other external factors may have on the economy and our operations in the future. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and experienced team's position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales base and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments in each of our communities based on local housing market conditions. With 38,000 homes in inventory, an ample supply of lots and continued strong sales trends in October, we are well positioned for another great year in 2021. Mike? Our fourth quarter homebuilding investment in lots, land and development totaled $1.6 billion, of which $690 million was for finished lots, $500 million was for land and $380 million was for land development, $330 million of our land and lot purchases in the fourth quarter were for Forestar. After briefly slowing our investments in lots, land and development earlier this year and the beginning weeks of the pandemic, we have since increased our pace of investment to ensure we maintain an adequate lot supply to support our strong sales and home construction pace. As a result for the year, we invested $5 billion in lots, land and development. Mike? In closing, our results reflect the strength of our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and affordable product offering across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions, and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your reference during 2020 have been remarkable. We are proud of your work ethic and your positive spirit as you safely continue helping our customers close on their much anticipated new homes. We closed the most homes in a year in our company's history and are incredibly well positioned to continue improving our operations in 2021. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. John, I would say there isn't anything unique. It's just the continuation of hard work and focus. And yes, our expectation is we will continue to grind higher. Steve, it's David. Everything we do, we think about scalable, sustainable of being a major factor in the thought process. So our lot position, our forward lot position, the deals we control and have being delivered to us, best I've ever seen. The market is the best I've ever seen. But a one quarter pop and starts doesn't help. So if you can't sustain it, it really adds a little value. We feel very, very good about where we are and what the market is giving us. Carl, we've seen better demand across the spectrum. Having a house that you're going to deliver in 30 days, I did think put you in a very strong position to drive value for the shareholders. So as Mike said, our inventory is much younger. But the demand is out too. It's - I don't know if I've - how many times I've said it but in 32 years, best market I've seen. And it does feel sustainable, unlike what was the fast demand in the last big up-cycle. And I'd just add on to that, Carl, that we see the rental operations, those businesses. Yes, we have capital that we see to invest or will we find that there's a real synergistic operating platform with our homebuilding builders. And we've seen that in the sourcing of opportunities as well as the execution of construction and just our general approach and focus on the business. So we've been really excited about the opportunities and the returns we see on the horizon there. We approach it from a subdivision-by-subdivision standpoint. And where we have the lots out in front, we build to a pace that maximizes our returns both on equity and inventory. And it's \u2013 it's really driven by the individual divisions and the markets that they operate in. I can tell you, we have projects where we've raised pricing an attempt to slow down sales and didn't see much of a change in the sales pace. So it really is driven by the production capability of that division in that submarket as to whether they can deliver more homes or they need to slow it down. There is some tweaking of that out in the field, obviously. I mean it's \u2013 you're at the back end of a subdivision, you want to drive the highest margin you can. But if you're on the front end or in the middle of a big, big community, which we have numerous big, big communities, you've got to be very careful with your price appreciation on your sales pace. Because nothing stops us like letting, one guy buy at one price and then having to incentivize or drop the price on somebody else down - in three, four months down the road. So it's - we call it odd not site [ph] in various project-by-project, division-by-division. And we trust our operators out there, who make those decisions. And it's been working for us for a very, very long time. Alan, everything we've done, since the last down market has been to derisk our land and loss of ply. And we are uniquely positioned with a very long runway on land and lots. And it's surprising, as it seems. But every time I go out, I see at least one or two deals in the division, that's better than anything else they have today. And that's the result of focusing on the relationships within these markets and treating these trade partners and land sellers, like partners and like, they are integral part of our business. They are an integral part of our derisk, derisking our balance sheet, generating cash flow and positioning us to grow and gain market share, at a pace that is driven by the market, not by our inability to deliver to that. Mike, it feels like there is runway in this market. And I say that because when I'm out talking to the really the division managers within these markets. They talk about employment growth. They talk about population growth. They talk about the positioning that they have. And I just don't get a sense that this is a frenzy or overheated environment out there, where people are speculating on housing. It's family formation, it's downsizing, it's a lot of different things that I believe, anyway are long-term demographic shifts. And when I look at where we are, and what we're doing and our product positioning and our cross point positioning are incredibly deep, very talented, long-tenured employees. It just feels like it's - we got - this market still has... Well, again, because of our scale and absorption pace per community, we get favorable terms in the market. The land price has gone up, absolutely, they have, but when the seller is looking at his risk side equation. Do you want investment-grade high absorbing company buying your lots or do you want somebody else buy? And that has worked to our advantage as we have continued year after year after year after year to build relationships with these people. So from a risk standpoint, having a set price, you're drawing a lot at some point in the future is significantly less risky than on the land. So \u2013 and it's also just a much more efficient use of capital. So that's something that we're going to continue to work on and I think get better at. Good morning, Eric. And I'll say that, everything we've been working on, market share gains, liquidity, derisking the balance sheet. All those things help in any market, but it's a true advantage and a good market. I wouldn't characterize anything as an abundance of labor. But I would say - the thing we look at to monitor that is our overall cycle times. And we did actually see those hold and compress here very recently. So we're very pleased with that. That's telling us that we're getting labor on the job sites and getting the homes completed. And the composition of our homes inventory to be more favoring the backlog is simply a function of demand. It's not taking us longer to build the houses. We're just selling them earlier in the production process than we might have a year ago. Thank you, Paul. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in January to share our first quarter results. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton team. Not only were you the first homebuilder to close more than 50,000 homes in a year, you are now the first to close greater than 60,000 homes and are solidly on the way to being the first to close 80,000 homes in a year. You're truly the best in the industry, D.R. Horton and this entire executive team continues to be hollered and honored to represent you on these calls. Stay safe, stay strong. Talk to you in January."

            "content": "Net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 81% to 23,726 homes, and the value of those orders was $7.3 billion, up 84% from $4 billion in the prior year. We sold 10,596 more homes this quarter than the same quarter last year. This positions D.R. Horton to achieve further gains in market share and scale as we deliver during fiscal 2021. Our average number of active selling communities increased 3% from the prior year and was up 2% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the fourth quarter was $307,600, up 2% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the fourth quarter was 19%, down from 23% in the prior year quarter. We believe the increase in demand in the second half of our fiscal year was fueled by increased buyer urgency due to lower interest rates, a limited supply of homes at affordable price points and, to some extent, pent-up demand from the pandemic slowdown earlier this year. We were and remain well positioned for this increased demand with our affordable product offerings, lot supply and housing inventories. We continued to see strong increases in net sales orders of greater than 50% in October compared to the same month last year. Jessica? In the fourth quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenues was 7.6%, down 90 basis points from 8.5% in the prior year quarter. For the year, homebuilding SG&A expense was 8.2%, down 50 basis points from 8.7% in 2019. Our homebuilding SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenues is at its lowest point in our history, and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring our infrastructure appropriately supports our business. Mike? Forestar, our majority owned subsidiary, is a publicly traded residential lot manufacturer, operating in 49 markets across 21 states. Our strategic relationship with Forestar as a well capitalized lot supplier across much of our operating footprint is serving us well and is presenting opportunities for both companies to gain market share. Forestar is delivering on its high-growth expectations with revenue growth of more than 100% and net income growth of 84% in fiscal year 2020, while they continued to build out their national operating platform. At September 30th, Forestar's lot position consisted of 60,500 lots, of which 42,400 are owned and 18,100 are controlled through purchase contracts. 72% of Forestar's owned lots are already under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under our master supply agreement. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and has approximately $740 million of liquidity, which includes $400 million of unrestricted cash and $340 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. At September 30, Forestar's net debt to capital ratio was 22.1%, and their next senior note maturity is in 2024. With low leverage, ample liquidity and its relationship with D.R. Horton, Forestar is in a very strong position to navigate through changing economic conditions and continue to grow their business. Jessica? Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. During fiscal 2020, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $1.9 billion and our cumulative cash generated from homebuilding operations for the past five years totals $5.2 billion. At September 30th, we had $4.4 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $2.6 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.8 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facilities. Our homebuilding leverage was 17.5% at fiscal year end, with $2.4 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding and $400 million of senior note maturities in the next 12 months. Subsequent to year end, we issued $500 million of 1.4% homebuilding senior notes due in October 2027. We plan to continue maintaining higher homebuilding cash balances than in prior years to support the increased scale and activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust changing conditions and opportunities. At September 30th, our stockholders' equity was $11.8 billion, and book value per share was $32.53, up 20% from a year ago. For the year, our return on equity was 22.1%, an improvement of 490 basis points from 17.2% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $63.7 million. For the year, we paid cash dividends of $256 million and repurchased 7 million shares of common stock for $360.4 million. We did not repurchase any shares during the third and fourth quarters, but we expect to resume share repurchases during fiscal 2021. Our outstanding share count is down 1% from a year ago, and we currently have an outstanding share repurchase authorization of $535 million. Based on our financial position and outlook for fiscal 2021, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 14% to $0.20 per share. We currently expect to pay dividends of approximately $290 million in fiscal 2021. Jessica? We'll evaluate that, compared to the alternative opportunities in the business. But clearly, with the returns we're seeing in the business today and the demand that we're seeing. We have a need to reinvest in our homebuilding business significantly to put our homes and inventory at a level to meet demand, and have our position and position to meet demand as well. As we look at our cash balances, our scale and our volume and level of activity in our business, is significantly higher than it was even just 2 or 3 years ago. And so we do expect to maintain a higher cash balance going forward, than we have historically. I think you will expect to see from us, at a minimum at quarter end will always be in homebuilding cash greater than $1 billion. But I think most often, you'll see our cash balance between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. And just for a frame of reference, we feel like that's an appropriate level of cash to maintain in the homebuilding business to support our activity. Because just as a frame of reference, on a monthly basis, our cash spend for our accounts payable, for our home construction, land and land development, payroll taxes, basically, all of our cash expenses range between $1.7 billion and $2 billion every single month. So maintaining $2 billion of cash is not excessive. I really feel like it's an appropriate level for our business. And also gives us flexibility then, when we see changing market conditions or opportunities, to adjust and take advantage of those. It's a combination of several factors, Steve. It did exceed our expectations. When we spoke - last spoke in July, we were seeing unusual demand into the summer. But I think we still had some question as to how long it might sustain. And fortunately, for the market, we continue to see very strong demand all the way through the end of our September quarter, and of course, we commented through October. So we had certainly more pricing power throughout the quarter as we were selling through our spec inventory than we had anticipated. We also had some anticipation that we might see a bit more cost increases come through than we have thus far. Those are still coming. We see those coming in the next quarter, but we did not see as much cost increases in our stick and brick as we would have anticipated in July. Thank you. But our first quarter guidance for closings is up mid-30s. And so we see stronger growth than that in the first quarter, the short-term visibility. And then longer term, we'll see what sales demand and positioning are as we get into the spring. Don't hear us say we have significant production constraints. There are always some, but we feel very good about our positioning and ability to continue to increase production and sustain production levels. Yes, Matt. We would expect that we had a little bit of that headwind in Q4 in the September quarter. But I think we'll see more of it in most of our lumber headwind hit and pass-through in the December quarter, and that was factored into our margin outlook of around 23% for the quarter. Thank you. From a material standpoint, as we've said and, is very clearly known in the industry, there are increases that are occurring. And we're anticipating that. All of that is anticipated in our forward margin guide, which we're anticipating a slight improvement in our gross margin going into Q1. From an availability standpoint, there are periodic shortages of certain products in various areas. And so our operators and our national purchasing team is working with our suppliers on, addressing those, making substitutions where we need to, in order to address those. But nothing that is causing significant holdbacks on our production. Right now, current shortage of the day is windows. And so we're seeing probably more issues with windows than anything else. But again, it's just part of the business, part of where we are in the process and addressing those as we need to. I think if you look over time, you may see that we have buyers in backlog a little bit longer, during our production cycle, because we've been selling some of our production earlier, in its production cycle. But compared to there are alternatives in the marketplace today, I think you'll consistently find that we're delivering homes faster, than any of the alternatives that are available to those individuals today.  So over time, it may change a little bit, but the relative comparison as to what else is available at that point in time, when you make the buy decision, as opposed to as much a repeat customer in a short time frame, it's a different customer comparing competing alternatives."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President, Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Jessica, please go ahead.\nJessica Hansen: Thank you, Kevin and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 in addition to current market conditions. Before we get started, today\u2019s call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R.

Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Form 10-Q, all of which are or will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning\u2019s earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-Q in the next day or two. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News & Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Jessica and good morning. I am pleased to be joined \u2013 to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We would like to first again express our gratitude to our country\u2019s dedicated field of healthcare workers and to all who are on the frontlines caring for our communities. Our thoughts remain with those affected by this pandemic and our priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees, customers, trade partners and the communities we serve. During the latter part of March, the impacts of COVID-19 and related widespread reductions in economic activity across the United States began to negatively affect our business. During April, when restrictive stay-at-home orders were in place for most of our markets, our sales orders decreased and our cancellations increased and our April net sales orders were 1% lower than a year ago. However, as restrictive orders began to be lifted across many markets and economic activity resumed, our sales increased significantly and our cancellations rate returned to normal levels. In both May and June, our net sales orders increased by more than 50% compared to the prior year periods, resulting in a net sales order increase of 38% for the quarter. We sold 5,931 more homes this quarter than the same quarter last year, positioning D.R. Horton to achieve further gains in market share and scale. We have continued to see strong increases in net sales orders in July compared to the same month last year. Despite the disruption from COVID-19 on our operations, the D.R. Horton team delivered a record third quarter, including net sales orders of 21,519 homes, a 25% increase in consolidated pre-tax income to $782 million and a 10% increase in revenues to $5.4 billion. Our pre-tax profit margin for the quarter improved 170 basis points to 14.5%, while our EPS increased 37% to $1.72 per diluted share. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 21.6% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 19.9%. While housing market conditions are very strong today, we remain cautious as to the impact that COVID-19 may have on the overall economy and our operations in the future. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity position and experienced operating teams, position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible, operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales base and inventory levels to optimize return on our inventory investments in each of our communities based on local housing market conditions. Mike?\nMike Murray: Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 37% to $1.72 per share compared to $1.26 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 33% to $631 million compared to $475 million. The current quarter results, included income tax benefit of $38.1 million related to federal energy efficient home tax credits that were retroactively reinstated earlier in the year. Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 10% to $5.2 billion on 17,642 homes closed, up from $4.7 billion on 15,971 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was essentially flat with last year at $295,200 and the average size of our homes closed was down 3% reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Net sales orders in the third quarter increased 38% to 21,519 homes and the value of those orders was $6.3 billion, up 35% from $4.7 billion in the prior year. Our average number of active selling communities was essentially unchanged from both the prior year and sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter was $294,500, down 2% from the prior year, primarily due to a decline in the average sales price for our West region as more of the region\u2019s mix shifted to our entry level Express brand during the quarter. The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 22%, up from 20% in the prior year quarter. Our net sales orders in both May and June increased by more than 50% compared to the prior year periods. We believe the increase in demand after April has been fueled by increased buyer urgency due to lower interest rates, the limited supply of homes at affordable price points, and to some extent, pent-up demand. We were and remain well-positioned for this increased demand with our affordable product offerings, lots supply and housing inventories, particularly completed homes and those close to completion. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the third quarter was 21.6%, up 30 basis points sequentially from the March quarter and up 130 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. We remain focused on managing the pricing incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the return on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be similar to the third quarter. However, there is uncertainty regarding the future impacts of COVID-19 on the economy and new home demand, which could negatively impact our gross margins in the future. Bill?\nBill Wheat: In the third quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 7.9%, down 20 basis points from 8.1% in the prior year quarter. Our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is at its lowest point in our history and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring that our infrastructure appropriately supports our business. Mike?\nMike Murray: We ended the third quarter with 32,800 homes in inventory. 12,700 of our total homes were unsold, of which 2,900 were completed. We also had 1,900 model homes at the end of the quarter. Due to our significant increase in sales in May and June, the portion of our backlog that is not yet under construction is higher than normal and our number of completed unsold homes is lower than in recent years. As a result, we have accelerated our pace of home starts across most of our communities to ensure we maintain an adequate number of homes available for sale in each community to meet demand. At June 30, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 335,000 lots, of which 34% were owned and 66% were controlled through purchase contracts. 32% of our total own lots are finished and at least 52% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our current lot portfolio includes an ample supply of lots for homes at affordable price points and continues to provide us a strong competitive position. David?\nDavid Auld: Our third quarter homebuilding investment in lots land and development totaled $1.1 billion, of which $390 million was for finished lots, $380 million was for land development, and $290 million was for land. $180 million of our land and lot purchases in the third quarter were for Forestar. After slowing our lots and land and development investments in March and April, we have since increased our pace of investments to ensure we maintain an adequate number of finished lots to support our home construction base. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Forestar, our major \u2013 our majority owned subsidiary, is a publicly traded residential lot manufacturer operating in 51 markets across 22 states. Our strategic relationship with Forestar as a well-capitalized lot supplier across much of our operating footprint is serving us well during this volatile time and is presenting opportunities for both companies to gain market share. Forestar is delivering on its high growth expectations with revenue growth of more than 200% and net income growth of 80% fiscal year-to-date in 2020. At June 30, Forestar\u2019s lot position consisted of 50,700 lots, of which 38,300 are owned and 12,400 are controlled through purchase contracts. 77% of Forestar\u2019s owned lots are already under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under our master supply agreement. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and has approximately $700 million of liquidity, which includes $350 million of unrestricted cash and $350 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. At June 30, Forestar\u2019s net debt-to-capital ratio was 25.2% and their next senior note maturity is in 2024. With low leverage, ample liquidity, and its relationship with D.R. Horton; Forestar is in a very strong position to navigate through changing economic conditions and continue to grow their business. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Financial services pre-tax income in the third quarter was $68.8 million with a pre-tax profit margin of 43.9% compared to $48.1 million and 40.2% in the prior year quarter. Despite the disruption in the secondary mortgage markets in March and April caused by COVID-19 and the uncertainty of the impact of the CARES Act, our mortgage company has continued selling the mortgages that originates at strong net gains. We began retaining servicing rights on some of our FHA and VA loan originations during the third quarter due to disruptions among mortgage servicers and we will continue to monitor developments in the mortgage markets and adjust our operations to adapt to changes in market conditions. For the quarter, 97% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 71% of our home buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 53% of the mortgage company\u2019s volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 718 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 91%. First-time homebuyers represented 57% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, reflecting our continued focus on offering homes at affordable price points. Mike?\nMike Murray: DHI Communities is our multifamily rental company focused on suburban garden style apartments that had four projects under active construction and one project that was substantially complete at the end of the quarter. After selling two projects earlier this fiscal year, no other projects were slated to be marketed and sold during our third or fourth quarters of fiscal 2020. We expect to market and sell a couple of projects in fiscal 2021, based on our current pace of construction and leasing activity. After pausing construction starts and new acquisitions by DHI Communities in March, April, and May, we began selectively resuming plans for new projects in June and we still plan to grow the DHI Communities platform. DHI Communities assets totaled $225 million at June 30. We also continue to evaluate our opportunities in the market for single family rental homes. We are currently building and leasing homes in nine single family rental communities across our operations, as we are in the early stages of our participation in this growing segment of the housing market. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. During the 9 months ended June, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $1.2 billion compared to $606 million in the prior year period. At June 30, we had $3.7 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of $1.9 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.8 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facilities. Our homebuilding leverage was 18.4% at the end of June, was $2.4 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding, and $400 million of senior note maturities in the next 12 months. At June 30, our stockholders equity was $11 billion and book value per share was $30.38, up 16% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months into June, our return on equity was 19.9% compared to 17.3% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $64 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in August. We did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter and we expect to cautiously manage our level of share repurchases in the near-term to maintain financial flexibility until we have better visibility to future market conditions and our expected operating results. Our outstanding share count is down 2% from a year ago and we currently have an outstanding share repurchase authorization of $535 million. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: As we noted last quarter, due to the uncertainty in the U.S. economy and our business operations from COVID-19, we withdrew our guidance for fiscal 2020. Based on today\u2019s market conditions, we are now providing our expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. In the fourth quarter, we expect to generate consolidated revenues in the range of $5.5 billion to $5.8 billion and to close approximately 18,000 to 19,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be similar to the third quarter in the mid 21% range and humbling SG&A in the fourth quarter to be 8% to 8.2% of homebuilding revenues. We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin in the fourth quarter of approximately 40% and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 23%. We plan to provide annual guidance for fiscal 2021 when we have sufficient visibility into market conditions hopefully on our next earnings call in early November. David?\nDavid Auld: In closing, our results reflect the strength of our experienced operational teams and it\u2019s relating market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions. And we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts during this time have been remarkable. We are proud of your work ethic and your positive spirit as you safely continue helping our customers close on their much anticipated new homes. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Your line is now live.\nAlan Ratner: Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on a great quarter and glad to hear everyone is doing well. First question, on the spec inventory supply, not surprisingly came down quite a bit just given the dynamics in the quarter and how strong demand was there. And you mentioned obviously a greater percentage of your backlog right now has not yet started, which makes a lot of sense. I am just curious as you ramp your start activity here and I am sure other builders are doing the same to not only build out your existing backlog, but replace the spec inventory presumably, what are you seeing on the labor side as far as any tightness there, any inflation that\u2019s starting to build up, because it seems like there is a pretty healthy ramp and starts coming?\nDavid Auld: Labor has been a challenge throughout this entire market cycle. So, we focused early on, on driving efficiency through the operation, partnering with our labor trades and have seen the benefit of that all the way through this cycle. The reality is, as I think Mike will tell you, the build cycles continue to be very, very stable and just the process of how we build and how we treat our trades has proven to be very effective in managing this situation.\nAlan Ratner: Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Second question, so as you start to think about \u201821 here, the sustainability of this demand is certainly a big question at this point, in the last several years, you have done a handful of M&A transactions on the private side and I am curious you mentioned buyback \u2013 potential buyback activity, how are you thinking about M&A right here given the climate and what are you seeing as far as the pipeline is concerned?\nBill Wheat: Good morning, Alan. We continue to evaluate different opportunities and it still comes down to where we can add, add to the long-term value of the company, where we can add product and new customer base to serve, but more importantly, people that are accretive to the operating teams. So we continue to talk with several private builders, where we are more inclined to look at the tuck-ins that we have done either adding to existing markets or opening up new markets for us. But you won\u2019t see us probably do any massive public acquisitions, but I do think we will continue to evaluate the smaller privates.\nAlan Ratner: Have you seen any changes in the privates\u2019 willingness to sell just given kind of the uncertainty in the climate today or has this bounced back in activity perhaps emboldened them a little bit to remain an independent company?\nBill Wheat: I would say, it\u2019s both and it\u2019s going to vary based upon the situation of a particular private builder as to whether they are thinking it\u2019s still a good place to be or if it\u2019s time for them to do something different and to join a bigger operation.\nAlan Ratner: Understood. Okay, guys. Thanks a lot. Good luck.\nBill Wheat: Thank you.\nDavid Auld: I will add that we don\u2019t \u2013 we are not in a position where we need to go at. And it really does have to be a great fit and at this point they would have to want to join our family and it\u2019s not going to be a stretch kind of a win-win for them and us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nStephen Kim: Thanks very much, guys. Yes, I wanted to follow-up on the cycle time and spec question that Alan just asked. So you mentioned cycle times are very stable. That\u2019s obviously extremely encouraging and exemplary, I would say. But we have seen your specs are down and obviously demand has surged significantly. So I guess the bottom line question for me is would you like to increase your spec levels from where they are today and are you able to do so in an environment, where demand is as strong as it has been?\nMike Murray: Answer to your first question, yes, Stephen, we would like to increase our spec levels today. We have aggressive starts planned to increase our specs. At the same time, we will be starting our sold homes. And so it is a big plan to start houses. But as David mentioned before, we have been focusing early on, on the efficiency, in the product, in the operational focus and partnering with our trades and being true that they are capable of supporting the growth that we have in front of us. So we do think we will be able to increase our spec inventory, but it\u2019s not going to be without a lot of effort, I can promise you that.\nDavid Auld: The focus right now is on driving a consistent sustainable start program, week to week, project by project. And as we continue to execute that, I think our spec accounts will come to what we historically have carried.\nStephen Kim: Yes, that\u2019s great. Very encouraging to hear and obviously we would \u2013 we look to Horton to take on those challenges. I wanted to ask a second question about pricing and the pricing environment. It would \u2013 it seems obviously that Express remains extremely strong. I am curious if you are seeing increased interest in Freedom and the traditional, D.R. Horton business more recently and whether that allows for a little bit more pricing flexibility perhaps than we had seen in the past, particularly the D.R. Horton semi-custom business. And a second half of that question is whether or not you are seeing the mix of local demand versus out-of-state demand driving what you saw in May and June and is there a difference in your ability to price \u2013 push price for when you are selling to a local versus out-of-state?\nDavid Auld: I would say, as to the branding, we are seeing uptick in demand for both Freedom and the D.R. Horton brand. As to the state question, I would say we\u2019re seeing increase in demand from both of my profiles. The relocation of people down to a more affordable tax-friendly environment continues. I think COVID maybe is even accelerating that. Pricing is something we track week-to-week, based upon demand at each individual flag and it\u2019s kind of \u2013 I\u2019ve always considered pricing at our sites. You want to \u2013 you never want to be in a position where you push pricing so hard that you have to come back and adjust it back down. You always want people to feel like if they buy today, they will save a little bit money \u2013 they will save money versus buying 6 months or a year from now. So, fortunately, our company, the entire structure and mentality is that those decisions are made in the individual communities and divisions and the people that are closest to the market actually, we feel make a better decision than we can make up here.\nStephen Kim: Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks a lot, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nJohn Lovallo: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one, May and June at 50% year-over-year order growth is clearly very encouraging. Just I know you said July was strong, David. Just curious if you could help us frame that in any way how strong it was on a year-over-year basis?\nDavid Auld: It\u2019s consistent with what we saw in May and June.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay, that\u2019s\u2026\nDavid Auld: It really is a testimony to our people and our positioning out there, but it\u2019s a very-very-very good market right now.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay. That\u2019s really encouraging. With that in mind, the overall tone maybe could be seen as just slightly more cautious than some of your peers, which is I think consistent with how you guys have always sort of run the business and I think it\u2019s prudent. But just curious, is this really conservatism just given unemployment, COVID, things that could happen or are you seeing any signs anywhere of any slowing in traffic or whatever it might be?\nDavid Auld: No signs of slowing. It\u2019s just a lot of uncertainty out there that is completely outside of our control. If you just look at long-term price in the industry, demographics, where the supply is versus where the future demand is going to be or should be even today, you got to feel very-very good about the long term. But in this industry, I mean you saw what happened at the end of March completely out from nowhere. So, I do think we will have a lot more visibility as we get into the November/December time period next year, and hopefully we can reinstate the guidance numbers that we can then turnaround again.\nJohn Lovallo: Thank you very much.\nDavid Auld: We are always going to be conservative. I mean, if you got Bill Wheat for a CFO, you are going to have conservative.\nJohn Lovallo: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Your line is now live.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I\u2019m going back to Alan and Steve\u2019s question about spec and the amount of unsold you have. And maybe Mike or David, is this \u2013 if you look at your backlog \u2013 your sold backlog, are you closer to completion with that than you would typically be at this time of year? And of your unsold spec, are you closer to finishing that than you normally would be this time of year?\nMike Murray: So, I would say that we are generally going to be in line with \u2013 the started sold homes are across the range of production largely at this time of the year, delivering into the fourth quarter and similar with the specs. We are probably maybe a little bit less finished with the specs because of the strong sales demand that we\u2019ve had, they\u2019ve moved to the sold category and we have them sort of set to close, if you will \u2013 sold to close in the September quarter. So, we feel really good about the ability to deliver the fourth quarter and the starts plan that we have out and the building permits we\u2019re able to accumulate. We feel good about being able to reload the inventory and bring us back to sustainable inventory levels we need to support the demand.\nCarl Reichardt: Okay. Thanks Mike. Obviously, it\u2019s a function of the vagaries of this market, so just trying to understand the math. And then just a bigger picture question, in your release and on the call, you talked about low rates motivating folks and maybe some pent-up demand, didn\u2019t talk about this idea of deurbanization or dedensification driving demand. And I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s something you think you\u2019ve seen and if you have some sort of sense from the field or math that tells you that you\u2019re seeing more and more folks coming from urban areas to purchase homes in suburbs or exurbs? I\u2019d just like your observations on that. Thanks a bunch, folks.\nDavid Auld: I think \u2013 well, this is David. I think that\u2019s a trend that was in place before the COVID-19 program and I think it\u2019s really tied toward the millennial being a more conservative disciplined buyer of homes than previous generations. They were forming households later, having children later, and I think this pandemic has accelerated that trend. And like \u2013 what do you call it \u2013 pent-up demand or pull forward demand or there is just a whole lot of people out there that I think are going to be looking for housing over the next five plus years.\nBill Wheat: Hey, Carl. I think what you are referring to is a longer term trend I think is continuing as I think certainly pandemics had an effect on it. We would generally agree that that is a trend that probably is accelerating right now, but it\u2019s still too early to know the depth of that and the sustainability of it. So, we try to just comment on what we see in front of us and then we\u2019ll live into the rest and be able to comment on the depth of that as time marches on.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks, Bill. Congrats, guys.\nMike Murray: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Your line is now live.\nEric Bosshard: Good morning, sir.\nDavid Auld: Good morning.\nEric Bosshard: Yes, good morning. Curious, in terms of what your plans are in terms of price and incentive. I know you had talked previously a quarter ago about sustaining incentives. But seeing where orders are, your inventory appears healthy; what is the strategy in terms of price and incentive in total? And then secondly, if you could just drill a little bit more into California specifically on that question as well.\nMike Murray: So, broadly on the price and incentive, as David mentioned before, it\u2019s a very local decision that\u2019s made. I can tell you that we did see very strong sales demand and so the level of incentives we were offering on sales later in the quarter were much lower than where we opened the quarter with. So, we did see firming pricing trends, firming incentives and in turn \u2013 but to see where that\u2019s going to go, we\u2019re going to need the market and right now we feel really strong about the sales trends that we\u2019re seeing without needing to do heavy incentives. But everyday, at Horton Communities, there is some level of incentives and potential pricing adjustments to meet the market whether that\u2019s up or down, and we do see tremendous value created with the urgency for buyers, as David mentioned before, feeling like they will save a little bit of money if they act today rather than wait for a few more weeks.\nDavid Auld: As to California, we are seeing stability and consistency out there today. We have reset our product and positioning out there to the entry level pretty much everywhere we can and it\u2019s driving better returns today than it has in the last 4 or 5 years.\nEric Bosshard: Great. And then just one follow-up if I could. In terms of land acquisition as demand has improved broadly and it appears that builders broadly are more active and aggressive in buying land, anything you are seeing different in terms of the competitive environment for securing land or any impact that\u2019s having on the cost of securing land?\nDavid Auld: Land prices are going to go up as absorptions continue to move up. So, our focus has been and will continue to be relationships with the developers. The fact that our operational teams in these markets have been there a long time, have great relationships with land sellers I think gives us some advantage. Our ability to close gives us an advantage. Our absorptions per flag, if you are developing lots, you want to be selling to somebody who is going to drive very high absorptions. So it\u2019s \u2013 I do believe we have a competitive advantage, people and capital and just operational efficiency. So I can tell you right now we are seeing a lot of deals. The COVID scare, I think, really created opportunities for us to open relationships with sellers that had been primarily selling through other competitors. So, feel very good about our land position today and the things we put in place to sustain that over time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Rehaut: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone and congrats on the results. First question, I didn\u2019t catch and apologies if you had mentioned it, what your average community count did this quarter either sequentially or on a year-over-year basis? And obviously with the incredible amount of strength and sell-through right now, if you can give us any sense of higher thinking 4Q might trend at least in the near-term?\nJessica Hansen: Sure, Mike. Our community count was flat both sequentially and year-over-year. And as you can imagine, with our very strong sales pace, we might not be in a position to see community count growth in Q4. It will probably stay closer to flat, maybe slightly down. But we have the lot position to continue to deliver homes and communities going forward. So, we feel very confident in our ability to continue to drive absorptions and ultimately have some community count growth that may just be pushed a little bit further out later next year.\nMichael Rehaut: Okay. Also with \u2013 I was just kind of curious about kind of on this topic, with Forestar, giving out guidance of midpoint of about 11,000 lot deliveries for next year and I believe that was a little bit below their prior guidance, pre-COVID and understanding that obviously there is a disruption perhaps in some of the development activities for a month or two. At the same time, you guys are looking at very, very strong results currently and into July, I was just trying to get a sense for maybe how that reconciles, Forestar maybe looking at a bit less of a delivery year than originally planned despite demand coming back extremely strong for you. How those two kind of fact patterns work against each other, because I would have thought perhaps and maybe it\u2019s just a more of a timing issue, but a 1,000 lots is not immaterial, so, just trying to get a sense of how to reconcile those two data points?\nBill Wheat: Yes, Mike, it is primarily timing. It\u2019s July of 2020. And Forestar was reestablishing just preliminary delivery guidance for fiscal \u201821 at a time in which their largest company \u2013 largest customers not providing 2021 guidance. So, it\u2019s just early, felt like it was important for Forestar to reestablish at least a baseline expectation for their top line growth next year given that they are truly a growth story and the revenues have been up over 200% this year, but it is a bit conservative we hope. And as we live over the next few months and as D.R. Horton gets sufficient visibility to provide guidance for fiscal 2021, our hope would be if certainly if demand trends continue as they are right now, the strength continues in the industry, I would expect that Forestar would ultimately be able to exceed that and increase their guidance over time. This is really timing.\nMichael Rehaut: Alright, alright. One more quick one if I could \u2013 if I could squeeze another one in. On the gross margins, obviously, a lot of strength there and you mentioned that you are getting some pricing power back obviously, which makes sense? Is there \u2013 and I know you are not giving fiscal \u201821 guidance at this point, but just conceptually perhaps, if you are looking at your gross margins and backlog currently and what you are seeing on the ground, in terms of just achieving some incremental pricing, achieving some incremental scales, etcetera. Is there any reason to think that you wouldn\u2019t be able to hit like the 22% gross margin next year with all those factors just given the momentum you have right now. Again, just trying to think conceptually, obviously, I know you are not giving guidance right now, but just along those lines, if you have any thoughts?\nMike Murray: Conceptually, we would love the 22% gross margin. But looking forward, we could see that there could be some headwind coming at us from lumber later into the fourth quarter and into early \u201922 \u2013 early \u201821 excuse me, I am getting confused in my ears. And we do have a backdrop right now of the strong demand environment and some pricing power and relief on incentives. So, we have some positive tailwinds, but we also have some headwinds and there is still the broader outlook that we are looking at here of what\u2019s going to happen in the economy and how the pandemic progresses through the fall and into the winter of next year. So we feel very good about being consistent with our level of margins to drive the right pace that ultimately for us is looking to drive the right return and that\u2019s what we are ultimately looking at it every community says how we maximize the return we built with every [indiscernible].\nJessica Hansen: Yes, our company-wide \u2013 I apologize for the background noise on the line. I am not sure where that\u2019s coming from. Okay. And in terms of our overall company-wide ROI, Mike, we are at 21.6%, which I think is probably a record return on inventory that we have generated that delivering, almost 20% return on equity as well. So we will continue to balance that pace in prices, as Mike mentioned, to maximize returns for both inventory and equity.\nMike Murray: Mike, you are off mute, now go ahead, if you said something, sorry.\nMichael Rehaut: Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nMatthew Bouley: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I hope everyone is doing well. I wanted to stick with the gross margin side. I guess, specifically just given some of the underlying pricing strength in the market, how are spec margins comparing versus to be built today? And going forward, when you have this decline in available spec here and in particularly, finished spec, how should we think about what the implication to gross margins would be as a result of that? Thank you.\nDavid Auld: Certainly, in a strong demand environment where we have been selling a lot of completed specs, the gap between margins between specs and built-to-order is narrower than normal, but still, typically we do still see higher gross margins on a on a built-to-order versus the spec, but today that gap is a little tighter than usual.\nMatthew Bouley: Okay, understood. And then just secondly and apologies if I missed this, but, Bill, if you could speak a little bit about the share repurchase plans and sort of what it will take to help to kind of foster reaccelerating that? Thank you.\nDavid Auld: Sure. There is a lot of moving pieces right now. We went through a very volatile quarter in terms of demand in terms of what we had to do in our operations and in the adjustments we have made there and still going forward, it\u2019s in our forward visibility. We are seeing extremely strong demand. We have seen a sell-through of our spec inventory. So we are actively reaccelerating our specs now. So first and foremost, we are focused on our business and what we feel like we need to reinvest to keep our spec inventory at the level we would like and keep our lot inventory replenished. And so until we get a better sense of what that need is in the core business, then we will adjust our \u2013 then we will put our plans in place for share repurchase over the next few months, we will be sitting down with all of our operators across the company and putting in place our business plans for fiscal \u201821. And as we get that set, then that will help further define and give us better clarity on what we\u2019ll do in terms of our share repurchase. So, our statement is we are going to cautiously manage our share repurchase and we still have an authorization in place and we\u2019ll update those plans accordingly as we get better visibility in our business.\nMatthew Bouley: Great. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nTruman Patterson: Hi, good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. So, just I don\u2019t think anybody is really expecting you to run at 50% plus order growth forever just given the supply side constraints. Are you all really focused on thinking in the next quarter to pushing price a little bit harder to kind of curb these absorptions or are you pretty comfortable at this pace in running at these absorptions given your community count and lot count and everything, just trying to understand which lever you are really trying to lean on a bit more going forward?\nDavid Auld: Right now, we are very comfortable with our lot position going out into \u201821. We have seen significant and competitive advantage results from the continued consolidation and market share gains. There is \u2013 what we focus on internally is consistent sustainable operations and feel very good about our pace right now. The market is certainly there and the pricing side \u2013 short-term price increases actually increase demand sometimes. So, again, it\u2019s an art and we leave those decisions to local markets. So, like Bill said, over the next 30 days we will be putting together an operating plan for \u201821 finalizing. I guess, we\u2019ve had one for some time, but finalizing it and that will drive a lot more visibility about how we\u2019re going to position for \u201821 and then \u201822 and then \u201823.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Thanks for that. It sounds like your lot positions may be bucking some of the industry trends recently. If I look at your fourth quarter implied backlog conversion rate, it looks like it falls to about 80%, the lowest level in \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 five years or so. I think that\u2019s pretty clearly a function of construction delays or maybe lack of starts during COVID. Do you think that you can get that back up and running where your backlog conversion gets to kind of normalized or flat in the first quarter of \u201821 or second quarter of \u201821 somewhere in there? And then also on that, how long do you think it will take for you to get your spec count kind of normalized in today\u2019s market?\nBill Wheat: Well, yes. First, we are not seeing really construction delays. Our cycle times have been very consistent really throughout. And backlog conversion really isn\u2019t a stat that we focus too much on. We focus more on our inventory position and our inventory turns. And right now, we\u2019re seeing our inventory turns accelerate. Our sales pace obviously has increased dramatically in the last few months, which did work down our completed homes \u2013 completed specs. So, our completed spec inventory is lower than it has been in some time. Also, the component of our backlog that is sold, but not started is higher than normal. So, as we accelerate our starts pace, that will bring those to back to a closer \u2013 closer to a normal level, and we expect to still deliver very strong volume. But it takes really our lot position and our home position to support that.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Asked another way, your inventory turns will probably be lower in 4Q do you think that kind of gets back to more normalized levels in the first half of \u201821, would that be the case you will see?\nBill Wheat: I think they are likely. I think our inventory turns are actually higher than they were a year-ago and I think Q4 will continue that way. I think that was part of our original guidance for fiscal \u201820, was that we expected to turn our housing inventory more quickly this year and that is what we are doing.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nSusan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question is just around \u2013 obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty as we think about the broader macro environment. And given your buyer base, have you done any analysis or have any thoughts on the impact of the reduction in the stimulus programs that are scheduled to come up later this week? How do you think that that has kind of played into the demand that you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of months and how are you thinking about it going forward if there are changes there?\nMike Murray: Good morning. I am sorry, go ahead.\nDavid Auld: No, you go ahead.\nMike Murray: What I think we are seeing with most of our buyers and the traffic we are seeing is that those people are not directly participating in a lot of the stimulus programs or relief packages that are out there. The underwriting required for a mortgage today is generally going to first start with a job and a steady predictable income stream. And so, we\u2019ve not seen a direct impact to that. To the extent there is a broader follow through to the economy, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. That\u2019s part of the conservatism I think in our outlook going forward is to see how that plays through in the broader economy.\nDavid Auld: And just to add, the amount of stimulus that\u2019s already been pushed out and will continue to be pushed out I think between now and the end of the year is going to impact the markets for multiple years. It\u2019s just a lot of liquidity that will filter through the overall economy and I think have a positive impact on housing and people\u2019s ability to buy a house.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then you noted in your commentary that the average size of the home came down 3% in the quarter. But as we kind of look out at some of the secular shifts that are perhaps coming through from COVID, more people working from home, their kids being home a lot more; are you seeing any of your buyers that are actually looking for a slightly larger home or more space or any kind of changes to the layout?\nMike Murray: We are seeing more consideration given to a setting that accommodates a better work-from-home environment, whether it\u2019s an extra bedroom to be used for a classroom, an office, a playroom that provides a little more space. But a lot of our floor plans today accommodate at a lesser aggregate square footage, a lot of very functional space, whether that\u2019s flex rooms or four bedrooms that work very well for them today. So, we are really pleased with the product offering that we have out there. But fortunately, in most of our neighborhoods, we are able to respond to buyer demand very quickly and adjust to what the current buyers in our sales offices are asking for with our inventory homes with the next round of starts we have in given neighborhood.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is now live.\nBuck Horne: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Question on SG&A a little bit, as you are trying to ramp back up on the land spend and get some more flags in the ground, is there any sort of near-term disrupt \u2013 not disruption, but are you going to have to reinvest in hiring people or do you need to start reaccelerating technology investments to keep up with the pace of demand right now? Is there anything on the SG&A side that we should consider in the near-term as demand has so rapidly increased that you need to accelerate some investment there?\nBill Wheat: No, Buck, I don\u2019t think we see anything that will move the needle dramatically. It\u2019s just a continuation of what we\u2019ve been doing. We did briefly have a hiring freeze during that month or so at the beginning of the pandemic, but we\u2019re back to normal in terms of hiring across our homebuilding and financial services operation. We are growing the business. We are always hiring and adding where we need to. Same thing on technology, we\u2019ve been making continuing investments over the last number of years and we\u2019ve redirected some of those during the pandemic to address the work-from-home environment and a few things like that, but those expenditures are not anything that\u2019s really out that it\u2019s going to move the needle in total, because there\u2019s also things we\u2019re not spending as much money on today. Travel is not as big a portion of our spending as in the past. Hopefully at some point it can be. But we are in a company lull in terms of our historical SG&A percentages and expect to be able to stay at that level going forward.\nBuck Horne: Alright, great. Congrats and very helpful. Thank you. Next question just is on the single-family rental component. It seems like your thoughts have evolved on that potential market opportunity and what you\u2019re seeing in terms of maybe the potential for a build for rent product offering in your communities. I just wonder if you could expand upon your thoughts at this point. Is that something you would like to have a portfolio that you could operate internally? Would you look to sell those as you build them or partner with another operator? Just how do you think about single family rentals at this point?\nMike Murray: Buck, that\u2019s something that we\u2019re still learning our way into. We feel really good about the handful of communities, I believe nine communities today that we have homes being constructed for the purpose of rental and we will have to see. We will have to see what the market brings us if we bring some of those communities to market for sale or if we build a portfolio to operate or aggregate to a portfolio for eventual disposition. It\u2019s something we are learning our way into today. So we will be back with you as that progresses.\nBuck Horne: Okay, fair enough. I appreciate it. Thanks and congrats on the quarter.\nMike Murray: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nMike Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question I wanted to go back to the sold but not started in backlog and I think you guys mentioned a few times and Bill, you responded to a previous question that percentage is higher than normal, which makes sense. Could you actually \u2013 could you give us what that percentage is in terms of what\u2019s sold but not started and how that compares on a year-over-year basis? And maybe as part of that, I don\u2019t know if you have any quantification of kind of like what an average \u2013 I know your build cycle is flat, but what an average delivery quote would be in terms of what you are able to quote to new buyers today versus what you would normally be able to?\nMike Murray: I\u2019ll take the second part of the question while Bill and Jessica are looking for the answer to the first part. Right now, we would not be able to quote to you an average because it\u2019s going to vary based upon which community you\u2019re in and the level of production that\u2019s available within that community and the type of product that it is. In some communities, we have a very quick build time and can deliver homes from start to completion in three months. In others it may be a four or five-month build cycle. And then generally, we\u2019re looking if we have inventory that\u2019s available to move in within the next 30 days as soon as you can clarify your mortgage situation and get qualified. We\u2019d like to have a home that\u2019s ready for you as soon as you can \u2013 you need it.\nMike Dahl: Got it. Thanks.\nJessica Hansen: And then, Mike, on the sold not started, we\u2019re running low double digit a little over 10% sold not started, which we normally I think would be in a low single-digit percentage. Maybe\u2026.\nMike Dahl: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And then second question and not to belabor the pace versus price too much, but understanding that it\u2019s a local decision. The \u2013 are you getting the sense that your local operators are \u2013 given some of the uncertainty that may still be out there, they are making the decision to let pace run a little hard for the foreseeable future just to capture what\u2019s out there while it\u2019s still out there type of mentality versus those operators pushing price more aggressively. I know you talked about incentives coming down but just wondering if you have kind of a pulse of what your local operators are leaning toward today?\nDavid Auld: Mike, the pace versus price versus margin has a lot to do with community size or it is in the community. You may push price in a community where you\u2019re on the back end of it and your deliveries sales pace is going to be three or four months\u2019 worth of inventory or 6 or 7 months\u2019 worth of inventory. And then you have other communities where you might have a thousand lots in front of you and driving pace actually generates a higher return than trying to find that absolute right margin dollar that either cuts off sales or allows sales to increase. And we trust our operators in the field to make those decisions we incentivize them to make good decisions. And it\u2019s a model that\u2019s been a part of the company for the 32 years I\u2019ve been here and it seems to be working. So, it really is a community by community process.\nMike Dahl: Got it. Thanks. Just a quick follow-up to that then, as you think about the 2021 plans, is that when you may introduce a little more kind of nudging in one direction versus the other or is it you\u2019re really just \u2013 I mean, what you are seeing today is pleasing in terms of how everything is being managed?\nDavid Auld: We could do better and we can make better decisions pretty much every day. You get up and don\u2019t make a mistake, you probably didn\u2019t do anything. So, we\u2019re going to walk through communities with our operators and we\u2019re going to talk to them. Are you making the decision that is going to drive the highest return for the shareholder? But ultimately, what we have seen over years and years and years is that when you empower people and you give them authority and responsibility, they become better managers and their relationship \u2013 it\u2019s a culture. I mean, it\u2019s who we are. And we are just not going to sit up here and try to drive pricing decisions in a community and pick any market you want to.\nMike Dahl: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to David for any further or closing comments.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everybody\u2019s time on the call today and look forward to speaking to you again in November. And to the D.R. Horton family, once again, you have outperformed the industry, setting record \u2013 all-time record for sales \u2013 21,500 sales, unbelievable accomplishment. D.R. Horton, the entire executive team, we are humbled and thankful that we are here to represent you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "content": "Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 37% to $1.72 per share compared to $1.26 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 33% to $631 million compared to $475 million. The current quarter results, included income tax benefit of $38.1 million related to federal energy efficient home tax credits that were retroactively reinstated earlier in the year. Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 10% to $5.2 billion on 17,642 homes closed, up from $4.7 billion on 15,971 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was essentially flat with last year at $295,200 and the average size of our homes closed was down 3% reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill? We ended the third quarter with 32,800 homes in inventory. 12,700 of our total homes were unsold, of which 2,900 were completed. We also had 1,900 model homes at the end of the quarter. Due to our significant increase in sales in May and June, the portion of our backlog that is not yet under construction is higher than normal and our number of completed unsold homes is lower than in recent years. As a result, we have accelerated our pace of home starts across most of our communities to ensure we maintain an adequate number of homes available for sale in each community to meet demand. At June 30, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 335,000 lots, of which 34% were owned and 66% were controlled through purchase contracts. 32% of our total own lots are finished and at least 52% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our current lot portfolio includes an ample supply of lots for homes at affordable price points and continues to provide us a strong competitive position. David? DHI Communities is our multifamily rental company focused on suburban garden style apartments that had four projects under active construction and one project that was substantially complete at the end of the quarter. After selling two projects earlier this fiscal year, no other projects were slated to be marketed and sold during our third or fourth quarters of fiscal 2020. We expect to market and sell a couple of projects in fiscal 2021, based on our current pace of construction and leasing activity. After pausing construction starts and new acquisitions by DHI Communities in March, April, and May, we began selectively resuming plans for new projects in June and we still plan to grow the DHI Communities platform. DHI Communities assets totaled $225 million at June 30. We also continue to evaluate our opportunities in the market for single family rental homes. We are currently building and leasing homes in nine single family rental communities across our operations, as we are in the early stages of our participation in this growing segment of the housing market. Bill? Answer to your first question, yes, Stephen, we would like to increase our spec levels today. We have aggressive starts planned to increase our specs. At the same time, we will be starting our sold homes. And so it is a big plan to start houses. But as David mentioned before, we have been focusing early on, on the efficiency, in the product, in the operational focus and partnering with our trades and being true that they are capable of supporting the growth that we have in front of us. So we do think we will be able to increase our spec inventory, but it's not going to be without a lot of effort, I can promise you that. So, I would say that we are generally going to be in line with \u2013 the started sold homes are across the range of production largely at this time of the year, delivering into the fourth quarter and similar with the specs. We are probably maybe a little bit less finished with the specs because of the strong sales demand that we've had, they've moved to the sold category and we have them sort of set to close, if you will \u2013 sold to close in the September quarter. So, we feel really good about the ability to deliver the fourth quarter and the starts plan that we have out and the building permits we're able to accumulate. We feel good about being able to reload the inventory and bring us back to sustainable inventory levels we need to support the demand. Thank you. So, broadly on the price and incentive, as David mentioned before, it's a very local decision that's made. I can tell you that we did see very strong sales demand and so the level of incentives we were offering on sales later in the quarter were much lower than where we opened the quarter with. So, we did see firming pricing trends, firming incentives and in turn \u2013 but to see where that's going to go, we're going to need the market and right now we feel really strong about the sales trends that we're seeing without needing to do heavy incentives. But everyday, at Horton Communities, there is some level of incentives and potential pricing adjustments to meet the market whether that's up or down, and we do see tremendous value created with the urgency for buyers, as David mentioned before, feeling like they will save a little bit of money if they act today rather than wait for a few more weeks. Conceptually, we would love the 22% gross margin. But looking forward, we could see that there could be some headwind coming at us from lumber later into the fourth quarter and into early '22 \u2013 early \u201821 excuse me, I am getting confused in my ears. And we do have a backdrop right now of the strong demand environment and some pricing power and relief on incentives. So, we have some positive tailwinds, but we also have some headwinds and there is still the broader outlook that we are looking at here of what's going to happen in the economy and how the pandemic progresses through the fall and into the winter of next year. So we feel very good about being consistent with our level of margins to drive the right pace that ultimately for us is looking to drive the right return and that's what we are ultimately looking at it every community says how we maximize the return we built with every [indiscernible]. Mike, you are off mute, now go ahead, if you said something, sorry. Good morning. I am sorry, go ahead. What I think we are seeing with most of our buyers and the traffic we are seeing is that those people are not directly participating in a lot of the stimulus programs or relief packages that are out there. The underwriting required for a mortgage today is generally going to first start with a job and a steady predictable income stream. And so, we've not seen a direct impact to that. To the extent there is a broader follow through to the economy, we'll have to wait and see. That's part of the conservatism I think in our outlook going forward is to see how that plays through in the broader economy. We are seeing more consideration given to a setting that accommodates a better work-from-home environment, whether it's an extra bedroom to be used for a classroom, an office, a playroom that provides a little more space. But a lot of our floor plans today accommodate at a lesser aggregate square footage, a lot of very functional space, whether that's flex rooms or four bedrooms that work very well for them today. So, we are really pleased with the product offering that we have out there. But fortunately, in most of our neighborhoods, we are able to respond to buyer demand very quickly and adjust to what the current buyers in our sales offices are asking for with our inventory homes with the next round of starts we have in given neighborhood. Buck, that's something that we're still learning our way into. We feel really good about the handful of communities, I believe nine communities today that we have homes being constructed for the purpose of rental and we will have to see. We will have to see what the market brings us if we bring some of those communities to market for sale or if we build a portfolio to operate or aggregate to a portfolio for eventual disposition. It's something we are learning our way into today. So we will be back with you as that progresses. Thank you. I'll take the second part of the question while Bill and Jessica are looking for the answer to the first part. Right now, we would not be able to quote to you an average because it's going to vary based upon which community you're in and the level of production that's available within that community and the type of product that it is. In some communities, we have a very quick build time and can deliver homes from start to completion in three months. In others it may be a four or five-month build cycle. And then generally, we're looking if we have inventory that's available to move in within the next 30 days as soon as you can clarify your mortgage situation and get qualified. We'd like to have a home that's ready for you as soon as you can \u2013 you need it."

            "name": "David Auld",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica and good morning. I am pleased to be joined \u2013 to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We would like to first again express our gratitude to our country's dedicated field of healthcare workers and to all who are on the frontlines caring for our communities. Our thoughts remain with those affected by this pandemic and our priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees, customers, trade partners and the communities we serve. During the latter part of March, the impacts of COVID-19 and related widespread reductions in economic activity across the United States began to negatively affect our business. During April, when restrictive stay-at-home orders were in place for most of our markets, our sales orders decreased and our cancellations increased and our April net sales orders were 1% lower than a year ago. However, as restrictive orders began to be lifted across many markets and economic activity resumed, our sales increased significantly and our cancellations rate returned to normal levels. In both May and June, our net sales orders increased by more than 50% compared to the prior year periods, resulting in a net sales order increase of 38% for the quarter. We sold 5,931 more homes this quarter than the same quarter last year, positioning D.R. Horton to achieve further gains in market share and scale. We have continued to see strong increases in net sales orders in July compared to the same month last year. Despite the disruption from COVID-19 on our operations, the D.R. Horton team delivered a record third quarter, including net sales orders of 21,519 homes, a 25% increase in consolidated pre-tax income to $782 million and a 10% increase in revenues to $5.4 billion. Our pre-tax profit margin for the quarter improved 170 basis points to 14.5%, while our EPS increased 37% to $1.72 per diluted share. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 21.6% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 19.9%. While housing market conditions are very strong today, we remain cautious as to the impact that COVID-19 may have on the overall economy and our operations in the future. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity position and experienced operating teams, position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible, operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales base and inventory levels to optimize return on our inventory investments in each of our communities based on local housing market conditions. Mike? Our third quarter homebuilding investment in lots land and development totaled $1.1 billion, of which $390 million was for finished lots, $380 million was for land development, and $290 million was for land. $180 million of our land and lot purchases in the third quarter were for Forestar. After slowing our lots and land and development investments in March and April, we have since increased our pace of investments to ensure we maintain an adequate number of finished lots to support our home construction base. Bill? In closing, our results reflect the strength of our experienced operational teams and it's relating market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions. And we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts during this time have been remarkable. We are proud of your work ethic and your positive spirit as you safely continue helping our customers close on their much anticipated new homes. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Labor has been a challenge throughout this entire market cycle. So, we focused early on, on driving efficiency through the operation, partnering with our labor trades and have seen the benefit of that all the way through this cycle. The reality is, as I think Mike will tell you, the build cycles continue to be very, very stable and just the process of how we build and how we treat our trades has proven to be very effective in managing this situation. I will add that we don't \u2013 we are not in a position where we need to go at. And it really does have to be a great fit and at this point they would have to want to join our family and it's not going to be a stretch kind of a win-win for them and us. The focus right now is on driving a consistent sustainable start program, week to week, project by project. And as we continue to execute that, I think our spec accounts will come to what we historically have carried. I would say, as to the branding, we are seeing uptick in demand for both Freedom and the D.R. Horton brand. As to the state question, I would say we're seeing increase in demand from both of my profiles. The relocation of people down to a more affordable tax-friendly environment continues. I think COVID maybe is even accelerating that. Pricing is something we track week-to-week, based upon demand at each individual flag and it's kind of \u2013 I've always considered pricing at our sites. You want to \u2013 you never want to be in a position where you push pricing so hard that you have to come back and adjust it back down. You always want people to feel like if they buy today, they will save a little bit money \u2013 they will save money versus buying 6 months or a year from now. So, fortunately, our company, the entire structure and mentality is that those decisions are made in the individual communities and divisions and the people that are closest to the market actually, we feel make a better decision than we can make up here. It's consistent with what we saw in May and June. It really is a testimony to our people and our positioning out there, but it's a very-very-very good market right now. No signs of slowing. It's just a lot of uncertainty out there that is completely outside of our control. If you just look at long-term price in the industry, demographics, where the supply is versus where the future demand is going to be or should be even today, you got to feel very-very good about the long term. But in this industry, I mean you saw what happened at the end of March completely out from nowhere. So, I do think we will have a lot more visibility as we get into the November/December time period next year, and hopefully we can reinstate the guidance numbers that we can then turnaround again. We are always going to be conservative. I mean, if you got Bill Wheat for a CFO, you are going to have conservative. I think \u2013 well, this is David. I think that's a trend that was in place before the COVID-19 program and I think it's really tied toward the millennial being a more conservative disciplined buyer of homes than previous generations. They were forming households later, having children later, and I think this pandemic has accelerated that trend. And like \u2013 what do you call it \u2013 pent-up demand or pull forward demand or there is just a whole lot of people out there that I think are going to be looking for housing over the next five plus years. Good morning. As to California, we are seeing stability and consistency out there today. We have reset our product and positioning out there to the entry level pretty much everywhere we can and it's driving better returns today than it has in the last 4 or 5 years. Land prices are going to go up as absorptions continue to move up. So, our focus has been and will continue to be relationships with the developers. The fact that our operational teams in these markets have been there a long time, have great relationships with land sellers I think gives us some advantage. Our ability to close gives us an advantage. Our absorptions per flag, if you are developing lots, you want to be selling to somebody who is going to drive very high absorptions. So it's \u2013 I do believe we have a competitive advantage, people and capital and just operational efficiency. So I can tell you right now we are seeing a lot of deals. The COVID scare, I think, really created opportunities for us to open relationships with sellers that had been primarily selling through other competitors. So, feel very good about our land position today and the things we put in place to sustain that over time. Certainly, in a strong demand environment where we have been selling a lot of completed specs, the gap between margins between specs and built-to-order is narrower than normal, but still, typically we do still see higher gross margins on a on a built-to-order versus the spec, but today that gap is a little tighter than usual. Sure. There is a lot of moving pieces right now. We went through a very volatile quarter in terms of demand in terms of what we had to do in our operations and in the adjustments we have made there and still going forward, it's in our forward visibility. We are seeing extremely strong demand. We have seen a sell-through of our spec inventory. So we are actively reaccelerating our specs now. So first and foremost, we are focused on our business and what we feel like we need to reinvest to keep our spec inventory at the level we would like and keep our lot inventory replenished. And so until we get a better sense of what that need is in the core business, then we will adjust our \u2013 then we will put our plans in place for share repurchase over the next few months, we will be sitting down with all of our operators across the company and putting in place our business plans for fiscal \u201821. And as we get that set, then that will help further define and give us better clarity on what we'll do in terms of our share repurchase. So, our statement is we are going to cautiously manage our share repurchase and we still have an authorization in place and we'll update those plans accordingly as we get better visibility in our business. Right now, we are very comfortable with our lot position going out into \u201821. We have seen significant and competitive advantage results from the continued consolidation and market share gains. There is \u2013 what we focus on internally is consistent sustainable operations and feel very good about our pace right now. The market is certainly there and the pricing side \u2013 short-term price increases actually increase demand sometimes. So, again, it's an art and we leave those decisions to local markets. So, like Bill said, over the next 30 days we will be putting together an operating plan for \u201821 finalizing. I guess, we've had one for some time, but finalizing it and that will drive a lot more visibility about how we're going to position for \u201821 and then \u201822 and then \u201823. No, you go ahead. And just to add, the amount of stimulus that's already been pushed out and will continue to be pushed out I think between now and the end of the year is going to impact the markets for multiple years. It's just a lot of liquidity that will filter through the overall economy and I think have a positive impact on housing and people's ability to buy a house. Mike, the pace versus price versus margin has a lot to do with community size or it is in the community. You may push price in a community where you're on the back end of it and your deliveries sales pace is going to be three or four months' worth of inventory or 6 or 7 months' worth of inventory. And then you have other communities where you might have a thousand lots in front of you and driving pace actually generates a higher return than trying to find that absolute right margin dollar that either cuts off sales or allows sales to increase. And we trust our operators in the field to make those decisions we incentivize them to make good decisions. And it's a model that's been a part of the company for the 32 years I've been here and it seems to be working. So, it really is a community by community process. We could do better and we can make better decisions pretty much every day. You get up and don't make a mistake, you probably didn't do anything. So, we're going to walk through communities with our operators and we're going to talk to them. Are you making the decision that is going to drive the highest return for the shareholder? But ultimately, what we have seen over years and years and years is that when you empower people and you give them authority and responsibility, they become better managers and their relationship \u2013 it's a culture. I mean, it's who we are. And we are just not going to sit up here and try to drive pricing decisions in a community and pick any market you want to. Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking to you again in November. And to the D.R. Horton family, once again, you have outperformed the industry, setting record \u2013 all-time record for sales \u2013 21,500 sales, unbelievable accomplishment. D.R. Horton, the entire executive team, we are humbled and thankful that we are here to represent you."

            "content": "Net sales orders in the third quarter increased 38% to 21,519 homes and the value of those orders was $6.3 billion, up 35% from $4.7 billion in the prior year. Our average number of active selling communities was essentially unchanged from both the prior year and sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter was $294,500, down 2% from the prior year, primarily due to a decline in the average sales price for our West region as more of the region's mix shifted to our entry level Express brand during the quarter. The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 22%, up from 20% in the prior year quarter. Our net sales orders in both May and June increased by more than 50% compared to the prior year periods. We believe the increase in demand after April has been fueled by increased buyer urgency due to lower interest rates, the limited supply of homes at affordable price points, and to some extent, pent-up demand. We were and remain well-positioned for this increased demand with our affordable product offerings, lots supply and housing inventories, particularly completed homes and those close to completion. Jessica? In the third quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 7.9%, down 20 basis points from 8.1% in the prior year quarter. Our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is at its lowest point in our history and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring that our infrastructure appropriately supports our business. Mike? Forestar, our major \u2013 our majority owned subsidiary, is a publicly traded residential lot manufacturer operating in 51 markets across 22 states. Our strategic relationship with Forestar as a well-capitalized lot supplier across much of our operating footprint is serving us well during this volatile time and is presenting opportunities for both companies to gain market share. Forestar is delivering on its high growth expectations with revenue growth of more than 200% and net income growth of 80% fiscal year-to-date in 2020. At June 30, Forestar's lot position consisted of 50,700 lots, of which 38,300 are owned and 12,400 are controlled through purchase contracts. 77% of Forestar's owned lots are already under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under our master supply agreement. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and has approximately $700 million of liquidity, which includes $350 million of unrestricted cash and $350 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. At June 30, Forestar's net debt-to-capital ratio was 25.2% and their next senior note maturity is in 2024. With low leverage, ample liquidity, and its relationship with D.R. Horton; Forestar is in a very strong position to navigate through changing economic conditions and continue to grow their business. Jessica? Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. During the 9 months ended June, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $1.2 billion compared to $606 million in the prior year period. At June 30, we had $3.7 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of $1.9 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.8 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facilities. Our homebuilding leverage was 18.4% at the end of June, was $2.4 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding, and $400 million of senior note maturities in the next 12 months. At June 30, our stockholders equity was $11 billion and book value per share was $30.38, up 16% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months into June, our return on equity was 19.9% compared to 17.3% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $64 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in August. We did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter and we expect to cautiously manage our level of share repurchases in the near-term to maintain financial flexibility until we have better visibility to future market conditions and our expected operating results. Our outstanding share count is down 2% from a year ago and we currently have an outstanding share repurchase authorization of $535 million. Jessica? Good morning, Alan. We continue to evaluate different opportunities and it still comes down to where we can add, add to the long-term value of the company, where we can add product and new customer base to serve, but more importantly, people that are accretive to the operating teams. So we continue to talk with several private builders, where we are more inclined to look at the tuck-ins that we have done either adding to existing markets or opening up new markets for us. But you won't see us probably do any massive public acquisitions, but I do think we will continue to evaluate the smaller privates. I would say, it's both and it's going to vary based upon the situation of a particular private builder as to whether they are thinking it's still a good place to be or if it's time for them to do something different and to join a bigger operation. Thank you. Hey, Carl. I think what you are referring to is a longer term trend I think is continuing as I think certainly pandemics had an effect on it. We would generally agree that that is a trend that probably is accelerating right now, but it's still too early to know the depth of that and the sustainability of it. So, we try to just comment on what we see in front of us and then we'll live into the rest and be able to comment on the depth of that as time marches on. Yes, Mike, it is primarily timing. It's July of 2020. And Forestar was reestablishing just preliminary delivery guidance for fiscal \u201821 at a time in which their largest company \u2013 largest customers not providing 2021 guidance. So, it's just early, felt like it was important for Forestar to reestablish at least a baseline expectation for their top line growth next year given that they are truly a growth story and the revenues have been up over 200% this year, but it is a bit conservative we hope. And as we live over the next few months and as D.R. Horton gets sufficient visibility to provide guidance for fiscal 2021, our hope would be if certainly if demand trends continue as they are right now, the strength continues in the industry, I would expect that Forestar would ultimately be able to exceed that and increase their guidance over time. This is really timing. Well, yes. First, we are not seeing really construction delays. Our cycle times have been very consistent really throughout. And backlog conversion really isn't a stat that we focus too much on. We focus more on our inventory position and our inventory turns. And right now, we're seeing our inventory turns accelerate. Our sales pace obviously has increased dramatically in the last few months, which did work down our completed homes \u2013 completed specs. So, our completed spec inventory is lower than it has been in some time. Also, the component of our backlog that is sold, but not started is higher than normal. So, as we accelerate our starts pace, that will bring those to back to a closer \u2013 closer to a normal level, and we expect to still deliver very strong volume. But it takes really our lot position and our home position to support that. I think they are likely. I think our inventory turns are actually higher than they were a year-ago and I think Q4 will continue that way. I think that was part of our original guidance for fiscal \u201820, was that we expected to turn our housing inventory more quickly this year and that is what we are doing. No, Buck, I don't think we see anything that will move the needle dramatically. It's just a continuation of what we've been doing. We did briefly have a hiring freeze during that month or so at the beginning of the pandemic, but we're back to normal in terms of hiring across our homebuilding and financial services operation. We are growing the business. We are always hiring and adding where we need to. Same thing on technology, we've been making continuing investments over the last number of years and we've redirected some of those during the pandemic to address the work-from-home environment and a few things like that, but those expenditures are not anything that's really out that it's going to move the needle in total, because there's also things we're not spending as much money on today. Travel is not as big a portion of our spending as in the past. Hopefully at some point it can be. But we are in a company lull in terms of our historical SG&A percentages and expect to be able to stay at that level going forward."

Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.\nDavid Auld: Thank You, Jessica and good morning. Although, we are in different locations while practicing social distancing, I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'd like to first express our gratitude to our country's dedicated field of healthcare workers and all who are on the front lines caring for our communities. Our thoughts remain with those affected by this pandemic and before we talk about our second quarter results, I will address current market conditions while we along with the rest of the world navigate through the impacts of Covid-19 on the economy and our business operations. Housing market and economic fundamentals were solid throughout most of the second quarter as interest rates on mortgage loans remained low, new home demand was strong and there was a limited supply of homes at affordable prices across most of our markets. However, during the latter part of March and into April the impacts of Covid-19 and related widespread reduction in economic activity across the United States began to negatively affect our business operations, as well as the demand for new homes across all of our markets. We experienced increases in sales cancellations and decreases in sales orders in late March in to date in April as compared to the same period last year. In almost all municipalities across the US where social distancing and other restrictions have been implemented, residential construction, lot development, financial services have been designated as essential businesses as part of critical infrastructure. We have continued our operations in those markets were allowed and it made appropriate adjustments to comply with social distancing and other standards as the health safety of our employees, customers and trade partners is our number one priority. We believe we are well prepared to operate in this uncertain environment. With our experienced operating teams, low leverage and a strong liquidity position. We plan to maintain our flexible operations and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations, limiting land acquisition and land development spending and adjusting our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales space and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments in each of the communities based on local housing market conditions. Our team delivered a strong second quarter during this unprecedented time for our nation and while making significant adjustments to our operational practices in March. Our consolidated pretax income for the quarter increased 34% to $621 million on 9% increase in revenues to $4.5 billion. Our pretax profit margin improved 260 basis points to 13.8% and our net sales orders increased 40%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12-months ended March 31st was 20.2% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 19.1%. Mike?\nMike Murray: Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 40% to $1.30 per share compared to $0.93 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 37% to $483 million compared to $351 million. Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 10% to $4.4 billion on 14,539 homes closed, up from $4 billion on 13,480 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was up 2% from last year to $3,100 and the average size of our homes closed was down 2% reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Net sales orders in the second quarter increased 20% to 20,087 and the value of those orders was $6 billion, up 22% from $4.9 billion in the prior year. Our average number of active selling communities increased 1% from the prior year and was flat sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the second quarter was $299,700, up 2% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the second quarter was 19% flat with the same quarter last year. As we disclosed in our preliminary release, our March net sales orders increased 6% from last year to 6,491 homes and our cancellation rate for the month was 24%. As a result of the pandemic, our sales orders began to decrease in late March and into April and our cancellations have remained elevated throughout April to date. Although April is not quite over yet, our net sales orders month-to-date is approximately 11% lower than the same period a year ago. This month-to-date net sales trend may not be indicative of the full month of April because a significant number of our sales cancellations typically occur in the final days of each month. However, we have seen an increase in our net sales order volumes in the most recent two weeks compared to the preceding four weeks. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the second quarter was 21.3%, up 30 basis points sequentially from the December quarter, up 200 basis points compared to the prior year. And in line with our expectations. We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of our communities during this uncertain environment to optimize the return on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. If economic conditions remain difficult and the recent decline in new home demand persists, we expect that our gross margins will decline from current levels. Bill?\nBill Wheat: In the second quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 8.3%, down 70 basis points from 9% in the prior year quarter. 55 basis points of the reduction in SG&A this quarter related to a decrease in the liability for our employee deferred compensation plan resulting from the decline in the stock market during the quarter. Our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is at its lowest point in our history and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring that our infrastructure appropriately supports our business. Mike?\nMike Murray: We ended the second quarter with 33,400 homes in inventory, 16,700 of our total homes were unsold of which 4,700 were completed. We also had 1,900 model homes at the end of the quarter. We are cautiously managing our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our communities by controlling our construction starts of unsold homes and closely monitoring the number of unsold completed homes and inventory. At March 31st, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 330,000 lots of which 36% were owned and 64% were controlled through purchase contracts. 32% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 54% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. David?\nDavid Auld: Our second quarter homebuilding investment in lots land and development totaled $1 billion of which $460 million was for finish lots; $350 million was for land development and $230 million was for land. Beginning in late March, we have temporarily stopped our purchase of raw land and we are closely managing all finished lot purchases and development spending. We are also working closely with our third party lot developers including Forestar to adjust the timing of our takedown schedules to match current demand levels. Mike?\nMike Murray: Forestar, our majority-owned subsidiary is a publicly traded residential lot manufacturer operating in 50 markets across 21 states. At March 31st, Forestar's lot position consisted of 52,300 lots, of which 35,800 are owned and 16,500 are controlled through purchase contracts, 80% of Forestar's own lots are already under contract with D R Horton were subject to a right of first offer under our master supply agreement. Forestar is separately capitalized from D R Horton and has approximately $790 million of liquidity, which includes $440 million of unrestricted cash and $350 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. During the quarter, Forestar are issued $300 million of 5% senior notes due 2028 and repaid $119 million of 3.75% convertible senior notes in cash at maturity. At March 31st, Forestar's net debt to capital ratio was 19.5% and their next senior note maturity is in 2024. With low leverage, ample liquidity and its relationship with D R Horton, Forestar is in a very strong position to navigate to these uncertain economic conditions. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Financial services pretax income in the second quarter was $24.7 million with a pretax profit margin of 23.6% compared to $34 million and 33.5% in the prior year quarter. In late March and April, our mortgage company experienced lower pricing and gains on sales of mortgage loans and servicing rights due to disruption in the secondary mortgage markets. Many purchasers and servicers have limited their purchases and tighten their credit standards due to liquidity and operational challenges caused by Covid-19 and the uncertainty of the impact of forbearance provisions from the Cares Act. We are closely monitoring developments in the mortgage markets and are prepared to make adjustments in our operations to adapt to further changes in market conditions. For the quarter, 98% of our mortgage companies' loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 67% of our home buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 48% of the mortgage companies' volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 720 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. First-time homebuyers represented 53% of the closings handled by our mortgage company reflecting our continued focus on offering homes at affordable price points. David?\nDavid Auld: The DHI Communities is our multifamily rental company focused on suburban garden style apartments with operations primarily in Texas, Arizona and Florida. During the quarter, DHI Communities sold an apartment project in Florida for $67 million and recorded a gain on sale of $28.2 million. This was DHI Communities fourth project sales and it was a final sale we were expecting this year. DHI Communities has three projects under active construction and one project that were substantially complete at the end of the quarter. We are continuing lease up and construction of these four projects but are delaying new acquisitions and deferring starting construction on other projects until we have clear visibility into market conditions. DHI Communities assets total $203 million at March 31st. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to withstand difficult economic conditions. And we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to invest in capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. During the first six months of fiscal 2020, our cash provided by our homebuilding operations was $52 million compared to $216 million of cash used in the prior year period. In March 31st, we had $2 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of $1 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage improved 370 basis points to 19.2%, a balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion and we have $400 million of senior note maturities in the next 12-months. At March 31st, our stockholders equity was $10.5 billion and book value per share was $28.77, up 15% from a year ago. For the trailing 12-month period ended March 31st, our return on equity was 19.1% compared to 17.6% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends, $64 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level to be paid in May. We also repurchase 4 million shares of common stock for $197 million. Our outstanding share count was down 3% year-over-year. We plan to cautiously manage our level of share repurchases in the near term to maintain financial flexibility until we have better visibility to future market conditions and are expected and operating results. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: As we mentioned in our press release, we have withdrawn our previously issued fiscal 2020 guidance due to the current uncertainty in the US economy and our business operations resulting from Covid-19. We expect to provide new annual guidance when we have clearer visibility into our business and market conditions. David?\nDavid Auld: In closing, our results reflect the efforts of our dedicated operational teams who continued to provide homes to families across the United States. We are well-positioned to effectively operate in this uncertain environment with our experienced team, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to withstand difficult economic conditions. And we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D R Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts and positive caring spirit during this unprecedented time have been remarkable. We are proud of your work ethic and creativity and finding ways to safely continue helping our customers close on their much anticipated new homes. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from John Lovallo with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nJohnLovallo: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my call and hope everyone is doing well. First question is, can you just help frame the magnitude of the improvement or an order activity over the past two weeks, maybe on a year-over-year basis. I mean are we talking about kind of down mid single digits? Is it closer to flat year-over-year? Any color would be helpful?\nBillWheat: Hey, John. This is this is Bill. We're not commenting on specific weeks, from week to week sales, gross sales can activity net sales can be quite volatile. So we provided our commentary on a month to day basis because we feel like that the most representative information that we can provide. We did indicate that our translation level has remained elevated into April, which obviously affects net sales as well.\nJohnLovallo: Okay. I understand. And then maybe just in terms of the order decline in April. Were there any particular regions that stood out? Maybe on a positive or on a negative basis and then in the regions that are starting to open up in some of these states, are you guys doing anything different in preparation there?\nMikeMurray: Good morning, John. This is Mike. We've seen probably Texas and Florida hold up pretty well, but I would say every market is down and down fairly consistently outside of Texas and Florida. It's been a pretty broad-based impact.\nJohnLovallo: Got it. And then are you guys doing anything different in some of the states that are planning to open early?\nJessicaHansen: Well, fortunately and as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, residential construction has been designated in essential business as part of critical infrastructure. So we really haven't been heavily impacted in terms of shutdowns. The biggest place we would have been impacted is Seattle since the state of Washington did not consider residential construction as part of an essential business. The state of Washington was about 3% of our closings in calendar 2019. And in the other areas that have been shut down for construction has been the bay area, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and when you combine those with the state of Washington, we're still only around 4% of our closings last year. So really the biggest impact has more been on just the ability to interact with consumers face to face, as we want to make sure we comply with social distancing protocol. So majority of our offices, our sales offices are by appointment only. Our trades are limited to one trade per job site at a time among numerous other new operational protocols we put in place, which has slowed our build cycles and impacted the business but by and large the true shutdowns has happened mainly in markets where we don't operate heavily.\nOperator: Our next question is from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please proceed.\nCarlReichardt: Thanks very much. Hope everyone is safe and well. My first question is on pricing and incentives and maybe you could talk generally, Dave or whoever like to about generally how you're looking at pricing and incentives now where you've adjusted what kinds of prices incentive adjusted you made and how consumers are responding to them?\nDavidAuld: Carl, this is David. We are responding I guess community by community. We kind of reset expectations on absorption. We rerun pace again kind of gets old saying but it's to me it's a flag by flag operation. You've got to maintain a certain level of pace and we adjust the incentives to maintain that pace. So the reality is Texas, Florida, if held up better given all the constraints and really after the shock of the first couple of weeks our people out there, if it kind of got a rhythm and figured out how to sell houses and all in from my perspective things are better than I had expect and than I was concerned they might be so.\nCarlReichardt: Thanks David. Then as a follow-up can you talk a little bit about construction cycle times and if your supply chain is struggled at all from the labor whole perspective? We've heard mixed things about labor availability obviously social distancing making it harder to get houses up and then of course inspection delays things like that maybe what percentage have your cycle times increased, if they have in terms of sort of start to see about. Thanks a lot.\nMikeMurray: Thanks Carl. This is Mike. We haven't really seen a lot of the cycle time changes coming through in the data yet because these are fairly recent operational changes that we've made in the field, both ourselves and a lot of our governing municipalities with the cadence of inspections. So we'll let you know as we see those trends develop through the quarter. What they actually work out to be. I have been very impressed with our teams and their ability to keep each other safe and respond to demand for housing and be out there building with labor. We see a lot of our labor on site wants to work. We've not had a seeing lots of labor shortages at all. Or not been able to travel like I normally have. So I haven't seen as much coming into this call than would have been prior calls, but driving the Dallas-Fort worth markets, I've seen a lot of activity. The trades, a lot of signage around in our neighborhoods and other neighborhoods about maintaining social distancing and seeing a lot of our labor activity being executed with people not heavily congregating in the streets or on the job sites. So I've been very pleased with that and very pleased with the pace that we've been able to maintain in our communities.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nStephenKim: Yes. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate all the information and likewise hope you guys are staying safe. David, I wanted to follow up on the comment you made about how the tone of business thus far has been a little bit better than you would have initially feared they might be. And your indication that orders improved in the last two weeks prior to the previous or relative to the prior four weeks. Is it fair to say that in your -- what you have observed is that this increase was not driven by pricing actions but by something else? And if the latter, what do you think that surprising strength was related to?\nDavidAuld: Yes. Stephen, I like everybody else was a news junkie coming when this thing first broke and you turn on the President's briefing and the world's going to end. And so you kind of get hunkered down mentality and as news has come out more and more and more it just you get a sense that it's not going to be as bad as the initial thought might have been. And the key, I guess, to me there's two things that really separate us from everybody else. It's the people we have out there representing the brand and then it's just the price point. And the people want to be in the house right now and by being affordable we have more opportunities put them in a house than our competitors. So that to me is probably the mood of the country seems to have improved significantly over the last 30 days and our ability to kind of manage the process through systems and communications. And just being more comfortable. I think has given us a lot, an opportunity to make things happen. So this is unprecedented times.\nStephenKim: No doubt. And but it's certainly encouraging that what you're seeing in even in advance of many parts of almost any part of the country really opening up which I guess began this past weekend. My second question relates to cancellations in sort of tempering your commentary on the orders improving. You mention the cancellations tend to be clustered in the last few days of a month. I was curious if you give us a sense for roughly how much of the cancellation activity occurs in those last few days? Are we talking like three-quarters of your monthly cancellations occurred? Are we talking more like 25% just dimensionalize that for us a little bit and in general are those cancellations that you have been seeing, the degree to which you have been seeing them already, are they tied to mortgage credit standards tightening or is it tied to something else as far as you can tell?\nDavidAuld: I think it's just timing when everybody wants to, our sales agents want to see people closed. The buyers want to close. You push through on the credit to get to a closing point and but majority in this industry of the -- that the majority of people closed the last week of the month. And when you're bringing everything to the point of closing, things fall out and whether it's a cancellation or a push to the next month that tends to happen now the percentage, I don't have any idea. But I mean we have been very purposeful in making sure that viruses in our backlog are going to be in a position to close. So historically that number may be 15% -20% the last week. I don't know maybe a little more. That's just not anything I track. It just, go ahead, Jessica, sorry.\nJessicaHansen: And clearly right now it's always true that more happen at the end of the quarter, but we're anticipating there could be even more right now due to the current uncertainty in the market. Typically the main reason people cancel is because they can't ultimately qualify for the mortgage. So are we going to have some fallout because of tightening credit standard, potentially, I think the bigger driver right now is just job loss and loss of income certainty and so there are a lot of buyers that are canceling because of some sort of impact of Covid-19 that's out of their control. And so I think that's the main driver for us putting that cautionary language in there. There are still a few more days in April and we just don't know.\nBillWheat: This is phenomenon we do see every month and we saw it at the end of March/\nMikeMurray: We did see at the end of March.\nBillWheat: There was definitely a higher level of cancs around the last days of the month of March.\nMikeMurray: And David touched on the before is that most homebuyers are trying to schedule their home closing towards the end of the calendar month because of the way they're prepaid and the escrows are funded. It reduces their out-of-pocket cash requirement and so they're the outside realtors often advice that. So we see more of our closings in a given month scheduled trying to be scheduled by the buyers and their realtors for the last week of the month. So as you bring those things together at the end of the month that's when you find out you might have had an outside lender who could not get mortgage taken care of or something happens it just a lot pushes all the once. And so that's why we added the language to the press release into our commentary this morning.\nStephenKim: Yes. That's encouraging. That's very helpful. I mean I supposed it is encouraging that the credit standards have already tightened and hopefully it will tighten a whole lot more from here which would but obviously help. But that's a very great color. I appreciate it and good luck with the rest of the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alan Ratner with Zelman and Associates. Please proceed.\nAlanRatner: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for all the info; glad to hear everyone's doing okay and congrats on the strong performance so far in this difficult environment. My first question, historically, specs have accounted for, I think, about 70% to 80% of your sales and just in terms of that level of homes that started as a spec home. And you might have sold it at various points of the construction. So I guess I'm a little bit curious how your spec starts have been trending? First, I guess, is there any reason to think that that percentage might move lower here just given some change in strategy that you guys might be imparting on? But the question is like how much are your starts down year-over-year for April because that I guess in my mind should be a fairly good leading indicator of what future order activity might look like?\nMikeMurray: Alan, we don't have the April starts month to day number here with us. Now we'll -- we can probably follow up with you on that or certainly by the end of the quarter, we'll be putting that information out for the starts. But we're managing our spec strategy the same way we always have. It's at a community by community level, measuring demand in that community and looking at what inventory is available today. The construction status of that inventory and seeing what needs to be available for those buyers in that given community. So that's a very local decision that our teams are making on it, on a daily and weekly basis. It's nothing; we're anticipating changing at this point in time. We are obviously looking at what we would call a build job making sure that that buyer is still committed to the home before we start the house. If there's anything unusual with that house that it wouldn't otherwise be acceptable as a spec, if something happened to that by our contract we'd be happy to have that home in inventory to sell to another buyer, if need be. That happens from time to time as well.\nJessicaHansen: We would anticipate that 70% to 80% that you reference not changing. \nMikeMurray: Right. \nJessicaHansen: What we have done is slower starts pace to match the reduction in current demand levels. And we'll continue to make those adjustments community by community.\nAlanRatner: Got it. Yes. That's what I was trying to get at is if that slowing of the starts, it's tracking call it's somewhere down 10% to 15% kind of what you're experiencing and the orders are for some reason it's coming in lower than that, but you can follow up with me on that if you don't have the data handy. Second question, if I could just on the mortgage data you guys provided, I'm curious if you have any additional granularity there. We've heard some tightening specifically on FHA, VA which is back half of your business below certain FICO scores whether that's 640, 660, I'm not sure if there's a magic cutoff from the investors you are dealing with. But do you have the percentage of your business that falls below say a 660 FICO score and does the piece of your business that your mortgage company does not capture the 30% plus. Does that profile look any different?\nJessicaHansen: So I don't have insight to the outside mortgage company, but when you look at our inside mortgage company, we've been running about a 720 FICO score on average and even our express buyers been around 700 to 710. So do we have some buyers that fall in the band you're talking about? Sure. But it's not a large piece and typically our mortgage company does a fantastic job of when those credit overlays and changes in terms of FICO scores happen, working to figure out a different mortgage product to get that buyer into. So it's not generally a 100% fall out although there can be some fallout.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Please proceed.\nMichaelRehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And congrats on the results so far and also hope everyone's safe across the D R Horton organization. The first question I had was trying to look at or think about the April results from a different angle. Obviously, very encouraging in terms of the down 11% even with perhaps even a higher cancs rate in the last few days expected. When you think about that relative to your competitor reporting last week in terms of a sharper fall-off in April and other companies talking about even more challenging March quarter. So I'm trying to get a sense I was wondering if you could comment around how you guys are operating or perhaps how you're positioned that has allowed for the better results versus several of your peers. Be it price point or you had also mentioned that if the current demand level persists you need expect gross margins to contract. So I'm curious if the relative out performance versus some of your peers and some of the stats is driven by existing again price point or geographic exposure or if you have made some more aggressive adjustments in your pricing or incentives. That's my first question. \nMikeMurray: Thanks Michael. Completely appreciate the question and I will say that I am most impressed with David mentioned for the teams of people we have out there that are operating; that are empowered to make decisions at the local level. And they're generally operating a business model that has inventory on the ground. It has specs, quick move in homes that are available and we're seeing a buyer come to us that may have been looking for an existing home and that's a very challenging transaction to make happen today. And so we're seeing some benefit of that and working with our realtor relationships able to execute against that and bring those buyers to a new home situation, where we have inventory on the shelf ready to go. As David mentioned before, we generally position to be an affordable option for the buyers in the market.  And finally, we're very encouraged by the level of activity we've seen the more recent weeks in April and that there are people out there that want a home and are able to qualify to get in contract for this home. And bring enthusiasm as we see and watching our social media as those buyers are super excited about the home they're able to acquire at this point in time.\nJessicaHansen: In terms of incentives which I think was the other piece your question. We have started utilizing just the typical incentives we would in a period of market weakness. So generally that will include higher co broke commissions and more dollars towards closing costs, if you use our internal mortgage company. And then just the array of ploys that our marketers come up with in terms of free fridge Friday, throwing in backyard landscaping, a lot of different things they can just repackage from week to week to where it's not necessarily a bigger hit to gross margin down the road, but it drives by our urgency to get a different incentive out there from week to week or month to month. So we have started to utilize slightly higher level of incentives because of the market weakness, but that's what we would typically do in this kind of environment.\nMikeMurray: And oftentimes that's very helpful to energize and motivate our internal sales agents in their activity, in their outreach program. So that's one of the reasons we would generally do activities like that.\nMichaelRehaut: No, that's helpful. And again clearly your relative performance is impressive either way you look at it. So congrats on that. I guess the second question also perhaps along these lines but from a different angle is Forestar as you had alluded to their results in your prepared remarks, they reported last week one interesting data point that they had was roughly only about 150 lot deliveries in the month of April or so far in April versus a rate of 650 to 700 in the February, March months. And so obviously that kind of points to a much sharper fall-off similar, more similar perhaps to some of the other competitors that I alluded to before in terms of the fall-off in order pace that they had been seeing. So I was just kind of curious, I was hoping perhaps you can reconcile how your April results have held up much better than that obviously is D R Horton is the major overwhelming customer of Forestar. If they are, if you guys aren't seeing as that type of a degree of magnitude of fall off, why has the Forestar lot deliveries falling so much more dramatically?\nBillWheat: Sure, Michael. This is Bill. It's really a matter of timing and as Forestar pointed out on their call, they're working with each of their builder customers obviously we are the majority of their deliveries right now. And it's a matter of sitting down community by community looking at the inventory levels of lots that the builder currently has looking at the revised expectations of pace and then determining the timing of what takedowns need to be adjusted to. And so for the first few weeks post the change of the market conditions, it's really a matter of, I think, everyone hits the pause button for just a short period of time to reassess. And so pushing out takedown will most affect the first month. And I think that's where Forestar is but as we work through our adjustments we would expect that their takedowns would become more steady going forward. And it's going to be community by community really as we work our way through this. So there is a timing difference on lot purchases relative to home sales, but ultimately to the extent that we're delivering, we're purchasing most of their lots ultimately Forestar space will ultimately match or start to approximate Horton after a period of time.\nMichaelRehaut: Well any of those adjustment and delays related to a change in strike price for those lots or is it more primarily driven within a degree around timing of the takedowns?\nBillWheat: It's primarily timing. That's the initial adjustment is to adjust to the pace community by community. So it's a vast majority of adjustments are all in timing.\nOperator: Our next question is from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nTrumanPatterson: Hi. Good morning, everybody. And thanks for taking my questions. I'm glad to hear you all are safe and healthy. First on SG&A, you had a very good number this quarter, great control. Could you just run through the drivers of this? And then also looking forward how are you all planning to adjust headcount going forward or whether or not you are planning on adjusting any headcount?\nJessicaHansen: And so as Bill indicated on the call that the main driver of our year-over-year improvement and our SG&A was down 70 basis points, 55 basis points of that was due to a decrease in the liability for our deferred comp plans for our employees resulting from the significant declines in the stock market this quarter. They're really only 15 basis points of their improvement was true leverage from the improved volumes we've seen in the market. And then I think Mike and Bill are going to chime in on your other question.\nMikeMurray: On the headcount, Truman, I would say that we are continually looking for ways to be as efficient as possible in the business. Right now, we don't have any broad-based layoffs or account adjustment plans. We're responding to what we see in demand in the marketplace. And we will continue to do that market by market. Our most important asset is the teams, the people that we have out there in the field and we've been a lot of work over the past 12 -15 years positioning the company to be prepared for whatever economic situation that we're forced to navigate through. And our people are the most important part of helping us get through all this.\nJessicaHansen: We have in the near term instituted a hiring freeze just during the current market uncertainty.\nBillWheat: Truman, I'd as you well know, we're a very overhead conscious company. And we're at actually the lowest point in our history in terms of SG&A as a percentage of our revenues. And so clearly we know how to manage our overhead relative to revenues and as we see where things go on a local basis moving forward, you can count on this to manage it well.\nTrumanPatterson: Okay. And then just jumping over to capital allocation. You guys have a $1 billion in cash, $2 billion in liquidity. Assuming that the market just stays down and that we will call it 10% to 15% range moving forward. Do you think you'd be able to restart the share repurchase in relatively short order? And then also jumping over to the MA environment, I realize that's probably too soon but have you seen any increase in potential deal flow or any kind of distressed builders out on the market?\nBillWheat: So I'll start with the share repurchase question, Truman. As we stated, we are cautiously managing that. It's too early to say exactly when or how we might be able to address that going forward. Base case, we would not expect to repurchase any shares in our third quarter as we assess market conditions and we see how things progress. But we do expect to maintain a balanced capital allocation over the long term. And we are focused on investing in our business, maintaining a strong balance sheet, maintaining a flexible position and still delivering strong returns to our shareholders.\nMikeMurray: And then, Truman, to the comment on MA, I do believe it is still a bit early in a situation to see any opportunities that make present as a result of the most recent market change. But we continue to evaluate opportunities generally with smaller private builders that are complementary to our platform in various markets or product offerings. So we'll continue to evaluate opportunities as they present. It's nice to have the capital to make those decisions to invest in a business.\nDavidAuld: And I'd just that even though we're very happy with what we're seeing today, these are uncertain times and nobody really knows what the ultimate impact of all this is going to be. And being in a very liquid deleveraged, de-risk position, I think will afford a lot of opportunity for, in the event, there is distressed situation out there down the road. So we're looking at liquidity, de-leverage has a very strong competitive advantage for us today.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please proceed.\nMatthewBouley: Hey. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hope everyone's well. Thanks for all the detail. So I wanted to ask on the construction labor side and maybe thinking a little more medium-term. I think there's sort of a debate out there around perhaps increasing availability of labour that could emerge in the coming months as the industry volumes come down and perhaps there's a wider pool of labour just given the unemployment situation we've seen across the market. What do you guys hearing on that front? Are you seeing the subs perhaps trying to attract additional labor here? Just how are you thinking about whether that labour tightness we've seen over these past few years will continue? Thank you. \nMikeMurray: Matthew, as you mentioned if there's a reduction in the activity level of the industry broadly that would create more labour available for the remaining starts that are out there. And then, obviously, if unemployment levels say at elevated rates that would create the opportunity to attract more people to the construction trades, if they are as the builders are starting homes. So we've seen adequate supply of labour along largely from our long relationships and large market positions. We've not been heavily constrained with our labour and I expect that going forward, we'll continue to build a partner with those people and perhaps with additional labour available to us in a given market, we can create some other efficiency for us.\nMatthewBouley: Okay. Understood. And then I want to follow up on the orders month to date, the down 11%. Any sense of how that shakes out by buyer group? I guess specifically what you're seeing with the entry-level buyer through all this?\nJessicaHansen: It's really been across the board in terms of reductions in demand. So a little too early for us to parse exactly if there's one buyer type that ultimately is going to be hit harder by the overall impact of what the whole world's going through right now. And right now it has just been broad-based and declines in demand across all price points and buyers.\nOperator: Our next question is from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nSusanMaklari: Thank you. Good morning. My first question is just can you talk a little bit to what you're seeing in terms of input costs? Have you seen any deflation maybe coming through? Or how are you thinking about that as you looks over the next few quarters?\nMikeMurray: I think teams did a really good job of keeping control of the input cost for materials especially we've seen our stick and brick cost per square foot basically in flat as a percentage of revenue sequentially and year-over-year this quarter. And so with that we've been really good. We've got national agreements in place with a significant portion of our manufactured materials that have been able to give us very strong pricing in the marketplace, but we've not seen any significant deflationary effects come through yet.\nSusanMaklari: Okay. Thanks. And then looking a little bit further out, perhaps thinking about what's going on the ground, do you expect that there could be a shift or a material shift in your buyer segment and the breakout of the business? And what could that potentially mean as we think about maybe the margins and some of the trajectory on that going forward?\nJessicaHansen: Hi. We're just going to continue to focus on homes at affordable price points, so that doesn't necessarily only mean entry-level buyers. We want to make sure we have an affordable or at least value-priced product offering across our entire family of brands. I think a core piece of our business will always remain the entry-level first-time buyer because there's just such a big population and clearly the more affordable you can be that the bigger that pool is of potential buyers. And so really the focus for us isn't necessarily a specific demographic or buyer type it's just being affordable across multiple price points and product offerings,\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nMikeDahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question just on the lending side. I think, David, you mentioned kind of purposefully managing the backlog with respect to just getting visibility on ability to close but at the same time everyone's pushing and invested in taking it as far along and as close to the finish line as possible. And I think, Jessica, you mentioned that job loss or income uncertainty has been the main driver of cancellation so far, but when we think about the three buckets of kind of broad issues, you've got job loss; you've got income loss or DTI issues and then you've got the other credit standards maybe you'd bucket those slightly differently, but when you think across those what percentage of your backlog have you been able to actively verify all three of those buckets or all necessary closing conditions at this point.\nBillWheat: HI, Mike. This is Bill. Probably not have specific percentages on that. We do turn our backlog rather quickly. Our backlog conversion rate is over 100% this quarter. So we do see fairly quickly with our spec strategy. We're selling homes during the construction process. We're getting to a scheduled closing date probably relatively quickly. And so we're essentially six weeks into this change, significant change in market conditions. We believe we've probably worked through a very good portion of the backlog. And as we work past the end of the month of April, I think, there's another step in that process, but we'll see really an appreciable move in terms of scrubbing the backlog after we really get past the month of April. I would say largely we will have a pretty good feel for where we stand with our backlog because a lot of our contracts, union backlog at that point will have been entered more recently not a 100%, but more recently and buyers who are signing new contracts after the beginning of the pandemic are probably looking at things a little differently than those that were in backlog prior to.\nMikeDahl: Okay. Thanks. And my follow-up questions still on the lending side. When we look at mortgage loans held for sale, those are up over 70% year-on-year on the balance sheet and clearly revenues are only running up 10% for the quarter or potentially lower going forward. So can you explain that differential or are you effectively underwriting more risk or balance sheeting more risk in order to get loans done today or what else explains that move?\nBillWheat: No change in those factors, Mike. Our volume increase on the homebuilding side is one factor. Also our mortgage company is now capturing, their capture rate of mortgages in the builder business has increased significantly over the last year or so. And so that -- so the mortgage loan held for sale, the mortgage origination volume by our mortgage company is a much stronger than actually our homebuilding revenues.\nMikeMurray: Yes. At this point in April we've effectively sold all of our March loan origination from the mortgage company. So no change there, servicing and loans.\nJessicaHansen: So the data point on the capture rate and today their capture rate for the second quarter was 67%. I think that might be the highest quarterly capture rate we've reported for the mortgage company. They've been actively working to capture more of the builder business and so that's been purposeful and that compares to only a 56% capture rate last year at this time.\nMikeDahl: Okay. Got it. So to be clear, I guess, you are not underwriting any loans at this point that would not be eligible or from a practical standpoint can be sold into the secondary market with current standards?\nJessicaHansen: Correct. We're continuing to underwrite and virtually everything is agency eligible.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nKenZener: Good morning, everybody. So, Jessica, can you guys talk about how many of your orders in 2Q were inter quarter closings? And if that shifted and if you have it for April that would be great, but if you saw something shift in March first that overall quarterly rate.\nJessicaHansen: I don't have it for the quarter or for, I don't have it from March or April specifically, Ken, but for the quarter, we sold and closed 48% of our homes in the same quarter, which was up from 40% sequentially and up from 45% year-over-year. So we did have a very strong backlog conversion rate which is why you would anticipate that two of them more sold and closed in the same quarter this year than last year at this time.\nKenZener: Yes. So the reason I asked that question is and the trend seems to be that you closed more based on what you just said. Therefore your pre build approach which obviously helped to turn your assets faster also allows you to compete with the existing market. So my question is with your 33,400 units under construction being that you're in 2Q, done with 2Q, historically you closed about 95% and give or take a couple points of your under construction over the next six months. Therefore, it seems and your comments don't seem to be that closing is the issue. You haven't really talked about a lot of construction delays though, Michael. So it seems like, I understand you pulled guidance. So -- are you -- would your concern more be about margins or I mean you have your units that are construction, so is it just, David, is it just that the demand might disappear or I mean is it just that it's so wise to not offer guidance and potentially miss it. Because I mean you have these units under construction. It seems your closing units you finish, so where's the real volatility I think in your normal cadence of closings, disappearing versus margins versus demand fading. \nDavidAuld: How would you say that this has been unprecedented event taking place? And we're managing through the process and responding to what we see so far. I would say it has been a better environment because of I think primarily because the way we are positioned with inventory and with the very creative and energized sales force out there. And as we get more clarity, I think, we will probably share that with you, but it's just an unprecedented time.\nKenZener: Yes. No. Idea makes sense. It's just that it seems though your closings won't be off that much given you already have these units under construction and you're still closing a lot of units. And if your pre build model it helps so. Totally understand. Thank you very much for your time/ End of Q&A\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference call back over to David for closing remarks.\nDavid Auld: Thank you. Sherry. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today. And look forward to speaking with you again in July. And to the D R Horton team, stay safe, stay strong. You are proving once again you are the best in the industry. D R Horton and the entire executive team, thank you for all you do every day. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

            "content": "Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 40% to $1.30 per share compared to $0.93 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 37% to $483 million compared to $351 million. Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 10% to $4.4 billion on 14,539 homes closed, up from $4 billion on 13,480 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was up 2% from last year to $3,100 and the average size of our homes closed was down 2% reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill? We ended the second quarter with 33,400 homes in inventory, 16,700 of our total homes were unsold of which 4,700 were completed. We also had 1,900 model homes at the end of the quarter. We are cautiously managing our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our communities by controlling our construction starts of unsold homes and closely monitoring the number of unsold completed homes and inventory. At March 31st, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 330,000 lots of which 36% were owned and 64% were controlled through purchase contracts. 32% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 54% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. David? Forestar, our majority-owned subsidiary is a publicly traded residential lot manufacturer operating in 50 markets across 21 states. At March 31st, Forestar's lot position consisted of 52,300 lots, of which 35,800 are owned and 16,500 are controlled through purchase contracts, 80% of Forestar's own lots are already under contract with D R Horton were subject to a right of first offer under our master supply agreement. Forestar is separately capitalized from D R Horton and has approximately $790 million of liquidity, which includes $440 million of unrestricted cash and $350 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. During the quarter, Forestar are issued $300 million of 5% senior notes due 2028 and repaid $119 million of 3.75% convertible senior notes in cash at maturity. At March 31st, Forestar's net debt to capital ratio was 19.5% and their next senior note maturity is in 2024. With low leverage, ample liquidity and its relationship with D R Horton, Forestar is in a very strong position to navigate to these uncertain economic conditions. Jessica? Good morning, John. This is Mike. We've seen probably Texas and Florida hold up pretty well, but I would say every market is down and down fairly consistently outside of Texas and Florida. It's been a pretty broad-based impact. Thanks Carl. This is Mike. We haven't really seen a lot of the cycle time changes coming through in the data yet because these are fairly recent operational changes that we've made in the field, both ourselves and a lot of our governing municipalities with the cadence of inspections. So we'll let you know as we see those trends develop through the quarter. What they actually work out to be. I have been very impressed with our teams and their ability to keep each other safe and respond to demand for housing and be out there building with labor. We see a lot of our labor on site wants to work. We've not had a seeing lots of labor shortages at all. Or not been able to travel like I normally have. So I haven't seen as much coming into this call than would have been prior calls, but driving the Dallas-Fort worth markets, I've seen a lot of activity. The trades, a lot of signage around in our neighborhoods and other neighborhoods about maintaining social distancing and seeing a lot of our labor activity being executed with people not heavily congregating in the streets or on the job sites. So I've been very pleased with that and very pleased with the pace that we've been able to maintain in our communities. We did see at the end of March. And David touched on the before is that most homebuyers are trying to schedule their home closing towards the end of the calendar month because of the way they're prepaid and the escrows are funded. It reduces their out-of-pocket cash requirement and so they're the outside realtors often advice that. So we see more of our closings in a given month scheduled trying to be scheduled by the buyers and their realtors for the last week of the month. So as you bring those things together at the end of the month that's when you find out you might have had an outside lender who could not get mortgage taken care of or something happens it just a lot pushes all the once. And so that's why we added the language to the press release into our commentary this morning. Alan, we don't have the April starts month to day number here with us. Now we'll -- we can probably follow up with you on that or certainly by the end of the quarter, we'll be putting that information out for the starts. But we're managing our spec strategy the same way we always have. It's at a community by community level, measuring demand in that community and looking at what inventory is available today. The construction status of that inventory and seeing what needs to be available for those buyers in that given community. So that's a very local decision that our teams are making on it, on a daily and weekly basis. It's nothing; we're anticipating changing at this point in time. We are obviously looking at what we would call a build job making sure that that buyer is still committed to the home before we start the house. If there's anything unusual with that house that it wouldn't otherwise be acceptable as a spec, if something happened to that by our contract we'd be happy to have that home in inventory to sell to another buyer, if need be. That happens from time to time as well. Right. Thanks Michael. Completely appreciate the question and I will say that I am most impressed with David mentioned for the teams of people we have out there that are operating; that are empowered to make decisions at the local level. And they're generally operating a business model that has inventory on the ground. It has specs, quick move in homes that are available and we're seeing a buyer come to us that may have been looking for an existing home and that's a very challenging transaction to make happen today. And so we're seeing some benefit of that and working with our realtor relationships able to execute against that and bring those buyers to a new home situation, where we have inventory on the shelf ready to go. As David mentioned before, we generally position to be an affordable option for the buyers in the market.  And finally, we're very encouraged by the level of activity we've seen the more recent weeks in April and that there are people out there that want a home and are able to qualify to get in contract for this home. And bring enthusiasm as we see and watching our social media as those buyers are super excited about the home they're able to acquire at this point in time. And oftentimes that's very helpful to energize and motivate our internal sales agents in their activity, in their outreach program. So that's one of the reasons we would generally do activities like that. On the headcount, Truman, I would say that we are continually looking for ways to be as efficient as possible in the business. Right now, we don't have any broad-based layoffs or account adjustment plans. We're responding to what we see in demand in the marketplace. And we will continue to do that market by market. Our most important asset is the teams, the people that we have out there in the field and we've been a lot of work over the past 12 -15 years positioning the company to be prepared for whatever economic situation that we're forced to navigate through. And our people are the most important part of helping us get through all this. And then, Truman, to the comment on MA, I do believe it is still a bit early in a situation to see any opportunities that make present as a result of the most recent market change. But we continue to evaluate opportunities generally with smaller private builders that are complementary to our platform in various markets or product offerings. So we'll continue to evaluate opportunities as they present. It's nice to have the capital to make those decisions to invest in a business. Matthew, as you mentioned if there's a reduction in the activity level of the industry broadly that would create more labour available for the remaining starts that are out there. And then, obviously, if unemployment levels say at elevated rates that would create the opportunity to attract more people to the construction trades, if they are as the builders are starting homes. So we've seen adequate supply of labour along largely from our long relationships and large market positions.

I think teams did a really good job of keeping control of the input cost for materials especially we've seen our stick and brick cost per square foot basically in flat as a percentage of revenue sequentially and year-over-year this quarter. And so with that we've been really good. We've got national agreements in place with a significant portion of our manufactured materials that have been able to give us very strong pricing in the marketplace, but we've not seen any significant deflationary effects come through yet. Yes. At this point in April we've effectively sold all of our March loan origination from the mortgage company. So no change there, servicing and loans."

            "content": "Thank You, Jessica and good morning. Although, we are in different locations while practicing social distancing, I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'd like to first express our gratitude to our country's dedicated field of healthcare workers and all who are on the front lines caring for our communities. Our thoughts remain with those affected by this pandemic and before we talk about our second quarter results, I will address current market conditions while we along with the rest of the world navigate through the impacts of Covid-19 on the economy and our business operations. Housing market and economic fundamentals were solid throughout most of the second quarter as interest rates on mortgage loans remained low, new home demand was strong and there was a limited supply of homes at affordable prices across most of our markets. However, during the latter part of March and into April the impacts of Covid-19 and related widespread reduction in economic activity across the United States began to negatively affect our business operations, as well as the demand for new homes across all of our markets. We experienced increases in sales cancellations and decreases in sales orders in late March in to date in April as compared to the same period last year. In almost all municipalities across the US where social distancing and other restrictions have been implemented, residential construction, lot development, financial services have been designated as essential businesses as part of critical infrastructure. We have continued our operations in those markets were allowed and it made appropriate adjustments to comply with social distancing and other standards as the health safety of our employees, customers and trade partners is our number one priority. We believe we are well prepared to operate in this uncertain environment. With our experienced operating teams, low leverage and a strong liquidity position. We plan to maintain our flexible operations and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations, limiting land acquisition and land development spending and adjusting our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales space and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments in each of the communities based on local housing market conditions. Our team delivered a strong second quarter during this unprecedented time for our nation and while making significant adjustments to our operational practices in March. Our consolidated pretax income for the quarter increased 34% to $621 million on 9% increase in revenues to $4.5 billion. Our pretax profit margin improved 260 basis points to 13.8% and our net sales orders increased 40%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12-months ended March 31st was 20.2% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 19.1%. Mike? Our second quarter homebuilding investment in lots land and development totaled $1 billion of which $460 million was for finish lots; $350 million was for land development and $230 million was for land. Beginning in late March, we have temporarily stopped our purchase of raw land and we are closely managing all finished lot purchases and development spending. We are also working closely with our third party lot developers including Forestar to adjust the timing of our takedown schedules to match current demand levels. Mike? The DHI Communities is our multifamily rental company focused on suburban garden style apartments with operations primarily in Texas, Arizona and Florida. During the quarter, DHI Communities sold an apartment project in Florida for $67 million and recorded a gain on sale of $28.2 million. This was DHI Communities fourth project sales and it was a final sale we were expecting this year. DHI Communities has three projects under active construction and one project that were substantially complete at the end of the quarter. We are continuing lease up and construction of these four projects but are delaying new acquisitions and deferring starting construction on other projects until we have clear visibility into market conditions. DHI Communities assets total $203 million at March 31st. Bill? In closing, our results reflect the efforts of our dedicated operational teams who continued to provide homes to families across the United States. We are well-positioned to effectively operate in this uncertain environment with our experienced team, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to withstand difficult economic conditions. And we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D R Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts and positive caring spirit during this unprecedented time have been remarkable. We are proud of your work ethic and creativity and finding ways to safely continue helping our customers close on their much anticipated new homes. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Carl, this is David. We are responding I guess community by community. We kind of reset expectations on absorption. We rerun pace again kind of gets old saying but it's to me it's a flag by flag operation. You've got to maintain a certain level of pace and we adjust the incentives to maintain that pace. So the reality is Texas, Florida, if held up better given all the constraints and really after the shock of the first couple of weeks our people out there, if it kind of got a rhythm and figured out how to sell houses and all in from my perspective things are better than I had expect and than I was concerned they might be so. Yes. Stephen, I like everybody else was a news junkie coming when this thing first broke and you turn on the President's briefing and the world's going to end. And so you kind of get hunkered down mentality and as news has come out more and more and more it just you get a sense that it's not going to be as bad as the initial thought might have been. And the key, I guess, to me there's two things that really separate us from everybody else. It's the people we have out there representing the brand and then it's just the price point. And the people want to be in the house right now and by being affordable we have more opportunities put them in a house than our competitors. So that to me is probably the mood of the country seems to have improved significantly over the last 30 days and our ability to kind of manage the process through systems and communications. And just being more comfortable. I think has given us a lot, an opportunity to make things happen. So this is unprecedented times. I think it's just timing when everybody wants to, our sales agents want to see people closed. The buyers want to close. You push through on the credit to get to a closing point and but majority in this industry of the -- that the majority of people closed the last week of the month. And when you're bringing everything to the point of closing, things fall out and whether it's a cancellation or a push to the next month that tends to happen now the percentage, I don't have any idea. But I mean we have been very purposeful in making sure that viruses in our backlog are going to be in a position to close. So historically that number may be 15% -20% the last week. I don't know maybe a little more. That's just not anything I track. It just, go ahead, Jessica, sorry. And I'd just that even though we're very happy with what we're seeing today, these are uncertain times and nobody really knows what the ultimate impact of all this is going to be. And being in a very liquid deleveraged, de-risk position, I think will afford a lot of opportunity for, in the event, there is distressed situation out there down the road. So we're looking at liquidity, de-leverage has a very strong competitive advantage for us today. How would you say that this has been unprecedented event taking place? And we're managing through the process and responding to what we see so far. I would say it has been a better environment because of I think primarily because the way we are positioned with inventory and with the very creative and energized sales force out there. And as we get more clarity, I think, we will probably share that with you, but it's just an unprecedented time. Thank you. Sherry. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today. And look forward to speaking with you again in July. And to the D R Horton team, stay safe, stay strong. You are proving once again you are the best in the industry. D R Horton and the entire executive team, thank you for all you do every day. Have a great day."

            "content": "Net sales orders in the second quarter increased 20% to 20,087 and the value of those orders was $6 billion, up 22% from $4.9 billion in the prior year. Our average number of active selling communities increased 1% from the prior year and was flat sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the second quarter was $299,700, up 2% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the second quarter was 19% flat with the same quarter last year. As we disclosed in our preliminary release, our March net sales orders increased 6% from last year to 6,491 homes and our cancellation rate for the month was 24%. As a result of the pandemic, our sales orders began to decrease in late March and into April and our cancellations have remained elevated throughout April to date. Although April is not quite over yet, our net sales orders month-to-date is approximately 11% lower than the same period a year ago. This month-to-date net sales trend may not be indicative of the full month of April because a significant number of our sales cancellations typically occur in the final days of each month. However, we have seen an increase in our net sales order volumes in the most recent two weeks compared to the preceding four weeks. Jessica? In the second quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 8.3%, down 70 basis points from 9% in the prior year quarter. 55 basis points of the reduction in SG&A this quarter related to a decrease in the liability for our employee deferred compensation plan resulting from the decline in the stock market during the quarter. Our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is at its lowest point in our history and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring that our infrastructure appropriately supports our business. Mike? Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to withstand difficult economic conditions. And we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to invest in capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. During the first six months of fiscal 2020, our cash provided by our homebuilding operations was $52 million compared to $216 million of cash used in the prior year period. In March 31st, we had $2 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of $1 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage improved 370 basis points to 19.2%, a balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion and we have $400 million of senior note maturities in the next 12-months. At March 31st, our stockholders equity was $10.5 billion and book value per share was $28.77, up 15% from a year ago. For the trailing 12-month period ended March 31st, our return on equity was 19.1% compared to 17.6% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends, $64 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level to be paid in May. We also repurchase 4 million shares of common stock for $197 million. Our outstanding share count was down 3% year-over-year. We plan to cautiously manage our level of share repurchases in the near term to maintain financial flexibility until we have better visibility to future market conditions and are expected and operating results. Jessica? Hey, John. This is this is Bill. We're not commenting on specific weeks, from week to week sales, gross sales can activity net sales can be quite volatile. So we provided our commentary on a month to day basis because we feel like that the most representative information that we can provide. We did indicate that our translation level has remained elevated into April, which obviously affects net sales as well. This is phenomenon we do see every month and we saw it at the end of March/ There was definitely a higher level of cancs around the last days of the month of March. Sure, Michael. This is Bill. It's really a matter of timing and as Forestar pointed out on their call, they're working with each of their builder customers obviously we are the majority of their deliveries right now. And it's a matter of sitting down community by community looking at the inventory levels of lots that the builder currently has looking at the revised expectations of pace and then determining the timing of what takedowns need to be adjusted to. And so for the first few weeks post the change of the market conditions, it's really a matter of, I think, everyone hits the pause button for just a short period of time to reassess. And so pushing out takedown will most affect the first month. And I think that's where Forestar is but as we work through our adjustments we would expect that their takedowns would become more steady going forward. And it's going to be community by community really as we work our way through this. So there is a timing difference on lot purchases relative to home sales, but ultimately to the extent that we're delivering, we're purchasing most of their lots ultimately Forestar space will ultimately match or start to approximate Horton after a period of time. It's primarily timing. That's the initial adjustment is to adjust to the pace community by community. So it's a vast majority of adjustments are all in timing. Truman, I'd as you well know, we're a very overhead conscious company. And we're at actually the lowest point in our history in terms of SG&A as a percentage of our revenues. And so clearly we know how to manage our overhead relative to revenues and as we see where things go on a local basis moving forward, you can count on this to manage it well. So I'll start with the share repurchase question, Truman. As we stated, we are cautiously managing that. It's too early to say exactly when or how we might be able to address that going forward. Base case, we would not expect to repurchase any shares in our third quarter as we assess market conditions and we see how things progress. But we do expect to maintain a balanced capital allocation over the long term. And we are focused on investing in our business, maintaining a strong balance sheet, maintaining a flexible position and still delivering strong returns to our shareholders. HI, Mike. This is Bill. Probably not have specific percentages on that. We do turn our backlog rather quickly. Our backlog conversion rate is over 100% this quarter. So we do see fairly quickly with our spec strategy. We're selling homes during the construction process. We're getting to a scheduled closing date probably relatively quickly. And so we're essentially six weeks into this change, significant change in market conditions. We believe we've probably worked through a very good portion of the backlog. And as we work past the end of the month of April, I think, there's another step in that process, but we'll see really an appreciable move in terms of scrubbing the backlog after we really get past the month of April. I would say largely we will have a pretty good feel for where we stand with our backlog because a lot of our contracts, union backlog at that point will have been entered more recently not a 100%, but more recently and buyers who are signing new contracts after the beginning of the pandemic are probably looking at things a little differently than those that were in backlog prior to. No change in those factors, Mike. Our volume increase on the homebuilding side is one factor. Also our mortgage company is now capturing, their capture rate of mortgages in the builder business has increased significantly over the last year or so. And so that -- so the mortgage loan held for sale, the mortgage origination volume by our mortgage company is a much stronger than actually our homebuilding revenues."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jessica Hansen, Vice President, Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Please go ahead.\nJessica Hansen: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning.

All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning\u2019s earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q in the day or two. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News & Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I\u2019m pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team started the year off strong. Our consolidated pretax income for the quarter increased 39% to $523 million on a 14% increase in revenue to $4 billion. Our pretax profit margin improved 230 basis points to 13%, and our net sales orders increased 19%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31st was 18.7% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 18.2%. These results reflect strength of our operational teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint, and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. We continue to see a good demand and a limited supply of homes at affordable prices across our markets, while economic fundamentals and financing availability remain strong -- solid, excuse me. Our strategic focus is to continue consolidated market share, while growing our revenues and profits, generating strong annual cash flows and returns, and maintaining a flexible financial position with a conservative balance sheet that includes an ample supply of homes, lots and lands for growth. We are well-positioned for the remainder of 2020 and future years. Mike?\nMike Murray: Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 53% to $1.16 per share, compared to $0.76 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 50% to $431 million, compared to $287 million. Our first quarter results included tax benefit of $32.9 million related to federal energy efficient homes tax credits that were retroactively reinstated. Our consolidated pretax income increased 39% to $523 million in the first quarter and our homebuilding pretax income increased 30% to $462 million. Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 13% to $3.9 billion on 12,959 homes closed, up from $3.4 billion on 11,500 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was up 1% from last year to $298,100 and the average size of our homes closed was down 2%, reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Net sales orders in the first quarter increased 19% to 13,126 homes and the value of those orders was $3.9 billion, up 22% from $3.2 billion in the prior year. Our significant sales price increase over the prior year quarter reflects the moderation in demand that occurred in late calendar 2018. Our average number of active selling communities increased 6% from the prior year and was flat sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the first quarter was $300,900, up 3% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 20% compared to 24% in the same quarter last year. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the first quarter was 21%, flat sequentially from the September quarter, up 100 basis points compared to the prior year quarter and in line with our expectations. Based on today\u2019s market conditions, we currently expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be consistent with the first quarter, subject to possible fluctuations due to product and geographic mix, as well as the relative impacts of warranty, litigation and purchase accounting. Bill?\nBill Wheat: In the first quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 9.2%, down 30 basis points from 9.5% in the prior year quarter. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our growth. Mike?\nMike Murray: We ended the first quarter with 30,200 homes in inventory. 18,400 of our total homes were unsold of which 5,600 were completed. Our first quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $1.3 billion, of which $890 million was for purchases of land and finished lots, while $410 million was for land development. Our underwriting criteria and operational expectations for new communities remained consistent at a minimum 20% annual pre tax return on inventory and return of our initial cash within 24 months. David?\nDavid Auld: At December 31st, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 320,000 lots of which 39% were owned and 61% were controlled through purchase contracts. 33% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 56% of our controlled lots are will be finished when we purchase them. We continue working to increase our lot position being developed by third parties by supporting the growth of Forestar\u2019s national lot manufacturing platform and expanding our relationship with lot developers across the country. Our current lot portfolio includes an ample supply of lots for homes at affordable price points and continues to provide a strong competitive advantage. Mike?\nMike Murray: Forestar, our majority owned subsidiary is a publicly-traded residential lot manufacturer, operating in 51 markets across 20 states. At December 31st, Forestar\u2019s lot position consisted of 44,500 lots of which 32,200 are owned and 12,300 our controlled through purchase contracts. 80% of Forestar\u2019s owned lots are already under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under the master supply agreement. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, Forestar delivered 2,422 lots and is on track to deliver 10,000 lots in fiscal 2020 and generate $800 million to 850 million of revenue. Forestar expects to deliver 12,000 lots and generate $900 million to $1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2021. These expectations are for Forestar\u2019s standalone results. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and is committed to maintaining a long-term net debt to capital ratio of 40% or lower. At December 31st, Forestar\u2019s net debt to capital ratio was 9.7%. Forestar has approximately $720 million of liquidity to fund its continued growth, which includes $370 million of unrestricted cash and $350 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. Forestar hosted their quarterly earnings call last Thursday and have an updated presentation on their Investors site and investor.forestar.com that describes Forestar\u2019s unique lot manufacturing model, and a significant growth and value creation opportunity. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Financial services pretax income in the first quarter increased 29% to $30.5 million and the pretax profit margin was 29.6%, up from 27.7% in the prior year. 97% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 65% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 49% of the mortgage company\u2019s volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 720 and an average loan to value ratio of 89%. First time homebuyers represented 50% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, reflecting our continued focus on offering homes at affordable price points for entry level buyers. David?\nDavid Auld: DHI Communities is our multifamily rental company focused suburban garden-style apartments with operations primarily in Texas, Arizona and Florida. During the quarter, DHI Communities sold its third apartment project located in Phoenix for $61.5 million and recognized a gain on sale of $31.2 million. DHI Communities has four projects under active construction and one project that was substantially complete at the end of the quarter. DHI Communities\u2019 total assets were $210 million at December 31st. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet strength and operating results are providing increased flexibility, and we are utilizing our strong position to enhance the long-term value of the Company. During the first three months of fiscal 2020, our cash used in homebuilding operations was $178.4 million, compared to $396.8 million in the prior year period. At December 31st, we had $2.6 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.4 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage improved 370 basis points to 19.5%. The balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $2.4 billion. And we have $500 million of senior notes maturing on February 15th, which we plan to repay, utilizing cash on hand and our revolving credit facility, as necessary. At December 31st, our stockholders\u2019 equity was $10.2 billion and book value per share was $27.92, up 14% from a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $64.6 million. We also repurchased 3 million shares of common stock for $163.1 million, resulting in $732.6 million remaining on our stock repurchase authorization at December 31, 2019. Our outstanding share count was down 2%, year-over-year. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Looking forward to the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect to generate consolidated revenues in a range of $4.25 billion to $4.4 billion and to close approximately 13,800 to 14,300 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be approximately 21% and homebuilding SG&A in the second quarter to be around 9% of homebuilding revenues. Based on today\u2019s market conditions and our first quarter results, we now expect to generate consolidated revenues for the full year of $18.5 billion to $19.1 billion and to close between 60,000 and 61,500 homes. We expect our income tax rate in the second, third and fourth quarters to be between 23% and 24%. We still expect to generate cash flow from homebuilding operations in excess of $1 billion for the full fiscal year of 2020, and we expect our outstanding share count to be down approximately 2% at the end of the year, compared to the end of fiscal 2019. David?\nDavid Auld: In closing, our results reflect the strength of our well-established operating platform across the country. We are focused on consolidating market share while growing our revenues and profits and generating strong annual cash flows and returns while maintaining a flexible financial position. Our return on equity of 18.2% and our homebuilding return on inventory of 18.7%, demonstrate our consistent focus and efforts. We\u2019re well-positioned to continue this performance with our conservative balance sheet, broad geographic footprint, affordable product offering across multiple brands, attractive finished lot and land position and most importantly, our outstanding experienced teams across the country. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. We are incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Your line is now live.\nCarl Reichardt: I wanted to ask something you guys often have talked about is the idea of getting your cash back out of your investments in land within two years. And with some of your peers moving to some of the products and markets that you serve, I\u2019m just curious as to your perspective, David, on the land market in general for affordable homes and your ability to continue to run the model where you\u2019re getting cash out in two years.\nDavid Auld: Well, the cash out in two years is something we stayed with through this -- from the downturn on. And I can tell you that that model has worked very well for us. And I don\u2019t see that changing. And as to the overall market for buying land, again, it comes back to the people we have embedded in these markets and relationships they have with the land\u2019s owners. And we feel very good about our opportunity to replace what we\u2019re building through, and through this market have seen that happen over and over and over again, so.\nCarl Reichardt: And then, on similar lines with looking like starts are going to pick up with orders strong for lots of folks, I\u2019m curious as to your perspective on the labor market, subs in particular, and what you\u2019re seeing and thinking about in terms of the potential for increases in cost there this year, as these orders get built out?\nDavid Auld: I think, there\u2019s always going to be that pressure on the cost side. Definitely, labor is getting tighter and continues to -- I think going to restrict a lot of people\u2019s ability to deliver houses. Again, it goes back to the kind of operating profile we adopted and continue, and that is consistent starts throughout the community, expanding the labor base, the efficiency, not necessarily just bodies. And we feel very good about what we\u2019ve accomplished. We have a very loyal trade base. I think I said on the last call, our traders don\u2019t have to go chase their paychecks. So, all of that combines to put us in a great position. Is it going to be a problem? I think less so for us than other people.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from John Lovallo from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now live.\nJohn Lovallo: First one on the order ASP over -- a little bit over 300,000 in the quarter, that was up pretty nicely a year-over-year. And I know you mentioned that there\u2019s some normalization off of a challenging period last year. But just curious, if we kind of break down that number, is that kind of regional and product mix driven, or are you taking pricing on a like-for-like basis?\nJessica Hansen: Part of it is regionally driven. If you look at our orders this year, the South Central was down 2% in terms of just the mix, the overall mix, and that\u2019s actually our lowest ASP region. So, we continue to expect just modest sale price increases as we move throughout the year, and to cover our costs increases, but on the like-for-like basis nothing significant in the way of price.\nJohn Lovallo: And then, just curious how you\u2019re thinking about the Forestar investment. If the plan is to kind of continue to dilute your stake through issuing equity out of Forestar, or are you now considering -- or any plan to potentially sell down your actual ownership position?\nMike Murray: Yes. We\u2019re still on track with our plan there John to ultimately deconsolidate Forestar. We were pleased when they were able to issue their first primary equity offering in September, which diluted our position down from the original 75%; here in December, we\u2019re sitting at 65%. We would expect additional equity issuances from Forestar over time that could continue to dilute our position. And then, as we\u2019ve also said all along, there\u2019s a potential that we could sell some of our shares. And at the point in time that we are ready to do that, we will have a plan in place that will complement the primary equity issuance. And those two things together would result in further dilution in our ownership position.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman and Associates. Your line is now live.\nAlan Ratner: So, first one, I think last quarter you guys commented just when you thought about the full-year, your best guess at that point would be that gross margins would be kind of similar in that 21% range. And you obviously hit that this quarter and 2Q guide is similar as well. So, just first off, is there any change in your thinking in terms of the progression in margins through the year, obviously very strong sales environment? So, how should we think about as the year progresses, what happens to margin?\nDavid Auld: I think, we\u2019re going to see consistent margins into the second quarter. And then frankly, as usual this time of the year, the spring selling season will really dictate where margins go in Q3 and Q4. Early returns in the spring selling season have been very positive. So, we\u2019re confident in giving our guidance of consistent margins in the Q2, but we\u2019re going to have to wait and see what happens in the next several weeks.\nAlan Ratner: Second question, if I look at your homes in inventory, that\u2019s been -- at least on a year-over-year basis has been trending lower for the last several quarters. I think this quarter you\u2019re down about 10% year-over-year. And obviously, last year was elevated a bit because of the sales -- the tougher sales environment. But, are you seeing a greater component of sales coming from to be built, or have you changed your thinking -- your thought process at all in terms of the optimal number of specs per community that would be translated into that type of decline we\u2019re seeing, or are you trying to amp that higher as the spring gets underway?\nDavid Auld: A couple of things going on with that number, Alan. One, the comparison to prior year, we\u2019re actually down 5%. We\u2019ve changed the way we report homes and inventory to exclude the model homes. So, last year, we were -- where we were last year, like 31,800; and so, this year, we are at 30,200. So, we\u2019re down slightly from last year. And last year may have been a bit elevated with softer sales and operating environment we saw in the fourth calendar quarter of \u201818. Another thing we\u2019ve talked about is getting better at turning our housing inventory to drive a higher return with those investment dollars. And then, we\u2019re also seeing the ability to push starts in as we\u2019re seeing demand come on. We\u2019re not noticing any kind of a difference in the mix between to be built versus our spec starts, continuing probably an 80-20 consistent approach for that.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nStephen Kim: First question I had for you is on the land spend. The land spend was fairly high relative to our expectations this quarter. I\u2019m talking specifically on the acquisition number of 890. [Ph] And as a percentage of rev, that was probably the highest we\u2019ve seen in six years. And, given your discipline and given your outlook on the business and your intention to basically get a return on that spend within 24 months, it seems that there\u2019s a fair amount of optimism that\u2019s implied by that strong land spend. So, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that, maybe break that down for us, at least qualitatively, in terms of was that kind of a strong land spend fairly equally distributed across the country where there are certain opportunities that emerged in a particular region or a particular product type that garnered a lion share of that? If you could just talk about the relatively strong land spend in greater detail?\nMike Murray: Sure, Stephen. As you know, you start your land spend, there is some lumpiness kind of from quarter-to-quarter. And so, one quarter, just based on the timing of when deals close and when they get ready to go and based on our business plans, there can be a bit of lumpiness there. One thing I would point out is that over half of our land acquisition spend is for finished lots. And so, we continue to dedicate a lot of our spend to finished lots which turn very quickly. And so I would really just attribute -- I wouldn\u2019t say there is necessarily any changes in our plans, but I would attribute a bit of this to a bit of a lumpiness, point out that finished lots are a heavy part of the spend. But, then we do -- we are optimistic. We do see growth, certainty in fiscal \u201820. And right now, we still see very good underlying fundamentals for the business. And so, we are still actively replenishing our land and lot supply.\nJessica Hansen: And we have to replenish it at a faster rate as we continue to grow our sales and closings pace. You have seen our owned lot count remained relatively flat for quite some time. So, it\u2019s really just a function of having to replenish at a faster rate.\nStephen Kim: Great. Yes. That\u2019s helpful. Second question relates to the broader macro environment or rather the broader environment with respect to housing policy. We\u2019ve seen some interesting moves here as of late. We have seen the average DTIs, the high DTIs and high LTV lending be curtailed or reined back the FHFA. And yes, we\u2019ve also heard that CFPD weigh in here and suggest they\u2019re going to move to an APOR spread versus the DTI. I was curious as to whether or not you have looked into this. Some of what we\u2019ve heard is that the move to the APOR spread would actually be stimulative to entry-level housing, on top of the dropping rates. That would seem to be extremely favorable for your business. And I was curious if you had looked at that at all. And if you have any view on whether or not these broader factors may be positive for your business the way it would appear to us?\nJessica Hansen: Sure. High level, I think we\u2019d agree with what you\u2019re saying. That being said, it\u2019s super early and out there and it\u2019s not something that we spend a lot of time on. I\u2019m sure our mortgage company would have a much more detailed response for you. But anything that continues to improve mortgage standards and makes it easier for people to get into a house clearly would be a benefit for our business. That being said, as David mentioned in his opening, financing availability is still good. I mean people that should be buying houses are who are buying houses today. And we\u2019re not necessarily in favor of people with significantly high DTIs or really low credit scores being in a house because we\u2019re very cognizant of what happened last cycle, and we don\u2019t want any repeat of that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nTruman Patterson: So, your guidance is for mid to high single digit closing growth. You\u2019ve bumped up the high end a little bit. But, is there anything structurally limiting you from going above the high end of that guidance, particularly on the land side and thinking availability of lots, your ability to get lots developed? And that also includes municipality constraints, delaying community openings that might create any kind of gap-outs?\nMike Murray: Truman, we\u2019re really excited about the way this year started off the first quarter and through the first several weeks of January, and we have increased our guidance as a result of that. Structurally, it\u2019s a question of the lots that are out in front of us. We feel good about the community positioning we have, getting some communities opened. But right now, we\u2019re not going to increase our guidance, based on where we are today in the spring selling season. But, we will certainly look to deliver all the homes we can. That\u2019s the best returns we can do in fiscal \u201820.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. So, put another way, there\u2019s nothing structurally limiting you on the land side from going above that if the market is a bit healthier than what you expect as of today?\nMike Murray: There is a finite number of homes we can build over the next 8.5, 9 months and deliver by September 30th. But, we\u2019re comfortable with our guidance range today, and we\u2019re just going to have to see what the spring is going to give us and where we end up in our inventory positioning in March and in April and May.\nJessica Hansen: Our guidance already incorporates a higher housing inventory turnover than what we did last year. So, it reflects an improvement in terms of building, selling and closing more houses this year than last year, which is what we continue to be focused on is there\u2019s efficiencies in the business. But that is what limits further upside to our current guidance.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. And then, sticking on the land side. Your option lots jumped nicely this quarter, as you all continue rotating towards more option land, how should we think about where that growth comes from? Is it primarily through Forestar? Is it more than even balance between Forestar and your third-party developers? And then, any way you can put out a target over the next couple of years, what you think you can get that option land bank as a percentage of total up to?\nDavid Auld: We\u2019re not going to set a hard target. Internally, we talk about goals, but that\u2019s an internal conversation. And it\u2019s kind of a balanced program. I think, the Forestar platform is again built out. We\u2019re very happy with the progress we\u2019re making there. But, we are also equally focused on our third-party developers. And they are a part of the D.R. Horton family. And that pipeline continues to get better and bigger. And so, it\u2019s a collection of the two. Primarily, it\u2019s just focus. We\u2019re treating capital as if it\u2019s a precious commodity. And we\u2019re going to try to treat it better than anybody else in the industry.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So, I wanted to ask on the SG&A side, since your guidance implies sort of flat percentage year-over-year, although you are growing the top line and kind of managing that inventory positioning. Is there any reason why we wouldn\u2019t see a bit more leverage? And how should we think about that beyond the next quarter? Thank you.\nBill Wheat: To the extent we\u2019re delivering on our closings guidance and showing mid to high single digit growth in revenue, we do expect to see leverage on our SG&A and improvement year-over-year. We\u2019re very pleased with the 30 basis points we saw in the first quarter. Based on what we see today and the volume we see in Q2, we do expect SG&A to be relatively flat with last year in Q2. But overall, we do expect some leverage for the year.\nMatthew Bouley: Okay. I appreciate that. And then, as you just mentioned, I believe to the prior question, your guidance for the Q2 closings does imply kind of a continued uptick on that conversion of your inventory positioning. But, you did also mention earlier that labor is kind of not surprisingly getting tighter. So, can you speak a bit about that balance? And what exactly are you guys doing on the ground that supports that improving efficiency? Thank you.\nDavid Auld: It gets back to -- to me, it gets back to relationships with trade base. And for the last, I don\u2019t know, ever since the downturn, we\u2019ve had a steady and consistent level of production going in our communities. And so, our trade base has gotten better at building the houses. And when they\u2019re not out there chasing work, then they can build more houses. What I look at is the same labor. We build more square footage with the same labor hours. So, it\u2019s a process. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve worked on all the way through this cycle. I think early on, we felt like labor was going to be the constraint on housing. And we have done I think a great job of managing the trade base and making sure that those guys were making money. And we were still delivering houses at a reasonable cost.\nMike Murray: Matt, the other thing we look at here and we watch sort of from a high level perspective is what our build times are doing in our process when we start a house, can we get it completed and then closed. And we\u2019re not seeing those times elongate, which would be real, more acute indicators of labor shortages in various markets. So, the longstanding deep relationships we have with a lot of the labor suppliers, combined with a more efficient plan set, if you will, in our communities and focus on the first time homebuyer and affordability, has driven our ability to continue to turn houses a little bit better, and we\u2019re going to see a lot of improvement in that metric this year.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan. Your line is now live.\nMichael Rehaut: First question I had was on your outlook for the year for community count and sales pace. I believe last quarter you talked about, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but you\u2019d expect community count -- average community count for the year to be up year-over-year, low single digits. I was wondering if that\u2019s still the expectation. I believe it\u2019s been flat sequentially more or less for last few quarters, but I guess the expectation would be to drift upward a little bit. And then, also on the sales pace, you had a nice improvement year-over-year. And I was just curious, if that was more driven by market conditions or certain product or geographic mix shifts, and how you think about the next quarter or two?\nJessica Hansen: Sure. So, when we think about community count, Mike, it\u2019s the hardest one for us to predict, quite honestly, which is why we never give formal guidance on it. I think, our base case would be that we would anticipate it to tick up at some point, as we move throughout the year. But when that inflection point actually happens, it\u2019s hard to call exactly. In terms of the sales pace, as we mentioned in the script, that does reflect the moderation in demand we saw in late calendar 2018. So, we did have -- although we generally don\u2019t talk about comps, we did have a relatively easy comp, when you look at that. And what our guidance reflects for the year from a closings perspective would infer that our sales year-over-year increase is going to moderate from Q1 and it will fluctuate Q2, Q3, Q4 in a range that supports that closings growth guidance that we\u2019ve alluded to.\nMichael Rehaut: I guess, secondly, bigger picture, kind of maybe piggybacking off an earlier question of owned versus option. Maybe said a different way, your lot option percentage has obviously while huge amounts of progress, impressive progress over the last few years, now, it\u2019s kind of been in that low-60s type of range, 60 to 61, 62, maybe over the last 3, 4 quarters. That increase over the last few years has been a big, big driver of your improved return profile. Just trying to get a sense of over the next 2 or 3 years, certainly, you\u2019re not going to do the same type of degree of change on the lot option profile, as you have before, maybe you\u2019ll drift up a little bit. I do recall you guys talking about a 70% number perhaps, but maybe now that\u2019s not as concrete. But, how should we think about, over the next two or three years, the next big lever of improvement in returns? Would it be more from a share repurchasing standpoint or are other levers that perhaps we\u2019re not thinking about?\nMike Murray: We expect it to be just continued incremental improvement on all for us. We do expect to continue to -- and our goal is to continue to push an option percentage upward. We\u2019re not going to set necessarily an upward target. But, we do expect to incrementally improve that as Forestar grows, build out its platform even further, that\u2019s going to continue to be part of that growth story as well as expanding relationships with our developers. We\u2019ve already alluded to on this call we\u2019re expecting to turn our housing inventory faster this year. And so, that\u2019s going to be an incremental level in terms of returns this year. And then, as our operations are more efficient and generate more cash that gives us more flexibility on the capital allocation side. And so, over the last several years, we have instituted an increasing level of share repurchases and dividend payoffs to shareholders, which has enhanced our ROE. And so, as we continue to incrementally improve each year, I think each one of those levers is going to allow us to continue to incrementally improve both operational returns and returns to shareholders.\nOperator: Your next question today is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is now live.\nJack Micenko: I wanted to revisit the pace question a little bit more. The 1Q here, this is I think the -- probably the high watermark since the crisis on sales pace. And I\u2019m curious the guide would suggest that pace will continue to improve through the year, maybe at a slower clip. But, the improvement, looking past year-over-year with the easy comps, but the improvement over the last four or five quarters, is that all product segmentation, or are you seeing lift across all your product types? I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s any regional differential that can drive maybe incremental pace, improvement through the latter half of this year, maybe in the next year?\nMike Murray: I think, we\u2019re seeing generally increased absorptions at our more affordable price points, whether that\u2019s the entire community or certain plans within more the traditional Horton branded communities. We are not heavily exposed to the luxury end of the market. So, we\u2019re not experiencing if there is any lift there or not lift going on there. We can speak to that very well. But, across all of our geographies, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about the traffic, pretty good about the demand, in the most recent quarter and in the quarters leading up to it.\nJack Micenko: And then, maybe the January trend the last couple of weeks, would it be consistent what we saw in the fiscal first or does that build sort of continue in the most recent couple weeks?\nMike Murray: I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve seen normal seasonality week-to-week as we progressed in January. It seems like historically people talked about Super Bowl Sunday being the kickoff to the spring selling season. And we\u2019ve noticed the past few years that seems to be starting a little bit earlier. And maybe it\u2019s because the Cowboys did make the playoffs, people are buying houses sooner. So, we\u2019re excited for Chiefs. And I think\u2026\nDavid Auld: And the 49ers\nMike Murray: And yes -- speak on opportunity.\nDavid Auld: Yes.\nJack Micenko: Just one more for me. A couple of jobs that you\u2019ve got, looks like you\u2019re trying to build a team on the single family rental side. Could you just refresh us on the strategy there and the thoughts, owned versus build for others, and how you\u2019re thinking about the business today?\nMike Murray: Yes. We\u2019re currently think about the business, we\u2019re still early stages on it and we\u2019re trying to get in and really understand the operations of the business and see where we add the most value to that process. Today, it\u2019s probably more dipping our toe in the water on the owned side, but we are certainly looking at it hard, and have not shut the door on any possibility today.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nKen Zener: So, you beat your closing guidance. I assume that was on higher intra-quarter order closings. Can you confirm that? And what was the percent for intra-quarter order closing in this 1Q versus last year?\nJessica Hansen: You are correct that beat that. This quarter, it was 40% that we sold and closed in the same quarter, which is slightly higher than we would typically do. I don\u2019t know that I -- I do have last year. Last year, it was 37%.\nKen Zener: Okay. And then, related to that, is there any shift in terms of -- I mean, that\u2019s what I would expect to see efficiency showing up. So, could you talk about if there is anything that you are thinking about in regards to that increase in that percent and talk about the margin spread that you -- or the trend that you guys have been seeing between the backlog closings and specifically the intra-quarter closing units?\nJessica Hansen: On the first part, Ken, I would say, it\u2019s pretty much in line with what we would expect, especially with the number of completed specs that we have. That allows us the opportunity to sell and close more homes within the quarter. So, I would expect that trend to continue. Last year, in the second quarter, we actually sold and closed 45% homes in the same quarter, sold and closed. If you look at the margin differential, that stayed relatively consistent and that there is a slight differential and a slightly lower margin on specs than there is build jobs. That being said, really the only big differential is on our completed specs that have been completed and unsold for a period of multiple months. So, the earlier we sell it as a spec, the tighter that differential is. And as a reminder, about 80% of what we closed in a quarter started as spec. So, when you see that 21% home sales margin we reported this quarter, that\u2019s by and large is a spec gross margin.\nKen Zener: Why is that spec margin a bit lower first backlog if there is a price appreciation? I mean, what is that -- I mean, what is that\u2019s moving? Is that you have to discount it, that seems inconsistent with order strength?\nJessica Hansen: No. it\u2019s that we\u2019re underwriting to a return. And as we turn our spec housing more quickly than build jobs, we are able to work for a slightly lower gross margin and get an equivalent return. In the build job, you are actually going to lose the price appreciation, if you walk in before you start construction. And so, we like selling more in real time and capturing that margin as we move along the way.\nMike Murray: Ken, a lot of our build job sales are actually sales of homes that we had planned to start anyway. They were in the production planning process to start. They just had not stated yet, but they were released to sale on the sales floor. Our average time in backlog for a customer that\u2019s in a build job is not terribly long because our homes -- generally, we are building through affordable price point, homes build fairly efficiently. And so, the customer is not sitting for a long period of time going through a large design selection process, lengthy permitting process till we get to start. A lot of these homes will be starting very soon after they sign the contract. So, it\u2019s a very tight margin differential between just a traditional spec sale to the marketplace.\nKen Zener: I appreciate that. And if I could, one last question. Did you guys pull most of your permits in California to get ahead of the solar mandate? Thank you.\nDavid Auld: No. I don\u2019t think so. We\u2019re responding to market out there. And certainly, the solar mandate is going to increase cost. But, pulling a permit and building a house when there is not a market forward is going to create a whole lot less return than pay any additional cost. So, it\u2019s kind of business as usual for us out there. And the solar mandate was -- we\u2019ve known about that for several years that we\u2019ve had the ability to prepare, and that\u2019s in our underwriting and we knew those costs were coming and as more and more homes are being built with solar, our base case expectation is that those costs will come down.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is now live.\nBuck Horne: Quick question. Could you just put color on percentage of communities that you were able to raise price on, on a same plan basis?\nMike Murray: Buck, we don\u2019t have that information in terms of tracking across our neighborhoods. We\u2019ve really have empowered our local operators to be looking to meet the market to drive returns, and that is certainly a function of pace and margin. And they\u2019re looking to maximize that at every community, every week, every day frankly as to looking at what that pace is. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019re managing centrally. So, we don\u2019t really have the ability to give you that color today.\nJessica Hansen: When we talk about a lot, our revenues per square foot, that\u2019s a metric people -- we\u2019ve consistently reported and we have given that yet today. Year-over-year, our revenue per square foot was up about 3%, and our stick and brick costs were down about 0.5%. Sequentially, our revenues per square foot, and our stick and brick costs per square foot were essentially flat.\nBuck Horne: And switching over to just the multifamily investments. Just curious if you could provide any potential quarterly timing of expected sales or closings, or how do you think of potential gains on sale from the multifamily division, either this year, next year? How do you plan on growing that investment going forward?\nMike Murray: Sure. In terms of timing, we expect to close a total of two projects in fiscal 2020. We closed our first one here in Q1. We did say that one of our communities is substantially complete, and so the process of stabilizing the rental situation and marketing it. So, we would expect to close that one later in fiscal 2020, don\u2019t have a specific quarter guide for you on that. And then, we do expect the investment level in the DHI Communities to grow this year. We expect it to grow approximately 100% from the point at the start of the year over the course of this year, as their pipeline is growing, and their number of projects will begin to grow more directly over the course of fiscal 2020, which will ultimately result in some future years, delivering more than two a year. The lead time, the pipeline on those deals is 2 to 3 years long. So, we\u2019re still a couple of years out from a significant increase of volume of project sales in DHI Communities. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Your line is now live.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you. With respect to single-family rental and multifamily, do you have any interest as the company, and any interest in creating a permanent capital vehicle to hold those assets? In my experience, in the REIT sector, the highest valuation is ascribed to continual recurring earnings rather than gain on sale type earnings where it\u2019s unpredictable to the market? Just curious as to your thoughts on that?\nBill Wheat: Yes. I understand that Jade. And it\u2019s something -- we\u2019re aware of that as well. And that\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re studying as we as we get further into this business. Our goals early on have been to ensure that we have a strong, efficient operating platform for beginning with multifamily. And as we look at the single family rental space, we\u2019re looking to do the same thing there. And as we get that established, we then look to growing the platform and setting the capital base for it. And so, as we look at the medium and longer term plans for setting the capital base for both of those businesses, that\u2019s certainly something that we will be considering for the longer term.\nJade Rahmani: Thanks very much. Turning to financial leverage, was wondering if the total debt to capital at slightly below 20% is in line with your long-term target, or do you think there\u2019s potentially improvement in that ratio in years to come?\nBill Wheat: Where we are today, we don\u2019t expect to increase our leverage. We expect to -- as we are generating cash and adding to our equity base that our leverage would not increase from here, and we could see further decreases. Our stated maximum leverage is 35% or below. But obviously, we got a lot of headroom on that today, but that does give us room that in certain scenarios we would leave ourselves some room to invest further and increase leverage, but we don\u2019t see that in the short run.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Rohit Seth from SunTrust. Your line is now live.\nRohit Seth: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give us an update on what\u2019s happening with the Freedom brand? Any color on that buyer segment?\nDavid Auld: We continue to work on that product offering presentation and lifestyle. It\u2019s something we\u2019re happy with. I think, it will be a larger and larger portion of our deliveries in the future. It\u2019s a growing demographic. And we think we can provide a product and lifestyle that people are going to move into.\nRohit Seth: Would you say -- are you expecting a ramp in that business in your annual guidance or is that annual guidance more driven by kind of that entry level bar? \nDavid Auld: It\u2019s still the entry level bar driving the market. The Freedom brand for us is part of our long term meet the needs of as many buyers out there as we can. And I think as the market moves, it will become a more and more important part of what we\u2019re doing.\nRohit Seth: Understood. And then, second question on your gross margin guidance, 21%.Can you maybe break out the cost buckets there, what\u2019s your labor cost inflation expectation, material cost and then like cost.\nJessica Hansen: Really just more of the same, so modest increases. I\u2019d say labor has stayed in the low single digit percentage range. Now that we\u2019ve kind of cycled through the lumber headwinds that we had, materials, we essentially would expect to be net neutral. We always have some categories where costs are going up. But, our purchasing teams do a fantastic job of finding other categories to lower our costs and offset whatever increases we\u2019re not able to push back on. And then, land really has been kind of a low to mid single digit percentage increase, at least on a per square foot basis. And that really is not expected to change either. I mean, land costs aren\u2019t coming down. As home prices, land costs typically follow. So, really just more of the same in \u201820 as what we experienced in \u201819, if you take out late calendar \u201818 incentive environment and the lumber costs that we cycled through.\nRohit Seth: And what is the expectation for tariff -- the tariff impact or no impact, or what you have in there? \nJessica Hansen: We\u2019ve got price protection on most everything. If there is a modest impact from any of the tariffs, we\u2019ve identified ways to offset that.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research. Your line is now live.\nMark Weintraub: You mentioned the very positive early returns on spring selling season. Was that largely just a reference to strong orders in January, or was it other things that color that comment?\nMike Murray: The primary thing is the order trends. I mean, that\u2019s the first read we\u2019re getting on what\u2019s coming through. And they\u2019re coming in at a great pace that we\u2019ve expected and we\u2019re seeing good seasonal build, week-to-week with that. And anecdotally, we\u2019re not hearing about any pushback or pressure on pricing from the customer side of the marketplace today.\nMark Weintraub: Kind of following up on that. Obviously, as Jessica just mentioned, you have a fairly benign cost environment now. As things heat up, labor does go higher, materials go higher, et cetera, do you have a sense as to what type of pricing power you might have in the current environment? And really, I recognize it\u2019s always a question of taste versus price. But, I guess, at some point in time, when you try and push price, it could have a bigger impact than at other times. And certainly, we saw that in the last year or two. Do you think that we\u2019ve created a bit more cushion in the environment, so that there would be more leeway on price, if costs start to go up, or do you think we haven\u2019t exited that environment?\nMike Murray: Feel really good about the market conditions we\u2019re seeing today and the buyers that are coming in and their urgency to buy. So, I would say we have some cushion to work with in that. But again, we\u2019re not just looking at a margin number, it is a return numbers, as you alluded to before, the pace versus price. And so, driving the communities at the planned absorptions, we found drive the highest returns. And then, the activity that begets that coming out of buyers seeing activity, seeing momentum, drives generally some pricing power and some margin expansion, executing at the community level. And that\u2019s really where our focus is. And as it\u2019s rolling up, we\u2019ve seen pretty consistent margins the last couple quarters and we\u2019re looking at that into next quarter. We\u2019re optimistic about spring, and that\u2019s going to tell us where margins ultimately go for this year.\nMark Weintraub: And one last one. Where are your thoughts on offsite manufacturing as a way to potentially mitigate or improve the labor side of things in time?\nMike Murray: So, we have -- a lot of our homes are put together with trusses, roof trusses that are manufactured offsite. Others, we\u2019re doing wall penalization in certain markets. And it\u2019s something we continually evaluate to look at the most efficient from both a time and a cost perspective as to how to deliver the home at the best value to the buyer. So, we\u2019re always evaluating it. We haven\u2019t seen a sea change in the economics of that today. Most of our homes are probably stick framed with trusses would be probably the broad generalization to say. But, there are some markets where we build roofs onsite.\nMark Weintraub: Great. Thank you.\nMike Murray: Vary across the country.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Jay McCanless from Wedbush. Your line is now live.\nJay McCanless: Just two questions. On incentives, what are you guys doing with incentives now? And more importantly, what are you seeing from your competition?\nBill Wheat: Pretty stable environment there. Certainly on a year-over-year basis, our incentives are down significantly, but over the last couple of quarters, been pretty stable. It\u2019s a normal environment where there\u2019s usually some level of incentives related to closing costs. And then, community-by-community, there could be some specific incentives but nothing out of the ordinary certainly in our business. And really, we\u2019re seeing pretty rational environment across other builders as well not hearing anything out of the ordinary.\nDavid Auld: I\u2019d say, the market is good. People are, as Bill said, performing rationally. It -- good time to be a homebuilder.\nJay McCanless: My second question. Just talking about what your average lot per community is right now and are you expecting that the trend up just to get the higher year-over-year unit closures you talked about the guidance?\nJessica Hansen: It slightly trended up here over the last couple of years, Jay, as our absorptions have improved, that does allow our underwriting to hit our standards and use slightly larger communities. So, I would say that is incorporated in what we\u2019re expecting for fiscal \u201820, but that\u2019s really just been more of the same of what we\u2019ve experienced each of the last few years. Multiple product types and larger communities allows us to drive more absorption. So, I don\u2019t have our current average lot size or a lot count. Rough, I would say probably 150, 200 lots. But obviously, we\u2019ve got significant variation in that. We\u2019ve got communities that are 30 lots, we\u2019ve got a communities are a 1,000 lots.\nMike Murray: Some more options, some more owned. There\u2019s a big mix there.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Alex Barron from Housing Research Center. Your line is now live.\nAlex Barron: I guess, I just wanted to circle back a little bit to the guidance. Over the last two quarters, orders have been double digit and a little bit off of that was maybe easier comp. But, I guess, I\u2019m just curious, you guys just being conservative this early in the spring selling season basically, giving the single digit order growth guidance or delivery guidance?\nJessica Hansen: So, Alex, not to be repetitive, but really, it is a function of where we sit today, the number of houses we have, the number of houses we had going into the year. We did have a much easier comp this quarter compared to late calendar last year, when the market was completely different than what it is. And to remind everyone, we heavily incentivized into December and really ended the spring to continue those sales increases that we saw. I think, we were the only builder in calendar 4Q of \u201818 that had an up quarter. Our sales were up about 3%, and that really was just a function of how heavily we incentivized in December to get there. So, October and November, you can read into were very tough months. And that led into a good comp this year, and 19% you though. I mean, it\u2019s a good market. As Mike\u2019s alluded to several times, we feel very good about the market today. But, we sit here today, we haven\u2019t seen the spring selling season. We\u2019ve got 5% fewer houses in the ground. So, if we\u2019re able to push and get a few more starts in, and the spring is stronger than expected, could there be a little upside, potentially, but we don\u2019t see a whole lot. And we did already raise the higher end of our guidance by about 500 homes.\nMike Murray: And on balance, we\u2019re looking at much stronger returns in fiscal 2020, because we\u2019re still seeing a good pace. Even at the guidance level, we\u2019re seeing a good pace, at better margins, better returns and a better turn of our inventory this year as well. So, we\u2019re very pleased with our positioning with the good market backdrop, and with our plan for the year.\nAlex Barron: Got it. And then, you mentioned that the best returns come from maintaining the sales pace pretty strong. So, we [indiscernible] you are seeking to push prices so much to not upset that strong sales pace?\nJessica Hansen: It depends on the community, Alex. It really just depends. If we\u2019ve got another community replacing a community ready to go behind it, we\u2019re going to most likely push more pace than we are priced because that\u2019s the best thing that we can do is continue to turn our inventory, generate more revenue and profits in a shorter period of time. But, if it\u2019s an area of the country where we don\u2019t have a replacement community or for whatever reason that community is not replaceable, we are going to be more likely to push price. So, it\u2019s always a balance community-by-community.\nAlex Barron: Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks and good luck this year.\nMike Murray: Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to David for any further or closing comments.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everybody\u2019s time on the call today and look forward to speaking to you again in April. And to the D.R. Horton team, outstanding first quarter. Thank you for your focus and hard work, and we\u2019ve got a great year set up, let\u2019s go deliver it.\nOperator: So, thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "content": "Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 53% to $1.16 per share, compared to $0.76 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 50% to $431 million, compared to $287 million. Our first quarter results included tax benefit of $32.9 million related to federal energy efficient homes tax credits that were retroactively reinstated. Our consolidated pretax income increased 39% to $523 million in the first quarter and our homebuilding pretax income increased 30% to $462 million. Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 13% to $3.9 billion on 12,959 homes closed, up from $3.4 billion on 11,500 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was up 1% from last year to $298,100 and the average size of our homes closed was down 2%, reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill? We ended the first quarter with 30,200 homes in inventory. 18,400 of our total homes were unsold of which 5,600 were completed. Our first quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $1.3 billion, of which $890 million was for purchases of land and finished lots, while $410 million was for land development. Our underwriting criteria and operational expectations for new communities remained consistent at a minimum 20% annual pre tax return on inventory and return of our initial cash within 24 months. David? Forestar, our majority owned subsidiary is a publicly-traded residential lot manufacturer, operating in 51 markets across 20 states. At December 31st, Forestar's lot position consisted of 44,500 lots of which 32,200 are owned and 12,300 our controlled through purchase contracts. 80% of Forestar's owned lots are already under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under the master supply agreement. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, Forestar delivered 2,422 lots and is on track to deliver 10,000 lots in fiscal 2020 and generate $800 million to 850 million of revenue. Forestar expects to deliver 12,000 lots and generate $900 million to $1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2021. These expectations are for Forestar's standalone results. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and is committed to maintaining a long-term net debt to capital ratio of 40% or lower. At December 31st, Forestar's net debt to capital ratio was 9.7%. Forestar has approximately $720 million of liquidity to fund its continued growth, which includes $370 million of unrestricted cash and $350 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. Forestar hosted their quarterly earnings call last Thursday and have an updated presentation on their Investors site and investor.forestar.com that describes Forestar's unique lot manufacturing model, and a significant growth and value creation opportunity. Jessica? Yes. We're still on track with our plan there John to ultimately deconsolidate Forestar. We were pleased when they were able to issue their first primary equity offering in September, which diluted our position down from the original 75%; here in December, we're sitting at 65%. We would expect additional equity issuances from Forestar over time that could continue to dilute our position. And then, as we've also said all along, there's a potential that we could sell some of our shares. And at the point in time that we are ready to do that, we will have a plan in place that will complement the primary equity issuance. And those two things together would result in further dilution in our ownership position. Sure, Stephen. As you know, you start your land spend, there is some lumpiness kind of from quarter-to-quarter. And so, one quarter, just based on the timing of when deals close and when they get ready to go and based on our business plans, there can be a bit of lumpiness there. One thing I would point out is that over half of our land acquisition spend is for finished lots. And so, we continue to dedicate a lot of our spend to finished lots which turn very quickly. And so I would really just attribute -- I wouldn't say there is necessarily any changes in our plans, but I would attribute a bit of this to a bit of a lumpiness, point out that finished lots are a heavy part of the spend. But, then we do -- we are optimistic. We do see growth, certainty in fiscal \u201820. And right now, we still see very good underlying fundamentals for the business. And so, we are still actively replenishing our land and lot supply. Truman, we're really excited about the way this year started off the first quarter and through the first several weeks of January, and we have increased our guidance as a result of that. Structurally, it's a question of the lots that are out in front of us. We feel good about the community positioning we have, getting some communities opened. But right now, we're not going to increase our guidance, based on where we are today in the spring selling season. But, we will certainly look to deliver all the homes we can. That's the best returns we can do in fiscal \u201820. There is a finite number of homes we can build over the next 8.5, 9 months and deliver by September 30th. But, we're comfortable with our guidance range today, and we're just going to have to see what the spring is going to give us and where we end up in our inventory positioning in March and in April and May. Matt, the other thing we look at here and we watch sort of from a high level perspective is what our build times are doing in our process when we start a house, can we get it completed and then closed. And we're not seeing those times elongate, which would be real, more acute indicators of labor shortages in various markets. So, the longstanding deep relationships we have with a lot of the labor suppliers, combined with a more efficient plan set, if you will, in our communities and focus on the first time homebuyer and affordability, has driven our ability to continue to turn houses a little bit better, and we're going to see a lot of improvement in that metric this year. We expect it to be just continued incremental improvement on all for us. We do expect to continue to -- and our goal is to continue to push an option percentage upward. We're not going to set necessarily an upward target. But, we do expect to incrementally improve that as Forestar grows, build out its platform even further, that's going to continue to be part of that growth story as well as expanding relationships with our developers. We've already alluded to on this call we're expecting to turn our housing inventory faster this year. And so, that's going to be an incremental level in terms of returns this year. And then, as our operations are more efficient and generate more cash that gives us more flexibility on the capital allocation side. And so, over the last several years, we have instituted an increasing level of share repurchases and dividend payoffs to shareholders, which has enhanced our ROE. And so, as we continue to incrementally improve each year, I think each one of those levers is going to allow us to continue to incrementally improve both operational returns and returns to shareholders. I think, we're seeing generally increased absorptions at our more affordable price points, whether that's the entire community or certain plans within more the traditional Horton branded communities. We are not heavily exposed to the luxury end of the market. So, we're not experiencing if there is any lift there or not lift going on there. We can speak to that very well. But, across all of our geographies, we're feeling pretty good about the traffic, pretty good about the demand, in the most recent quarter and in the quarters leading up to it. I'd say, we've seen normal seasonality week-to-week as we progressed in January. It seems like historically people talked about Super Bowl Sunday being the kickoff to the spring selling season. And we've noticed the past few years that seems to be starting a little bit earlier. And maybe it's because the Cowboys did make the playoffs, people are buying houses sooner. So, we're excited for Chiefs. And I think... And yes -- speak on opportunity. Yes. We're currently think about the business, we're still early stages on it and we're trying to get in and really understand the operations of the business and see where we add the most value to that process. Today, it's probably more dipping our toe in the water on the owned side, but we are certainly looking at it hard, and have not shut the door on any possibility today. Ken, a lot of our build job sales are actually sales of homes that we had planned to start anyway. They were in the production planning process to start. They just had not stated yet, but they were released to sale on the sales floor. Our average time in backlog for a customer that's in a build job is not terribly long because our homes -- generally, we are building through affordable price point, homes build fairly efficiently. And so, the customer is not sitting for a long period of time going through a large design selection process, lengthy permitting process till we get to start. A lot of these homes will be starting very soon after they sign the contract. So, it's a very tight margin differential between just a traditional spec sale to the marketplace. Buck, we don't have that information in terms of tracking across our neighborhoods. We've really have empowered our local operators to be looking to meet the market to drive returns, and that is certainly a function of pace and margin. And they're looking to maximize that at every community, every week, every day frankly as to looking at what that pace is. And that's something that we're managing centrally. So, we don't really have the ability to give you that color today. Sure. In terms of timing, we expect to close a total of two projects in fiscal 2020. We closed our first one here in Q1. We did say that one of our communities is substantially complete, and so the process of stabilizing the rental situation and marketing it. So, we would expect to close that one later in fiscal 2020, don't have a specific quarter guide for you on that. And then, we do expect the investment level in the DHI Communities to grow this year. We expect it to grow approximately 100% from the point at the start of the year over the course of this year, as their pipeline is growing, and their number of projects will begin to grow more directly over the course of fiscal 2020, which will ultimately result in some future years, delivering more than two a year. The lead time, the pipeline on those deals is 2 to 3 years long. So, we're still a couple of years out from a significant increase of volume of project sales in DHI Communities. The primary thing is the order trends. I mean, that's the first read we're getting on what's coming through. And they're coming in at a great pace that we've expected and we're seeing good seasonal build, week-to-week with that. And anecdotally, we're not hearing about any pushback or pressure on pricing from the customer side of the marketplace today. Feel really good about the market conditions we're seeing today and the buyers that are coming in and their urgency to buy. So, I would say we have some cushion to work with in that. But again, we're not just looking at a margin number, it is a return numbers, as you alluded to before, the pace versus price. And so, driving the communities at the planned absorptions, we found drive the highest returns. And then, the activity that begets that coming out of buyers seeing activity, seeing momentum, drives generally some pricing power and some margin expansion, executing at the community level. And that's really where our focus is. And as it's rolling up, we've seen pretty consistent margins the last couple quarters and we're looking at that into next quarter. We're optimistic about spring, and that's going to tell us where margins ultimately go for this year. So, we have -- a lot of our homes are put together with trusses, roof trusses that are manufactured offsite. Others, we're doing wall penalization in certain markets. And it's something we continually evaluate to look at the most efficient from both a time and a cost perspective as to how to deliver the home at the best value to the buyer. So, we're always evaluating it. We haven't seen a sea change in the economics of that today. Most of our homes are probably stick framed with trusses would be probably the broad generalization to say. But, there are some markets where we build roofs onsite. Vary across the country. Some more options, some more owned. There's a big mix there. And on balance, we're looking at much stronger returns in fiscal 2020, because we're still seeing a good pace. Even at the guidance level, we're seeing a good pace, at better margins, better returns and a better turn of our inventory this year as well. So, we're very pleased with our positioning with the good market backdrop, and with our plan for the year. Thank you, Alex."

            "name": "David Auld",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I'm pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team started the year off strong. Our consolidated pretax income for the quarter increased 39% to $523 million on a 14% increase in revenue to $4 billion. Our pretax profit margin improved 230 basis points to 13%, and our net sales orders increased 19%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31st was 18.7% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 18.2%. These results reflect strength of our operational teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint, and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. We continue to see a good demand and a limited supply of homes at affordable prices across our markets, while economic fundamentals and financing availability remain strong -- solid, excuse me. Our strategic focus is to continue consolidated market share, while growing our revenues and profits, generating strong annual cash flows and returns, and maintaining a flexible financial position with a conservative balance sheet that includes an ample supply of homes, lots and lands for growth. We are well-positioned for the remainder of 2020 and future years. Mike? At December 31st, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 320,000 lots of which 39% were owned and 61% were controlled through purchase contracts. 33% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 56% of our controlled lots are will be finished when we purchase them. We continue working to increase our lot position being developed by third parties by supporting the growth of Forestar's national lot manufacturing platform and expanding our relationship with lot developers across the country. Our current lot portfolio includes an ample supply of lots for homes at affordable price points and continues to provide a strong competitive advantage. Mike? DHI Communities is our multifamily rental company focused suburban garden-style apartments with operations primarily in Texas, Arizona and Florida. During the quarter, DHI Communities sold its third apartment project located in Phoenix for $61.5 million and recognized a gain on sale of $31.2 million. DHI Communities has four projects under active construction and one project that was substantially complete at the end of the quarter. DHI Communities' total assets were $210 million at December 31st. Bill? In closing, our results reflect the strength of our well-established operating platform across the country. We are focused on consolidating market share while growing our revenues and profits and generating strong annual cash flows and returns while maintaining a flexible financial position. Our return on equity of 18.2% and our homebuilding return on inventory of 18.7%, demonstrate our consistent focus and efforts. We're well-positioned to continue this performance with our conservative balance sheet, broad geographic footprint, affordable product offering across multiple brands, attractive finished lot and land position and most importantly, our outstanding experienced teams across the country. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. We are incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Well, the cash out in two years is something we stayed with through this -- from the downturn on. And I can tell you that that model has worked very well for us. And I don't see that changing. And as to the overall market for buying land, again, it comes back to the people we have embedded in these markets and relationships they have with the land's owners. And we feel very good about our opportunity to replace what we're building through, and through this market have seen that happen over and over and over again, so. I think, there's always going to be that pressure on the cost side. Definitely, labor is getting tighter and continues to -- I think going to restrict a lot of people's ability to deliver houses. Again, it goes back to the kind of operating profile we adopted and continue, and that is consistent starts throughout the community, expanding the labor base, the efficiency, not necessarily just bodies. And we feel very good about what we've accomplished. We have a very loyal trade base. I think I said on the last call, our traders don't have to go chase their paychecks. So, all of that combines to put us in a great position. Is it going to be a problem? I think less so for us than other people. I think, we're going to see consistent margins into the second quarter. And then frankly, as usual this time of the year, the spring selling season will really dictate where margins go in Q3 and Q4. Early returns in the spring selling season have been very positive. So, we're confident in giving our guidance of consistent margins in the Q2, but we're going to have to wait and see what happens in the next several weeks. A couple of things going on with that number, Alan. One, the comparison to prior year, we're actually down 5%. We've changed the way we report homes and inventory to exclude the model homes. So, last year, we were -- where we were last year, like 31,800; and so, this year, we are at 30,200. So, we're down slightly from last year. And last year may have been a bit elevated with softer sales and operating environment we saw in the fourth calendar quarter of \u201818. Another thing we've talked about is getting better at turning our housing inventory to drive a higher return with those investment dollars. And then, we're also seeing the ability to push starts in as we're seeing demand come on. We're not noticing any kind of a difference in the mix between to be built versus our spec starts, continuing probably an 80-20 consistent approach for that. We're not going to set a hard target. Internally, we talk about goals, but that's an internal conversation. And it's kind of a balanced program. I think, the Forestar platform is again built out. We're very happy with the progress we're making there. But, we are also equally focused on our third-party developers. And they are a part of the D.R. Horton family. And that pipeline continues to get better and bigger. And so, it's a collection of the two. Primarily, it's just focus. We're treating capital as if it's a precious commodity. And we're going to try to treat it better than anybody else in the industry. It gets back to -- to me, it gets back to relationships with trade base. And for the last, I don't know, ever since the downturn, we've had a steady and consistent level of production going in our communities. And so, our trade base has gotten better at building the houses. And when they're not out there chasing work, then they can build more houses. What I look at is the same labor. We build more square footage with the same labor hours. So, it's a process. It's something we've worked on all the way through this cycle. I think early on, we felt like labor was going to be the constraint on housing. And we have done I think a great job of managing the trade base and making sure that those guys were making money. And we were still delivering houses at a reasonable cost. And the 49ers Yes. No. I don't think so. We're responding to market out there. And certainly, the solar mandate is going to increase cost. But, pulling a permit and building a house when there is not a market forward is going to create a whole lot less return than pay any additional cost. So, it's kind of business as usual for us out there. And the solar mandate was -- we've known about that for several years that we've had the ability to prepare, and that's in our underwriting and we knew those costs were coming and as more and more homes are being built with solar, our base case expectation is that those costs will come down. We continue to work on that product offering presentation and lifestyle. It's something we're happy with. I think, it will be a larger and larger portion of our deliveries in the future. It's a growing demographic. And we think we can provide a product and lifestyle that people are going to move into. It's still the entry level bar driving the market. The Freedom brand for us is part of our long term meet the needs of as many buyers out there as we can. And I think as the market moves, it will become a more and more important part of what we're doing. I'd say, the market is good. People are, as Bill said, performing rationally. It -- good time to be a homebuilder. Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking to you again in April. And to the D.R. Horton team, outstanding first quarter. Thank you for your focus and hard work, and we've got a great year set up, let's go deliver it."

            "content": "Net sales orders in the first quarter increased 19% to 13,126 homes and the value of those orders was $3.9 billion, up 22% from $3.2 billion in the prior year. Our significant sales price increase over the prior year quarter reflects the moderation in demand that occurred in late calendar 2018. Our average number of active selling communities increased 6% from the prior year and was flat sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the first quarter was $300,900, up 3% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 20% compared to 24% in the same quarter last year. Jessica? In the first quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 9.2%, down 30 basis points from 9.5% in the prior year quarter. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our growth. Mike? Our balanced capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet strength and operating results are providing increased flexibility, and we are utilizing our strong position to enhance the long-term value of the Company. During the first three months of fiscal 2020, our cash used in homebuilding operations was $178.4 million, compared to $396.8 million in the prior year period. At December 31st, we had $2.6 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.4 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage improved 370 basis points to 19.5%. The balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $2.4 billion. And we have $500 million of senior notes maturing on February 15th, which we plan to repay, utilizing cash on hand and our revolving credit facility, as necessary. At December 31st, our stockholders' equity was $10.2 billion and book value per share was $27.92, up 14% from a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $64.6 million. We also repurchased 3 million shares of common stock for $163.1 million, resulting in $732.6 million remaining on our stock repurchase authorization at December 31, 2019. Our outstanding share count was down 2%, year-over-year. Jessica? To the extent we're delivering on our closings guidance and showing mid to high single digit growth in revenue, we do expect to see leverage on our SG&A and improvement year-over-year. We're very pleased with the 30 basis points we saw in the first quarter. Based on what we see today and the volume we see in Q2, we do expect SG&A to be relatively flat with last year in Q2. But overall, we do expect some leverage for the year. Yes. I understand that Jade. And it's something -- we're aware of that as well. And that's one of the things that we're studying as we as we get further into this business. Our goals early on have been to ensure that we have a strong, efficient operating platform for beginning with multifamily. And as we look at the single family rental space, we're looking to do the same thing there. And as we get that established, we then look to growing the platform and setting the capital base for it. And so, as we look at the medium and longer term plans for setting the capital base for both of those businesses, that's certainly something that we will be considering for the longer term. Where we are today, we don't expect to increase our leverage. We expect to -- as we are generating cash and adding to our equity base that our leverage would not increase from here, and we could see further decreases. Our stated maximum leverage is 35% or below. But obviously, we got a lot of headroom on that today, but that does give us room that in certain scenarios we would leave ourselves some room to invest further and increase leverage, but we don't see that in the short run. Pretty stable environment there. Certainly on a year-over-year basis, our incentives are down significantly, but over the last couple of quarters, been pretty stable. It's a normal environment where there's usually some level of incentives related to closing costs. And then, community-by-community, there could be some specific incentives but nothing out of the ordinary certainly in our business. And really, we're seeing pretty rational environment across other builders as well not hearing anything out of the ordinary."

Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the U.S. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton.\nJessica Hansen : Thank you, Tom, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 financial results. Before we get started, today's call includes comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.

This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor. drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-K towards the end of next week. As referenced in our press release, we realigned the aggregation of our home-building operating segments into 6 new reportable segments this quarter to better allocate our home-building operating segments across our geographic reporting regions.  As a result, in addition to our standard updated investor and supplementary data presentations, we will also be posting to our Investor Relations site, 3 years of quarterly sales, closings, backlog, homes, and lock data that conforms to our new geographic region presentation. All of this can be found at investor. drhorton.com on the Presentations section under News and Events, for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.\nDavid Auld : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officer, and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today, we also have Paul Romanowski with us, who was recently promoted to Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officer. Paul has been with D.R. Horton since 1999 serving as our Florida South Division President for 15 years, and most recently, as our Florida Region President for 7 years. I'd like to take a brief moment to have Paul introduce himself before we get started, Paul.\nPaul Romanowski: Thank you, David. And hello, everyone. I'm excited for the opportunity to serve in my new role on the D.R. Horton management team, and I look forward to getting to know our investors and analysts in the coming year.\nDavid Auld : Thank you, Paul. Given that Paul is new to his role, he will not be an active participant today, but we are glad to have him with us and believe his extensive home building experience will strengthen our executive team. The D.R. Horton team finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, which included a 63% increase in consolidated pre -tax income to $1.7 billion and a 27% increase in revenue to $8.1 billion. Our pre -tax profit margin for the quarter improved 480 basis points to 21.3%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 65% to $3.70. For the year, consolidated pre -tax income increased 80% to $5.4 billion on a $27.8 billion of revenue.  Our pre -tax profit margin for the year improved 460 basis points to 19.3%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 78% to $11.41. We closed a record 81,965 homes this year, an increase of over 16,500 homes or 25% from last year, while also achieving a historical low home building SG&A percentage of 7.3%. Our home building return on inventory was 37.9%, and our return on equity was 31.6%, these results reflect our experienced teams in their production capabilities. Our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint, and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Our home-building cash flow from operations for 2021 was $1.2 billion.  Over the past 5 years, we have generated $5.9 billion of cash flow from homebuilding operations. While growing our consolidated revenues by 128% and our earnings per share by 383%. During this time, we also more than doubled our book value per share, reduced our homebuilding leverage 220%, and increased our homebuilding liquidity by $2.8 billion, all while significantly increasing our returns on inventory and equity. Market conditions remain very robust and we are focused on maximizing returns and increasing our market share further. However, there are still significant challenges in the supply chain, including shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market.  As a result, we continued restricting our home sales base during the fourth quarter by selling homes later in the construction cycle to align with our production levels and better ensure certainty of home closing date for our homebuyers. We expect to approve the supply chain challenges and ultimately increase our production capacity. After starting construction on 22,400 homes this quarter, our homes in inventory increased 26% from a year ago to 47,800 homes at September 30th, 2021. In October, we started more than 8,000 homes, further positioning us to achieve double-digit growth again in 2022. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage position holds very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace, and inventory levels to optimize our returns. Mike.\nMike Murray: Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 65% to $3.70 per share, and for the year, diluted earnings per share increased 78% to $11.41. Net income for the quarter increased 62% to $1.3 billion and for the year, net income increased 76% to $4.2 billion. Our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 24% to $7.6 billion on 21,937 homes closed, up from $6.1 billion on 20,248 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $346,100, up 14% from last year. And the average size of our homes closed was down 1%, Bill?\nBill Wheat : Net sales orders in the fourth quarter decreased 33% to 15,949 homes, and the value of those orders was $6 billion down 17% from $7.3 billion in the prior year. A year ago, our fourth quarter net sales orders were up 81% due to the surgeon housing demand during the first year of the pandemic when we had significantly more completed homes available to sell and prior to the supply chain challenges that arose in 2021. Our average number of active selling communities decreased 5% from the prior year and was down 3% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the fourth quarter was $378,300, up 23% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the fourth quarter was 19%, flat with the prior-year quarter.  As David described, new home demand remains very strong and our local teams are continuing to restrict our sales order pace where necessary on a community-by-community basis based on the number of homes in inventory, construction times, production capacity, and lock position. They also continue to adjust sales prices to market while staying focused on providing value to our buyers. We are still restricting the pace of our sales orders during our first fiscal quarter, but to a lesser extent than during our fourth quarter. As a result, we expect our first quarter net sales orders to be approximately equal to or slightly higher than our 20,418 sales orders in the first quarter last year. Our October net sales order volume was in line with our plans and we remain confident that we are well-positioned to deliver double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2022, with 26,200 homes in backlog, 47,000 homes in inventory, a robust lot supply, and strong trade and supplier relationships. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 26.9% up 100 basis points sequentially from the June quarter. The increase in our gross margin from June to September reflects the broad strength of the housing market and benefited from the better alignment of our sales order pace to our construction schedules. The strong demand for a limited supply of homes has allowed us to continue to raise prices or lower the level of sales incentives in most of our communities. On a per square foot basis, our revenues were up 7% sequentially, while our stick-and-brick cost per square foot increased 7.5%, and our lot cost increased 2%.  We expect both our construction and lot costs will continue to increase. However, with the strength of today's market conditions, we expect to offset any cost pressures with price increases. We currently expect our home-sales gross margin in the first quarter to be similar to the fourth quarter. We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pays in each of our communities to optimize the return on our inventory investments, and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. Bill.\nBill Wheat : In the fourth quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenues was 6.9% down 70 basis points from 7.6% in the prior year quarter. For the year, homebuilding SG&A expense was 7.3% down 80 basis points from 8.1% in 2020. Our homebuilding SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenues, is at its lowest point for a quarter and for a year in our history. And we are focused on continuing to control our SG&A while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our business. David?\nDavid Auld : We have increased our housing inventory and response to the strength of demand, and are focused on expanding our production capabilities further. We started 22,400 homes during the fourth quarter and 91,500 homes during fiscal 2021, which is an increase of 21% compared to fiscal 2020. We ended the year with 47,800 homes in inventory, up 26% from a year ago. 21,700 of our total homes at September 30th were unsold, of which 900 were completed. Although we have not seen significant improvement in the supply chain yet we expect the current constraints to ultimately moderate at some point in 2022. Mike?\nMike Murray: At September 30th, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 530,000 lots of which 24% were owned and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. 24% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 47% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our growing in capital efficient lot portfolio is key to our strong competitive position and will support our efforts to increase our production volume to meet home-buyer demand. Our fourth quarter home-building investments in lot, land, and development totaled $1.8 billion, of which $1 billion was for finished lots, $330 million was for land, and $440 million was for land development. Bill.\nBill Wheat : Forestar, our majority-owned subsidiary is a publicly traded well-capitalized residential lot manufacturer, operating in 56 markets across 23 states. Forestar continues to execute extremely well on its high-growth plan, as they increase their lots sold by 53% to 15,915 lots during fiscal 2021, compared to the prior year. Forestar 's pre -tax profit margin for the year improved 400 basis points to 12.4%, excluding an $18.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt.  At September 30th, Forestar's owned and controlled lot position increased 60% from a year ago to 97,000 lots. 61% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer, under our master supply agreement. $370 million of D.R. Horton's land and lot purchases in the fourth quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton, and had approximately $500 million of liquidity at year-end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 35.2% with its current capitalization, strong lot supply, and relationship with D.R. Horton, Forestar plans to continue profitably growing their business. Jessica.\nJessica Hansen : Financial services pre -tax income in the fourth quarter was $103 million on $223 million of revenues, with a pre -tax profit margin at 46.1%. For the year, financial services pre -tax income was $365 million on $824 million of revenues representing a 44.3% free tax profit margin. For the quarter, 98% of our mortgage Company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage Company handled the financing for 66% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 45% of the mortgage Company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 722 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. First-time home buyers represented 59% of the closings handled by our mortgage Company this quarter. Mike?\nMike Murray: Our multi-family and single-family rental operations generated combined pretax income of $74.3 million in the fourth quarter and $86.5 million in fiscal 2021. Our total rental property inventory at September 30th was $841 million compared to $316 million a year ago. We sold 3 multi-family properties totaling 960 units during fiscal 2021 for $191.9 million, all of which were sold in the fourth quarter, compared to 2 properties totaling 540 units sold in fiscal 2020. We sold 3 single-family rental communities totaling 260 homes during fiscal 2021 for $75.9 million dollars, including one sale of 64 homes during the fourth quarter for $21 million dollars in revenue.  In fiscal 2022, we expect our rental operations to generate more than $700 million in revenues from rental property sales. We also expect to grow the total inventory investment in our rental platforms by more than $1 billion in fiscal 2022 based on our current rental projects in development and our significant pipeline of future single and multi-family rental projects. We are positioning our rental operations to be a significant contributor to our revenues, profits, and returns in future years. Bill.\nBill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic. During fiscal 2021, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $1.2 billion dollars, and our cumulative cash generated from homebuilding operations for the past 5 years was $5.9 billion. At September 30th, we had $5 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $3 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our home building revolving credit facility. This level of liquidity provides significant flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions.  Our home building leverage was 17.8% at fiscal year-end, with $3.1 billion of home-building public notes outstanding, of which $350 million matures in the next 12 months. At September 30th, our stockholder's equity was $14.9 billion, and book value per share was $41.81, up 29% from a year ago. For the year, our return on equity was 31.6%, an improvement of 950 basis points from 22.1% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $71.6 million for a total of $289.3 million of dividends paid during year. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares of common stock for $212.6 million.  And our stock repurchases during fiscal year 2021 totaled 10.4 million shares for $874 million. Our outstanding share count is down 2% from a year ago, and our remaining share repurchase authorization at September 30th was $546.2 million dollars. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis, and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year. Based on our financial position and outlook for fiscal 2020, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 13% to $22.5 per share. Jessica.\nJessica Hansen : As we look forward to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we are expecting market conditions to remain similar with strong demand from home buyers, but continuing supply chain challenges that will delay home constructions, completions, and closings. We expect to generate consolidated revenues in our December quarter of $6.5 billion to $6.8 billion and our homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in a range between 17,500 and 18,500 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the first quarter to be 26.8% to 27% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter to be approximately 8%.  We anticipate a financial services pre -tax profit margin in the range of 30% to 35%, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24% in the first quarter. Looking further out, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues for the full fiscal year of 2022 of $32.5 to $33.5 billion and to close between 90,000 and 92,000 homes. We forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2022 of approximately 24% subject to changes in potential future legislation that could increase the federal corporate tax rate.  We also expect that our share repurchases will reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 2% at the end of fiscal 2022 compared to the end of fiscal 2021. We expect to generate positive cash flow from our home building operations in fiscal 2022 after our investments in homebuilding inventories, to support double-digit growth. We will then balance our cash flow utilization priorities among increasing the investment in our rental operation, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares. David?\nDavid Auld : In closing, our results reflect our experienced teams and production capabilities. Industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to capitalize on today's robust market and to effectively operate in changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the Company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis.  Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts during 2021 were remarkable. We closed the most homes in a year in our Company's history, achieving 10% market share with record profits and returns. And we are incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations in 2022. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we remind participants to please limit themselves to 1 question and 1 follow-up each. We also asked that while posing your question, please pick-up your handset if listening on speaker phone to provide optimum sound quality. Please hold while we poll for question. And the first question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks. Morning, everybody. Welcome, Paul. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your internal plans for '22 for orders, and perhaps talk a little bit about what you see your community count doing relative to your absorptions in which you lean on more for growth in the next fiscal year.\nDavid Auld : Well, as for our sales absorptions and community count, I think we're still believing that community count is flat up single-digit -- low single-digit. And as far as our sales numbers that is good. If we're projecting to deliver 90,000 to 92,000 homes then, we've got to have sales place that matches that. And again, Carl, the key to us is making sure that when we sell a home, we know when it's going to [Indiscernible] and deliver.  And as -- what I believe is as the market continues into 2022 that you're going to see stabilization on the material side first and then the labor side. We've been working on expanding our labor base for the last 10 years. And the consistent level of starts has allowed us the -- the drive and efficiency there that has allowed us to deliver more houses and we just plan on continuing to do that.\nJessica Hansen : And really rather than a focus on community count, it adds inflows quarter-to-quarter. If we start a house, we're going to ultimately sell and close it. So, we really focused on our homes and inventory, and our lot position.\nCarl Reichardt: Sure. Thanks, Jessica. Thanks, David.\nDavid Auld : Both of which are in very, very good shape right now.\nCarl Reichardt: Yeah, okay. I appreciate that. Thank you. And then David, I wanted to go back to something that D.R. Horton has talked about in the past, that we don't hear too much from others is this idea of getting your cash out of land investments within 24 months of when you put it in, and I'm curious really on two fronts. One, the significant shift to options is probably allowed that to improve. but on the other hand, the delays entitlement and approval processes and finding dirt has probably hurt that. So can you talk about that goal of getting your cash out of your land investments within 24 months and how you see that changing over time? And thanks a lot.\nDavid Auld : I would say it's more of a requirement not a goal or less. That's something that we put in place coming out of the downturn that we have not wavered off of, and that is probably the toughest underwriting hurdle that our divisions have to face. But it's a non-negotiable program, because we saw what going long, long owning long positions at land does to your balance sheet and your risk level and what our unforeseen events that might happen on the future.  So the 24-month cash back is still a part of every deal we underwrite and has been a primary factor I think in driving our option lot position because it's -- we have to find partners. We have to to controllable lots we want to control. So we've got to be good partners with these trends, and that's been a focus through this entire cycle. And I think a major factor in that is the -- just the unrelenting underwriting requirement that you got to get your cash off the table in 24 months.\nBill Wheat : And Carl to your point about extending delays and things like that, that applies when we do own our land and we're self-developing. it doesn't necessarily affect our cash return when we're working with a third-party and by buying lots because we're not buying the lots until we're ready to start homes and those approvals are in place. I would say more recently, one thing that is impacting our turns and our ability to actually return our cash in 24 months is the extension of our construction times with the supply chain delays.  We have seen further elongation of our construction times. I believe on a year-over-year basis, our closings this quarter were -- the construction times were longer by about 7 weeks, which is a bit longer than we would reported last quarter and so that is a factor that is causing a bit of friction in our inventory turns right now. But, hopefully, as we achieve some stabilization on the material side over the coming year, we will see that stabilize and, hopefully, we will be -- contract again.\nCarl Reichardt: Thank you, Bill. And thanks, everybody. I really appreciate the answers.\nDavid Auld : Thanks, Carl.\nJessica Hansen : Thanks, Carl.\nOperator: And your next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is live Please go ahead.\nStephen Kim : Okay, thanks very much. Thanks guys for all the info. I guess my first question relates to your Company's comments about affordability. I guess first, am I right to think that you're driving affordability primarily through construction into design efficiencies? Or should we think that this operates is going to imply a lower gross margin? All things held constant? And then, regulated to your margin, I imagine you got peak lumber coming through your December quarter. So if lumber stays where it is right now, would it be reasonable to think that the December quarter margins is maybe likely to be the low point for the fiscal '22 year?\nBill Wheat : Well, in terms of lumber cost, that they are still rising. They rose further in our fiscal Q4. We've seen them rise further into October, so we do believe that we are seeing the peak of lumber cost. However, other costs are increasing as well, we're seeing costs really increasing across-the-board so even when we see perhaps have some relief from lumber as we move further into fiscal 2022, I think that will be offset by other cost increases. As far as the net effect on gross margin, ultimately that will depend on the strength of the demand environment as we move into the spring season, and our ability to continue to offset costs with prices. Right now, our short-term view is that we should be able to offset cost with price and maintain our margins that are around the level that we just reported in the fourth quarter. But, truly as we move through fiscal 2022, it will depend on the strength of the demand environment.\nJessica Hansen : And our ability to continue to achieve affordability is really across a multitude of things. It's not any one thing we would point to. Clearly, our sides and our scale and the construction efficiencies that we've been very focused on, particularly in our Express Homes brand, limiting floor plans, limiting options, being able to control the trades at our job site all-day long, house to house to house, repetitively doing the same thing over and over and over again, has been a benefit in that regard. And then to a lesser extent, we have also continued to see our average square footage come down, and that's the way we can focus on affordability as well, is building more of our smaller floor plans.\nDavid Auld : Stephen, we're constantly trying to derive a more affordable total occupancy cost for our buyers, and that effort is never going to stop.\nStephen Kim : Right, and I think the gist of my question was that none of that implies unnecessarily a lower gross margin, all else held constant, right?\nDavid Auld : No, I don't -- we're not seeing that.\nStephen Kim : All right. That's why I wanted to clarify. Okay. And then secondly, regarding sales restrictions, obviously really encouraging, we do an analysis of your starts and your inventory. It's certainly we agree. We saw a really big, positive inflection in your production metrics that we can see externally and so I wanted to ask you about your comment about the sales restrictions, because a layperson or somebody listening from the outside could hear you say, hey, we are reducing our sales restrictions and things that themselves will be yes, that's because demand has weakened. And so therefore, there aren't as many people on waiting list and things like that.  And so I was wondering if you could clarify with maybe a little more detail, are you -- these sales restrictions which are starting to get alleviated or being relaxed, is that a sign of slowing demand or increasing supply? And assuming it's not a weakening of demand, I just wanted to go back to what you said in March. I think Jessica, that they get you a stress test that your backlog. I felt that gave a lot of comfort about affordability, I was wondering if you did that recently?\nMike Murray: That last question, yes, we did update the stress test and we look at that every quarter in our backlog and found no real change. In fact, to maybe a slight improvement from the March quarter to what we saw in September quarter backlog. In the sales restrictions, it's certainly a function of supply. We're seeing that we have been able to pull more homes to the production process to points, where we are able to give that buyer a more confident delivery date and give them a better experience in the process. I don't think that in anyway, it's sales that have been reflective of the demand environment.  We have consciously chosen not to push our sales contracts and take advantage of that demand until we can meet those customer expectations properly. So we've seen that our completed homes in inventory that are unsold are still below 1,000 homes. And that's scattered across the country, so it's not like we're seeing any pile up of available inventory. It's when we're releasing homes, we're able to sell those homes in the normal course of business.\nJessica Hansen : As a reminder for those may not have heard the stress test commentary last quarter and just to quantify that, the stress that we've done on our backlog is if interest rates were to rise 100 basis points, what that at-risk buyer would look like, and it's generally mid-to-high single-digit percentage of potential at-risk with a full 100 basis point move, And that's really just at risks. We would not expect a total fallout in that regard. We look to document additional income, look to put those buyers and additional different mortgage products and they currently anticipating. we feel pretty comfortable still with the ability of our buyers from an affordability perspective.\nStephen Kim : Thanks for all the info, appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Matthew, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Bouley : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results here in a pretty tough environment. So on the order outlook, Bill, you spoke to the Q1 uptick and I think suggesting basically 28% higher sequentially versus Q4, which is certainly well above historical norms, and not surprising as you released those sales restrictions and the inventory homes are there. Does this atypical uptick get you back to equilibrium for lack of a better term? Or should we understand that just given your inventory position ahead of the spring that we can perhaps see yet another, I guess I'd call it unusual uptick as you kind of released those sales and continue to lessen the sales restrictions. Thank you.\nBill Wheat : Yeah. Thanks, Matt. I think we're still in an unusual environment. The prior-year trends really don't apply to where we are today. Our sales order pace and the sequential pace of our shareholders is really driven by supply, by the homes that we have started, that we have in production that reached the stage that were ready to release them for sales, and so our sales volumes are really governed by or constrained by our homes in inventory where they stand. And so right now, with the visibility that we have to Q1, we believe we're in position where we will deliver sales that are equal to or maybe, slightly better than last year's level, which is an unusual sequential pattern versus where we were in Q4 when we were restricting sales. And then as we move into the year, I think the pattern will still be governed by our inventory levels.\nMike Murray: I think what you're gonna see in our forward expectation on sales, it's kind of aligning with our growth in starts that we've had over the past few quarters as Bill said, as those homes come through production and reach production stages that we're confident in a delivery date, then we're able to release those to the marketplace for sales.\nMatthew Bouley : That's great. Thank you both for that. Secondly, on ASP's, I think the revenue guide from doing the math right, implies maybe mid to high single-digit increases in ASP's in fiscal year '22 give or take. Obviously, you're order ASP's have been north of that for two consecutive quarters, if not well north of that here in Q4. Are there any assumptions around geographic or product mix that we should be aware of that might temper closing ASP s into next year?\nBill Wheat : we're looking at the year as a whole and what our ASP will be for the year will ultimately be dependent on the spring selling season. And so the assumption that these prices for the year will be up mid-to-high single-digit, I think that's fair. We're not going to assume that prices will continue to increase as fast as they have. And so our base assumption will be there will be some moderation in sales prices. We're going to continue to be focused on affordability from an intentional perspective for our business. And so for our initial guide going into the year prior to seeing what the spring will look like, prior to seeing what the supply chain challenges will continue to be. And what that will do to us over the course of the year, we've set our ASP target as you've seen.\nMatthew Bouley : Great. Well, thank you all and good luck.\nBill Wheat : Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mike Rehaut of JP Morgan. Mike, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nMike Rehaut: Thanks, good morning, everyone. First question, I was hoping to get a little bit of sense of how you're thinking about gross margins? At least perhaps directionally through fiscal '22 and even longer term. Understanding, obviously, a lot is in flux. But as you look through the rest of the year, obviously a lot of people are focusing on the reduction of lumber cost, as a tailwind. At the same time, you have some other headwinds in terms of additional cost inflation and I guess, assuming incentives and discounts are steady, just trying to get a sense of how you think at this point between lumber and other areas of cost inflation in the current pricing that you have in place, how things might progress throughout the rest of '22.\nJessica Hansen : We really don't have much visibility to our gross margin past a quarter or two, so you heard our specific gross margin guide for fiscal Q1, which was essentially relatively in line with Q4. As Bill mentioned, continued lumber headwinds in that December quarter. Some of that does back off as we move throughout next year. But ultimately, the gross margin that we achieved for fiscal 2022 as a whole is going to be dependent on the strength of the spring selling season, which we're pretty far out on. But I think we do feel with the strength in today's market, we should be in a very good position to continue to hopefully at least maintain gross margins from here. But we'll update as necessary as we move throughout the year and see how the spring unfolds and some of these supply chain pressures that are continuing to drive some cost increases.\nMike Rehaut: Right. Appreciate that. I guess also just longer term. You're in a new state of play here in terms of plus or minus around 27%. Just 3 years ago you were at closer to 20% and versus the last cycle. I think your peak was around 25.5% in 2005. Over the next 2, 3, or 4 years, as your underwriting deals today, and just curious, obviously, you underwrite them for returns, but there was a gross margin component in that. How should we think about a quote unquote normal or even a new normal? Again, assuming that we don't have this over the next 12 to 18 months, like a complete mean reversion to a let's say, a fuller incentive pipe backdrop or whatnot.\nMike Murray: Appreciate that, and it's a great point. One, we do focus first and foremost on returns and not just the margin. You're right, it is a component of the return equation. And three years ago, as you mentioned we were around 20% and if we had said at the time, we think three years from now, we will be at 27%. I don't think we'd have gotten a lot of credibility for that prediction. So it's really hard, as Jeff mentioned before, to really give us any great degree of confidence in predicting accurately what margins will be several periods out. I do think in our forward underwriting, is that we are encouraged by what we see and what we'll be able to achieve in margins going forward. And ultimately it's the return and the cash back that's driving our investment decisions today.\nJessica Hansen : Two of the things that we can't point to -- a lot of questions have been about other structural changes in the business that can lead to maintaining a higher gross margin over the long term than what we've historically seen. They're not enough to keep us at 27%, but two things we would point to, that we believe we can maintain are the scale advantages. There would expect to maintain some level of improvement in our margin from that. But then also less interest in our cost of sales. With what we've done with our balance sheet in terms of reducing our leverage, we will be flowing through less cost of sales consistently going forward.\nDavid Auld : Coincidentally [Indiscernible] consolidated, it's a maturing industry. My anticipation is, you're going to see more stability than typically has been associated around prior cycles. I think that there is a consistency discipline in the industry today, that has never existed.\nMike Rehaut: One last quick one, if I could sneak it in, how should we think about community count and sales pace in 2022 versus 2021 in terms of I think both for -- in terms of just growth from both aspects.\nJessica Hansen : It's going to continue to be mainly driven by absorption rather than community count. We would expect for the full year to have a modest increase in our community count. But I think as I referenced in at apparel at the outset of the call. If we have the houses and lots, we're going to ultimately selling close the house. And so that 's generally the better indicator of where our business is going and just what our absolute community count is doing.\nMike Rehaut: Great. Thank you.\nJessica Hansen : Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Deepak Raghav. Deepak, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nDeepak Raghav: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter and thanks for taking my questions. My first 1 is on your start space in October, 8-K Ohio Homes that possess a pretty solid rate. Perhaps there's some timing benefit here. But can you walk us through some of the puts and takes to a normalized touched-pace near-term, or is this a good run rate for 2023 deliveries with perhaps upside when supply chain improves?\nDavid Auld : I think the a run rate that we're targeting is pretty well established for the first 4 to 6 months of this year. So that's a consistent run rate we're targeting. I think that we're basing our guidance and everything and what we're projecting for the year on the way the supply chain exists today. And we have to carry more houses and inventory to support that double-digit growth than we typically have had to do on the past. So we're positioning for -- we'll see what the spring brains and we'll see what the material and labor supply issues either resolve, mitigate, or get worse.\nJessica Hansen : It's a lot easier to slow down our start than it is to speed it up. So we consistently adjust our start based on what our forward outlook is.\nDavid Auld : What we control is our liquidity, and our process, and our targets. And we're very focused on the liquidity, because it's a risk mitigator that allows us to be more flexible, in what we target and how we operate.\nBill Wheat : We've already talked on this call about we are in an unusual time in terms of how our sales pace looks. We're also an unusual time in terms of historical measures of our homes and inventory relative to what we can close, with extended construction times and all the disruptions. As David said, we have to hold more homes in inventory to deliver the same number of closings today versus a few years ago.\nJessica Hansen : The offset to that is we own a lot of land, in terms of years supply, so we are still driving very impressive returns.\nDavid Auld : Well, again, we're very focused on liquidity and maintaining the flexibility, that is a key competitive advantage, I think for whatever happens in the market.\nDeepak Raghav: All fair comments. Thanks for that. My follow-up is pretty high level question to the extent you're just willing to discuss. How do you think the supply chain is going to play out? Do appreciate that the visibility is not great beyond a quarter or more at best, but just given the current state, what are your thoughts on the realistic best-case, worst-case scenario playing out in fiscal 2022? Or even if you don't want to go all out to 2022, what are some of the scenarios as we enter spring selling season? Thank you.\nDavid Auld : From a supply chain standpoint, I think you've got some of the best companies that have ever existed in the history of the world focused on that, and I think they're going to get it figured out. And the people that we do business with are the best of the best in that industry, so I'm very confident. Was it Q1, Q2, Q3? I don't know that, but I am very confident that the people that are working on it are going to get a result, and when that happens I think we will return to an inventory conversion rate that's consistent with what we've done in the past, maybe even a little better.\nDeepak Raghav: All right, that's great. I'll pass it on, thanks very much and good luck.\nDavid Auld : Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup. Anthony, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nAsher Sohnen: Hi, this is Asher Sohnen on for Anthony and I just want to ask, you mentioned that you need more homes in inventory now to deliver the same number of homes. Are you able to articulate a target or maybe your normalized spec count for this kind of new normal? And then when supply chain do clear up, do you expect to reduce that spec count eventually, or because it's become like the new normal going forward?\nBill Wheat : Absolutely. When we get back to a more normalized time, we would expect our inventory turns to return back to historical norms, or as David said, or better. Historically, if you looked at the beginning of the year for us, you could take our homes in inventory and you can pretty well double that and that's what we would close the next year. Sometimes we've done a little better than that, sometimes a little worse. Given the current environment if it remains as tough as it is right now, we probably -- we will not be able to do that.  Our guidance obviously would it would imply that, but absolutely. When we get back to a more normal time, we would expect to reduce our spec count and turn our inventory and focus on generating the best returns that we possibly can. This is simply a reflection of the current environment we are in, the elongated construction times we're seeing\nAsher Sohnen: Great. And then as a follow-up, just understanding that the sales declines in the quarter is kind of a function of supply. But I'm just curious. And -- have you any -- have you seen any markets where maybe prices are starting to get a bit frothy or that you're concerned around affordability, maybe seeing some buyers start to walk away around the margins?\nMike Murray: I think it's pretty clear that the market is not as white hot right now as it was in the spring. But we're still seeing very strong demand, and the homes that we're releasing for sale are still being absorbed quite well with very historical low levels of incentives in place. So we're seeing very few homes complete construction that are not being sold prior to that completion process.\nDavid Auld : And I'd also say that even though our ASP has gone up and it's not a sustainable rise quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter, but it is something that I think indicates the level of demand out there when you restrict the number of houses you sell. It's a good time to be selling houses today.\nAsher Sohnen: Demand still exceed supply?\nDavid Auld : Yes.\nJessica Hansen : And I think, in terms of Mike 's comment is not quite as high as spring. We are seeing, I think, somewhat of a return to normal seasonality as well. We wouldn't expect the market to be as strong today as it is during the spring selling season. So we still feel very good as we move throughout fiscal '22, that the market is going to remain robust.\nMike Murray: Those 900 homes we have that are completed and unsold, less than 100 have been completed for an extended period of time, out of almost 50,000 homes.\nAsher Sohnen: Thanks, that's very helpful. I'll turn it up -- I'll turn it over.\nOperator: Thank you, your next question is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Jade, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much. On the land side, you said that sequentially lot costs were up 2% quarter-over-quarter. How much do you think they're up year-over-year?\nJessica Hansen : Give me one second, Jade. I have it. I just -- they are up about a mid-single-digit percentage, which has been pretty consistent as of last year too on a year-over-year basis.\nJade Rahmani: Okay. That's somewhat surprising because I think, historically, land usually appreciates in line with appreciation, or perhaps at a faster clip. Do you expect lot costs to begin accelerating? Is the moderate pace of growth reflective of the timing at which you acquired these lots?\nMike Murray: That's got a lot to do with it, Jade. It's -- the homes we're delivering this quarter are delivered on a large variety of vintages, of lot acquisitions, of when we contracted for the land, and contracted for the lots, and so you're seeing a big blend come through. So generally we are seeing cost inflation, and our lot costs and what we're currently buying and -- but it takes -- it's a muted impact in the near term and it takes several years for those costs to be fully reflected through into our closings.\nBill Wheat : And this is one of the strengths of our long lock for lot pipeline and our controlled lot position because we've got land and lots controlled generally at fixed prices or at known prices and so we reap the benefits of that by having a strong controlled lot position.\nJade Rahmani: Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Truman, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nTruman Patterson : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions, and Paul, congratulations on the promotion. Just wanted to follow up on a prior question, but your '22 closings expectations up about 11% year-over-year at the midpoint. You all mentioned material shortages and multiple products currently, but David, you've made a couple of comments that you expect improvement in 2022. I'm just trying to understand what are your suppliers telegraphing you with respect to 2022 capacity. Are they adding employees, lines, etc.? Just what sort of level of growth do they think they can support?\nDavid Auld : We've got commitments from all of our major material guys. They're going to support us. They know our numbers. They know what we're trying to accomplish. They see our start base for the last 6 months and the next 6 months. So -- and they are really good companies. I'm not going to pill out a bunch of names because I'll forget about half of them. CEO of Oracle came in and with Don Horton, myself and the entire executive team, it's a level of partnership and commitment to each other. I think that just hadn't existed in the past. And I think as a result of the consolidation of the industry, and the significant 10% market share of new home housing is a real number.\nJessica Hansen : And in our conversations they are hiring, they are opening new lines, unemployment benefit going away as expected to have some impact. I think some of the extended impacts from the Texas freeze is also expected to be worked through as we move into calendar 2022. And as David said, these things are taking a while to work through, but they are doing what they need to do to help support our business. And as always, we expect them to support D.R. Horton's business first and for a lot of those pressures to be solved what smaller builders versus us.\nDavid Auld : Having scale -- significant scale in these markets, is a huge benefit for us and I think really gives us more access and better service than some of those smaller, less -- people with less scale.\nMike Murray: Having a forward locked pipeline of over 0.5 million lots makes it pretty powerful as a conversation piece in talking with the large suppliers.\nTruman Patterson : Okay, fair enough. And in your capital allocation priorities, I don't believe that I heard anything about MNA. Could you just discuss any inter -- or the level in your pipeline that you're seeing our valuation stretched at this point. Then just a second question, I'm sure it's well deserved, but could you all just run through the decision behind creating the Co-COO chair?\nMike Murray: Sure. I'll take the first question and let David handle the second question. The M&A landscape is pretty similar to where it's been the past few quarters. It's anecdotal. We're not looking for any major transformational M&A opportunities. It would be hard for us to accomplish one of those at the scale we're at today. But we are looking at tucking in acquisitions to add great platforms and people to the team across the country, where we maybe looking for growth. And it's an ongoing conversation with people in that process, but don't look for any major use of capital on that front today.\nDavid Auld : And on the Co-COO program, in looking at our platform it would basically have doubled in the last five years, and during COVID trying to get places being not only from an executive officer standpoint, but from a regional president standpoint. We were asking gas to get employees and really became less and less comfortable with that, I think on the last call I might have statement about infrastructure, and then immediately had a quick talking about it because the infrastructure I was talking about was our platform, which was a dual COO roles, and then doubling our reach account. So that we're continuing to scale up our platform, to make -- to coincide with the scale-up in market share that we're gaining. We've got great people that are performed at exceptional levels. But as you move up that next step, the world changes and the skill set changes.  So you've got to get young guys in a position to -- in my mind, anyway, and what we've talked about up here, you've got to get the younger guy into a position, a regional role where he is working through divisions instead of on top of divisions. And it's a training process. And so while we've got a great market, while we're scaling up in absorptions, we need to scale up in people. And Paul gives us the ability to touch the regional guys more consistently, and to be in new markets more consistently. As he travels, Mike travels, I travel. And by increasing the number of regions, we were then able to elevate people within divisions to leadership roles, and it's just kind of a consistent stairstep where we get more people access to that role and give them a chance to learn that job before something happens and you're forced to make a change.  So it's a core of continuing to scale for our next 5 years in a row, and it's -- we've got great people and we've got an incredibly strong management team, and that's something that to be honest with you, I think about hold the time. It's the quality of our people, at that division level and region level compared to when I started with the Company or compared to when we went public, or even compared to the last cycle. What I call super-cycle [Indiscernible] So it's a -- the Company is in incredibly good position with incredibly good people. And Paul is going to help us get -- make it even better. So --\nTruman Patterson : Perfect. Thank you all.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Eric, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nEric Bosshard : Thank you. Two things. First of all, in terms of the spring selling season, I know that you don't have visibility to it. And so there's, by definition, some degree of uncertainty. But as you look at your position and what you're seeing in the market now, could you identify these are the areas of notable uncertainty that you just won't know until you get to the spring?\nMike Murray: That's the unknown-unknown. Always a great question. It's one of the things we're always trying to ponder and peer around the quarter, and figure out what's going to happen. But one of the big unknown is going into the year is not from a demand side, but from a production capacity side. As David said before, it's going to get better, stay the same or get worse. I mean, it may different parts of it maybe law free over the next six to nine months and being prepared to handle those challenges is what we deal with every day.  As we say, when people want to and can buy homes, we can solve the rest of the problems, that's our job. Still see good demand trends out there, still see very good traffic, this fall in the models. Quality of traffic, interest of traffic, and our [Indiscernible] participation has been really strong, starting to fall. So that for us, that would be a good sign for continuing what happens.\nDavid Auld : What we can control, Eric, is inventory and how we position it to be in front of the spring market, and that we feel very good about. So we can -- that is where we can have targets, we can have a plan. We can execute that plan and then we'll respond to the market as it comes.\nEric Bosshard : Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, a lot of talk about affordability earlier in the call and I know there's a lot of components of affordability, but ultimately, for your customer, it's them paying the price for the house. And the order ASP, I think coming out of [Indiscernible] is now 380,000, which is certainly different than it was two or three years ago for the Company. I'm just curious how you think about that. If especially, how you think about it relative to the different products that you have and relative to markets. How do you think consumers respond to that, customers respond to that and the path forward?\nMike Murray: It's something we talked about and try to stay focused on providing more affordable homes and being the relative affordable choice in a given marketplace. We look at our mortgage companies statistics and we can see that almost 60% of our buyers this quarter were first-time homebuyers, and almost 60% of our buyers had a combined household income -- reported income for the mortgage purposes, at least of $90,000 or less. And so we still think that's -- that provides a good target market for us to continue to look to serve. And while we have seen pricing come up and average loan size come up the debt-to-income ratios that we're seeing across the loans we're underwriting has not really budged. It's been pretty consistent.\nJessica Hansen : And as the industry as a whole has continued to increase sales prices, Generally speaking, we still do have the lowest average sales price generally than almost all the large public builders.\nEric Bosshard : Okay, that's helpful context, thank you.\nDavid Auld : Thank you.\nOperator: And the final question we have time for today is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman and Associates. Alan, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nAlan Ratner : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I'd love to drill in a little bit on the rental operations, obviously breaking it out this quarter, and certainly, I think over $700 million of revenue -- clearly got some aggressive growth plans there. So focusing first on the single-family rental side, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the rollout there and maybe what you've been surprised on or maybe what's reaffirmed your views up to this point as you start leasing up communities and selling them? Are you seeing any interesting trends on who these renters are? Are they longer-term renters that are choosing to rent? Are they people waiting for a new home to be built? Any kind of either anecdotal or data you can provide there? And longer term, how big of a piece of the business do you want to target this at?\nDavid Auld : I would say that the renters are not terribly different than first-time home buyers. People moving into areas, they're looking for housing, they're looking for a better lifestyle. Things that probably have surprised us, level of demand and the lack of, not only from a rental standpoint, but from what I consider institutional type investor base that has bought the three that we saw. It may not be a white-hot for sale business this year compared to last year. But it is a white-hot build a ramp business, especially the way we're positioning these projects as kind of on the affordable land, self-contained, not intermixed with for sale housing.\nAlan Ratner : Got it, so on that note, David, with strong as demand has been, I guess, first off, is the 35% margin that you guys generated at that business, is that a realistic intermediate-term margin on that $700+ million of revenue? And is the plan still to do the merchant-build approach? You mentioned the institutional capital, a lot of your peers have either partnered up with some of those investors and established joint ventures or some ongoing investment there. It seems like you're kind of choosing more of the merchant-build approach. So profitability and longer-term, any reason why maybe the strategy changes there.\nBill Wheat : We've got a small sample size thus far on those that we've plugged have been very pleased with the profit levels we've seen. I expect we will still see some projects that will generate those level of profits, but as we grow the platform and as we build the infrastructure in place to support a larger volume across the country. We wouldn't necessarily expect to continue to generate the same margin that we've shown on these first few, but do expect pretax profit margins to be higher on the rental business than on our for-sale business and to generate an accretive return, it needs to be a little bit higher, because of the assets are held a little bit longer. We do still expect to see very attractive profit levels on the rental business, but the current sample size is still little bit small.\nAlan Ratner : And as we've said before, as we learn the business then we'd make our capitalization decisions about how to go about capitalizing the business. So we're still evaluating that, looking at options there.\nDavid Auld : I will say that everything we worked on, everything we think about, we want to do things that are sustainable and scalable, and I can tell you that the rental side of this market certainly seem sustainable and with our platform is scalable. So we're pretty excited about it.\nAlan Ratner : Great, thanks for all the color there guys.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I will now like to turn the floor back to David Auld for closing comments.\nDavid Auld : Thank you, Tom. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in January on our first-quarter results. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton team. You were the first home builder to close more than 50,000 homes, you are now the first to close greater than 80,000 homes in a year, and you're well on your way to becoming the first home-builder to close more than 100,000 homes in a year. Stay humble, stay hungry, and stay focused. You'll compete and continue to win every day. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this, thus, conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Mike Murray",
            "content": "Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 65% to $3.70 per share, and for the year, diluted earnings per share increased 78% to $11.41. Net income for the quarter increased 62% to $1.3 billion and for the year, net income increased 76% to $4.2 billion. Our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 24% to $7.6 billion on 21,937 homes closed, up from $6.1 billion on 20,248 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $346,100, up 14% from last year. And the average size of our homes closed was down 1%, Bill? At September 30th, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 530,000 lots of which 24% were owned and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. 24% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 47% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our growing in capital efficient lot portfolio is key to our strong competitive position and will support our efforts to increase our production volume to meet home-buyer demand. Our fourth quarter home-building investments in lot, land, and development totaled $1.8 billion, of which $1 billion was for finished lots, $330 million was for land, and $440 million was for land development. Bill. Our multi-family and single-family rental operations generated combined pretax income of $74.3 million in the fourth quarter and $86.5 million in fiscal 2021. Our total rental property inventory at September 30th was $841 million compared to $316 million a year ago. We sold 3 multi-family properties totaling 960 units during fiscal 2021 for $191.9 million, all of which were sold in the fourth quarter, compared to 2 properties totaling 540 units sold in fiscal 2020. We sold 3 single-family rental communities totaling 260 homes during fiscal 2021 for $75.9 million dollars, including one sale of 64 homes during the fourth quarter for $21 million dollars in revenue.  In fiscal 2022, we expect our rental operations to generate more than $700 million in revenues from rental property sales. We also expect to grow the total inventory investment in our rental platforms by more than $1 billion in fiscal 2022 based on our current rental projects in development and our significant pipeline of future single and multi-family rental projects. We are positioning our rental operations to be a significant contributor to our revenues, profits, and returns in future years. Bill. That last question, yes, we did update the stress test and we look at that every quarter in our backlog and found no real change. In fact, to maybe a slight improvement from the March quarter to what we saw in September quarter backlog. In the sales restrictions, it's certainly a function of supply. We're seeing that we have been able to pull more homes to the production process to points, where we are able to give that buyer a more confident delivery date and give them a better experience in the process. I don't think that in anyway, it's sales that have been reflective of the demand environment.  We have consciously chosen not to push our sales contracts and take advantage of that demand until we can meet those customer expectations properly. So we've seen that our completed homes in inventory that are unsold are still below 1,000 homes. And that's scattered across the country, so it's not like we're seeing any pile up of available inventory. It's when we're releasing homes, we're able to sell those homes in the normal course of business. I think what you're gonna see in our forward expectation on sales, it's kind of aligning with our growth in starts that we've had over the past few quarters as Bill said, as those homes come through production and reach production stages that we're confident in a delivery date, then we're able to release those to the marketplace for sales. Appreciate that, and it's a great point. One, we do focus first and foremost on returns and not just the margin. You're right, it is a component of the return equation. And three years ago, as you mentioned we were around 20% and if we had said at the time, we think three years from now, we will be at 27%. I don't think we'd have gotten a lot of credibility for that prediction. So it's really hard, as Jeff mentioned before, to really give us any great degree of confidence in predicting accurately what margins will be several periods out. I do think in our forward underwriting, is that we are encouraged by what we see and what we'll be able to achieve in margins going forward. And ultimately it's the return and the cash back that's driving our investment decisions today. I think it's pretty clear that the market is not as white hot right now as it was in the spring. But we're still seeing very strong demand, and the homes that we're releasing for sale are still being absorbed quite well with very historical low levels of incentives in place. So we're seeing very few homes complete construction that are not being sold prior to that completion process. Those 900 homes we have that are completed and unsold, less than 100 have been completed for an extended period of time, out of almost 50,000 homes. That's got a lot to do with it, Jade. It's -- the homes we're delivering this quarter are delivered on a large variety of vintages, of lot acquisitions, of when we contracted for the land, and contracted for the lots, and so you're seeing a big blend come through. So generally we are seeing cost inflation, and our lot costs and what we're currently buying and -- but it takes -- it's a muted impact in the near term and it takes several years for those costs to be fully reflected through into our closings. Having a forward locked pipeline of over 0.5 million lots makes it pretty powerful as a conversation piece in talking with the large suppliers. Sure. I'll take the first question and let David handle the second question. The M&A landscape is pretty similar to where it's been the past few quarters. It's anecdotal. We're not looking for any major transformational M&A opportunities. It would be hard for us to accomplish one of those at the scale we're at today. But we are looking at tucking in acquisitions to add great platforms and people to the team across the country, where we maybe looking for growth. And it's an ongoing conversation with people in that process, but don't look for any major use of capital on that front today. That's the unknown-unknown. Always a great question. It's one of the things we're always trying to ponder and peer around the quarter, and figure out what's going to happen. But one of the big unknown is going into the year is not from a demand side, but from a production capacity side. As David said before, it's going to get better, stay the same or get worse. I mean, it may different parts of it maybe law free over the next six to nine months and being prepared to handle those challenges is what we deal with every day.  As we say, when people want to and can buy homes, we can solve the rest of the problems, that's our job. Still see good demand trends out there, still see very good traffic, this fall in the models. Quality of traffic, interest of traffic, and our [Indiscernible] participation has been really strong, starting to fall. So that for us, that would be a good sign for continuing what happens. It's something we talked about and try to stay focused on providing more affordable homes and being the relative affordable choice in a given marketplace. We look at our mortgage companies statistics and we can see that almost 60% of our buyers this quarter were first-time homebuyers, and almost 60% of our buyers had a combined household income -- reported income for the mortgage purposes, at least of $90,000 or less. And so we still think that's -- that provides a good target market for us to continue to look to serve. And while we have seen pricing come up and average loan size come up the debt-to-income ratios that we're seeing across the loans we're underwriting has not really budged. It's been pretty consistent."

            "name": "David Auld",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officer, and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today, we also have Paul Romanowski with us, who was recently promoted to Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officer. Paul has been with D.R. Horton since 1999 serving as our Florida South Division President for 15 years, and most recently, as our Florida Region President for 7 years. I'd like to take a brief moment to have Paul introduce himself before we get started, Paul. Thank you, Paul. Given that Paul is new to his role, he will not be an active participant today, but we are glad to have him with us and believe his extensive home building experience will strengthen our executive team. The D.R. Horton team finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, which included a 63% increase in consolidated pre -tax income to $1.7 billion and a 27% increase in revenue to $8.1 billion. Our pre -tax profit margin for the quarter improved 480 basis points to 21.3%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 65% to $3.70. For the year, consolidated pre -tax income increased 80% to $5.4 billion on a $27.8 billion of revenue.  Our pre -tax profit margin for the year improved 460 basis points to 19.3%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 78% to $11.41. We closed a record 81,965 homes this year, an increase of over 16,500 homes or 25% from last year, while also achieving a historical low home building SG&A percentage of 7.3%. Our home building return on inventory was 37.9%, and our return on equity was 31.6%, these results reflect our experienced teams in their production capabilities. Our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint, and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Our home-building cash flow from operations for 2021 was $1.2 billion.  Over the past 5 years, we have generated $5.9 billion of cash flow from homebuilding operations. While growing our consolidated revenues by 128% and our earnings per share by 383%. During this time, we also more than doubled our book value per share, reduced our homebuilding leverage 220%, and increased our homebuilding liquidity by $2.8 billion, all while significantly increasing our returns on inventory and equity. Market conditions remain very robust and we are focused on maximizing returns and increasing our market share further. However, there are still significant challenges in the supply chain, including shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market.  As a result, we continued restricting our home sales base during the fourth quarter by selling homes later in the construction cycle to align with our production levels and better ensure certainty of home closing date for our homebuyers. We expect to approve the supply chain challenges and ultimately increase our production capacity. After starting construction on 22,400 homes this quarter, our homes in inventory increased 26% from a year ago to 47,800 homes at September 30th, 2021. In October, we started more than 8,000 homes, further positioning us to achieve double-digit growth again in 2022. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage position holds very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace, and inventory levels to optimize our returns. Mike. We have increased our housing inventory and response to the strength of demand, and are focused on expanding our production capabilities further. We started 22,400 homes during the fourth quarter and 91,500 homes during fiscal 2021, which is an increase of 21% compared to fiscal 2020. We ended the year with 47,800 homes in inventory, up 26% from a year ago. 21,700 of our total homes at September 30th were unsold, of which 900 were completed. Although we have not seen significant improvement in the supply chain yet we expect the current constraints to ultimately moderate at some point in 2022. Mike? In closing, our results reflect our experienced teams and production capabilities. Industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to capitalize on today's robust market and to effectively operate in changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the Company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis.  Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts during 2021 were remarkable. We closed the most homes in a year in our Company's history, achieving 10% market share with record profits and returns. And we are incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations in 2022. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Well, as for our sales absorptions and community count, I think we're still believing that community count is flat up single-digit -- low single-digit. And as far as our sales numbers that is good. If we're projecting to deliver 90,000 to 92,000 homes then, we've got to have sales place that matches that. And again, Carl, the key to us is making sure that when we sell a home, we know when it's going to [Indiscernible] and deliver.  And as -- what I believe is as the market continues into 2022 that you're going to see stabilization on the material side first and then the labor side. We've been working on expanding our labor base for the last 10 years. And the consistent level of starts has allowed us the -- the drive and efficiency there that has allowed us to deliver more houses and we just plan on continuing to do that. Both of which are in very, very good shape right now. I would say it's more of a requirement not a goal or less. That's something that we put in place coming out of the downturn that we have not wavered off of, and that is probably the toughest underwriting hurdle that our divisions have to face. But it's a non-negotiable program, because we saw what going long, long owning long positions at land does to your balance sheet and your risk level and what our unforeseen events that might happen on the future.  So the 24-month cash back is still a part of every deal we underwrite and has been a primary factor I think in driving our option lot position because it's -- we have to find partners. We have to to controllable lots we want to control. So we've got to be good partners with these trends, and that's been a focus through this entire cycle. And I think a major factor in that is the -- just the unrelenting underwriting requirement that you got to get your cash off the table in 24 months. Thanks, Carl. Stephen, we're constantly trying to derive a more affordable total occupancy cost for our buyers, and that effort is never going to stop. No, I don't -- we're not seeing that. Coincidentally [Indiscernible] consolidated, it's a maturing industry. My anticipation is, you're going to see more stability than typically has been associated around prior cycles. I think that there is a consistency discipline in the industry today, that has never existed. I think the a run rate that we're targeting is pretty well established for the first 4 to 6 months of this year. So that's a consistent run rate we're targeting. I think that we're basing our guidance and everything and what we're projecting for the year on the way the supply chain exists today. And we have to carry more houses and inventory to support that double-digit growth than we typically have had to do on the past. So we're positioning for -- we'll see what the spring brains and we'll see what the material and labor supply issues either resolve, mitigate, or get worse. What we control is our liquidity, and our process, and our targets. And we're very focused on the liquidity, because it's a risk mitigator that allows us to be more flexible, in what we target and how we operate. Well, again, we're very focused on liquidity and maintaining the flexibility, that is a key competitive advantage, I think for whatever happens in the market. From a supply chain standpoint, I think you've got some of the best companies that have ever existed in the history of the world focused on that, and I think they're going to get it figured out. And the people that we do business with are the best of the best in that industry, so I'm very confident. Was it Q1, Q2, Q3? I don't know that, but I am very confident that the people that are working on it are going to get a result, and when that happens I think we will return to an inventory conversion rate that's consistent with what we've done in the past, maybe even a little better. Thank you very much. And I'd also say that even though our ASP has gone up and it's not a sustainable rise quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter, but it is something that I think indicates the level of demand out there when you restrict the number of houses you sell. It's a good time to be selling houses today. Yes. We've got commitments from all of our major material guys. They're going to support us. They know our numbers. They know what we're trying to accomplish. They see our start base for the last 6 months and the next 6 months. So -- and they are really good companies. I'm not going to pill out a bunch of names because I'll forget about half of them. CEO of Oracle came in and with Don Horton, myself and the entire executive team, it's a level of partnership and commitment to each other. I think that just hadn't existed in the past. And I think as a result of the consolidation of the industry, and the significant 10% market share of new home housing is a real number. Having scale -- significant scale in these markets, is a huge benefit for us and I think really gives us more access and better service than some of those smaller, less -- people with less scale. And on the Co-COO program, in looking at our platform it would basically have doubled in the last five years, and during COVID trying to get places being not only from an executive officer standpoint, but from a regional president standpoint. We were asking gas to get employees and really became less and less comfortable with that, I think on the last call I might have statement about infrastructure, and then immediately had a quick talking about it because the infrastructure I was talking about was our platform, which was a dual COO roles, and then doubling our reach account. So that we're continuing to scale up our platform, to make -- to coincide with the scale-up in market share that we're gaining. We've got great people that are performed at exceptional levels. But as you move up that next step, the world changes and the skill set changes.  So you've got to get young guys in a position to -- in my mind, anyway, and what we've talked about up here, you've got to get the younger guy into a position, a regional role where he is working through divisions instead of on top of divisions. And it's a training process. And so while we've got a great market, while we're scaling up in absorptions, we need to scale up in people. And Paul gives us the ability to touch the regional guys more consistently, and to be in new markets more consistently. As he travels, Mike travels, I travel. And by increasing the number of regions, we were then able to elevate people within divisions to leadership roles, and it's just kind of a consistent stairstep where we get more people access to that role and give them a chance to learn that job before something happens and you're forced to make a change.  So it's a core of continuing to scale for our next 5 years in a row, and it's -- we've got great people and we've got an incredibly strong management team, and that's something that to be honest with you, I think about hold the time. It's the quality of our people, at that division level and region level compared to when I started with the Company or compared to when we went public, or even compared to the last cycle. What I call super-cycle [Indiscernible] So it's a -- the Company is in incredibly good position with incredibly good people. And Paul is going to help us get -- make it even better. So -- What we can control, Eric, is inventory and how we position it to be in front of the spring market, and that we feel very good about. So we can -- that is where we can have targets, we can have a plan. We can execute that plan and then we'll respond to the market as it comes. Thank you. I would say that the renters are not terribly different than first-time home buyers. People moving into areas, they're looking for housing, they're looking for a better lifestyle. Things that probably have surprised us, level of demand and the lack of, not only from a rental standpoint, but from what I consider institutional type investor base that has bought the three that we saw. It may not be a white-hot for sale business this year compared to last year. But it is a white-hot build a ramp business, especially the way we're positioning these projects as kind of on the affordable land, self-contained, not intermixed with for sale housing. I will say that everything we worked on, everything we think about, we want to do things that are sustainable and scalable, and I can tell you that the rental side of this market certainly seem sustainable and with our platform is scalable. So we're pretty excited about it. Thank you, Tom. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in January on our first-quarter results. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton team. You were the first home builder to close more than 50,000 homes, you are now the first to close greater than 80,000 homes in a year, and you're well on your way to becoming the first home-builder to close more than 100,000 homes in a year. Stay humble, stay hungry, and stay focused. You'll compete and continue to win every day. Thank you."

            "content": "Net sales orders in the fourth quarter decreased 33% to 15,949 homes, and the value of those orders was $6 billion down 17% from $7.3 billion in the prior year. A year ago, our fourth quarter net sales orders were up 81% due to the surgeon housing demand during the first year of the pandemic when we had significantly more completed homes available to sell and prior to the supply chain challenges that arose in 2021. Our average number of active selling communities decreased 5% from the prior year and was down 3% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the fourth quarter was $378,300, up 23% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the fourth quarter was 19%, flat with the prior-year quarter.  As David described, new home demand remains very strong and our local teams are continuing to restrict our sales order pace where necessary on a community-by-community basis based on the number of homes in inventory, construction times, production capacity, and lock position. They also continue to adjust sales prices to market while staying focused on providing value to our buyers. We are still restricting the pace of our sales orders during our first fiscal quarter, but to a lesser extent than during our fourth quarter. As a result, we expect our first quarter net sales orders to be approximately equal to or slightly higher than our 20,418 sales orders in the first quarter last year. Our October net sales order volume was in line with our plans and we remain confident that we are well-positioned to deliver double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2022, with 26,200 homes in backlog, 47,000 homes in inventory, a robust lot supply, and strong trade and supplier relationships. Jessica? In the fourth quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenues was 6.9% down 70 basis points from 7.6% in the prior year quarter. For the year, homebuilding SG&A expense was 7.3% down 80 basis points from 8.1% in 2020. Our homebuilding SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenues, is at its lowest point for a quarter and for a year in our history. And we are focused on continuing to control our SG&A while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our business. David? Forestar, our majority-owned subsidiary is a publicly traded well-capitalized residential lot manufacturer, operating in 56 markets across 23 states. Forestar continues to execute extremely well on its high-growth plan, as they increase their lots sold by 53% to 15,915 lots during fiscal 2021, compared to the prior year. Forestar 's pre -tax profit margin for the year improved 400 basis points to 12.4%, excluding an $18.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt.  At September 30th, Forestar's owned and controlled lot position increased 60% from a year ago to 97,000 lots. 61% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer, under our master supply agreement. $370 million of D.R. Horton's land and lot purchases in the fourth quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton, and had approximately $500 million of liquidity at year-end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 35.2% with its current capitalization, strong lot supply, and relationship with D.R. Horton, Forestar plans to continue profitably growing their business. Jessica. Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic. During fiscal 2021, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $1.2 billion dollars, and our cumulative cash generated from homebuilding operations for the past 5 years was $5.9 billion. At September 30th, we had $5 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $3 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our home building revolving credit facility. This level of liquidity provides significant flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions.  Our home building leverage was 17.8% at fiscal year-end, with $3.1 billion of home-building public notes outstanding, of which $350 million matures in the next 12 months. At September 30th, our stockholder's equity was $14.9 billion, and book value per share was $41.81, up 29% from a year ago. For the year, our return on equity was 31.6%, an improvement of 950 basis points from 22.1% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $71.6 million for a total of $289.3 million of dividends paid during year. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares of common stock for $212.6 million.  And our stock repurchases during fiscal year 2021 totaled 10.4 million shares for $874 million. Our outstanding share count is down 2% from a year ago, and our remaining share repurchase authorization at September 30th was $546.2 million dollars. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis, and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year. Based on our financial position and outlook for fiscal 2020, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 13% to $22.5 per share. Jessica. And Carl to your point about extending delays and things like that, that applies when we do own our land and we're self-developing. it doesn't necessarily affect our cash return when we're working with a third-party and by buying lots because we're not buying the lots until we're ready to start homes and those approvals are in place. I would say more recently, one thing that is impacting our turns and our ability to actually return our cash in 24 months is the extension of our construction times with the supply chain delays.  We have seen further elongation of our construction times. I believe on a year-over-year basis, our closings this quarter were -- the construction times were longer by about 7 weeks, which is a bit longer than we would reported last quarter and so that is a factor that is causing a bit of friction in our inventory turns right now. But, hopefully, as we achieve some stabilization on the material side over the coming year, we will see that stabilize and, hopefully, we will be -- contract again. Well, in terms of lumber cost, that they are still rising. They rose further in our fiscal Q4. We've seen them rise further into October, so we do believe that we are seeing the peak of lumber cost. However, other costs are increasing as well, we're seeing costs really increasing across-the-board so even when we see perhaps have some relief from lumber as we move further into fiscal 2022, I think that will be offset by other cost increases. As far as the net effect on gross margin, ultimately that will depend on the strength of the demand environment as we move into the spring season, and our ability to continue to offset costs with prices. Right now, our short-term view is that we should be able to offset cost with price and maintain our margins that are around the level that we just reported in the fourth quarter. But, truly as we move through fiscal 2022, it will depend on the strength of the demand environment. Yeah. Thanks, Matt. I think we're still in an unusual environment. The prior-year trends really don't apply to where we are today. Our sales order pace and the sequential pace of our shareholders is really driven by supply, by the homes that we have started, that we have in production that reached the stage that were ready to release them for sales, and so our sales volumes are really governed by or constrained by our homes in inventory where they stand. And so right now, with the visibility that we have to Q1, we believe we're in position where we will deliver sales that are equal to or maybe, slightly better than last year's level, which is an unusual sequential pattern versus where we were in Q4 when we were restricting sales. And then as we move into the year, I think the pattern will still be governed by our inventory levels. we're looking at the year as a whole and what our ASP will be for the year will ultimately be dependent on the spring selling season. And so the assumption that these prices for the year will be up mid-to-high single-digit, I think that's fair. We're not going to assume that prices will continue to increase as fast as they have. And so our base assumption will be there will be some moderation in sales prices. We're going to continue to be focused on affordability from an intentional perspective for our business. And so for our initial guide going into the year prior to seeing what the spring will look like, prior to seeing what the supply chain challenges will continue to be. And what that will do to us over the course of the year, we've set our ASP target as you've seen. Thank you. We've already talked on this call about we are in an unusual time in terms of how our sales pace looks. We're also an unusual time in terms of historical measures of our homes and inventory relative to what we can close, with extended construction times and all the disruptions. As David said, we have to hold more homes in inventory to deliver the same number of closings today versus a few years ago. Absolutely. When we get back to a more normalized time, we would expect our inventory turns to return back to historical norms, or as David said, or better. Historically, if you looked at the beginning of the year for us, you could take our homes in inventory and you can pretty well double that and that's what we would close the next year. Sometimes we've done a little better than that, sometimes a little worse. Given the current environment if it remains as tough as it is right now, we probably -- we will not be able to do that.  Our guidance obviously would it would imply that, but absolutely. When we get back to a more normal time, we would expect to reduce our spec count and turn our inventory and focus on generating the best returns that we possibly can. This is simply a reflection of the current environment we are in, the elongated construction times we're seeing And this is one of the strengths of our long lock for lot pipeline and our controlled lot position because we've got land and lots controlled generally at fixed prices or at known prices and so we reap the benefits of that by having a strong controlled lot position. We've got a small sample size thus far on those that we've plugged have been very pleased with the profit levels we've seen. I expect we will still see some projects that will generate those level of profits, but as we grow the platform and as we build the infrastructure in place to support a larger volume across the country. We wouldn't necessarily expect to continue to generate the same margin that we've shown on these first few, but do expect pretax profit margins to be higher on the rental business than on our for-sale business and to generate an accretive return, it needs to be a little bit higher, because of the assets are held a little bit longer. We do still expect to see very attractive profit levels on the rental business, but the current sample size is still little bit small."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R Horton.\nJessica Hansen: Thank you, Darrell and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021.

This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-Q, early next week. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentation section under News and Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Jessica and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray , our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The DR work team delivered an outstanding third quarter highlighted by a 78% increase in earnings to $3.06 per diluted share. Our consolidated pretax income increased 81% on a 35% increase in revenues to $7.3 billion and our pretax profit margin improved 490 basis points, and 19.4%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 34.9% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 29.5%. These results reflect our experience team's new production capabilities, our ability to leverage the award and scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Housing market conditions remain very robust. And we are focused on maximizing returns and increasing our market share further. However, multiple disruptions in the supply chain combined with the improvement in economic conditions, and strong demand for new homes have resulted in shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market, which has caused our construction time to become less predictable. As our top priority is to consistently fulfill our commitments to our homebuyers, we have slowed our home sales pace to more closely align our current production levels and our selling homes later in the construction cycle when we can better ensure the certainty of home close date for our homebuyers. We expect to work through these issues and increase our production capacity. We started construction on 22,600 homes this quarter, and our homes in inventory increased 44% from a year ago to 47,300 homes at June 30, 2021, positioning us to finish 2021 strong and to achieve double digit growth again in 2022. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and a low leverage positioned us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our home building operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments. Mike?\nMike Murray: Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 78% to $3.06 per diluted share, compared to $1.72 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 77% to $1.1 billion compared to $630.7 million. Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 35% to $7 billion on 21,588 homes closed, up from $5.2 billion on 17,642 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $326,100 and the average size of our homes closed was down 2%. Bill?\nBill Wheat: The value of our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 2% from the prior year to $6.4 billion, while our net sales orders for the quarter decreased 17% to 17,952 homes. Our average number of active selling communities increased 1% from the prior year quarter and was down 3% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter was $359,200. The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 17%, down from 22% in the prior year quarter. As David described in this very strong demand environment, our local teams are restricting the sales over pace in each of their communities based on the number of homes in inventory, construction time and lot position. They continue to adjust sales paces and prices to market on a community by community basis, while staying focused on providing value to our buyers. Based on the stage of completion of our current homes and inventory, production schedules and capacity, we expect to continue restricting the pace of our sales orders during our fourth fiscal quarter. As a result, we expect our fourth quarter net sales orders to be lower than the third quarter. However, we are confident that we will be well positioned to deliver double digit volume growth in fiscal 2022 with 32,200 homes in backlog, 47,300 homes in inventory, a robust lot supply and strong trade and supplier relationships. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the third quarter was 25.9%, up 130 basis points sequentially from the March quarter. The increase in our gross margin from March to June exceeded our expectations and reflects the broad strength of the housing market. The strong demand for a limited supply of homes has allowed us to continue to raise prices or lower the level of sales incentives in most of our communities. On a per square foot basis, our revenues were up 4.7% sequentially, while our stick and brick cost per square foot increased 3.5%. And our lot costs increased 1.7%. We expect both our construction and lot costs will continue to increase on a per square foot basis. However, with the strength in today's market conditions; we expect to offset any cost pressures with price increases. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be similar to or slightly better than the third quarter. We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the return on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. Bill?\nBill Wheat: In the third quarter homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.1%, down 80 basis points from 7.9% in the prior year quarter. Our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is lower than any quarter in our history. And we remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our business. David?\nDavid Auld: We have increased our housing inventory and response to the strength of demand and we expect the current constraints on our supply chain to ultimately subside. This quarter, we started 22,600 homes, up 33% from the third quarter last year, bringing our trailing 12 months starts to 94,500 homes. We ended this quarter with 47,300 homes in inventory, up 44% from a year ago; 15,400 of our total homes at June 30th were unsold, of which 500 were complete. Mike?\nMike Murray: At June 30th, our home building lot position consisted of approximately 517,000 lots, which 24% were owned, and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. 25% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 44% of our control lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our growing in capital efficient lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position and also supports our efforts to increase our production volume to meet homebuyer demand. Our third quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land in development totaled $1.8 billion, of which $910 million was for finished lots; $540 million was for land development, and $350 million was to acquire land. $300 million of our total lot purchases in the third quarter were from Forestar. Forestar, our majority owned subsidiary is a publicly traded well capitalized residential lot manufacturer operating in 55 markets across 22 states. Forestar is delivering on its high growth expectations and now expects to grow its fiscal 2021 lot deliveries by approximately 50% year-over- year to a range of 15,500 to 16,000 lots, with a pre ax profit margin of 11.5% to 12%, excluding their $18.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt recognized during the quarter. At June 30th, Forestar's owned and controlled lot opposition increased 91% from a year ago to 96,600 lots, 61% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with D. R. Horton are subject to a right of first offer and our master supply agreement. Forestar's separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had approximately $470 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt to capital ratio of 37.8%. With a strong lot supply, capitalization and relationship with D.R. Horton, Forestar plans to continue profitably growing their business. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Financial Services pretax income in the third quarter was $70.3 million, with the pretax profit margin of 37.3% compared to $68.8 million and 43.9% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decline in our financial services pretax profit margin was primarily due to lower net gains on loans originated this quarter caused by market fluctuations and increased competitive pricing pressure in the market. For the quarter, 98% of our mortgage companies' loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 66% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 45% of the mortgage companies' volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 721 and an average loan to value ratio of 89%. First time homebuyers represented 58% of the closings handled by the mortgage company this quarter. Mike?\nMike Murray: At June 30th, our multifamily rental operations had 11 projects under active construction in an additional four projects that are completed and in a lease up phase, based on leased occupancy and our marketing process. We expect to sell two or three of these projects during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Our multifamily rental assets sold $458.3 million at June 30. Last year, we began constructing and leasing homes as income producing single family rental communities. After these rental communities are constructed and achieve a stabilized level of least occupancy. Each community is marketed for sale. During the third quarter, we sold our second single family rental community for $23.1 million in revenue, and $11.4 million of gross profit. At June 30, our homebuilding inventory included $303.1 million of assets related to 44 single family rental communities, compared to $87.2 million of assets related to 10 communities at the beginning of the fiscal year. We are pleased with the performance of our single and multifamily rental teams, and we look forward to the growing contributions for our future profits and returns. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our balance capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. During the nine months into June our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $276 million, even while we have reinvested significant operating capital to expand our homebuilding inventories in response to strong demand. At June 30, we had $3.7 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.7 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. We believe this level of homebuilding cash and liquidity is appropriate to support the increased scale and activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 16% at the end of June, with $2.5 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding and no senior note maturities in the next 12 months. At June 30, our stockholders equity was $13.8 billion, and book value per share was $38.54, up 27% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months into June, our return on equity was 29.5% compared to 19.9%, a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $72.1 million. And our board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in August. We repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock for $241.2 million during the quarter for a total of 8.1 million shares repurchase fiscal year-to-date for $661.4 million. Our remaining share repurchase authorization in June 30 was $758.8 million. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 based on today's market conditions, we expect to generate consolidated revenues of $7.9 billion to $8.4 billion and our homes close to be in the range between 23,000 and 24,500 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 26% to 26.3% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter to be approximately 7%. We anticipate our financial services pretax profit margin in the range of 40% to 45%. And we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 23.5%. For the full fiscal year of 2021, we now expect consolidated revenues of $27.6 billion to $28.1 billion and to close between 83,000 and 84,500 homes. This year, we have prioritized reinvestment of our operating capital to increase our housing and land and lot inventories to support higher demand. Our other cash flow priorities remain balanced. Among increasing our investment in our multi and single family rental platforms, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying a dividend and repurchasing shares to reduce our outstanding share counts by approximately 2% from the beginning of fiscal 2021. David?\nDavid Auld: In closing, our results reflect our experience teams and production capabilities. Industry leading market share, raw geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our results also illustrate the growth opportunity in front of us as we increase production capacity in response to homebuyer demand. Our strong balance sheet liquidity and low leverage provide us with a significant financial flexibility to capitalize on today's robust market and to effectively operating in changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. As a result of these efforts, we are incredibly well positioned to continue growing and improving our operations. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is come from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.\nStephenKim: Yes, thanks very much guys, impressive results. And really interesting times here, I wanted to talk a little bit about this restriction of sales which we've been seeing you and others do. Throughout the June quarter, you indicated you expected that to continue in the September quarter. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color around that. Are you expecting the restrictions to be similar in severity in the September quarter? Do you think those restrictions might continue past September to a meaningful degree. And I guess it's really related to your starts. And so in that regard, your starts were down I think 5% sequentially or so was curious when you thought that could grow. And you talked about building the infrastructure needed to do higher level of housing starts, I wondered to see if you could provide a little more color around that. So more color on the starts outlook. And are you going to be continuing to restrict sales at the same degree in September, and maybe past September?\nDavidAuld: Well, on the starts outlook, we have a plan. And our plan is to consistently be out there community by community, increasing production over time. If you look at our quarterly run rate, we're in that 20,000 to 23,000 starts each quarter. That was the plan for this year. Our plan is to take that out next year. And we position land, lots people to affect that plan. So demand out there is just unlike anything I've ever seen. And I think our focus is on how to meet that demand in the most efficient manner. And injecting a homeowner into the process sooner rather than later, impacts the our ability to get the house and built an extent that time and it makes it harder for our trades and our superintendent, I can tell you is through our history, to have somebody walk into our models and to tell them we don't have a house for you to buy today is something that is foreign to us and as difficult as anything I've ever seen on sales people. It is a tough environment to be in a sales office today. And I talk -- in our travels, I talk to our people we're going to provide a home for everybody walking in. We just need to keep on patient and understand their frustration. But that's just again; it's a market I've never seen. Demand is just unbelievable today. I can't remember the rest of the question.\nStephenKim: Largely, they were to look ahead, and the restrictions, are they likely to continue to the same degree in the September quarter? And will they -- you anticipate continue past September?\nDavidAuld: We are continuing to put things in place to expand our production capability, we've increased the pay size of our lot deliveries, because we see, in my history, if a buyer walked into a model, and you hadn't figured out how to get them under contract, in a week, 10 days, they had bought somewhere else. I got an email this month, from a buyer who has been in our models at every release for the last year and hasn't been able to buy a house. And he's still waiting. I mean, you can multiply that 1000s and 1000s of times across the country, with multiple builders out there. We did not restrict sales, as soon as the general market did, and which just geometrically increased our demand. And it's just -- it again, we're all managing through a market that none of us have ever seen. And probably the difference in this cycle, than the prior super demand cycle that I was a part of, is the builders are disciplined this cycle. We're all focused on capital efficiency; we're all focused on improving returns. And it's, I think it's going to expand the cycle again. And, again, we're in un-chartered waters from a demand aspect right now.\nJessicaHansen: And Steve, in terms of just specifically restricting sales, those decisions are going to continue to be made on a community by community basis. So where we can get the start accelerated is where we'll open up for more sales more quickly.\nMikeMurray: Where we can get the starts accelerated as well as getting better certainty to production timelines. The worst thing we want to do is put a homeowner -- homebuyer into the backlog, and then not be able to deliver our commitment to them as to when their home's going to be ready. It's very disruptive. We want them to have a great experience and be very happy with their house when they move into it. So as we've worked through a lot of the supply chain disruptions, we've adopted some of our processes, sharing more information earlier in the process with our trade partners, helping us with longer lead times, that's helping to work through some of the supply chain issues. We're hopeful that those things are resolving as we work them through but for the fourth quarter, I can foresee us continuing to restrict sales, again, the decision made community by community based upon current local conditions. But those restrictions will likely remain in place in the fourth quarter.\nStephenKim: Okay, appreciate that. Your order ASP was remarkably up about 10% sequentially from the March quarter, I was wondering how much of that increase in order ASP was actual price, do you think versus mix shift? And as you look in at that order, ASP flowing into your gross margin in the next quarter or two? I was curious if you could help us understand what kind of lumber cost cadence we should be thinking about. Obviously, it's gyrated quite a bit here over the year past year so if you could give us a sense for was this quarter absorbing peak lumber cost? Or is it next quarter just help us understand how the lumber cost cadence fits in as well as the mix shift effect in your order ASP.\nMikeMurray: Steve, I'll take that, the lumber cost. I don't think we saw peak lumber costs coming through in our June quarter closings. I'm expecting to your word gyrating was a good word for the lumber market, seeing the higher lumber costs coming through in our September quarter deliveries and early into our fourth quarter deliveries and I'm very confident that the order price trends that we've seen have more than offset that lumber cost. And we've been able to absorb that well, into margins that we'll see in our fourth quarter deliveries.\nJessicaHansen: Yes, and in terms of mix, Steve, I mean, our sales orders are a good indicator of our forward closing price. But it doesn't typically flow through directly like that. So we wouldn't expect our closing price next quarter to be at the same magnitude or equivalent to our sales orders. But we haven't seen a whole lot of mix. So I mean, we are seeing and you can see it flowing through on our closings in our gross margin, a lot of like for like price improvement. \nOperator: Our next question is come from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG.\nCarlReichardt: Thanks, good morning, everybody. In the release, you've mentioned that you're building out infrastructure to support the higher level of housing starts going forward. And can you expand on that a little bit, David? So are there incremental costs? What specifically are you referring to there? And when is your expectation that such infrastructure will be in place to support those starts level? And I guess really, what I'm asking is, how much of this is really in your control, versus the demand side of supply chain side that isn't?\nDavidAuld: I think what we can control, we are controlling, Carl, we can control the number of lots that we push into the pace; we can control communication with our trade partners, and make sure they understand the levels and timing of what we're pushing out. In our staffing levels generally that's been the least of the problems, because it's absorption for community. So you have to add support and communities. But it's just a very efficient process. So it really just has to do with field operations, as far as driving that capacity and aggregating and consolidating trade base within those sub markets, which is a process that we go through every day. I mean, we did start almost 95,000 homes, in trailing 12 months. And that's I don't think anybody else has ever done that. And it's a result of scale, and just incredibly hard work being done out in the field.\nCarlReichardt: Thanks David. And then, in the past, and this cycle too, we've seen builders use sales price to try to put a brake on turnover rates. And I think there's some concerns in the market, which I share that pricing dynamic may be beginning to negatively impact sales rates. I'm curious if that's something you felt that you saw, you said a lot of positive things about demand, and whether or not now, the restriction on sales, it looks like are far more important to you to manage absorption pace, and then pricing is. And I also know that's made -- that decision is made at a local level. So can you sort of help untangle that for me that we really not using price and just using price to cover costs and because demand is good, or you still feel like you're using prices and break on sale?\nDavidAuld: I think today we're seeing very little price pushback. It's -- I don't know that you could ever know that you could impact demand the price today. So, go ahead.\nMikeMurray: Our restriction on sales is not being driven by and large buy, just let's just increase pricing until people stop buying. We are not releasing homes for sale until we're through a certain stage in the production process, which varies by community. But it's not just using price to adjust the pace that we're going. We're actually not releasing the homes for sale. When the homes do get released for sale, we're seeing very quick absorption of those particular homes by buyers that are waiting to buy homes and to go under contract and then take delivery of the homes. \nJessicaHansen: Still very focused on affordability, Carl, even with increases in our ASP is still significantly lower than the rest of the public builders by and large. And that's a focus that we don't want to lose. We do want to maintain affordability and we've seen the credit profile of our buyers continue to keep pace with where ASPs have gone and so really even when we do stress tests on our backlog, it looks like our buyers are in very good shape even in spite of the price increases we've seen in the market.\nOperator: Our next question is come from the line of Deepak Raghav with Wells Fargo Securities. \nDeepakRaghav: Hi, good morning all. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk through some of the early outlooks on pricing and margin into 2022? If you're able to, it feels like you should get good leverage from your double digit revenue growth outlook. And hopefully commodities may moderate into that -- into 2022. Early just given that you're all -- all the builders are pacing sales here, giving the breathing time for supply chain to catch up. And you may not feel compelled to give all that benefits back. So should we think about flat to up gross margins? Or would they still be pressures to gross margin from a tough 2021 comp?\nMikeMurray: Sure, thanks. Thanks, Deepak. We have commented and guided to a slightly off gross margin into our Q4, and to our September quarter of 26% to 26.3%. And based on what we can see today in our backlog with the pricing that has already been taken in our sales orders over the last quarter or two, we believe we're in position certainly to maintain or slightly see increases in our gross margin over the next quarter or two in excess of the cost increases that we're seeing come through. So in the short run, the next quarter or two, we do expect stability or maybe a slight upside to our current gross margin. Obviously, beyond that, we don't have as much visibility, but clearly, we feel like we have good stability in our margins for the near term.\nDeepakRaghav: Okay, that's fair. You also mentioned some new or incremental supply chain constraints in the quarter. Can you please elaborate on those? And also as we talk about the supply chain, racquetball constraints, any new ones that cropped up in the prior quarter -- in the quarter, one? And two, have you seen any easing on the flip side, as well?\nMikeMurray: So on the supply chain, if anything was construed as there were new constraints, I don't want to imply that there were any new constraints. I think we referenced last quarter that the supply chain challenges have been a bit of a whack a mole, and that one pops up and the teams jump on it, and work with the suppliers in that particular category to solve those issues. One of the things we have done is adjusted internally with a lot of our lead time, how far in advance of actual production start that we're communicating with the supply chain partners to make sure that product is available for us. But I could not point to any one particular item as new or incredibly acute right now. There's just a series of issues that we solve every day in the business. That's part of what we do. It's how we've delivered over 20,000 homes this last quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan.\nMichaelRehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I want to get a better sense a little bit of the approach to orders relative to production pace and supply constraints. And obviously a bit of discussion here already on the call. But what I'm a little confused on is you'd said that your starts pace is kind of tracking to plan at 22,000 to 23,000. You just said that. Also, there are no really new constraints out there more ongoing supply constraints, yet your orders are down 17%. And that's in contrast to prior commentary of flat to down single digits. So just wanted to understand what really has been the difference in approach and if there's something that really changed during the quarter that's driving that different result on the order side, relative to your prior commentary?\nBillWheat: Well, Mike, I think what we have seen is an elongation of our construction times beyond what we were seeing previously so which is really a cumulative effect of a number of things that have been ongoing that are impacting supply chain, which are manifesting themselves in longer construction times. And so as we're managing that and trying to manage the customer experience as best we can that has resulted in us releasing sales in more communities later in the construction cycle than we were previously. So it's been a, I would say, an incremental restriction of sales, that's resulted in probably a bit more of a sales order restriction than we would have anticipated a quarter ago. But it's something that's as we work through the supply chain issues and start to have better visibility and get more of our production later in the construction cycle and essentially catch up a bit on production, and we'll be able to probably resume at a better pace on sales orders.\nMikeMurray: A goal means to have our customers in backlog for a shorter period of time, the time from when they sign the contract, we deliver the home, we're consciously trying to compress that timeframe, to give them more certainty in the process, and give us more control of when we deliver the home to them. \nDavidAuld: When you move release date on a particular house, from slab to frame to windows install, I mean that is an extended period of time right now. And so reading demand, or any significant change in this quarter adjustment, as we have pushed out that release date, to me is just not indicative of what is out there in the market. We really are trying to improve the experience of the homebuyer. And when we give somebody a date to close, we intend to keep because their whole life revolves around them. And as the certainty close date was impacted by windows insulation, anything and everything that appliances that was taking place through the last six months, it just became obvious to us that we need to be more restricted in what we've done, trust me. It is soul crushing to ourselves people to have somebody walk out and ready willing able to buy. And we tell that we have houses that will become available in 30 to 45 days. And we'll be glad to call you, what is different to me this market cycle than any other than I've ever been a part of. Is it 30 or 45 days later, you call that person and yes, they're still trying to buy a house. So it's a tough market -- environment.\nMichaelRehaut: Right, no, I appreciate those comments, David, and obviously not disappointing your customers is a key part of it. Second question, I just wanted to circle back a little bit to the order ASP essentially around 360, up over -- 22%, up 22% year-over-year, the backlog up over 13% year-over-year. It stands obviously in stark contrast to 2018 through 2020, where you also had periods of home price appreciation, not anywhere near the same level. But you were able to maintain that average closing price right around 300 for three straight years. So the question is what are you doing going forward to, I understand that obviously, you have a price that's maybe below most of your peers, but still that monthly payment has been something that you guys pride yourselves on. Is there any action that you can take over the next year or two to perhaps reverse that trend, either through building slightly further out or maybe slightly different footprints or more attached products, whatever it might be, to perhaps reverse that trend, particularly to the extent that rates might rise? The real concerns here in the marketplace, is that the current price maybe it's okay in the current backdrop but might be more vulnerable in the next year or two. So anything that you're doing in terms of your product mix your geographic mix that might help solves those issues.\nDavidAuld: Well, we have decreased our square footage and you will probably continue to see that take place. We are reducing the number of two storey homes that we offer in communities. I mean my offer I mean, we have a production model, we're detailing or we're picking the houses we're going to build and the lay schedule that we're going set up with the market with. So it again, we are very sensitive to price point, we are very sensitive to the FHA loan limits. That to us is a risk mitigator, because that's where the vast majority of buyers are. And if we service so, I trust my core, we're monitoring, and we're tracking it. And we do believe that as our production capabilities continue to improve, and increase, and we consolidate labor and in these markets that we will continue to be able to offer affordable homes. If rates tick up and yes, more pressure on price. But we will meet that challenge when it comes.\nOperator: Our next question is come from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays.\nMatthewBouley: Good Morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess not to belabor the point, but just back on the restricting of sales pace. Because it seems like it was affected to really similar degree consistently across your markets, despite these local community by community decisions. So can you sort of go over the mechanics, I guess, of how you all Horton management really communicates the strategy to, I believe you said earlier, these sort of frustrated individual operators and sales folks, what are you telling people to look for in terms of, like you said, homes and inventory and extended cycle times today versus ideally where you want them to be, in order to begin releasing those sales again, thank you.\nDavidAuld: I think what we're looking for is to get a level of inventory in front of the buyers, typically, this time of year, we'd be sitting on 40%- 45% specs, the day, the only specs, we have are at our houses, we haven't released to the market. So again, it's -- we're trying to grab efficiency in the process. And by controlling when that house is sold, it does help both meet customer expectation, and it also eliminates a lot of frustration on the building side where a buyer is coming out. And they have been told; maybe they bought a house in January. And they've been told they will be moving into June and the house is ready to move into. So they're out there every day, monitoring the progress of their house against the progress of every other home in the community. And it just adds the level of difficulty that to be honest with you right now today.  We don't want and we don't need it. Somebody gets frustrated in the middle process; they stay frustrated for a very long time very hard to meet the expectation once they get upset. So by limiting that by pushing the maturity of our inventory further down the process before we inject a buyer into it. We're trying to take some of the pressure off our trades and our builders. And what does that process take place? I will tell you, in some divisions, it started in January, and then it would other divisions in February. And really by April in April, 1st of May it took hold in some of our very large divisions in the state of Texas and it just got to the point where we were spending more time on it or we were spending a significant amount of time dealing with the customers frustration on this closed state of their house at the expense of other things we could be doing that would drive future efficiency and production capability. So again it's -- it was a process that took place over multiple months, beginning in one division and ending really ending in Texas.  So Don Horton said many times, never thought he'd see a day when he couldn't build every house he could sell in the state of Texas. I can tell you today there are not enough lots or trade capacity to meet demand in the state of Texas; I don't care if you're Don Horton, or any of the other public builders out there. It's very difficult to get a house build today. We're doing a better job than anybody else. And we're going to get better at what we're doing. But it's -- there is a tremendous amount of demand out there.\nMatthewBouley: No, that's really helpful color there. And it's actually segue into my follow up, which is when you talk about how strong demand is, and exceeding your current capacity, and you're clear around your own restrictions. What are you looking at in your communities that quantifiably, I guess that gives you the confidence to say that, and in fairness when you look at the, I guess traffic, perhaps in your communities, are you also seeing traffic slip more than you might expect, seasonally? And was that part of the shortfall in orders? Or is it really just simply what you previously said that demand is just far exceeding capacity.\nMikeMurray: Matt, we can look across and see the stage of construction our unsold homes are at, and by and large, they are at early stages of construction, and likely not available or released for sale. So and we're not writing sales contracts, by and large for pre sales, breathing, we haven't started yet and generally reaching a more mature stage of construction. So we can deliver with certainty, a closing date to that buyer at the time we signed the contract with them.\nJessicaHansen: And so many of our communities have wait lists or interest lists that far exceed even what we have under construction, which is why you continue to hear us answer every single question so far, that the demand is still there. And the demand is extremely robust. And this was an internal decision that was based on our production capacity and taking care of our homeowners and homebuyers.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman and Associates.\nAlanRatner: Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So first question, Jessica, you made a comment earlier that I'd love to drill in on a little bit in regards to the credit profile of your buyers, I think obviously a lot of questions on the home price increases and what impact that could have on affordability, you said you've seen the credit profile of your buyers keeping pace with the home price increases, you've instituted up to this point, which I was a little surprised at just given the fact we know incomes are not up 20% year-over-year, and rates are pretty stable now after obviously going down quite a bit in the second half of last year. So should I interpret that to imply that maybe the mix of your buyers or the buyers in your interest list are kind of slowly shifting maybe towards more of a move up buyer or at least a more affluent first time buyer than you've historically seen over the last few years.\nJessicaHansen: We really haven't seen a change in our mix across our brands, which would be our best indicator as an entry level versus move up. And really, even if we look at the credit profile across all of our brands, we really saw, we've seen this year an improvement in FIFO score, a slight reduction in debt to income, even with a higher average loan amount as a result of the higher average sales prices that we're experiencing. So no, I don't -- I wouldn't attribute it to that. I mean, we still have almost 55% to 60% of our buyers are first time buyers.\nMikeMurray: A very large number of unsatisfied buyers out there, people that want to buy a home that have not been able to buy a home because they could not get a home. And we look at the existing home inventory levels that are available and given marketplaces. They're just not there. And so the quick moving homes, the specs we had that were completed last year, obviously they were absorbed very quickly into the marketplace, we've restricted the sale of a lot of our homes, to give better certainty to that homebuyer in the process of their delivery date. And with in a rising price environment when we're restricting the sale, they were able to price to market at the time we signed the contract, which is then closer to the delivery date.\nAlanRatner: Got it. Okay. And I appreciate that extra color there. So I guess the follow up to that point then is obviously it's an incredibly tight supply environment today. You guys are holding back sales, restricting sales. A lot of other builders are kind of doing or saying the same thing. So it would seem like if you kind of connect the dots here, a lot of homes are being started today. Not a lot of those homes yet are released for sale. So at some point in the future, you would think inventory is going to come to the market in a pretty meaningful way and the question then, of course is will the demand be sufficient to absorb that? Because right now it's probably a little tricky to get a firm grasp on what that demand is when you're turning buyers away. So are you tracking that on your kind of a local basis what other builders are doing in terms of restricting sales with starting homes? And how would you anticipate responding if let's just say later this year, or in your fiscal 1Q you start releasing more homes for sale, other builders do the same thing. And the demand is not quite what you expected it to be? Are you willing to accept a lower absorption pace? Are you going to start at that point to maybe discount a little bit? What would the thought process be?\nJessicaHansen: It's going to be a different answer community by community. And usually, our first read Alan is on the existing home side. So our local guys are very in tune with what's going on with both existing home inventory and other public builders in their market. And as always we can adjust our search schedule up or down based on market conditions. So if what you're saying were to come true, and there start to be signs of some sort of increased supply in the market, that the demand is not going to be there for which right now feels like we are a long ways away from, we would be able to adjust our starts accordingly community by community where we saw those signs, like we always do to make sure we don't end up with an excess supply of completed specs. But with 500 completed homes across the country today, we're just so far from having that conversation on a national level. But those are things that our local operators certainly pay attention to, all the time when they're looking at their business plan and what they're going to do going forward, our plan would be to continue to consolidate market share, regardless of market conditions. And we believe we're going to continue to be the best position to do that, kind of regardless of what the demand profile looks like in future periods.\nDavidAuld: And again, so we're focused on the lower end of the price scale. And I can assure you if we -- even if we look at the other public builders out there, their price points are higher, and any slowdown in the market, at least in my opinion, is going to be driven by the house payment. And it does not feel like that is anything on horizon right now.\nMikeMurray: I don't think if you look at what we have available for sale today, what we've started and what we plan to start, I don't believe that's going to satisfy the demand that we're seeing in our sales offices today. And I don't believe any of the other builders have near the amount of inventory coming at them and starts coming at them that we do. So I just don't see that in the new home builders being able to push a lot of inventory into the marketplace available for sale in any kind of a short to medium term horizon, that's going to dent significantly this demand. That's why Jessica said, we watch at a local level what's happening in the existing home market.\nAlanRatner: That's very helpful. I appreciate the thought process there. And it'll be interesting to see over the next few quarters. Can I sneak in one last one? David, you mentioned obviously, many times this is unlike anything you've seen in terms of having to turn buyers away. When I look at your business and obviously the one big thing that's changed in terms of your strategy now versus prior cycles is on the land strategy. You own a lot fewer lots or a much smaller supply of land on a year supply basis than you have in the past. And you're more reliant on third party developers through option contracts, et cetera. So I'm curious what you're seeing from the developers or are they facing outsize pressure on their development timelines vis-\u00e0-vis perhaps what you're seeing on your own portfolio? And is that in any way, slowing the process down? It's not just you; obviously, the whole industry is shifting more towards that strategy. But I'm curious, with a smaller supply of own land, does that inhibit your ability to grow perhaps more than it had in the past?\nDavidAuld: These third party developers are our trade partners of ours. I mean, we work with these guys' day in and day out. We've been working with them day in day out for multiple years now. We know these guys, we know their capabilities. And if one of them gets in trouble. I mean, we step in and help. And we've done that a couple of times this year, where a local guy got out over skis, and we had to step in and bring the lots to market and that's, so it's -- we talked about the flexibility of our capital structure on our balance sheet and liquidity that we maintain. That's why we do this. And then we got the added benefit of a very close relationship with Forestar, who has been, they have done an exceptional job of building out their platform over the last five years. And they have really good people controlling the operations and developments of these lots and we are their biggest customer. And so we, I was thinking about that this morning, when you look at the embedded lot counts that we own and control and our ability to actually have a production plan to drive a set number of starts every week in every market on a consistent and growing basis. That is just in today's world that is an incredible competitive advantage. And it allows us to communicate with our trades. So that they know what we're going to start. Our, the vast majority of our key trade partners know our start base in October, November, December, and January. And that's when we're going to start down. And they are aligned with our vision of what we're trying to accomplish. And, I mean, they spent a lot of work into this position. But there's never been a platform in this industry that has anything like what D.R. Horton platform is today. And we're very proud of that. And we'd like we're going to deliver outstanding results as a result of it.\nJessicaHansen: And just for reference our control lot position. So in addition to what we own is up 78% from a year ago, so we have got the lots in front of us and feel very comfortable about our lot position not being the hindrance to our ability to grow. It's actually what supported us being able to grow like we have, and to continue to do so in the future.\nAlanRatner: I appreciate that, guys. And just to clarify, I wasn't implying you don't control the lots, it was more there are lots developed.\nDavidAuld: That's a valid concern is something that we monitor, and whether we own a lot, or we're buying an option. We have people in other divisions working with on every community to make sure those lots get delivered.\nOperator: Our next question is come from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.\nAnthonyPettinari: Good morning. Last year, the pandemic kind of threw seasonality out the window, as you look at home buyer behavior in terms of underlying demand. Are you seeing any return of seasonality? Or should we expect another year of people looking to buy homes the week of Thanksgiving, the week of Christmas? And then your cancellation rate, I think extremely low by historical standards. But I think it ticked up very modestly sequentially in the quarter. Was there anything behind that? It sounds like price wasn't an issue. But just wondering if there was anything you saw there that just kind of noise?\nJessicaHansen: Nothing on -- nothing to point out on the cancellation rate. I mean, that's still at a historical low. Typically, we're very comfortable and are normalized ranges in the low 20s versus the 17 I think that we mentioned today, so it's the nothing of note there. To the first question, seasonality, yes.\nDavidAuld: Again, if we -- if -- I don't know how you define seasonality that is based upon the number of houses you start, and when you release them for sale. We're building that process program to improve that, I think you're going to see our sales track our inventory of releases. And as we release more houses from selling houses.\nMikeMurray: And sales historically has been a very good indicator of demand in the marketplace, as we've had a broad range of homes in various production stages available for sale and pre sales available. And that would be a good indicator of demand in the marketplace. Today, it's our supply of homes, is indicating what we're going to be able to sell and deliver and with almost 50,000 homes in production. And the starts we've had over the past 12 months. We're in a great place to continue to deliver double digit growth in our deliveries. We feel really good about fiscal '22.\nAnthonyPettinari: Great. That's very helpful. And then just as a follow up, I mean, I think in the past, you've talked about community count, rising low single digits as you pivot to selling homes a little bit later. Is there any change to that estimate or its impact?\nMikeMurray: Our goal as we focus on gaining market share, consolidate market share we would expect over the longer term our community account to continue to grow, obviously today with the strong demand, but there's some communities where we have sold out sooner and so you see some quarterly fluctuation in that. But over the longer term, we'd expect the trend to be for community accounts to continue to grow at a modest pace at a low to mid single digit pace over the longer term.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research.\nTrumanPatterson: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So first question on you alluded in your press release about double digit unit growth in 2022. And my question doesn't really pertain to demand or the demand outlook, really, but I'm just hoping to understand, what are some of the biggest risks to achieving that growth on the supply side? We've heard issues with lot development availability, community approvals, material shortages, a little bit of labor issues. I'm just hoping that you can explain some of these risks that might impede that double digit growth, and how some of those constraints you see playing out into '22.\nJessicaHansen: Truman, it really is a little bit of everything you mentioned, but it's nothing new. It's all things, as Mike said earlier on we've been working through this entire time. So if we didn't feel confident in the double digit and the ability to continue to manage through those, and ramp up our production to more adequately meet the demand that's in the market, we wouldn't be saying that here in July. But there are constraints. And we wouldn't say any one thing, it's everything you outlined. And it varies by market, essentially, on a daily basis, what the constraint is, but our operators are doing a fantastic job of navigating through that.\nMikeMurray: But the positioning, we can see in our inventory, our inventory did increase by about 1,000 units this quarter, up 44% year-over-year, on a trailing 12 months basis, we've started 94,500 homes, that in and of itself is double digit growth over what our plan deliveries are this year. So we're already in position to deliver double digit, and working to improve on that and expand on that as we move into '22. We feel like we're in great position to do that. There'll be challenges. There'll be unknown challenges that we haven't dealt with yet. But we're confident in our teams and our ability to continue to maintain the current pace and incrementally improve on it as we move into '22 on our starts.\nJessicaHansen: And I know that's a relatively high level comment today. We're sitting in July; we haven't finished our fiscal year. So we would expect in November to give more specific guidance, in addition to just the double digit closing target.\nTrumanPatterson: Okay. Really, what I'm kind of looking at is on the material side; we've heard of shortages kind of across the board, but especially windows, doors, concrete, I mean, it depends which market, right? But do you actually have contracts in place, with your suppliers to actually get that level of product?\nMikeMurray: We have relationships with our suppliers. I mean, no matter what the contract says, you're going to get what with they're going to give you and they're going to deliver who they want to deliver to. And so we work very hard to be a good trade partner, with our suppliers in both materials and labor, and making sure they understand what our production plans are. And our commitment is to them. And they've made the commitment to us. \nDavidAuld: Again, it goes back to scale within these markets. I mean, we're a very important customer to do just about every material supplier in those markets. So Mike's right, it is about relationships, but it's about future relationships, as well. So is it going to be difficult path, yes, it is going to be difficult, because they're saying no to somebody, we just don't want them to be saying no to us. \nTrumanPatterson: Understood. And then my follow up question just a follow up very strong order ASP up 10%, quarter-over-quarter. We've just seen a lot of builders starting to employ a final and best bidding process. Just hoping to understand either what portion of your communities or the portion of that price I came from the bidding process. And then on the other side of it just with affordability there's been some talk, some believe in the industry that there's been some incentives taking up. Have you seen that in any of your local markets?\nDavidAuld: Certainly haven't seen any incentive ticking up. And we have used the fund to invest in certain communities and where we have a very limited lot supply. But that's not a giant component of what we're seeing on sales price or margin. Certainly it's impactful, and it's certainly happening in our extended longer communities, especially at the price points we have, we're offering in the entry level we don't like that. I personally don't like that process. Because in '05, '06 there was a false demand by people running around putting houses under contract, because they never intended to close, I don't want our operators to have a false expectation about the pricing that's achievable in the market, by having a guy from California bid on my house and stuff, work on again Texas, and then all of a sudden, every house is worth what a guy transferring in from California is willing to pay. We're trying to stay very close to these markets. And our goal is to sell everybody walks into our house and into our model for home. And we're not there right now, but we're certainly going to get there. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Kenneth Zener with Keybanc Capital.\nKennethZener: Good morning, everybody. And don't pick on the California folks there. \nDavidAuld: We're making a lot of money in California right now.\nKennethZener: You can make more there. Alright, so look, all the stocks that are reporting today, across all the categories, record margins, record demand, limited supply, and right, what's different this cycle is that we have very low interest rates and COVID. Very high consumer credit, right, governments are printing all the money. And structurally in housing, there's a very high propensity for institutional buyers, right? I mean, it's coming from builders, like you, other large builders, something $5 billion, $6 billion portfolios all the time buying 15,000- 20,000 unit property. So, look, I think you guys obviously have the best business model in many ways, and you're working on your land supply. So I understand all that. But where are as an operator, I mean your whip is less capitalized unison inventory divided by whip than it is historically.  And your leverage is so low. I mean, what is -- what are you going to look for, I guess, to see when? Yes, it seems like you're over earning, obviously, you guys, there's nothing that'll indicate your margins are going down? You're actually got up. But I mean, what do you think it will be there? Are you looking at -- how are you looking at the existing side? How are you looking at people bidding on properties that are maybe not an individual investor, but all this institutional money that's coming in, because the cap rates are still good? What is it that you're looking at separate from the operations on the macro events that causes you? Yes, I don't know if there's a factor to that to look at rather than the operational side. That's it. Thank you.\nMikeMurray: I think from, looking at what macro storm clouds might be the things that might happen in the next six months or a year that we never anticipated, like a worldwide pandemic that we didn't anticipate two years ago. There are certainly things like that that can happen that could impact the business. Rising interest rates always are a significant cost input into the value of the homes and the monthly payment. And we monitor obviously that very closely and looking at affordability. I think Jessica touched on it before with two points in the stress testing we did the backlog, that the backlog can withstand some interest rate upward movement right now. In addition, the DTI, the debt-to-income levels we're seeing in our borrowers this most recent quarter, actually taking down a little bit despite the average loan size going up.  So the credit qualities of our buyers are good. Looking at our for sale communities, the vast majority of the buyers of those homes are owner occupied homes. We don't have any institutional relational outtake programs and out for sale communities. Our institutional focus would be on the build direct communities which are separate and apart from the for sale side of our business. It's hard to know all the things that may change in the future, Kenn. But one thing we do focus on and have focused on for many years is maintaining a very strong, flexible balance sheet as you said, where we have great low leverage strong equity capitalization, and very good liquidity that allows us to take advantage of the market conditions as they change and continue to consolidate market share, especially at a local level where we can turn that local market share leverage into outperformance. \nOperator: Thank you. That is all the time we have today for the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Darrell. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today. And look forward to speaking with you again to share our fourth quarter and full year results in November. Under the D.R. Horton family, Don Horton and the entire executive team, thank you for your focus and hard work. Tremendous account accomplishments in delivering the first three quarters. Let's go finish strong and put numbers on the board that nobody's ever seen. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Murray",
            "content": "Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 78% to $3.06 per diluted share, compared to $1.72 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 77% to $1.1 billion compared to $630.7 million. Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 35% to $7 billion on 21,588 homes closed, up from $5.2 billion on 17,642 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $326,100 and the average size of our homes closed was down 2%. Bill? At June 30th, our home building lot position consisted of approximately 517,000 lots, which 24% were owned, and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. 25% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 44% of our control lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our growing in capital efficient lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position and also supports our efforts to increase our production volume to meet homebuyer demand. Our third quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land in development totaled $1.8 billion, of which $910 million was for finished lots; $540 million was for land development, and $350 million was to acquire land. $300 million of our total lot purchases in the third quarter were from Forestar. Forestar, our majority owned subsidiary is a publicly traded well capitalized residential lot manufacturer operating in 55 markets across 22 states. Forestar is delivering on its high growth expectations and now expects to grow its fiscal 2021 lot deliveries by approximately 50% year-over- year to a range of 15,500 to 16,000 lots, with a pre ax profit margin of 11.5% to 12%, excluding their $18.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt recognized during the quarter. At June 30th, Forestar's owned and controlled lot opposition increased 91% from a year ago to 96,600 lots, 61% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with D. R. Horton are subject to a right of first offer and our master supply agreement. Forestar's separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had approximately $470 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt to capital ratio of 37.8%. With a strong lot supply, capitalization and relationship with D.R. Horton, Forestar plans to continue profitably growing their business. Jessica? At June 30th, our multifamily rental operations had 11 projects under active construction in an additional four projects that are completed and in a lease up phase, based on leased occupancy and our marketing process. We expect to sell two or three of these projects during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Our multifamily rental assets sold $458.3 million at June 30. Last year, we began constructing and leasing homes as income producing single family rental communities. After these rental communities are constructed and achieve a stabilized level of least occupancy. Each community is marketed for sale. During the third quarter, we sold our second single family rental community for $23.1 million in revenue, and $11.4 million of gross profit. At June 30, our homebuilding inventory included $303.1 million of assets related to 44 single family rental communities, compared to $87.2 million of assets related to 10 communities at the beginning of the fiscal year. We are pleased with the performance of our single and multifamily rental teams, and we look forward to the growing contributions for our future profits and returns. Bill? Where we can get the starts accelerated as well as getting better certainty to production timelines. The worst thing we want to do is put a homeowner -- homebuyer into the backlog, and then not be able to deliver our commitment to them as to when their home's going to be ready. It's very disruptive. We want them to have a great experience and be very happy with their house when they move into it. So as we've worked through a lot of the supply chain disruptions, we've adopted some of our processes, sharing more information earlier in the process with our trade partners, helping us with longer lead times, that's helping to work through some of the supply chain issues. We're hopeful that those things are resolving as we work them through but for the fourth quarter, I can foresee us continuing to restrict sales, again, the decision made community by community based upon current local conditions. But those restrictions will likely remain in place in the fourth quarter. Steve, I'll take that, the lumber cost. I don't think we saw peak lumber costs coming through in our June quarter closings. I'm expecting to your word gyrating was a good word for the lumber market, seeing the higher lumber costs coming through in our September quarter deliveries and early into our fourth quarter deliveries and I'm very confident that the order price trends that we've seen have more than offset that lumber cost. And we've been able to absorb that well, into margins that we'll see in our fourth quarter deliveries. Our restriction on sales is not being driven by and large buy, just let's just increase pricing until people stop buying. We are not releasing homes for sale until we're through a certain stage in the production process, which varies by community. But it's not just using price to adjust the pace that we're going. We're actually not releasing the homes for sale. When the homes do get released for sale, we're seeing very quick absorption of those particular homes by buyers that are waiting to buy homes and to go under contract and then take delivery of the homes. Sure, thanks. Thanks, Deepak. We have commented and guided to a slightly off gross margin into our Q4, and to our September quarter of 26% to 26.3%. And based on what we can see today in our backlog with the pricing that has already been taken in our sales orders over the last quarter or two, we believe we're in position certainly to maintain or slightly see increases in our gross margin over the next quarter or two in excess of the cost increases that we're seeing come through. So in the short run, the next quarter or two, we do expect stability or maybe a slight upside to our current gross margin. Obviously, beyond that, we don't have as much visibility, but clearly, we feel like we have good stability in our margins for the near term. So on the supply chain, if anything was construed as there were new constraints, I don't want to imply that there were any new constraints. I think we referenced last quarter that the supply chain challenges have been a bit of a whack a mole, and that one pops up and the teams jump on it, and work with the suppliers in that particular category to solve those issues. One of the things we have done is adjusted internally with a lot of our lead time, how far in advance of actual production start that we're communicating with the supply chain partners to make sure that product is available for us. But I could not point to any one particular item as new or incredibly acute right now. There's just a series of issues that we solve every day in the business. That's part of what we do. It's how we've delivered over 20,000 homes this last quarter. A goal means to have our customers in backlog for a shorter period of time, the time from when they sign the contract, we deliver the home, we're consciously trying to compress that timeframe, to give them more certainty in the process, and give us more control of when we deliver the home to them. Matt, we can look across and see the stage of construction our unsold homes are at, and by and large, they are at early stages of construction, and likely not available or released for sale. So and we're not writing sales contracts, by and large for pre sales, breathing, we haven't started yet and generally reaching a more mature stage of construction. So we can deliver with certainty, a closing date to that buyer at the time we signed the contract with them. A very large number of unsatisfied buyers out there, people that want to buy a home that have not been able to buy a home because they could not get a home. And we look at the existing home inventory levels that are available and given marketplaces. They're just not there. And so the quick moving homes, the specs we had that were completed last year, obviously they were absorbed very quickly into the marketplace, we've restricted the sale of a lot of our homes, to give better certainty to that homebuyer in the process of their delivery date. And with in a rising price environment when we're restricting the sale, they were able to price to market at the time we signed the contract, which is then closer to the delivery date. I don't think if you look at what we have available for sale today, what we've started and what we plan to start, I don't believe that's going to satisfy the demand that we're seeing in our sales offices today. And I don't believe any of the other builders have near the amount of inventory coming at them and starts coming at them that we do. So I just don't see that in the new home builders being able to push a lot of inventory into the marketplace available for sale in any kind of a short to medium term horizon, that's going to dent significantly this demand. That's why Jessica said, we watch at a local level what's happening in the existing home market. And sales historically has been a very good indicator of demand in the marketplace, as we've had a broad range of homes in various production stages available for sale and pre sales available. And that would be a good indicator of demand in the marketplace. Today, it's our supply of homes, is indicating what we're going to be able to sell and deliver and with almost 50,000 homes in production. And the starts we've had over the past 12 months. We're in a great place to continue to deliver double digit growth in our deliveries. We feel really good about fiscal '22. Our goal as we focus on gaining market share, consolidate market share we would expect over the longer term our community account to continue to grow, obviously today with the strong demand, but there's some communities where we have sold out sooner and so you see some quarterly fluctuation in that. But over the longer term, we'd expect the trend to be for community accounts to continue to grow at a modest pace at a low to mid single digit pace over the longer term. But the positioning, we can see in our inventory, our inventory did increase by about 1,000 units this quarter, up 44% year-over-year, on a trailing 12 months basis, we've started 94,500 homes, that in and of itself is double digit growth over what our plan deliveries are this year. So we're already in position to deliver double digit, and working to improve on that and expand on that as we move into '22. We feel like we're in great position to do that. There'll be challenges. There'll be unknown challenges that we haven't dealt with yet. But we're confident in our teams and our ability to continue to maintain the current pace and incrementally improve on it as we move into '22 on our starts. We have relationships with our suppliers. I mean, no matter what the contract says, you're going to get what with they're going to give you and they're going to deliver who they want to deliver to. And so we work very hard to be a good trade partner, with our suppliers in both materials and labor, and making sure they understand what our production plans are. And our commitment is to them. And they've made the commitment to us. I think from, looking at what macro storm clouds might be the things that might happen in the next six months or a year that we never anticipated, like a worldwide pandemic that we didn't anticipate two years ago. There are certainly things like that that can happen that could impact the business. Rising interest rates always are a significant cost input into the value of the homes and the monthly payment. And we monitor obviously that very closely and looking at affordability. I think Jessica touched on it before with two points in the stress testing we did the backlog, that the backlog can withstand some interest rate upward movement right now. In addition, the DTI, the debt-to-income levels we're seeing in our borrowers this most recent quarter, actually taking down a little bit despite the average loan size going up.  So the credit qualities of our buyers are good. Looking at our for sale communities, the vast majority of the buyers of those homes are owner occupied homes. We don't have any institutional relational outtake programs and out for sale communities. Our institutional focus would be on the build direct communities which are separate and apart from the for sale side of our business. It's hard to know all the things that may change in the future, Kenn. But one thing we do focus on and have focused on for many years is maintaining a very strong, flexible balance sheet as you said, where we have great low leverage strong equity capitalization, and very good liquidity that allows us to take advantage of the market conditions as they change and continue to consolidate market share, especially at a local level where we can turn that local market share leverage into outperformance."

            "content": "Thank you, Jessica and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray , our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The DR work team delivered an outstanding third quarter highlighted by a 78% increase in earnings to $3.06 per diluted share. Our consolidated pretax income increased 81% on a 35% increase in revenues to $7.3 billion and our pretax profit margin improved 490 basis points, and 19.4%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 34.9% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 29.5%. These results reflect our experience team's new production capabilities, our ability to leverage the award and scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Housing market conditions remain very robust. And we are focused on maximizing returns and increasing our market share further. However, multiple disruptions in the supply chain combined with the improvement in economic conditions, and strong demand for new homes have resulted in shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market, which has caused our construction time to become less predictable. As our top priority is to consistently fulfill our commitments to our homebuyers, we have slowed our home sales pace to more closely align our current production levels and our selling homes later in the construction cycle when we can better ensure the certainty of home close date for our homebuyers. We expect to work through these issues and increase our production capacity. We started construction on 22,600 homes this quarter, and our homes in inventory increased 44% from a year ago to 47,300 homes at June 30, 2021, positioning us to finish 2021 strong and to achieve double digit growth again in 2022. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and a low leverage positioned us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our home building operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments. Mike? We have increased our housing inventory and response to the strength of demand and we expect the current constraints on our supply chain to ultimately subside. This quarter, we started 22,600 homes, up 33% from the third quarter last year, bringing our trailing 12 months starts to 94,500 homes. We ended this quarter with 47,300 homes in inventory, up 44% from a year ago; 15,400 of our total homes at June 30th were unsold, of which 500 were complete. Mike? In closing, our results reflect our experience teams and production capabilities. Industry leading market share, raw geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our results also illustrate the growth opportunity in front of us as we increase production capacity in response to homebuyer demand. Our strong balance sheet liquidity and low leverage provide us with a significant financial flexibility to capitalize on today's robust market and to effectively operating in changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. As a result of these efforts, we are incredibly well positioned to continue growing and improving our operations. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Well, on the starts outlook, we have a plan. And our plan is to consistently be out there community by community, increasing production over time. If you look at our quarterly run rate, we're in that 20,000 to 23,000 starts each quarter. That was the plan for this year. Our plan is to take that out next year. And we position land, lots people to affect that plan. So demand out there is just unlike anything I've ever seen. And I think our focus is on how to meet that demand in the most efficient manner. And injecting a homeowner into the process sooner rather than later, impacts the our ability to get the house and built an extent that time and it makes it harder for our trades and our superintendent, I can tell you is through our history, to have somebody walk into our models and to tell them we don't have a house for you to buy today is something that is foreign to us and as difficult as anything I've ever seen on sales people. It is a tough environment to be in a sales office today. And I talk -- in our travels, I talk to our people we're going to provide a home for everybody walking in. We just need to keep on patient and understand their frustration. But that's just again; it's a market I've never seen. Demand is just unbelievable today. I can't remember the rest of the question. We are continuing to put things in place to expand our production capability, we've increased the pay size of our lot deliveries, because we see, in my history, if a buyer walked into a model, and you hadn't figured out how to get them under contract, in a week, 10 days, they had bought somewhere else. I got an email this month, from a buyer who has been in our models at every release for the last year and hasn't been able to buy a house. And he's still waiting. I mean, you can multiply that 1000s and 1000s of times across the country, with multiple builders out there. We did not restrict sales, as soon as the general market did, and which just geometrically increased our demand. And it's just -- it again, we're all managing through a market that none of us have ever seen. And probably the difference in this cycle, than the prior super demand cycle that I was a part of, is the builders are disciplined this cycle. We're all focused on capital efficiency; we're all focused on improving returns. And it's, I think it's going to expand the cycle again. And, again, we're in un-chartered waters from a demand aspect right now. I think what we can control, we are controlling, Carl, we can control the number of lots that we push into the pace; we can control communication with our trade partners, and make sure they understand the levels and timing of what we're pushing out. In our staffing levels generally that's been the least of the problems, because it's absorption for community. So you have to add support and communities. But it's just a very efficient process. So it really just has to do with field operations, as far as driving that capacity and aggregating and consolidating trade base within those sub markets, which is a process that we go through every day. I mean, we did start almost 95,000 homes, in trailing 12 months. And that's I don't think anybody else has ever done that. And it's a result of scale, and just incredibly hard work being done out in the field. I think today we're seeing very little price pushback. It's -- I don't know that you could ever know that you could impact demand the price today. So, go ahead. When you move release date on a particular house, from slab to frame to windows install, I mean that is an extended period of time right now. And so reading demand, or any significant change in this quarter adjustment, as we have pushed out that release date, to me is just not indicative of what is out there in the market. We really are trying to improve the experience of the homebuyer. And when we give somebody a date to close, we intend to keep because their whole life revolves around them. And as the certainty close date was impacted by windows insulation, anything and everything that appliances that was taking place through the last six months, it just became obvious to us that we need to be more restricted in what we've done, trust me. It is soul crushing to ourselves people to have somebody walk out and ready willing able to buy. And we tell that we have houses that will become available in 30 to 45 days. And we'll be glad to call you, what is different to me this market cycle than any other than I've ever been a part of. Is it 30 or 45 days later, you call that person and yes, they're still trying to buy a house. So it's a tough market -- environment. Well, we have decreased our square footage and you will probably continue to see that take place. We are reducing the number of two storey homes that we offer in communities. I mean my offer I mean, we have a production model, we're detailing or we're picking the houses we're going to build and the lay schedule that we're going set up with the market with. So it again, we are very sensitive to price point, we are very sensitive to the FHA loan limits. That to us is a risk mitigator, because that's where the vast majority of buyers are. And if we service so, I trust my core, we're monitoring, and we're tracking it. And we do believe that as our production capabilities continue to improve, and increase, and we consolidate labor and in these markets that we will continue to be able to offer affordable homes. If rates tick up and yes, more pressure on price. But we will meet that challenge when it comes. I think what we're looking for is to get a level of inventory in front of the buyers, typically, this time of year, we'd be sitting on 40%- 45% specs, the day, the only specs, we have are at our houses, we haven't released to the market. So again, it's -- we're trying to grab efficiency in the process. And by controlling when that house is sold, it does help both meet customer expectation, and it also eliminates a lot of frustration on the building side where a buyer is coming out. And they have been told; maybe they bought a house in January. And they've been told they will be moving into June and the house is ready to move into. So they're out there every day, monitoring the progress of their house against the progress of every other home in the community. And it just adds the level of difficulty that to be honest with you right now today.  We don't want and we don't need it. Somebody gets frustrated in the middle process; they stay frustrated for a very long time very hard to meet the expectation once they get upset. So by limiting that by pushing the maturity of our inventory further down the process before we inject a buyer into it. We're trying to take some of the pressure off our trades and our builders. And what does that process take place? I will tell you, in some divisions, it started in January, and then it would other divisions in February. And really by April in April, 1st of May it took hold in some of our very large divisions in the state of Texas and it just got to the point where we were spending more time on it or we were spending a significant amount of time dealing with the customers frustration on this closed state of their house at the expense of other things we could be doing that would drive future efficiency and production capability. So again it's -- it was a process that took place over multiple months, beginning in one division and ending really ending in Texas.  So Don Horton said many times, never thought he'd see a day when he couldn't build every house he could sell in the state of Texas. I can tell you today there are not enough lots or trade capacity to meet demand in the state of Texas; I don't care if you're Don Horton, or any of the other public builders out there. It's very difficult to get a house build today. We're doing a better job than anybody else. And we're going to get better at what we're doing. But it's -- there is a tremendous amount of demand out there. And again, so we're focused on the lower end of the price scale. And I can assure you if we -- even if we look at the other public builders out there, their price points are higher, and any slowdown in the market, at least in my opinion, is going to be driven by the house payment. And it does not feel like that is anything on horizon right now. These third party developers are our trade partners of ours. I mean, we work with these guys' day in and day out. We've been working with them day in day out for multiple years now. We know these guys, we know their capabilities. And if one of them gets in trouble. I mean, we step in and help. And we've done that a couple of times this year, where a local guy got out over skis, and we had to step in and bring the lots to market and that's, so it's -- we talked about the flexibility of our capital structure on our balance sheet and liquidity that we maintain. That's why we do this. And then we got the added benefit of a very close relationship with Forestar, who has been, they have done an exceptional job of building out their platform over the last five years. And they have really good people controlling the operations and developments of these lots and we are their biggest customer. And so we, I was thinking about that this morning, when you look at the embedded lot counts that we own and control and our ability to actually have a production plan to drive a set number of starts every week in every market on a consistent and growing basis. That is just in today's world that is an incredible competitive advantage. And it allows us to communicate with our trades. So that they know what we're going to start. Our, the vast majority of our key trade partners know our start base in October, November, December, and January. And that's when we're going to start down. And they are aligned with our vision of what we're trying to accomplish. And, I mean, they spent a lot of work into this position. But there's never been a platform in this industry that has anything like what D.R. Horton platform is today. And we're very proud of that. And we'd like we're going to deliver outstanding results as a result of it. That's a valid concern is something that we monitor, and whether we own a lot, or we're buying an option. We have people in other divisions working with on every community to make sure those lots get delivered. Again, if we -- if -- I don't know how you define seasonality that is based upon the number of houses you start, and when you release them for sale. We're building that process program to improve that, I think you're going to see our sales track our inventory of releases. And as we release more houses from selling houses. Again, it goes back to scale within these markets. I mean, we're a very important customer to do just about every material supplier in those markets. So Mike's right, it is about relationships, but it's about future relationships, as well. So is it going to be difficult path, yes, it is going to be difficult, because they're saying no to somebody, we just don't want them to be saying no to us. Certainly haven't seen any incentive ticking up. And we have used the fund to invest in certain communities and where we have a very limited lot supply. But that's not a giant component of what we're seeing on sales price or margin. Certainly it's impactful, and it's certainly happening in our extended longer communities, especially at the price points we have, we're offering in the entry level we don't like that. I personally don't like that process. Because in '05, '06 there was a false demand by people running around putting houses under contract, because they never intended to close, I don't want our operators to have a false expectation about the pricing that's achievable in the market, by having a guy from California bid on my house and stuff, work on again Texas, and then all of a sudden, every house is worth what a guy transferring in from California is willing to pay. We're trying to stay very close to these markets. And our goal is to sell everybody walks into our house and into our model for home. And we're not there right now, but we're certainly going to get there. We're making a lot of money in California right now. Thank you, Darrell. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today. And look forward to speaking with you again to share our fourth quarter and full year results in November. Under the D.R. Horton family, Don Horton and the entire executive team, thank you for your focus and hard work. Tremendous account accomplishments in delivering the first three quarters. Let's go finish strong and put numbers on the board that nobody's ever seen. Thank you."

            "name": "Bill Wheat",
            "content": "The value of our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 2% from the prior year to $6.4 billion, while our net sales orders for the quarter decreased 17% to 17,952 homes. Our average number of active selling communities increased 1% from the prior year quarter and was down 3% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter was $359,200. The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 17%, down from 22% in the prior year quarter. As David described in this very strong demand environment, our local teams are restricting the sales over pace in each of their communities based on the number of homes in inventory, construction time and lot position. They continue to adjust sales paces and prices to market on a community by community basis, while staying focused on providing value to our buyers. Based on the stage of completion of our current homes and inventory, production schedules and capacity, we expect to continue restricting the pace of our sales orders during our fourth fiscal quarter. As a result, we expect our fourth quarter net sales orders to be lower than the third quarter. However, we are confident that we will be well positioned to deliver double digit volume growth in fiscal 2022 with 32,200 homes in backlog, 47,300 homes in inventory, a robust lot supply and strong trade and supplier relationships. Jessica? In the third quarter homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.1%, down 80 basis points from 7.9% in the prior year quarter. Our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is lower than any quarter in our history. And we remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our business. David? Our balance capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. During the nine months into June our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $276 million, even while we have reinvested significant operating capital to expand our homebuilding inventories in response to strong demand. At June 30, we had $3.7 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.7 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. We believe this level of homebuilding cash and liquidity is appropriate to support the increased scale and activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 16% at the end of June, with $2.5 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding and no senior note maturities in the next 12 months. At June 30, our stockholders equity was $13.8 billion, and book value per share was $38.54, up 27% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months into June, our return on equity was 29.5% compared to 19.9%, a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $72.1 million. And our board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in August. We repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock for $241.2 million during the quarter for a total of 8.1 million shares repurchase fiscal year-to-date for $661.4 million. Our remaining share repurchase authorization in June 30 was $758.8 million. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year. Jessica? Well, Mike, I think what we have seen is an elongation of our construction times beyond what we were seeing previously so which is really a cumulative effect of a number of things that have been ongoing that are impacting supply chain, which are manifesting themselves in longer construction times. And so as we're managing that and trying to manage the customer experience as best we can that has resulted in us releasing sales in more communities later in the construction cycle than we were previously. So it's been a, I would say, an incremental restriction of sales, that's resulted in probably a bit more of a sales order restriction than we would have anticipated a quarter ago. But it's something that's as we work through the supply chain issues and start to have better visibility and get more of our production later in the construction cycle and essentially catch up a bit on production, and we'll be able to probably resume at a better pace on sales orders."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. An interactive question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Thank you. You may begin.\nJessica Hansen: Thank you, Melissa. And good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Before we get started, today\u2019s call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R.

Horton\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K and it\u2019s most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning\u2019s earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q in the next day or two. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Jessica. And good morning. I\u2019m pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered a strong second quarter, highlighted by 95% increase in earnings to $2.53 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 90% on a 43% increase in revenues to $6.4 billion, and our pre-tax profit margin, improved 450 basis points to 18.3%. Our net sales orders for the quarter, increased 35% to 27,059 homes, and our homes in the inventory increased 38% to 46,100. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12-months ended March 31 was 31.2%, and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 27.1%. These results reflect our experienced teams and expanding production capabilities, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Housing market conditions remain very robust, and we are focused on maximizing returns and capital efficiency in each of our communities while increasing D.R. Horton\u2019s market share. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity, and low leverage positions us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace, and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments. Mike?\nMike Murray: Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 95% to $2.53 per diluted share compared to $1.30 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 93% to $930 million compared to $483 million. Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 41% to $6.2 billion on 19,701 homes closed, up from $4.4 billion on 14,539 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was up 4% from the prior year at $313,200 and the average size of our homes closed was down 2%, reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Net sales orders in the second quarter increased 35% to 27,059 homes, and the value of those orders was $8.8 billion, up 47% from $6 billion in the prior year. We sold over 14,200 more homes in the first half of fiscal 2021 than the same period last year, supporting further gains in market share and scale. Our average number of active selling communities increased 4% from the prior year quarter and was flat sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the second quarter was $327,000, up 9% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the second quarter was 15%, down from 19% in the prior year quarter. Our local teams are managing the sales order pace in each of their communities, based on their lot position, number of homes in inventory, and pace of home starts and production. Their increasing sales prices were supported by the market, while remaining focused on providing homes at affordable prices. We are pleased with our sales pace to date in April and remain well-positioned in this strong market with our affordable product offerings, lot supply, and housing inventories. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the second quarter was 24.6%, up 50 basis points sequentially from the December quarter. The increase in our gross margin from December to March exceeded our expectations and reflects the broad strength of the housing market across our footprint. The strong demand for a limited supply of homes has allowed us to raise prices or lower the level of sales incentives in most of our communities. On a per square foot basis, our revenues were up 3.5% sequentially, while our stick-and-brick cost per square foot increased 4.5% and our lot costs increased 2%. We expect both our construction and lot costs will continue to increase on a per square foot basis. However, with the strength of today\u2019s conditions, we expect to offset these cost pressures with price increases. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the third quarter to be similar to or slightly better than the second quarter. We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives, and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the return on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. Bill?\nBill Wheat: In the second quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.6%, down 70 basis points from 8.3% in the prior year quarter. The improvement in our SG&A ratio this quarter was better than our expectations and was due to our higher-than-expected volume of homes closed and the increase in our average selling price. Our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is at its lowest point in the March quarter in our history, and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure appropriately supports our business. Mike?\nMike Murray: We have increased our housing inventory in response to the strength of demand. We started 23,700 homes this quarter, up 33% from the second quarter last year and ended the quarter with 46,100 homes in inventory, up 38% from a year ago. 12,200 of our total homes at March 31 were unsold, of which 700 were completed. We also had 1,900 model homes at the end of the quarter. At March 31, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 487,000 lots, of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. 26% of our total owned finished lots - owned lots are finished and at least 45% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our growing and capital efficient lot portfolio is key to our strong competitive position, allowing us to increase our production volume to meet homebuyer demand. David?\nDavid Auld: Our second quarter homebuilding investments, and lots, land development totaled $1.7 billion, of which $980 million was for finished lots, $440 million was for land development and $290 million was to acquire land. $270 million of our lot purchases in the second quarter were from Forestar. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Forestar, our majority-owned subsidiary, is a publicly traded residential lot manufacturer, operating in 54 markets across 22 states. Our strategic relationship with Forestar, as a well capitalized lot supplier across much of our operating footprint, is serving us well and is presenting opportunities for both companies to gain market share. Forestar is delivering on its high growth expectations, and now expects to grow its lot deliveries by 40% to 45% in fiscal 2021 to a range of 14,500 to 15,000 lots, with a pre-tax profit margin of 10% to 10.5%. At March 31st, Forestar\u2019s lot position increased 62% from a year ago to 84,500 lots, of which 58,700 are owned and 25,800 are controlled through purchase contracts. 63% of Forestar\u2019s owned lots are under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under our Master Supply Agreement. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had approximately $500 million of liquidity at quarter end, which included $170 million of unrestricted cash and $330 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. At March 31st, Forestar\u2019s net debt-to-capital ratio was 34.1%. Forestar has been active in the public capital markets recently, issuing common stock through its at the market equity offering program, issuing new senior unsecured notes, calling for redemption of some of its higher coupon senior notes and extending the maturity and increasing the capacity of its revolving credit facility. With low leverage, strong liquidity, capital markets access and its relationship with D.R. Horton, Forestar is in a great position to continue to grow their profitable business. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Financial services pre-tax income in the second quarter was $107.7 million, with a pre-tax profit margin of 47.8% compared to $24.7 million and 23.6% in the prior year quarter. The improvement in our financial services operating margin is primarily due to strong net gains on sale and better G&A leverage due to increased loan volume. For the quarter, 98% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 67% of our home buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 47% of the mortgage company\u2019s volume. Borrowers' originating loans with DHI mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 720 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 90%. First time homebuyers represented 57% of the closings handled by our mortgage company in the quarter. Mike?\nMike Murray: At March 31st, our multifamily rental operations had eight projects under active construction and an additional four projects that are completed and in the lease-up phase. Based on our pace of leasing activity, we expect to sell two of these projects during the second half of fiscal 2021. Our multifamily rental assets totaled $394.4 million at March 31st. As we\u2019ve mentioned, we are now constructing and leasing homes within single-family rental communities. After these rental communities are constructed and achieved a stabilized level of leased occupancy, each community is expected to be marketed for sale. Our single-family rental operations are currently reported in our homebuilding segment. There were no sales of single-family rental communities during the second quarter. However, we still expect one more sale later this fiscal year. At March 31st, our homebuilding fixed assets included $182.6 million of assets related to our single-family rental platform, representing 27 communities, up from 13 communities in the first quarter. We now expect our total investments in our single and multifamily rental platforms will increase between $400 million and $500 million from the beginning to the end of fiscal 2021. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. During the six months ended March, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $138 million compared to $52 million in the prior year period. $215 million of cash provided by our homebuilding operations was due to a deferral of estimated tax payments granted by the IRS as a result of the Texas winter storm this year, and the cash flow impact of this item will reverse in our third quarter. At March 31st, we had $3.7 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.9 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.8 billion of available capacity on our revolving credit facilities. We plan to continue maintaining higher homebuilding cash balances and liquidity than in prior years to support the increased scale and activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 16.8% at the end of March, with $2.5 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding and no senior note maturities in the next 12 months. At March 31st, our stockholder\u2019s equity was $13 billion and book value per share was $35.96, up 25% from a year ago. For the trailing 12-months ended March, our return on equity was 27.1% compared to 19.1% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $72.7 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in May. We repurchased 4.5 million shares of common stock for $350.4 million during the quarter, and the remaining outstanding share repurchase authorization at March 31st was $115.1 million. This week, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase authorization replacing the company\u2019s previous authorization. The new authorization has no expiration date. We are committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis, and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, based on today\u2019s market conditions, we expect to generate consolidated revenues of $7 billion to $7.2 billion and our homes closed to be in a range between 21,500 and 22,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the third quarter to be in the range of 24.6% to 25%, and our homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter to be approximately 7.5%. We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin of approximately 45%, and we expect our income tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23% for the quarter. For the full fiscal year of 2021, we now expect consolidated revenues of $26.8 billion to $27.5 billion and to close between 82,500 and 84,500 homes. We still expect to generate positive cash flow from our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2021. However, we are not providing specific guidance for our homebuilding cash flow this year, as we prioritize augmenting our housing and land and lot inventories to support higher demand. After reinvesting in our homebuilding business, our cash flow priorities are balanced among increasing our investment in both our multi and single-family rental platforms, maintaining our conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying dividends and repurchasing shares to reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 1.5% from the beginning of fiscal 2021. David?\nDavid Auld: In closing, our results reflect our experienced teams and expanding production capabilities, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to capitalize on today\u2019s robust market and to effectively operate in changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts continue to be remarkable. We are incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Lovallo: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. First one, I guess, it really seems like the asset-light strategy that you guys embarked upon a few years ago is really hitting stride now. I mean, option percentage up to close to 75%, and buybacks now expected to actually lower the share count. So these are all things that we had hoped for some time, and again, it really seems to be hitting stride. Two questions on that. I mean where do you now see sort of the target percent option? I know it can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but any change in the view longer term on that? And then, has the view now on buybacks, has that changed? Do you think that you'll actually be able to continue chipping away at the share count over time?\nDavid Auld: John, I'd say we're always going to try to get better and continuing to push the auction as a percentage of total. We consider that a better utilization cap. So if we're at 75% now, over time, we would expect to turn that into 80%, and we'll get to 80% over time. If different market conditions, it could grow beyond that. So it's - it's just \u2013 you know, like every time we do, we talk about sustainable, scalable, and that follows right on track. We believe that auctioning lots is - will drive better cash flow, better returns to our shareholders, and as our builders on our platforms out there execute that strategy, relationships grow stronger, and it's just a - there's a momentum that I think will continue.\nBill Wheat: And then John, with respect to share repurchases, I would use the word sustainable as well there. As we have progressed in our capital light strategy, as we\u2019ve generated more cash flow, as we have gotten in position with our scale to reinvest in our business to support the scale that we believe that the market will bear today. And we\u2019ve improved our balance sheet and our liquidity position. We are now in a position where I do think we have hit an inflection point where I think we can more definitively talk about consistently repurchasing shares and consistently reducing our share count over time. And so, we had a little bit of interruption with COVID last year in which we paused. We reinstated share repurchase last quarter and then this quarter, we\u2019ve accelerated. And now with the new authorization, we are more definitively stating that we expect to consistently reduce our share count each year going forward, and that will be part of our balanced program.\nJohn Lovallo: Yeah. That\u2019s really encouraging on both fronts, guys. The second question is, we have heard through the channel of what I would characterize as maybe seemingly aggressive behavior by some of your competitors in terms of whether it\u2019s you know, prices being paid for land, potentially even cutting some corners to get homes closed. Just curious, if you guys have heard any rumblings like this in the market? And if so, I mean, does it maybe suggest that things are getting a little bit too heavy a heal [ph] overall?\nDavid Auld: Yeah. John, we\u2019ve seen on a very limited basis some erratic behavior on the land front, where a builder has positioned themselves where they just don\u2019t have adequate or even non-adequate supply of lots, they are buying out of desperation. But it hasn\u2019t been consistent across all the markets and even within markets where I have seen it, it\u2019s not impactful to the overall land valuation. You know, our entire process through this cycle has been to auction lots, take longer positions where we control pricing through this market, and I think we said it on every call, we are incredibly well-positioned on our lot supply. And if somebody is being erratic, then we will \u2013 they\u2019re going to be in a very difficult position to compete if they\u2019re accelerating - if they\u2019re overbidding land price, because we are \u2013 we\u2019re pretty efficient in delivering houses, and our land pipeline is long and deep and very well priced.\nBill Wheat: John, back to your other question about closing homes before they\u2019re ready. We\u2019ve been in this business a long time and certainly have kind of learned a lesson that we don\u2019t want to close the home before its time. So we will wait until the home is ready, and the buyer is satisfied with the home to be in there. At the same time, buyers are very anxious to get in their homes. Build times have elongated a bit with supply chain disruptions and some of the labor availability. Our production process, our consistent cadence of starts helps us overcome a lot of that. Selling homes after we\u2019ve started them in their production cycle gives us more assurance of a completion date, and we\u2019re able to better work with the buyers on matching that completion and closing date, align with what they need to move in for whatever situation they\u2019re coming from. So keeping that buyer happy through the process, and most importantly, that day, they move in their house, they\u2019re very happy with the completed D.R. Horton home that they\u2019ve just purchased.\nJohn Lovallo: It\u2019s really helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Bouley: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Congrats on the results and thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a question about the revenue guidance, and it\u2019s entirely possible I missed it, but just to the extent you are raising the full-year revenue guide by about, I guess, $1.7 billion at the midpoint, but delivery is up about 2,500 at the midpoint, it seems like there is a lot more revenue there than would be implied by the deliveries. Just what else is driving that uptick? Thank you.\nBill Wheat: Yeah. Thanks, Matt. With the sales price increases that we have seen in recent quarters, with the sales price increase we\u2019ve seen in our net sales orders this quarter, we are anticipating a further increase in our closing average prices in Q3 and Q4 versus where we\u2019ve been in the first two quarters. So there is some expectation and visibility to increase sales prices in that revenue guide. As well, our total consolidated revenues, it does include our financial services revenues as well, and we\u2019re seeing very strong net gain performance there. And so there is probably a bit more contribution from that segment of our business into the consolidated revenue guide as well.\nMatthew Bouley: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Second one, I wanted to ask about the administration\u2019s first time buyer plan that was laid out the other day. It\u2019s obviously much more, I guess, surgically targeted than the broad plan that was initially presented. But do you have any insight into what portion of your buyers might qualify under this down payment plan as it was laid out? Thank you.\nJessica Hansen: I don\u2019t have a percentage to share with you, Matt. Honestly, we haven\u2019t spent a whole lot of time on that to date. I do think it\u2019s a narrower target than what was initially proposed. And so I don\u2019t know that we expect it to move the needle a whole lot. Honestly, the market strength today is extremely robust, and we don\u2019t really need anything to increase demand further or put more pressure on home prices, which is ultimately what more buyers, with a limited supply in the market, can drive. So we\u2019re going to continue to maintain our focus on affordability, and I\u2019m sure our mortgage company will be focused on what we need to do on that front. And we\u2019ll support those buyers as they come into our sales offices, if that is something they can take advantage of, but we don\u2019t expect that to be a big impact overall.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Understood. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Rehaut: Hi, thanks. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to drill down a little bit on the increase of closings guidance, which I think is really noteworthy given all the concerns around the supply chain and the well publicized limitations around different parts of the supply chain, et cetera, that we\u2019ve all heard about. Maybe you can kind of walk through if there are specific efforts that you\u2019ve kind of put into place that give you the better visibility for that in the back half? And certainly also the increase in closings is much higher than the beat that you had in the second quarter itself. So, I was hoping you could kind of talk to what\u2019s driving that increased guidance? If it\u2019s perhaps some improved efficiencies in the field? If it\u2019s better supply chain arrangements or with certain key providers of either lumber or on the labor side, we would love to hear a little bit more about what's driving that?\nMike Murray: Thank you, Michael. What\u2019s giving us confidence from the ability to raise our deliveries guidance has been the starts we\u2019ve been able to get out for the past two, three quarters, frankly, we\u2019ve had very strong home starts, and that\u2019s a result of our teams positioning their operating platforms to be able to have a sustained production cadence in a given neighborhood, in a given submarket. And that\u2019s allowed us to enhance our relationships with a lot of local subcontractors and labor providers in a given market. We're able to give them a consistent and plan full starts program that they can then plan their business back to. On the materials side, there certainly has been, what they\u2019ll call, a Whac-A-Mole game of trying to find the latest thing that we\u2019re out of with our purchasing scale and a lot of our national partners that we\u2019ve been working with, they\u2019ve been really good at helping us get product into homes that we need to close the homes. And those teams have deep relationships with multiple channels in their markets, able to get the components we need to complete the homes. So honestly, our build times have elongated a little bit here lately. It\u2019s not surprising, but we\u2019re very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made at holding the line and the confidence we have in our production process today to up our guidance for the year and deliver more homes into the strong demand we\u2019re seeing.\nMichael Rehaut: No, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for that. I guess, secondly, you continue to do very well, obviously, with the sales pace improvements year-over-year. At the same time, you kind of mentioned that you are managing that sales pace with the mind of your capacity on starts. I believe, obviously, your order growth came in a touch below our estimate, but obviously, still extremely strong and the need to make sure sales don\u2019t go too far out, I think, is well understood. How should we think about sales pace in the back half from current quarter levels? Is it something where we should expect more of a flattish type of year-over-year prospect, just given how the business is currently being managed? Or would you see, perhaps, some further upside potential if you are able to further improve your starts capacity?\nBill Wheat: Sure, Mike. Today, our starts pace and our production pace truly is leading our sales pace, and we\u2019re essentially selling based on that production schedule, as Mike mentioned a few minutes ago. Based on the visibility that we see right now, we think we can continue to expand our capacity and put ourselves in a great position to continue to grow our business into fiscal \u201822 at a double-digit pace. But that being said, the quarterly sales order pace, when you look at the sales order pace last year in Q3 and Q4, we had some very strong levels that are some very strong comps that we\u2019re up against in the back half of the year. So on our normal cadence and in positioning ourselves to grow double-digit next year, our sales order comparables year-over-year in Q3 and Q4 could be in the range of flattish, slightly up, slightly down, but that doesn\u2019t really change the positioning that we\u2019re going to be in, in terms of growing our top line and our bottom line in fiscal \u201821 and positioning ourselves for fiscal 2022.\nMichael Rehaut: Great. Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about lot count and how it ties to future community count. I think lot count was up, I think, 48% year-on-year. It\u2019s an enormous increase for a large company. Can you maybe talk about the cadence of how you expect your communities to grow over the next couple or three years based on that significant increase in lot?\nDavid Auld: I think we\u2019re looking at, what, low single digit community growth goal. I mean when you look at our lot count, a lot of that is option positions that are going to deliver over the next year or two years, and then last for two to three years beyond that. So at the pace these communities are running, we\u2019re looking for 600, 700 lot projects, which doesn\u2019t impact community count, but it does significantly increase lot count when it\u2019s replacing some that\u2019s half that size. So it\u2019s about scale, it\u2019s about driving consistent discipline starts. And demand right now is - it is really good. And so when Bill mentioned that our starts pace is driving our sales pace, I mean, that is the reality. If we could start more houses, we\u2019d be selling more houses. So every month with us, it\u2019s about driving production capability and expanding our start program. And if you look at week-to-week to week-to-week, it\u2019s how we manage it. Our operation - our operators out there are doing a great job.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks, David. And then just drilling down back to material cost increases and to tie them to the scale that you have, whether it\u2019s local scale or national scale. If you look at conditions now, David, do you see - can you maybe talk to some specific examples, even of the leverage you\u2019ve been able to get relative to peers on costs or the acquisition of materials if there are shortages? Because it seems to me that\u2019s a - that along with the spec models a pretty important aspect to why you\u2019re continuing to grow as fast as you are despite the size of the company? Thanks.\nDavid Auld: Carl, it\u2019s a consistent discipline start program that we\u2019ve been on and managing very effectively, communicating that to our trade base. And so if they have visibility what their work process load is going to be over the next 60, 90 days. And does scale matter? Absolutely, scale matters. And I feel like every month, every - really, every day, every week, every month, our competitive position, because of our scale, because of our discipline, has just grown. And it\u2019s - we talk about sustainable. It is a great market out there, and I feel like what we\u2019re doing is we have the ability to sustain.\nJessica Hansen: And Carl, in terms of material cost increases, although we have had to take some cost increases, as home prices have continued to rise and our building product partners have been experiencing cost increases in their business, we generally have price protection built in to where we have a cap on what our increase is going to be. So when you see a headline price increase for a product category, generally, what we\u2019re taking is less. It may just be protected in a form of a back-end rebate so we can protect the market price for our partners, but we are generally taking something much less than whatever the overall market increase is.\nCarl Reichardt: That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, guys. Thanks, everybody.\nDavid Auld: Thanks, Carl.\nJessica Hansen: Thanks, Carl.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Kim: Yeah. Thanks, guys. David, when you were talking about how the market was really good, I was thinking about all the people who are reading the transcript, who are not going to be able to capture - the transcript is not going to capture the emphasis there, it was a shame. I want to ask you guys about production capacity, putting community count growth aside, because everyone is very focused on that. I am focused on the potential for your absorption, you know, unit production per community to increase from here. One way is, obviously, through a mix of communities, bringing on larger communities. I think you referred to that a little bit. Or more entry level communities, which naturally have a higher level absorption. But I\u2019d also think you could increase production within each type of community, like each supervisor running a little more labor or paying overtime rates or whatever. So what I\u2019m wondering is, as you look at your absorption rates today, per community, how much room is there from here to increase either your mix of higher running communities, higher absorption communities? Or, and I should say, how much ability is there to increase your throughput within each type of community through - from here, given that your starts are up 34%, I think or so, this past quarter?\nDavid Auld: Stephen, I think there\u2019s always room to improve, and we\u2019re pushing that mentality out every day. Nothing is good enough. We got to get better. And at our operators and our culture and our company, they\u2019re all competing with each other. And so when you look at the numbers of our divisions, and you think the guy that\u2019s in the 10th or 11th slot, wants to be the number one slot, and so - but to do that, he\u2019s got to get bigger and he\u2019s got to get better. And that drives a very good result for our shareholders. And we talked about absorption as a global deal. It\u2019s really subdivision-by-subdivision, market-by-market. And our improvement in the platform and in the - what had been our smaller markets, scaling up to become big markets, has been nothing short of phenomenal. I mean, we've got great operators out there that, I think, have a lot of room to scale up, and they\u2019re positioned to do it and we\u2019ve got a market that has really derisked that effort. So I mean, I think our numbers are going to get better, Stephen. I think we\u2019ve got a lot of upside on what we\u2019re doing. And I didn't see the chart of how many markets we're number one in. But last quarter, I think it was 13. I mean, 13 out of 91. I mean, our expectation is we\u2019re going to be number one in every market. So we\u2019ve got a tremendous amount of opportunity to scale up.\nBill Wheat: We hate to put a goal or trying to define what the edge of the universe could be because we\u2019d hate to limit it ourselves. I think 5 years ago, if you look back and told us we\u2019d be doing these absorptions and production capabilities, we\u2019d have been limiting to what we would have said at that time. So as David said, no matter what we\u2019re able to get done, we know we can all do a little bit better and be a little smarter about how we do things.\nMike Murray: Yeah. And Stephen, obviously, in the current market with as strong as demand it is, it\u2019s a little different than we\u2019ve seen at other times in the past. It truly is. We can increase absorption if we can increase production capacity and capabilities. So our operators, our construction managers and everyone is looking for how can we continue to expand our starts pace each week, whether that\u2019s finding additional trades or helping our trades be more efficient, so they can do more homes in the same amount of time. So everybody is working to just get a little bit better.\nMike Murray: And we\u2019ve consistently been growing at a double-digit pace for several years with just a low single digit community count growth. So we would continue to point you to our lot count as a driver. If we have a finished lot, we\u2019re going to start a home ultimately, and we\u2019re going to sell and close it. And so, that\u2019s really more the driver than thinking about just a community count growth expectation.\nStephen Kim: Yeah. Absolutely. All right. Upward and onward. Second question relates to kind of affordability. You\u2019re probably getting a lot of questions about [Indiscernible] you know, prices are up so much. Isn\u2019t affordability being stretched? I was wondering if you could share with us whether you\u2019re seeing any signs of stress yet at the first time buyer? And then more sort of holistically, I think that prices that the homebuilders pass through inherently lags the resale market when prices are rising this fast because you all don't sell above asking price, right, whereas in the resale market, most homes are now selling above asking price. And so given the prices in the resale market are up, gosh, pretty close to 20% right now, isn\u2019t it right to think that your prices in your community should be able to rise further from here based simply on the pricing that has already been achieved in the resale market and which obviously, first time buyers are paying? So I mean I just want to - so one, can you - do you see any stress on the first time buyer market? And then two, do you agree with me that pricing for builders kind of lags a little bit inherently in this environment?\nJessica Hansen: Yeah. I think we would agree with the latter that pricing may lag a little bit, but we clearly are seeing the ability to continue to push price. Our first time homebuyer percentage is actually up year-over-year, 57% compared to 53% last year, and we actually saw it tick up to the high 60s for Express. And also an improvement in terms of our first time buyer percentage just in our D.R. Horton brand. Our FICO scores stayed extremely stable as have our debt-to-income levels. So it\u2019s showing us that the buyer and the consumer is healthy today. And there are still plenty of people out there that can afford to buy a house. That being said, it's something we recognize that could ultimately become an issue. We still have an average sales price that I think is, compared to most people, about $100,000 lower than most of the rest of the public builders. So that puts us in a very strong competitive position to continue to accommodate buyers who really are looking for affordable product offerings.\nStephen Kim: Excellent. Great. Thanks a lot guys. Good job.\nDavid Auld: Thank you.\nJessica Hansen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning. Just a follow-up on pricing. If it\u2019s possible to generalize, are you seeing price increases among competitors as being steeper than D.R. Horton communities? If so, is it possible to quantify how much \u2013 you know, whether that\u2019s 0.5 point or 1 point? Is that continuing to kind of drive your value proposition versus customers? Or do you think that the rate of increases is maybe more in line with some of your large competitors here?\nJessica Hansen: So there\u2019s a lot of variability, as I think David alluded to earlier, market-to-market, community-by-community. But even if you just listen to the other builder conference calls, which I have, generally, they\u2019re talking about higher price increases at a minimum on average versus an individual floor plan than we are in most cases. So I think we do believe that we\u2019re continuing to maintain that competitive advantage by not necessarily pushing price in some communities as much as others. In some communities, I\u2019m sure we're keeping pace with the market if the ability is there to do so.\nDavid Auld: I\u2019d disagree with Jessica. Our goal isn\u2019t to sell one house, it\u2019s to sell communities. And so we probably are not as aggressive as some of the other builders have been in raising prices. I mean, our margins are great, our returns are phenomenal, but we\u2019re in this for the long haul. And it's - we're not doing anything short term that we don\u2019t think is sustainable over time. So that\u2019s just who we are. We like being affordable. We like being the price point leader. We like competitive advantage. We think that drives more consistent, sustainable results over time, which is how we think about things.\nJessica Hansen: And our lot position and our production capabilities allow us to continue to do what we\u2019re doing from an affordable product offering perspective, whereas other builders don\u2019t have as deep of a lot position as we do in many markets. And they also can\u2019t start as many homes as we can today. So there\u2019s really no need for us to push price as much as some other builders are doing. As David said, our returns have been improving, I think, at or better than the industry as a whole, even while staying affordable.\nBill Wheat: We do take a long focus to all of this, and we do want to be sustainable and continue to grow our market share. We\u2019re committed to growing our market share. We\u2019re committed to returning capital to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases in a meaningful manner.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then apologies if I missed this, but did you see any impact either from a sales side or from a cost side, from the winter storm in February in Texas and other parts of the country? I mean, from the outside, it doesn\u2019t look like it, but I am just curious what the impact was to your business?\nBill Wheat: Yeah. I think there were some supply chain disruptions, some of the petrochemical plants on the Gulf Coast probably are creating some ripples. But by and large, our teams in the field did a phenomenal job of working through that, protecting the homes we had in production, as well as trying to make up the delivery days we may have lost to get those homeowners into their homes as quickly as possible.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.\nBill Wheat: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.\nAlan Ratner: Hey, guys. Good morning. And congrats on the great performance. I\u2019d love to dig a little bit deeper on the price and affordability conversation. And one of the things that really struck me was, it\u2019s pretty amazing. Your average price over the last five or so years has been remarkably consistent, kind of roughly around $300,000. And prices have been going up over the time period, but you guys have obviously been able to offset that through either growing the share of Express or maybe moving a little bit further out into the tertiary submarkets. And it seems like now that, that price is clearly breaking out of the range up to 330 [ph] And I guess the question for you is, how comfortable are you - or how high are you comfortable taking that number? When you think about the lots you\u2019re acquiring today, what those costs look like? What the material costs look like? What the consumer can afford? Is there a benchmark in mind, recognizing that $300,000 seems to have been kind of the unofficial benchmark over the last five years, where that price could go before you start to get a little bit uncomfortable?\nBill Wheat: Well, the $300,000 price was not the result of any top-down direct directed approach, it all happened at the subdivision level, the submarket level and the communities. And we can\u2019t make as good decisions from a centralized basis here, as our teams in the field make multiple times a day, every day of the week and responding to the market conditions, which includes what existing homes were selling for, other new home alternatives a buyer may have, as well as their cost inputs to that process. We work closely with our mortgage partners in the field to understand what the buyers are coming in with in terms of a loan qualification process and have their underwriting, and all of that factors in on a daily and a weekly basis in determining what the home is worth and can trade for at that point in time. So what we're seeing as a result of individual decisions made by people that are very experienced in the field, very close to the customers. And we\u2019re selling homes, we\u2019re delivering homes, we\u2019re originating and delivering mortgages to well qualified buyers today. So yes - and then that we\u2019re seeing the upside of that is that our aggregate average sales price has increased substantially, both in the deliveries for the quarter and in the new sales for the quarter. But it\u2019s the result of what's actually happening in the marketplace, we have so many model homes and touch points in market and communities, we\u2019re just seeing the result of that rolling up. So you\u2019re seeing a strong consumer, as Jessica mentioned before, that really wants to have a home.\nAlan Ratner: Understood. Got you. And then kind of related on that point because you brought up the feedback from the field, one thing that we hear a lot from builders lately is their share of buyers coming from out of state has really increased pretty dramatically since before the pandemic. I think some analysis we\u2019ve done, that share is roughly doubled from builders we talked to. So I\u2019m curious, A, if you\u2019ve looked at that or quantified the share of your business that buyers are buying from out of state versus where that was pre-COVID? And I guess on the flip side to that, if that were to slow at all, does that put any pressure on affordability, recognizing a lot of people are moving from higher tax state, higher cost states to more affordable markets?\nMike Murray: We don\u2019t have anything that we\u2019ve aggregated to track that. Anecdotally, we\u2019ve heard, in my travels, David\u2019s travels, we\u2019ve heard about people relocating into the market. But we also have - when I talk to agents in the models, where your buyers coming from? They are coming from a ZIP code over or a school district over, and they\u2019re looking to get a slightly different home at a different stage in their life or their first home, they\u2019re coming out an apartment in that market. So I hear what you\u2019re saying, Alan, and I understand what a lot of the national numbers have been. We have not necessarily tracked it to give you a quantitative answer here.\nJessica Hansen: And Texas and Florida continue to be our two largest states, and where I think you\u2019ve seen a lot of in migration and relocation, but that was happening before COVID.\nMike Murray: Right.\nJessica Hansen: So I\u2019m not sure that, you know, as a result of the pandemic easing and whatever changes from a work-from-home perspective, that, that really does anything to slow that down because we really think about that trend as haven\u2019t been pre-pandemic and those being very friendly states that generally have more affordable housing, where people have wanted to live and where a lot of businesses have relocated to so their employees can have a good cost of living and find a good quality home at the right price.\nDavid Auld: And Alan, I\u2019d say the builders that are positioned higher in the price scale, probably experienced more of that than we do. I mean ours \u2013 we\u2019re selling to people forming housing - housing formations. And I do think that a lot of that is just local market buyers, which maybe insulates us somewhat from the people moving back and forth.\nAlan Ratner: Got it. That makes sense. All right, guys. Thanks a lot. Good luck.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Alan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Dahl: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate all the color. So far the pricing commentary, in particular on a relative basis, tracks with what we\u2019ve been seeing in our work. But I guess the important thing is it\u2019s still very healthy price increases as you\u2019ve alluded to. The question is really about implications for margins. Unless I missed it, you only gave 3Q. But conceptually, when we think about fiscal 4Q or even beyond that, when you look at maybe cost increases continuing to accelerate, but your price increase picking up and some of that flowing through to the P&L more. Would you expect 4Q to be at least similar to 3Q? Would you expect it to be higher? Any other moving pieces we should be thinking about call it two quarters or further out?\nJessica Hansen: Sure, Mike. We really only have the best visibility to wonder out, which is why we\u2019ve stuck to guidance for just Q3 specifically. But clearly, market conditions remained very strong. And we\u2019ve been very pleased with our operators. As you\u2019ve heard us say, every quarter, for several quarters, our gross margins have exceeded our expectations because they\u2019ve done such a great job controlling costs. And we have been able to pushed through some price to offset some of that costs as well. I think our base case would be if market conditions remain this strong, we\u2019re hopeful that we get enough price to offset any cost increases. And is there potential upside due to continued market strength? Sure. But it\u2019s not something we can sit here and say today about our fourth quarter margins or anything further out, it\u2019s going to continue to be dependent on market strength, affordability and our ability to push through price.\nMike Dahl: Okay. Got it. Thanks, Jessica. That's helpful. And then my second question is also still affordability related. Just with the rapid level of increases, I guess, both in existing home market and new home market really across price points. Are you seeing anything from an appraisal standpoint where you are starting to see appraisals lag behind the price increases that have been implemented? Just any color from the field on that?\nBill Wheat: Sure. You, typically, will see in a rising price environment like we\u2019re in today, that the appraisals are often backwards looking. And it does tend to us to dampen maybe where it would go. But what you are seeing in our closed loans are homes that have been fully underwritten and appraised meeting appraisal valuations. And so we do hear about it anecdotally. There is oftentimes more education you can provide in that process and more information you can make available that can help with the appraisal process, but it\u2019s not been a significant impediment to the prices that we\u2019re contracting for homes are closing at those prices generally.\nMike Dahl: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nTruman Patterson: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I just wanted to talk a little bit more on the cost increases, especially lumber. Lumber is just really starting to spike here over the past month or so. And I appreciate that, literally, every day, the futures are a moving target. But could you give us a big picture macro overview? Do you think that there\u2019s any relief in sight going forward? Any new sawmills opening? There is a lot of robust demand or do you think this level of lumber pricing is kind of here to stay? And with that I wanted to follow up on Mike Dahl's question. Do you think there\u2019s enough pricing in the industry to really offset this lumber inflation especially that will probably hit kind of calendar 4Q?\nDavid Auld: You know, is the lower pricing here to stay? I think a lot of it was driven by mills shutting down during COVID. I do think as they reopen these mills and increase the capacity to deliver wood, you\u2019re going to see some improvement, some - a little less pressure on it. I think opening up international trade may relieve some pressure on it. But right now, to date, the demand is so strong. A lot of people, over the last so many years, deferred buying a house. Now the house has been formed [ph] and the kids are coming, and COVID showed that you know, living in an apartment down, metropolitan area may not be the lifestyle you want, so a lot of factors driving demand. I don't know if I answered your question, but it's complicated.\nJessica Hansen: We continue to have a focus on efficiency. And regardless of what\u2019s going on in the cost environment, we\u2019re trying to become more efficient every day, and we want to be able to put an affordable house on the ground regardless of our input costs. And I think we've proven that our operators and our scale are allowing us to do that kind of regardless of lumber fluctuations here over the last couple of years. And we\u2019ll see where it's headed. But we adjust to that as necessary and do the best we can to manage those lumber costs as they come through.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Thank you. And then another one, just on affordability and pricing, I mean, very robust pricing so far this year, especially on a year-over-year basis. And I know a lot of entry level builders really try to stay below the FHA loan limits within the specific metro. But could you just generally talk about how much wiggle room you have to possibly push pricing going forward before really bumping up against those loan limits appreciating that you\u2019re probably attempting to continue to switch to a smaller square footage?\nMike Murray: Yeah, I think Truman that we\u2019re continually looking to make sure we\u2019re affordable to the markets that we serve on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis. And we\u2019re seeing that today that we\u2019re not getting any resistance to the pricing that\u2019s coming through. You can just see that by the level of specs that we have. I think 26% of our homes in inventory are unsold today, and probably most of those are fairly recently started. It may not even have been released for sale yet, as we\u2019re working our way through the production process. But as we see sign off softening demand would be an increase in our completed specs. And right now, those are down, I think, about 700 homes that are completed and unsold today, which is, you know, we probably haven\u2019t been that low since 1992, the time we become public.\nDavid Auld: That's usually the number at Dallas.\nMike Murray: Yeah, usually, in a given market, we may have that many, by intention. And so we are - we see very strong demand, and we\u2019re not seeing any resistance yet on the affordability side. Because as we\u2019ve talked about before, we do try to position ourselves as an affordable value choice against the competitive set we have in any even neighborhood versus other new homes and the compelling buy against existing homes.\nTruman Patterson: Asked another way, are you all comfortable going above the FHA loan limits today, just given how strong demand is?\nDavid Auld: In some markets, we are. It just adds a risk level to the underwriting\u2026\nTruman Patterson: Okay.\nDavid Auld: That's one of the things we look at on every project we put under contract. It\u2019s how that stacks against FHA. And if it\u2019s over FHA, it adds to the risks. But are we comfortable doing it? Yes. It depends \u2013 it\u2019s all project-driven, market-driven.\nTruman Patterson: All right. Thank you. Good luck on the upcoming quarter.\nDavid Auld: Thank you.\nBill Wheat: Thank you, Truman.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question today comes from the line of Jay McCanless with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nJay McCanless: Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. First question I had, you talked about cycle times moving up a little bit. Could you talk about where they are now versus last year?\nMike Murray: They\u2019re probably about two to three weeks longer on the build process. What we have seen though, on the flip side of that, is historically with our spec production model, that we would have a period of time from when the home is completed until it\u2019s finally closed - it's sold and closed. With the sales and deliveries we\u2019ve had of our completed unsold homes over the past year, our time from completion of the home to deliver to the customer has greatly shortened. And so we\u2019ve maintained a lot of capital efficiency and great inventory turns in that process. But we have seen an elongation of our build times.\nJay McCanless: Okay. Got it. And then the other question I had, when you think about the getting more starts out there, getting the land entitled, I mean, is the pinch point right now on the labor side that you don\u2019t have enough people to pour foundations, et cetera? Or are you still having to deal with some headwinds on the municipal side to get the lots entitled, et cetera? What\u2019s - I guess what\u2019s the bigger issue right now on a national basis?\nMike Murray: I don\u2019t know that you could point to any one issue. It\u2019s all a challenge in the execution of the business, and that\u2019s what we do. That\u2019s what our job is, is to get out there every day, identify sites that are going to make great neighborhoods, work with local municipalities and land sellers, third party developers to get the entitlements in place. Generally, anecdotally, it takes longer than it used to. And people, in some markets will complain, and then you\u2019ll share a story about a market, maybe one of the coastal markets and how many years it takes to get through something, and then they\u2019re like, wow, this is pretty good here. And then in terms of production capability, we have focused on expanding our production capability through a sustained disciplined starts program that lets us share that information with our subcontractor partners that they\u2019re able to be plan full in their business and allocate the resources to it. They really appreciate working with us and that it\u2019s they can be - they know what\u2019s coming at them and what the expectations are. And so simplifying our product, simplifying our starts processes has been a big win for us in grabbing more production capacity in the markets and then hanging on to it by keeping the lots coming, so we can keep starting the houses.\nJay McCanless: Sounds great. Thanks again for taking my questions and congrats on a great quarter.\nJessica Hansen: Thanks, Jay.\nMike Murray: Thanks, Jay.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I\u2019ll turn the floor back to Mr. Auld for final comments.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Melissa. We appreciate everybody\u2019s time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our third quarter results in July. And to the D.R. Horton family, Don Horton and the entire executive team, thank you for your continued focus and hard work. And I\u2019m going to remind you again, stay humble, stay hungry and stay - and let's close out this year in an unbelievable fashion. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 95% to $2.53 per diluted share compared to $1.30 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 93% to $930 million compared to $483 million. Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 41% to $6.2 billion on 19,701 homes closed, up from $4.4 billion on 14,539 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was up 4% from the prior year at $313,200 and the average size of our homes closed was down 2%, reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill? We have increased our housing inventory in response to the strength of demand. We started 23,700 homes this quarter, up 33% from the second quarter last year and ended the quarter with 46,100 homes in inventory, up 38% from a year ago. 12,200 of our total homes at March 31 were unsold, of which 700 were completed. We also had 1,900 model homes at the end of the quarter. At March 31, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 487,000 lots, of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. 26% of our total owned finished lots - owned lots are finished and at least 45% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our growing and capital efficient lot portfolio is key to our strong competitive position, allowing us to increase our production volume to meet homebuyer demand. David? At March 31st, our multifamily rental operations had eight projects under active construction and an additional four projects that are completed and in the lease-up phase. Based on our pace of leasing activity, we expect to sell two of these projects during the second half of fiscal 2021. Our multifamily rental assets totaled $394.4 million at March 31st. As we've mentioned, we are now constructing and leasing homes within single-family rental communities. After these rental communities are constructed and achieved a stabilized level of leased occupancy, each community is expected to be marketed for sale. Our single-family rental operations are currently reported in our homebuilding segment. There were no sales of single-family rental communities during the second quarter. However, we still expect one more sale later this fiscal year. At March 31st, our homebuilding fixed assets included $182.6 million of assets related to our single-family rental platform, representing 27 communities, up from 13 communities in the first quarter. We now expect our total investments in our single and multifamily rental platforms will increase between $400 million and $500 million from the beginning to the end of fiscal 2021. Bill? Thank you, Michael. What's giving us confidence from the ability to raise our deliveries guidance has been the starts we've been able to get out for the past two, three quarters, frankly, we've had very strong home starts, and that's a result of our teams positioning their operating platforms to be able to have a sustained production cadence in a given neighborhood, in a given submarket. And that's allowed us to enhance our relationships with a lot of local subcontractors and labor providers in a given market. We're able to give them a consistent and plan full starts program that they can then plan their business back to. On the materials side, there certainly has been, what they'll call, a Whac-A-Mole game of trying to find the latest thing that we're out of with our purchasing scale and a lot of our national partners that we've been working with, they've been really good at helping us get product into homes that we need to close the homes. And those teams have deep relationships with multiple channels in their markets, able to get the components we need to complete the homes. So honestly, our build times have elongated a little bit here lately. It's not surprising, but we're very pleased with the progress we've made at holding the line and the confidence we have in our production process today to up our guidance for the year and deliver more homes into the strong demand we're seeing. Yeah. And Stephen, obviously, in the current market with as strong as demand it is, it's a little different than we've seen at other times in the past. It truly is. We can increase absorption if we can increase production capacity and capabilities. So our operators, our construction managers and everyone is looking for how can we continue to expand our starts pace each week, whether that's finding additional trades or helping our trades be more efficient, so they can do more homes in the same amount of time. So everybody is working to just get a little bit better. And we've consistently been growing at a double-digit pace for several years with just a low single digit community count growth. So we would continue to point you to our lot count as a driver. If we have a finished lot, we're going to start a home ultimately, and we're going to sell and close it. And so, that's really more the driver than thinking about just a community count growth expectation. We don't have anything that we've aggregated to track that. Anecdotally, we've heard, in my travels, David's travels, we've heard about people relocating into the market. But we also have - when I talk to agents in the models, where your buyers coming from? They are coming from a ZIP code over or a school district over, and they're looking to get a slightly different home at a different stage in their life or their first home, they're coming out an apartment in that market. So I hear what you're saying, Alan, and I understand what a lot of the national numbers have been. We have not necessarily tracked it to give you a quantitative answer here. Right. Yeah, I think Truman that we're continually looking to make sure we're affordable to the markets that we serve on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis.

            "name": "David Auld",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica. And good morning. I'm pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered a strong second quarter, highlighted by 95% increase in earnings to $2.53 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 90% on a 43% increase in revenues to $6.4 billion, and our pre-tax profit margin, improved 450 basis points to 18.3%. Our net sales orders for the quarter, increased 35% to 27,059 homes, and our homes in the inventory increased 38% to 46,100. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12-months ended March 31 was 31.2%, and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 27.1%. These results reflect our experienced teams and expanding production capabilities, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Housing market conditions remain very robust, and we are focused on maximizing returns and capital efficiency in each of our communities while increasing D.R. Horton's market share. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity, and low leverage positions us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace, and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments. Mike? Our second quarter homebuilding investments, and lots, land development totaled $1.7 billion, of which $980 million was for finished lots, $440 million was for land development and $290 million was to acquire land. $270 million of our lot purchases in the second quarter were from Forestar. Bill? In closing, our results reflect our experienced teams and expanding production capabilities, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to capitalize on today's robust market and to effectively operate in changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts continue to be remarkable. We are incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. John, I'd say we're always going to try to get better and continuing to push the auction as a percentage of total. We consider that a better utilization cap. So if we're at 75% now, over time, we would expect to turn that into 80%, and we'll get to 80% over time. If different market conditions, it could grow beyond that. So it's - it's just \u2013 you know, like every time we do, we talk about sustainable, scalable, and that follows right on track. We believe that auctioning lots is - will drive better cash flow, better returns to our shareholders, and as our builders on our platforms out there execute that strategy, relationships grow stronger, and it's just a - there's a momentum that I think will continue. Yeah. John, we've seen on a very limited basis some erratic behavior on the land front, where a builder has positioned themselves where they just don't have adequate or even non-adequate supply of lots, they are buying out of desperation. But it hasn't been consistent across all the markets and even within markets where I have seen it, it's not impactful to the overall land valuation. You know, our entire process through this cycle has been to auction lots, take longer positions where we control pricing through this market, and I think we said it on every call, we are incredibly well-positioned on our lot supply. And if somebody is being erratic, then we will \u2013 they're going to be in a very difficult position to compete if they're accelerating - if they're overbidding land price, because we are \u2013 we're pretty efficient in delivering houses, and our land pipeline is long and deep and very well priced. I think we're looking at, what, low single digit community growth goal. I mean when you look at our lot count, a lot of that is option positions that are going to deliver over the next year or two years, and then last for two to three years beyond that. So at the pace these communities are running, we're looking for 600, 700 lot projects, which doesn't impact community count, but it does significantly increase lot count when it's replacing some that's half that size. So it's about scale, it's about driving consistent discipline starts. And demand right now is - it is really good. And so when Bill mentioned that our starts pace is driving our sales pace, I mean, that is the reality. If we could start more houses, we'd be selling more houses. So every month with us, it's about driving production capability and expanding our start program. And if you look at week-to-week to week-to-week, it's how we manage it. Our operation - our operators out there are doing a great job. Carl, it's a consistent discipline start program that we've been on and managing very effectively, communicating that to our trade base. And so if they have visibility what their work process load is going to be over the next 60, 90 days. And does scale matter? Absolutely, scale matters. And I feel like every month, every - really, every day, every week, every month, our competitive position, because of our scale, because of our discipline, has just grown. And it's - we talk about sustainable. It is a great market out there, and I feel like what we're doing is we have the ability to sustain. Thanks, Carl. Stephen, I think there's always room to improve, and we're pushing that mentality out every day. Nothing is good enough. We got to get better. And at our operators and our culture and our company, they're all competing with each other. And so when you look at the numbers of our divisions, and you think the guy that's in the 10th or 11th slot, wants to be the number one slot, and so - but to do that, he's got to get bigger and he's got to get better. And that drives a very good result for our shareholders. And we talked about absorption as a global deal. It's really subdivision-by-subdivision, market-by-market. And our improvement in the platform and in the - what had been our smaller markets, scaling up to become big markets, has been nothing short of phenomenal. I mean, we've got great operators out there that, I think, have a lot of room to scale up, and they're positioned to do it and we've got a market that has really derisked that effort. So I mean, I think our numbers are going to get better, Stephen. I think we've got a lot of upside on what we're doing. And I didn't see the chart of how many markets we're number one in. But last quarter, I think it was 13. I mean, 13 out of 91. I mean, our expectation is we're going to be number one in every market. So we've got a tremendous amount of opportunity to scale up. Thank you. I'd disagree with Jessica. Our goal isn't to sell one house, it's to sell communities. And so we probably are not as aggressive as some of the other builders have been in raising prices. I mean, our margins are great, our returns are phenomenal, but we're in this for the long haul. And it's - we're not doing anything short term that we don't think is sustainable over time. So that's just who we are. We like being affordable. We like being the price point leader. We like competitive advantage. We think that drives more consistent, sustainable results over time, which is how we think about things. And Alan, I'd say the builders that are positioned higher in the price scale, probably experienced more of that than we do. I mean ours \u2013 we're selling to people forming housing - housing formations. And I do think that a lot of that is just local market buyers, which maybe insulates us somewhat from the people moving back and forth. Thank you, Alan. You know, is the lower pricing here to stay? I think a lot of it was driven by mills shutting down during COVID. I do think as they reopen these mills and increase the capacity to deliver wood, you're going to see some improvement, some - a little less pressure on it. I think opening up international trade may relieve some pressure on it. But right now, to date, the demand is so strong. A lot of people, over the last so many years, deferred buying a house. Now the house has been formed [ph] and the kids are coming, and COVID showed that you know, living in an apartment down, metropolitan area may not be the lifestyle you want, so a lot of factors driving demand. I don't know if I answered your question, but it's complicated. That's usually the number at Dallas. In some markets, we are. It just adds a risk level to the underwriting... That's one of the things we look at on every project we put under contract. It's how that stacks against FHA. And if it's over FHA, it adds to the risks. But are we comfortable doing it? Yes. It depends \u2013 it's all project-driven, market-driven. Thank you. Thank you, Melissa. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our third quarter results in July. And to the D.R. Horton family, Don Horton and the entire executive team, thank you for your continued focus and hard work. And I'm going to remind you again, stay humble, stay hungry and stay - and let's close out this year in an unbelievable fashion. Thank you."

            "content": "Net sales orders in the second quarter increased 35% to 27,059 homes, and the value of those orders was $8.8 billion, up 47% from $6 billion in the prior year. We sold over 14,200 more homes in the first half of fiscal 2021 than the same period last year, supporting further gains in market share and scale. Our average number of active selling communities increased 4% from the prior year quarter and was flat sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the second quarter was $327,000, up 9% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the second quarter was 15%, down from 19% in the prior year quarter. Our local teams are managing the sales order pace in each of their communities, based on their lot position, number of homes in inventory, and pace of home starts and production. Their increasing sales prices were supported by the market, while remaining focused on providing homes at affordable prices. We are pleased with our sales pace to date in April and remain well-positioned in this strong market with our affordable product offerings, lot supply, and housing inventories. Jessica? In the second quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.6%, down 70 basis points from 8.3% in the prior year quarter. The improvement in our SG&A ratio this quarter was better than our expectations and was due to our higher-than-expected volume of homes closed and the increase in our average selling price. Our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is at its lowest point in the March quarter in our history, and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure appropriately supports our business. Mike? Forestar, our majority-owned subsidiary, is a publicly traded residential lot manufacturer, operating in 54 markets across 22 states. Our strategic relationship with Forestar, as a well capitalized lot supplier across much of our operating footprint, is serving us well and is presenting opportunities for both companies to gain market share. Forestar is delivering on its high growth expectations, and now expects to grow its lot deliveries by 40% to 45% in fiscal 2021 to a range of 14,500 to 15,000 lots, with a pre-tax profit margin of 10% to 10.5%. At March 31st, Forestar's lot position increased 62% from a year ago to 84,500 lots, of which 58,700 are owned and 25,800 are controlled through purchase contracts. 63% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under our Master Supply Agreement. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had approximately $500 million of liquidity at quarter end, which included $170 million of unrestricted cash and $330 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. At March 31st, Forestar's net debt-to-capital ratio was 34.1%. Forestar has been active in the public capital markets recently, issuing common stock through its at the market equity offering program, issuing new senior unsecured notes, calling for redemption of some of its higher coupon senior notes and extending the maturity and increasing the capacity of its revolving credit facility. With low leverage, strong liquidity, capital markets access and its relationship with D.R. Horton, Forestar is in a great position to continue to grow their profitable business. Jessica? Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. During the six months ended March, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $138 million compared to $52 million in the prior year period. $215 million of cash provided by our homebuilding operations was due to a deferral of estimated tax payments granted by the IRS as a result of the Texas winter storm this year, and the cash flow impact of this item will reverse in our third quarter. At March 31st, we had $3.7 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.9 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.8 billion of available capacity on our revolving credit facilities. We plan to continue maintaining higher homebuilding cash balances and liquidity than in prior years to support the increased scale and activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 16.8% at the end of March, with $2.5 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding and no senior note maturities in the next 12 months. At March 31st, our stockholder's equity was $13 billion and book value per share was $35.96, up 25% from a year ago. For the trailing 12-months ended March, our return on equity was 27.1% compared to 19.1% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $72.7 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in May. We repurchased 4.5 million shares of common stock for $350.4 million during the quarter, and the remaining outstanding share repurchase authorization at March 31st was $115.1 million. This week, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase authorization replacing the company's previous authorization. The new authorization has no expiration date. We are committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis, and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year. Jessica? And then John, with respect to share repurchases, I would use the word sustainable as well there. As we have progressed in our capital light strategy, as we've generated more cash flow, as we have gotten in position with our scale to reinvest in our business to support the scale that we believe that the market will bear today. And we've improved our balance sheet and our liquidity position. We are now in a position where I do think we have hit an inflection point where I think we can more definitively talk about consistently repurchasing shares and consistently reducing our share count over time. And so, we had a little bit of interruption with COVID last year in which we paused. We reinstated share repurchase last quarter and then this quarter, we've accelerated. And now with the new authorization, we are more definitively stating that we expect to consistently reduce our share count each year going forward, and that will be part of our balanced program. John, back to your other question about closing homes before they're ready. We've been in this business a long time and certainly have kind of learned a lesson that we don't want to close the home before its time. So we will wait until the home is ready, and the buyer is satisfied with the home to be in there. At the same time, buyers are very anxious to get in their homes. Build times have elongated a bit with supply chain disruptions and some of the labor availability. Our production process, our consistent cadence of starts helps us overcome a lot of that. Selling homes after we've started them in their production cycle gives us more assurance of a completion date, and we're able to better work with the buyers on matching that completion and closing date, align with what they need to move in for whatever situation they're coming from. So keeping that buyer happy through the process, and most importantly, that day, they move in their house, they're very happy with the completed D.R. Horton home that they've just purchased. Yeah. Thanks, Matt. With the sales price increases that we have seen in recent quarters, with the sales price increase we've seen in our net sales orders this quarter, we are anticipating a further increase in our closing average prices in Q3 and Q4 versus where we've been in the first two quarters. So there is some expectation and visibility to increase sales prices in that revenue guide. As well, our total consolidated revenues, it does include our financial services revenues as well, and we're seeing very strong net gain performance there. And so there is probably a bit more contribution from that segment of our business into the consolidated revenue guide as well. Sure, Mike. Today, our starts pace and our production pace truly is leading our sales pace, and we're essentially selling based on that production schedule, as Mike mentioned a few minutes ago. Based on the visibility that we see right now, we think we can continue to expand our capacity and put ourselves in a great position to continue to grow our business into fiscal \u201822 at a double-digit pace. But that being said, the quarterly sales order pace, when you look at the sales order pace last year in Q3 and Q4, we had some very strong levels that are some very strong comps that we're up against in the back half of the year. So on our normal cadence and in positioning ourselves to grow double-digit next year, our sales order comparables year-over-year in Q3 and Q4 could be in the range of flattish, slightly up, slightly down, but that doesn't really change the positioning that we're going to be in, in terms of growing our top line and our bottom line in fiscal \u201821 and positioning ourselves for fiscal 2022. We hate to put a goal or trying to define what the edge of the universe could be because we'd hate to limit it ourselves. I think 5 years ago, if you look back and told us we'd be doing these absorptions and production capabilities, we'd have been limiting to what we would have said at that time. So as David said, no matter what we're able to get done, we know we can all do a little bit better and be a little smarter about how we do things. We do take a long focus to all of this, and we do want to be sustainable and continue to grow our market share. We're committed to growing our market share. We're committed to returning capital to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases in a meaningful manner. Yeah. I think there were some supply chain disruptions, some of the petrochemical plants on the Gulf Coast probably are creating some ripples. But by and large, our teams in the field did a phenomenal job of working through that, protecting the homes we had in production, as well as trying to make up the delivery days we may have lost to get those homeowners into their homes as quickly as possible. Thank you. Well, the $300,000 price was not the result of any top-down direct directed approach, it all happened at the subdivision level, the submarket level and the communities. And we can't make as good decisions from a centralized basis here, as our teams in the field make multiple times a day, every day of the week and responding to the market conditions, which includes what existing homes were selling for, other new home alternatives a buyer may have, as well as their cost inputs to that process. We work closely with our mortgage partners in the field to understand what the buyers are coming in with in terms of a loan qualification process and have their underwriting, and all of that factors in on a daily and a weekly basis in determining what the home is worth and can trade for at that point in time. So what we're seeing as a result of individual decisions made by people that are very experienced in the field, very close to the customers. And we're selling homes, we're delivering homes, we're originating and delivering mortgages to well qualified buyers today. So yes - and then that we're seeing the upside of that is that our aggregate average sales price has increased substantially, both in the deliveries for the quarter and in the new sales for the quarter. But it's the result of what's actually happening in the marketplace, we have so many model homes and touch points in market and communities, we're just seeing the result of that rolling up. So you're seeing a strong consumer, as Jessica mentioned before, that really wants to have a home. Sure. You, typically, will see in a rising price environment like we're in today, that the appraisals are often backwards looking. And it does tend to us to dampen maybe where it would go. But what you are seeing in our closed loans are homes that have been fully underwritten and appraised meeting appraisal valuations. And so we do hear about it anecdotally. There is oftentimes more education you can provide in that process and more information you can make available that can help with the appraisal process, but it's not been a significant impediment to the prices that we're contracting for homes are closing at those prices generally. Thank you, Truman."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. And welcome to the First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton.\nJessica Hansen: Thank you, Christine, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Before we get started, today's call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q in the next day or two. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I'm pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding first quarter, which included a 98% increase in consolidated pretax income to over $1 billion, a 48% increase in revenues to $5.9 billion, and a 56% increase in net sales orders to 20,418. Our pretax profit margin for the quarter improved 440 basis points to 17.4%, while our earnings increased 84% to $2.14 per diluted share. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31 was 28%, and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 24.4%. These results reflect the strength of our homebuilding and financial services teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint, and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Housing market conditions remain very strong, and our teams are focused on maximizing returns and improving capital efficiency in each of our communities, while increasing our market share. However, we remain cautious regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic or other external factors may have on the economy and our operations in the future. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and experienced teams position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our home building operations and managing our product offering, incentives, home prices, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments. With 42,100 homes in inventory, an ample supply of lots and continued strong sales trends in January, we are well positioned for the spring selling season and the remainder of 2021. Mike?\nMike Murray: Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 84% to $2.14 per diluted share compared to $1.16 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 84% to $792 million compared to $431 million. Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 48% to $5.7 billion on 18,739 homes closed, up from $3.9 billion on 12,959 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was up 2% from the prior year at $304,100, and the average size of our homes closed was down 2%, reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Net sales orders in the first quarter increased 56% to 20,418 homes, and the value of those orders was $6.4 billion, up 62% from $3.9 billion in the prior year. We sold 7,292 more homes this quarter than the same quarter last year, supporting our plan to achieve further gains in market share and scale during fiscal 2021. Our average number of active selling communities increased 3% from the prior year quarter and was up 1% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the first quarter was $314,200, up 4% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 18%, down from 20% in the prior year quarter. We are pleased with our sales pace to date in January, and have seen the volume improvement we expect as we head into the spring selling season. We remain well positioned for increased demand with our affordable product offerings, lot supply and housing inventories. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the first quarter was 24.1%, up 140 basis points sequentially from the September quarter and up 310 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. The sequential increase in our gross margin from September to December exceeded our expectations and reflects the broad strength of the housing market across almost all of our markets. We continue to see very strong demand and a limited supply of homes, especially at affordable price points, and we still have pricing power and are currently using very few sales incentives. On a per square foot basis, our revenues were up 4% from the prior year quarter, while our stick-and-brick cost per square foot was down 1.5%, and our lot cost per square foot was up 4%. Sequentially, our revenues were flat on a per square foot basis, while our stick-and-brick cost per square foot decreased 1.5%, and our lot cost decreased 1.5%. Although, we didn't see the impact of rising costs in our December quarter, we do expect both our construction and lot costs will increase on a per square foot basis in our homes closed next quarter. With the strength of today's market conditions, we expect to offset these cost pressures with price increases and currently expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter. We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the return on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. Bill?\nBill Wheat: In the first quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.9%, down 130 basis points from 9.2% in the prior year quarter. The improvement in our SG&A ratio this quarter was better than our expectations and was due to strong leverage driven by our higher-than-expected volume of homes closed and the increase in our average selling price. Our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is at its lowest point for our first quarter in our history, and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure appropriately supports our business. Mike?\nMike Murray: We ended the first quarter with 42,100 homes in inventory. 16,300 of our total homes were unsold, of which 1,600 were completed. We also had 1,900 model homes at the end of the quarter. Due to our strong sales in the second half of fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our level of unsold and completed unsold homes is lower than in recent years. We have accelerated our pace of home starts across most of our communities in the past two quarters to ensure we maintain an adequate number of homes to meet demand. During the first quarter, we started 22,800 homes. We have made good progress increasing our homes in inventory, and we expect to increase them further in the second quarter as we enter the spring selling season. At December 31, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 441,000 lots, of which 28% were owned and 72% were controlled through purchase contracts. 30% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 47% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our growing and capital-efficient lot portfolio continues to provide us a strong competitive position, allowing us to start construction on more homes to meet homebuyer demand. David?\nDavid Auld: For first quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $1.95 billion, of which $1.13 billion was for finished lots, $490 million was for land development and $330 million was to acquire land, $290 million of our lot purchases in the first quarter were for Forestar. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Forestar, our majority owned subsidiary is a publicly traded residential lot manufacturer operating in 51 markets across 21 states. Our strategic relationship with Forestar has a well-capitalized lot supplier across much of our operating footprint is serving us well and is presenting opportunities for both companies to gain market share. Forestar is delivering on its high growth expectations and now expects to grow its lot deliveries by 30% to 35% in fiscal 2021 to a range of 13,500 to 14,000 lots. At December 31, Forestar's lot position increased 74% from a year ago to 77,500 lots, of which 52,300 are owned and 25,200 are controlled through purchase contracts. 67% of Forestar's owned lots are already under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under our Master Supply Agreement. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and has approximately $580 million of liquidity, which includes $240 million of unrestricted cash and $340 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. At December 31, Forestar's net debt-to-capital ratio was 31.8%. And their next senior note maturity is in 2024. With low leverage, ample liquidity and its relationship with D.R. Horton, Forestar is in a very strong position to grow their business and navigate through changing market conditions. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Financial services pretax income in the first quarter was $84.1 million, with a pretax profit margin of 44.9% compared to $30.5 million and 29.6% in the prior year quarter. Our mortgage company has continued selling the mortgages it originates at strong net gains. We began retaining servicing rights on a portion of our FHA and VA loan originations in the third quarter last year because of lower valuations offered by mortgage servicers due to the uncertainty of the impact of the CARES Act. Servicing values have since improved, and we sold a portion of our retained servicing rights during the first quarter. We expect to continue retaining some servicing rights prior to selling them to third parties, typically within six months of loan origination. For the quarter, 97% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 68% [ph] of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 50% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 719 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 90%. First time homebuyers represented 56% of the closing handled by our mortgage company, up from 50% in the prior year quarter. Mike?\nMike Murray: At December 31st, our multifamily rental operations had four projects under active construction and an additional four projects that are in the lease-up phase. These eight projects represent 2,325 multifamily units. Based on our pace of leasing activity, we currently expect to sell two projects during the second half of fiscal 2021. Our multifamily rental assets totaled $294.3 million at December 31st. And as we mentioned on our last call, we are constructing and leasing homes within single family rental communities. After these rental communities are constructed and achieve a stabilized level of leased occupancy, each community is expected to be marketed for sale. Our single-family rental operations are currently reported in our homebuilding segment. During the quarter ended December 31st, we completed our first sale of a single-family rental community, representing 124 homes for $31.8 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $14 million. We currently expect one more sale of a single-family rental community later this fiscal year. At December 31st, our homebuilding fixed assets included $106.6 million of assets related to our single-family rental platform, representing 13 communities totaling 890 single family rental homes and owned finished lots. We still expect our total investments in our single and multifamily rental platforms to more than double during fiscal 2021. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. During the three months ended December, our cash used in homebuilding operations was $269.2 million compared to $178.4 million in the prior year period. At December 31st, we had $3.9 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of $2.1 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.8 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facilities. We plan to continue maintaining higher homebuilding cash balances than in prior years to support the increased scale and activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. During the quarter, we issued $500 million of 1.4% senior notes due in 2027, and we repaid $400 million of 2.55% senior notes at their maturity. Our homebuilding leverage was 17.3% at the end of December with $2.5 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding and no senior note maturities in the next 12 months. At December 31st, our stockholders' equity was $12.5 billion and book value per share was $34.33, up 23% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months into December, our return on equity was 24.4% compared to 18.2% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $73 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in February. We repurchased one million shares of common stock for $69.8 million during the quarter and our remaining outstanding share repurchase authorization at December 31 was $466 million. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, based on today's market conditions, we expect to generate consolidated revenues of $6 billion to $6.2 billion and our homes closed to be in a range between 19,000 and 19,500 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter and our homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter to be approximately the same as the first quarter. We anticipate a financial services pretax profit margin in the second quarter of 40% to 45%, and we expect our income tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 23.5%. For the full fiscal year of 2021, we now expect consolidated revenues of $25.2 billion to $25.8 billion and to close between 80,000 and 82,000 homes. We expect to generate positive cash flow from our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2021. However, we are not providing specific guidance for our homebuilding cash flow this year, as we prioritize augmenting our housing and land and lot inventories to support higher demand. After reinvesting in our homebuilding business, our cash flow priorities include increasing our investment in both our multi and single-family rental platforms, maintaining our conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying a dividend and repurchasing shares to keep our outstanding share count flat year-over-year. David?\nDavid Auld: In closing, our results reflect the strength of our experienced operational teams, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions, and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts during this time have been remarkable. We are proud of your work ethic and your positive spirit as you continue safely helping our customers close on their much-anticipated new homes. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Happy New Year. I wanted to talk a little about your underlying costs. Thanks for the info on stick-and-brick and land. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the labor market, David? We're starting to hear a little more, a few builders starting to say things are easing, some others are telling us things are tougher. And oftentimes, you'd like to talk about specific trade specific markets. But I'm interested just broadly, what your expectations are for the labor shortage beginning to ease or tighten in 2021?\nDavid Auld: I don't see it being much different than it's been in 2020, at least not for us. We set up and try to drive our communities in the most efficient way, making it the easiest possible way we can for our trades to get in, get out, get their job done. We've actually, I think, through this cycle, have been focused on the labor side and have created a lot of efficiency and have expanded our trade base just by making it easier for them to get in, get out and what they're doing. 2021, our volume is ramping up. I think that's going to continue to be a challenge. But we feel very good, I mean, we wouldn't be selling houses if we couldn't build them, so.\nCarl Reichardt: Fair enough. And then I wanted to ask a little bit about the West region, which the growth is slower than the really significant growth you're seeing in other places, and inventory is down sequentially as well. In the meantime, South Central, you took more order dollars this quarter than you did last quarter. So I'm curious if you're thinking about shifting capital investment among the different regions as you look into 2021 and beyond. Is there a de-emphasis happening in the West? Or is it - this loan is just a function of being out of product and out of communities? Thanks.\nDavid Auld: The underwriting in the West is much more difficult, time lines are longer. So through this cycle, our community count has continued to slip down there. I will tell you, we have one of the best groups of people in the company in the West region. When we talk about platform, we talk about people, product price, and we are certainly - have a very strong platform out West. When the returns in Texas, Florida, Carolinas have been incredible, and everybody competes for capital in this company. So I will say the West is an area that I personally going to emphasize this year, and I think you'll see the growth return there.\nJessica Hansen: Carl, for reference, it will be posted after the call, but our West region community count was down 9% year-over-year and 10% sequentially, which compares to the company average, which was actually slightly up in both periods.\nCarl Reichardt: That will do it, Jessica. All right. Thanks so much everyone, congrats.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning, guys. And thank you for taking my questions as well. The first one, just on the NAHB had noted that builder respondents were growing more and more concerned with affordability and home price appreciation and also with rates sort of grinding higher. And maybe not specific to D.R. Horton, but for the industry, I mean, how are you guys thinking about this dynamic? And do you see any risk to industry-wide demand as the spring approaches here?\nMike Murray: John, this is Mike. Good morning. We're always focused on affordability that's something that's consistent across the platform. And I'm not as well versed to speak to the industry. But in our communities, we're focused on providing the value at whatever price point we're at. And so whether we have buyers moving up from their current housing situation to a D.R. Horton home or they are first-time homebuyer with 56% of our buyers in the quarter were first time homebuyers. We're focused on providing an affordable home for that buyer that fits in their monthly budget.\nJessica Hansen: We continue to see healthy credit metrics across that buyer group. Our FICO score was 719 this quarter. I think on our Express brand standalone, it was almost 710. And then as we also mentioned on the call, our average square footage has continued to tick down slightly on a year-over-year basis. And as home prices have risen, but what we typically see is first time buyers want to buy as much home as they can get for their money, and they're buying out of need, not a discretionary purchase. And so if home prices have risen, they just buy a little bit less house.\nJohn Lovallo: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And then, how are you guys thinking about the potential for increased environmental regulations under the Biden administration? And what this could mean for land development costs and time lines, things of that nature?\nMike Murray: Well, I don't think it's going to help affordability. And I believe it's going to extend time. We're well positioned with owning control over 400,000 lots. And again, we're going to focus on affordability. And as regulations increase, affordability is going to become more challenging. But given our position, our people, I think we're - we can meet that challenge.\nJohn Lovallo: Thanks very much, guys.\nJessica Hansen: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Kim: Hey, guys. Fun times. It's interesting the way sometimes the builders are trade, it makes it seem like people think you're just the beneficiary of good luck. But I'm reminded about that statement, you know, luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. And you guys have done a great job over the last couple of years preparing for this situation. And so I wanted to ask you about your comment, as to capital allocation. Because you indicated there that you are, wanting to carry higher cash levels than normal for the foreseeable future. I think you made reference to some uncertainty in the current environment. But arguably, homebuilding is always difficult to predict. And so I'm curious, what is a good rule of thumb for modeling your cash levels going forward and what are the kind of things that you're looking to fade or dissipate, in order to pave the way for you to hold lower cash levels than that?\nMike Murray: Sure. Good question, Steve. Just to get to the point in terms of expected levels, we would expect at each quarter end to maintain at least $1 billion of homebuilding cash, but would expect most quarters to see between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. I would say the primary driver behind that shift over the last year is we've been building a little bit more. It's just a significant increase in volume and scale and activity, which feel like it's prudent to ensure that we have sufficient cushion to manage significant sudden changes in the business to avoid having any potential liquidity crunches. That just gives us that much more flexibility to respond when we see opportunities in the market. And so we've seen a number of significant shifts in our business over the last few years from a sharp increase in interest rates, which decreased demand in late '18 to the pandemic disruption in the spring of 2020. To then the very significant increase in demand that we saw in the summer of 2020 and ever since. And so from that standpoint, having a bit more cushion, a bit more liquidity to respond, whichever direction we need to go in the business, we just feel like it's prudent. I don't see us changing that strategy. I think that just puts us in a very strong and flexible position to respond to market changes.\nStephen Kim: Okay. Yeah. Certainly sounds like we ought to be modeling that on a longer-term basis. Okay. Second question relates to the pretty awesome margins you all reported this quarter. And I think you just gave guidance as to that margin fairly recently. And so I think a lot of folks are just curious, as to what drove the upside in your margin this quarter? And paying note to the fact that your guidance for the March quarter suggests that it's more than just a temporary spike. I personally think you're still being conservative, but I'd love to hear what drove the upside surprise in this quarter?\nMike Murray: Well Steve, I'd say the first thing we expected to see this quarter that we did not as we've been seeing cost increases coming into our business over the last quarter or two, and we expected to see a bit more of that come through in our closings in Q1, which we did not. That's still coming. We can see it coming through our backlog, and we expect to see some of those cost increases start to hit our margins in the coming quarters. That being said, we still have a very strong environment, obviously with the ability to raise prices, very low incentive levels. And so, we do expect at this point now with that additional visibility of another quarter to be able to maintain the current margins that we're showing, which obviously are very strong levels.\nJessica Hansen: We've really had price projection on the prior cycle on the material front. And we've seen very neutral impact from materials other than a little bit of headwind from lumber last year. Lumber is starting to pick back up. So that's going into our commentary as well. But really, it's a function of home prices has risen significantly and building product companies have cost inflation as well. And so, we are experiencing some increases in material costs that we didn't see, as we said, flow through in the December quarter, but we do expect those to start flowing through in the rest of the year.\nDavid Auld: And I'll just add, our operational teams are doing a great job at controlling costs, where we see increases, we look for efficiencies to reduce cost. And I mean, to be honest, I think we were a little bit surprised a stick and brick per foot, actually it went down last quarter. That's just a phenomenal job by our people.\nStephen Kim: Absolutely, great. Thanks very much guys. And best of luck.\nDavid Auld: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. And thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask about the lot position of 441,000. I think you said it really suggests a material addition during the quarter. I guess, number one, could you speak at a higher level, just around what that signals around your view of the sustainability of housing demand? And number two, just the color around the lots you added during the quarter, kind of duration of those lots, lot inflation, any of that could actually impact 2021? Thank you.\nBill Wheat: Sure. And Matt, you'll notice that most of that addition to the lot position did come in the form of options lots. We continue to significantly increase our option lot position. We had noted on our last call that we do expect our own lot to increase modestly, and they did kind of get back to a normal level there. But we've been on an ongoing effort to expand our relationships with developers across the country. Of course, our relationship with Forestar continues to bear fruit as well. So, a significant portion of the additions to our lot position through options came from our third-party developers and our relationship with Forestar. And with the significant growth we've seen in demand and significant volume increases that we've seen, that we certainly want to make sure we stay in position to maintain. We probably have stepped up our efforts to ensure that we're keeping our pipeline sufficiently out in front of us with the volume we're seeing today.\nDavid Auld: The volume we see today, Matt, as well as looking forward to more medium term, we just don't see a lot of overbuilding, a lot of excess supply in the marketplace relative to household formation demand. And so we want to maintain, as Bill said, adequate support of inventory for that medium term land. So that's why you're seeing our controlled lot position increased.\nBill Wheat: And the fact that we're still heavy option does allow us to be a little more aggressive in tying things up. So it's, again, positioning for the future.\nDavid Auld: Very capital-efficient with the options.\nMatthew Bouley: Okay. Got it. That's very helpful color. Second one, I wanted to ask about ASPs. I think, Bill, you might have mentioned or I think you said the order ASPs of 314, I think the backlog ASP is right there as well. So I'm just curious, number one, like-for-like versus mix, if that's just perhaps Emerald [ph] getting a lot better. But then number two, if I look at the closings and revenue guidance for the year, it seems to suggest that the closing ASPs settled back down a little bit. I'm just wondering if you can reconcile that and just how to think about closing ASPs for the year. Thank you.\nBill Wheat: Yeah, sure. We always see a higher ASP in our backlog than we do in our sales and our closings because higher priced homes generally are bigger and take longer to work their way through. So that's not necessarily unusual. But yes, so with our sales ASP being at 314 in this quarter, that's definitely showing a continuation of some price appreciation. And so in the near term, we would expect, I think to probably still see some potential upside. That been said, our operators and our teams and our people are very focused on providing affordability. And so we're going to keep an eye on the price points and the payments that our buyers need to have to afford to move into our homes. And so we never plan for significant price appreciation beyond a quarter or two because we always know that at some point, we will make some adjustments in our operations to make sure we keep our price points affordable.\nJessica Hansen: And our ASP per square foot on a year-over-year basis was up 4%, but sequentially, it was actually flat.\nMatthew Bouley: Okay. Got it.\nBill Wheat: And so the guidance doesn't reflect all of our price. It doesn't reflect quite all of that price. It reflects that we would still continue to manage very closely on the affordability.\nMatthew Bouley: Okay. Thanks, everyone. And congrats, again.\nBill Wheat: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Bosshard: Good morning.\nJessica Hansen: Good morning.\nEric Bosshard: The increase - the increased delivery number for the year, curious what changed and where that changed and thinking a bit of geography and mix and also the production pace, but just sort of the things that changed that have resulted in you taken a little bit more optimistic on full year deliveries?\nMike Murray: I think we've seen consistently strong demand across our footprint, Eric. In addition, as we've gotten the starts up in the first quarter, we started almost 23,000 homes with good visibility to start for the next couple of quarters. And so that gives us more confidence in the number we can deliver for the full year. So just a little clear - a little more of a year coming into focus with what we're going to be able to accomplish.\nDavid Auld: We're also seeing a good start to the spring in January, which again, it's about confidence. And we don't want to put a number out there that we don't feel really good about. So we feel really good about that number.\nEric Bosshard: From a production pace and inventory pace, anything different that you're doing there or have done there to also allow you to get more homes produced?\nMike Murray: Anything different. It's - we talk about sustainability and growing the scale of our platform and doing it in a measured approach that allows us to hang on to those increases. So I wouldn't say, it's anything different. It's just further execution of the same strategy of growing our capacity for production, growing our market share market-by-market. And that's what our teams think about every day when they're getting up and going about their jobs is how I get a little better today and grab a little more production capacity in my marketplace.\nEric Bosshard: Great. Thank you.\nMike Murray: Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.\nAlan Ratner: Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on the great results. My first question, I was hoping to drill in a bit more on the land side, follow-up to Matt's question earlier. If I'm just kind of looking at the growth in your lot book and obviously account for all the closings you've had over the last year, it looks like over 40% of your current lot booked or lots controlled have actually been tied up over the last 12 months since the pandemic began. And I'm curious, we hear from a lot of builders. When we underwrite land, we assume today's absorptions, today's pricing. And obviously, the current environment makes that a little bit tricky, because your margins and your absorptions are at cycle highs. So I'm curious, as you look at the composition of the land you've tied up over the last 12 months, could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about underwriting to gross margin to return on inventory to absorption whatever metrics you guys think about internally? And how that compares to where you're generating business today?\nDavid Auld: Our underwriting really hasn't changed much as we've seen absorptions increase, it does - when we're requiring a two-year cash back at a 10 a month absorption, you can buy more lots than you can a five a month absorption. So we have seen the scale of the deals get a little bigger, but the position that from a pricing and location standpoint, I don't see that we've given up much in the deals we're doing today versus the deals we were doing two or three, four years ago. Scale is bigger. The phase sizes are bigger. Lot prices have been pretty stable. And I think I said this on the last call, when I'm traveling and looking at deals, the deals that we put on the books this quarter, we're better than most of the deals that we had on the books. So it's very - it gives me a lot of confidence, and our guys are doing a great job. So I don't see deterioration in our lot position from marketability or really even a pricing standpoint.\nAlan Ratner: Got it. That's helpful color. Second question on the closing guidance for the year, I just want to maybe get a little bit more commentary there. So if I look at your 2Q guide, your closings are going to be up just under 40% through the first half of the year. And for the full year guide, the midpoint, I think, is a 24% increase, which obviously is incredibly strong. But I'm just curious, what's driving that deceleration in the back half, because your backlog is going to be a very strong - strongly. So is this a function of conservatism around cycle times and just the backlog conversions might be a bit lower than years past because of how elevated the backlogs are? Or is there something else that's driving maybe that you sell in the back half?\nJessica Hansen: It's really the stage of construction our homes are in Alan. We have a lot fewer completed specs today than we typically have. And as a result, we're selling and closing fewer homes intra-quarter than we typically would. I think that quarter that was in the 20 - mid-20% range and typically it's in the high 30% or 40% range. So it's really just a function of the stage of our inventory. And we did get, as Mike said, almost 23,000 homes started this quarter, but a lot of those are still in the early stages of construction. And so a lot of the homes that we'll be starting here a little bit later in the year won't be available for this fiscal year, but they'll put us in a very good position to continue growth in fiscal 2022.\nMike Murray: And when you look, obviously, at the year-over-year increases, we started to see some very significant year-over-year increases in Q3. Last year, Q3 and Q4 were much more significant. So the year-over-year increases going forward are naturally not going to necessarily continue at the same pace they are right now. But we're still expecting a very strong year, very strong year-over-year increase for fiscal '21.\nAlan Ratner: Sure. Absolutely. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Good luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congrats on the results. First question, I kind of wanted to ask about the underwriting and the gross margins, maybe from another angle and apologies if maybe I'm beating a dead horse here. But with the gross margins at 24%, obviously, that's - you almost have a very good problem to deal with in kind of keeping those margins extensively to the extent possible at these levels, which are kind of rarefied air for you historically. You mentioned earlier that you haven't seen much appreciation in lot prices, lot prices are being pretty stable, and the deal flow is pretty attractive right now. But if home price appreciation were to moderate obviously, today, it's in a, let's call it, a high single-digit type of year-over-year dynamic on a same store basis. If that were to moderate more to like a low single-digit rate, given where you're underwriting the deals to today, should we expect that gross margin to come in a little bit over the next couple of years? Is that the right way to think about it? Or are there other factors that maybe we're not appreciating?\nJessica Hansen: We really have no insight to gross margin in the next few years. I mean, gross margin really is a function of the market, Mike. We're focused on underwritings to returns. And although we don't see it right now. Even if we did see a compression in our gross margins for whatever reason, affordability, interest rate, something that we don't foresee today as an issue, we can still generate very attractive returns on our current land, bank with the efficiencies that David's kind of already talked to in our business today and our ability to keep turning our houses. But we feel very comfortable with our current lot position that we are going to be able to offset costs going forward and hopefully hang in around this 24% range. But really further than a quarter out, we don't have a whole lot of visibility because we do turn our houses much more quickly, I think, than the industry by and large. And so we have the best early read on cost and gross margin in the market.\nBill Wheat: Can't emphasize enough that gross margin is not part of our underwriting hurdles, returns is our underwriting hurdle. And certainly, higher gross margins can generate higher returns. But we focus, first and foremost, on hitting returns, hitting our absorptions in each community. And then the market, sometimes will give you more margin than you may have underwritten.\nDavid Auld: If you look at our average sales price, we are significantly more affordable than most of our peers in the homebuilding space. And our land portfolio and our operating structures are designed and geared to drive that affordability. So are we - when I look at the competitive makeup out there, both of the resale market, which is really, today, our primary competitor at this price points? And our peers in the industry, it's - I mean, we feel very good about our current position and which allows us to underwrite and execute the positions that we believe will keep us in this range.\nMichael Rehaut: Right. No, I appreciate it. I guess, secondly, I just wanted to zero in on SG&A for a moment. The results were significantly better than what you were looking for, I think, by order of about 100 basis points, yet your closings were only modestly above guidance. So I was wondering, you had mentioned leverage off of the strong volume, but you really had instead of 40 basis points, you know, 140 basis points of year-over-year leverage. And additionally, you're expecting SG&A ratio to be flat sequentially versus historically, a little bit better. So just wondering if there was anything specific to the first quarter, and I apologize if I missed this earlier, that benefited this past quarter more on a one-time basis? Or what kind of drove that differential?\nBill Wheat: Michael, thank you. You touched on part of it. Deliveries were a little bit ahead of what we had guided to. In addition to ASP is a little higher, which drives a little more SG&A leverage. Something Jessica touched on before is the lower level of completed inventory, especially the completed specs that we're carrying the business today, able to operate the inventory portfolio very efficiently. And that requires less SG&A to maintain and care for those homes while they're sitting completed because we do run those costs through SG&A. So as we have less of those, we had around 5,000 a year ago. And today, we have about 1,600. So that's - that's an improvement and a tailwind as well.\nJessica Hansen: And although we guided to flat SG&A sequentially, on a year-over-year basis, it would actually be approximately 40 basis points of leverage, which is still a pretty nice move. And when we think about it on an annual basis, as our SG&A is already at record lows, we're not going to ever just be able to model and say that our SG&A is going to be down more than, say, that on an annual basis. Can we ultimately maybe get there if you continue see prices rising ASP plays a big role in that? Sure. But right now, we feel like leveraging our SG&A 40 basis points on a year-over-year basis is a really nice move.\nBill Wheat: But nothing onetime. Yes, there are some changing conditions and the volume and pricing has helped, but nothing onetime in the quarter.\nMichael Rehaut: Right. Thanks so much, guys.\nJessica Hansen: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nNishu Sood: Thank you. So first question I just wanted to ask was around demand trends. A lot of folks are wondering demand has been so strong. What's it going to look like when life returns to normal? I mean, clearly, we're far from being back to normal. But in your last quarter, obviously, vaccine news, there's some hope out there. Is there anything you can - you've seen in terms of the traffic? Or what folks are looking for, how it's evolving that give us any insights in to, how your home buyers are looking at things?\nDavid Auld: The demand out there, I think, is really driven by demographics. And I think it has been accelerated, because of the pandemic and people's desire to become - or to find a safe environment for their family. I really don't see that demand issue changing. I mean, it's - it accelerates. It's a long-term program, and it got accelerated. Now that's going to stay. So, I mean we are positioning. We are driving to take advantage of as much of that demand as we can. And it's - I mean, right now today, it's very good out there.\nJessica Hansen: A lot of our floor plans in issue actually already incorporated flex space. So depending on what a buyer is looking for today, whether it be a home office, a second home office, a learning space for their kids. Those types of things, we've already always had floor plans that can accommodate that. And we can continue to adjust our starts based on what those homebuyers are potentially looking for. And then the things that have always been true are as people start their families and have children, they generally want a backyard for their kids. They want good public schools, maybe a garage for their cars. Those things have kind of always been true that go along with the demographic side of the equation that David was talking to. So I would say other than the acceleration from the pandemic, and that's being positioned in the right places with a lot of different floor plans to choose from. No significant change on that front.\nBill Wheat: And still the strongest demand is at the most affordable price.\nJessica Hansen: Yeah.\nBill Wheat: And that's been a trend that we've been seeing for quite a while. Obviously, we're very well positioned to take advantage of that. The environment right now with low interest rates, that's accommodated for that as well and it's certainly a benefit for that demand as well, which for right now, we don't really see that changing much in the near term.\nNishu Sood: Got you, got you. Makes sense. So second question I wanted to ask was around your inventory levels. So demand has been so strong. Obviously, you folks have ramped up your starts considerably, but still remains - just looking at a metric like your inventory against your backlog just kind of sizing it, still remains behind where it would be normally. Are we in a market where demand is just so strong, it will be difficult to get back to your normal or targeted levels of inventory? Or do you see, as the year progresses here, there could be some progress on that, even if demand does remain, as strong as it has been?\nMike Murray: If demand remains at the exact level it is today, it would be very challenging for us to get back to a historical relationship between total inventory and backlog. Demand is that good. We look at our starts capacity, neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood, week-by-week. And we are increasing that capacity over time to make sure it's sustainable. And we're doing it well with our trade partners in mind. So - but while we're doing that, demand continues to expand, to absorb that additional capacity we're putting into the marketplaces today, at the price points we're serving.\nJessica Hansen: Really more focused and issue on homes conversion than backlog conversion. I mean, backlog is a function of what we're selling. And we're going to sell, so what's out there from a demand perspective and ultimately, we'll get the house started. We've got the lot positioned to do it unlike anyone else in the industry. We wouldn't be selling the houses if we didn't have the lots and feel comfortable about our cost structure and what kind of return we were going to generate on those houses. So we're really focused on the houses we have in inventory and how quickly we're turning those and rather than a backlog conversion metric, trying to improve our housing inventory turn. And generally, we turn that at least two times a year. Last year, we did a little bit better than that, this year now with our new guidance, we're reflecting better than two times as well.\nDavid Auld: And we talk to our operators all the time about being disciplined, focused and consistent and it starts in your communities. And that's how we're building capacity to deliver more homes by that execution at the community level.\nNishu Sood: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Pettinari: Hi, good morning. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about expected seasonality for the year. And given the buyer traffic patterns you've seen, does it lead you to believe you'll see kind of a traditional spring selling season or could demand maybe be more evenly distributed throughout the year? And I think we've heard from others that buyers are visiting homes maybe on what used to be off-peak days or off-peak hours. Is that something you've seen? Or can you just comment generally on any kind of changes you've seen in buyer behavior?\nMike Murray: Yeah. We've certainly seen very different seasonality throughout 2020. Stronger demand through the summer, fall, winter in 2020 than we've seen historically. So we're coming off of some unusually strong periods. But that being said, with what we've seen thus far in January, we're seeing increases in volume that we would expect to see. It remains to be seen whether we'll still see the same percentage relationships between our Q2 and Q1 that we've seen historically or not. But right now, we just see a very strong demand environment. Definitely some different patterns in buyer behavior than we've seen historically. But feeling good about what we can see going ahead. With a very strong Q1, where we see the same sort of patterns throughout the fiscal year, we historically have seen. I would expect there's probably be a bit of flattening of some of the historical patterns, but obviously, off to a very good start. And I think the way things are looking right now, we're optimistic about the spring.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's helpful. And then it seems like some of your peers are pushing price and slowing down sales pace given some production constraints. I'm wondering if you're seeing markets where price increases by competitors are maybe a bit steeper than yours and has that improved your value proposition for customers? Or maybe to ask the question another way, do you think your affordability edge is maybe stronger than it was 12 months ago with competitors raising prices? Or any kind of general comments on the pricing environment?\nMike Murray: If you just look at our average sales price increase over quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter compared to our competitors. And yes, I would say our competitive advantage has increased and improved. But again, it really comes down to the ability to deliver the homes. And I think that's where we've gained the largest competitive advantage with the discipline around what we're doing and the focus on efficiency over the last couple of years. So it's a - it doesn't do any good to sell a house at any price, you can't deliver it. So we're focused on the delivery side of it and expanding our capacity via becoming more and more efficient through our processes.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nJack Micenko: Hi. Good morning. We talked a lot about returns. We talked about underwriting, not really focusing on margin. And David, you sound pretty constructive on the land environment. I guess, my question would be thinking about Horton as this longer-term 60-40 option versus owned mix coming in at 72 this quarter. Is 72 the new 60? If the goalposts changed or is it really more of an interim function, that's where the markets kind of brought you in terms of availability of new acquisitions over the last couple of quarters?\nDavid Auld: Yeah, actually, 70s [ph] are new 60. We're going to continue to try to grind that number higher. Ultimately, it comes down to relationships and execution in the field. And that's something we focus on every day. So it's my expectation over time is that we will continue to drag a point here, a point there and drive better and better efficiency, capital efficiency through our business and to our company and ultimately, probably the industry.\nJack Micenko: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then looking at the single-family rental sale, it would appear that the gross margins on those 124 homes was pretty healthy, it may be in excess of the company margin. Am I looking at that the right way? Or is there something I'm missing? Obviously, you've got your G&A costs and everything below the line. But just from a purely a margin perspective, it looks like that was a really healthy margin on the sale of those units?\nMike Murray: Yeah, we're very pleased with that transaction. And we look forward to that continuing to explore that business. It seems to be attracting a lot of capital and a lot of interest today. And we expect to be to take advantage of that.\nJack Micenko: All right. Thanks for taking my questions.\nMike Murray: Thank you, Jack.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nSusan Maklari: Thank you. And congratulations on the results. My first question is just - I wondered if you could perhaps quantify a bit more of the comments around January. Just perhaps framing the magnitude of what you're seeing either sequentially or on a year-over-year basis for us?\nMike Murray: You know, Su three weeks in, we rarely comment on a single month, much less just a few weeks. So - but suffice it to say, what we generally expect when we get into January, is we expect there to be a step-up in traffic and volume coming through our weekly sales pace. And so we have seen that. We've seen three weeks of weekly sales thus far, and there has been that discernible step-up in volume in January versus what we had seen in the December quarter. So we're encouraged by that.\nDavid Auld: Several years ago, we would - the spring selling season to kick in with Super Bowl effectively at the end of January, early February. The past several years, this year being no exception, we've seen that sales pace accelerate coming out of the holidays after January 1.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And my next question is around what you're seeing in terms of some of the suppliers. We've obviously heard that with the ramp in volumes and some of the supply chain issues that those companies are seeing in their own businesses, that there's been some constraints maybe especially in some areas like appliances and windows. Can you just talk to what you're seeing there? And I guess, maybe in some areas, is there anything that you've heard more recently around the issue with some of the semiconductor supplies and some of the issues that they're seeing in those industries?\nJessica Hansen: So really, various products are in short supply, Su. It kind of depends on, what market and what day, would agree with your sentiments on both windows and appliances. We've had challenges in both of those. Our product partners have been working hard to support our business. So we don't have to push back any closings. And we've been very pleased where we have to substitute, upgrade and even install other brands if necessary, to make sure we're not having to push closings. I don't know that I have anything specific on semiconductors that I've heard, as of late. But I really would have put windows again, as the headliner this quarter. It's probably actually gotten even a little worse than when we said that last quarter.\nSusan Maklari: Got you. Okay. Thank you.\nJessica Hansen: Thanks, Su.\nOperator: Thank you. Due to time constraints, our final question will come from the line of Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nBuck Horne: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. I'll try to keep this one quick. Question we get a lot from investors is kind of just where is all this buyer demand coming from? How sustainable it is at? I'm just curious if you get from a high-level perspective, any evidence of the population migration that seems to be happening around the country. Are you seeing any noticeable uptick in out-of-state buyers or out of market buyers versus your historical normal? And has that changed at all one way or the other since the pandemic began?\nJessica Hansen: I would say anecdotally, yes. I mean, we continue to see Texas and Florida as our two strongest space with a lot of diversity just even within those states. But clearly, there has been a flight in a lot of cases from the coast to Texas to Florida, to the Carolinas, and then from the West Coast into Salt Lake into Vegas into Phoenix, and so I think we would expect that trend to continue. And in that regard, really like our positioning as it pertains to our lot position across the country.\nBill Wheat: I also like the fact that you don't see existing home inventory levels sale - for sale at high levels, at all, supply is very tight for homes that are available in the next 60 days to 90 days. And that has been a consistent part of our business model for forever is to be an alternative to that used home and provide a customer with a new home on their time line.\nJessica Hansen: And Buck, you didn't ask this specific question, but we've had a lot of conversations over the last quarter or so about just the age. And for the last - however many years about our millennial is ever going to buy a home, coming off around 35% of our business in 2019 was to buyers 34 and under. We saw that pretty quickly in the pandemic and through the remainder of fiscal 2020 and now into 2021 tick up to the low 40s. So, I think 42% versus 35% is a pretty big move. And we've seen that settle out to where over 40% of our buyers are 34 and under. I think answering that question that, yes, millennials are going to own homes.\nBuck Horne: Okay. That's great. That's - okay, go ahead, please\u2026\nDavid Auld: Everything we're seeing has been the long-term trends that we've been experiencing really coming out of the downturn, COVID accelerated it. And it feels like right now that, that acceleration is kind of the new norm going forward.\nBuck Horne: That's extremely helpful. Thank you, guys. I appreciate all that color. And just one last one on the single-family - rental business, just a follow-up on that, outstanding community trade. I'm just wondering you mentioned that you plan to double your investment in the platform over the course of this year. So it sounds like there's quite a bit of scalable opportunity. How do you think about the total market opportunity for developing single family rentals within your platform? And would you continue on this method of building it yourself, pre-leasing it and then flipping it stabilized? Or would you pre-sell some of these or partner with investors ahead of development? How do you envision the scaling up of that business?\nMike Murray: Where we are today with the program is we're still learning the business and the execution side of it. We were very pleased with the first transaction. And as we learn more about the market, we will evaluate various alternatives for how we want to go about scaling it out and ultimately capitalizing it. But we need to know more about what we're doing. We do see a lot of opportunity. We think there is some portion of the population that will be a great customer for this product that desires a single-family lifestyle, but may not, for whatever reason, be purchasing a home. And so we want to build up to be in a position to help to supply this.\nBill Wheat: And Buck, just to clarify, the comment about doubling our investment this year refers to our entire rental platform, both multifamily and single family. Our total assets and the combined platform at the beginning of the year was $330 million. So we expect that $330 million more than double in fiscal '21.\nBuck Horne: Got it. Got it. Thank you so much and congratulations.\nBill Wheat: Thanks.\nJessica Hansen: Thanks.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Mr. Auld, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Christine. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again with our second quarter results in April. And to the D.R. Horton team an outstanding first quarter. We're set up to have an unbelievable year. Stay humble, stay hungry and stay focused. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 84% to $2.14 per diluted share compared to $1.16 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 84% to $792 million compared to $431 million. Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 48% to $5.7 billion on 18,739 homes closed, up from $3.9 billion on 12,959 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was up 2% from the prior year at $304,100, and the average size of our homes closed was down 2%, reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill? We ended the first quarter with 42,100 homes in inventory. 16,300 of our total homes were unsold, of which 1,600 were completed. We also had 1,900 model homes at the end of the quarter. Due to our strong sales in the second half of fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our level of unsold and completed unsold homes is lower than in recent years. We have accelerated our pace of home starts across most of our communities in the past two quarters to ensure we maintain an adequate number of homes to meet demand. During the first quarter, we started 22,800 homes. We have made good progress increasing our homes in inventory, and we expect to increase them further in the second quarter as we enter the spring selling season. At December 31, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 441,000 lots, of which 28% were owned and 72% were controlled through purchase contracts. 30% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 47% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our growing and capital-efficient lot portfolio continues to provide us a strong competitive position, allowing us to start construction on more homes to meet homebuyer demand. David? At December 31st, our multifamily rental operations had four projects under active construction and an additional four projects that are in the lease-up phase. These eight projects represent 2,325 multifamily units. Based on our pace of leasing activity, we currently expect to sell two projects during the second half of fiscal 2021. Our multifamily rental assets totaled $294.3 million at December 31st. And as we mentioned on our last call, we are constructing and leasing homes within single family rental communities. After these rental communities are constructed and achieve a stabilized level of leased occupancy, each community is expected to be marketed for sale. Our single-family rental operations are currently reported in our homebuilding segment. During the quarter ended December 31st, we completed our first sale of a single-family rental community, representing 124 homes for $31.8 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $14 million. We currently expect one more sale of a single-family rental community later this fiscal year. At December 31st, our homebuilding fixed assets included $106.6 million of assets related to our single-family rental platform, representing 13 communities totaling 890 single family rental homes and owned finished lots. We still expect our total investments in our single and multifamily rental platforms to more than double during fiscal 2021. Bill? John, this is Mike. Good morning. We're always focused on affordability that's something that's consistent across the platform. And I'm not as well versed to speak to the industry. But in our communities, we're focused on providing the value at whatever price point we're at. And so whether we have buyers moving up from their current housing situation to a D.R. Horton home or they are first-time homebuyer with 56% of our buyers in the quarter were first time homebuyers. We're focused on providing an affordable home for that buyer that fits in their monthly budget. Well, I don't think it's going to help affordability. And I believe it's going to extend time. We're well positioned with owning control over 400,000 lots. And again, we're going to focus on affordability. And as regulations increase, affordability is going to become more challenging. But given our position, our people, I think we're - we can meet that challenge. Sure. Good question, Steve. Just to get to the point in terms of expected levels, we would expect at each quarter end to maintain at least $1 billion of homebuilding cash, but would expect most quarters to see between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. I would say the primary driver behind that shift over the last year is we've been building a little bit more. It's just a significant increase in volume and scale and activity, which feel like it's prudent to ensure that we have sufficient cushion to manage significant sudden changes in the business to avoid having any potential liquidity crunches. That just gives us that much more flexibility to respond when we see opportunities in the market. And so we've seen a number of significant shifts in our business over the last few years from a sharp increase in interest rates, which decreased demand in late '18 to the pandemic disruption in the spring of 2020. To then the very significant increase in demand that we saw in the summer of 2020 and ever since. And so from that standpoint, having a bit more cushion, a bit more liquidity to respond, whichever direction we need to go in the business, we just feel like it's prudent. I don't see us changing that strategy. I think that just puts us in a very strong and flexible position to respond to market changes. Well Steve, I'd say the first thing we expected to see this quarter that we did not as we've been seeing cost increases coming into our business over the last quarter or two, and we expected to see a bit more of that come through in our closings in Q1, which we did not. That's still coming. We can see it coming through our backlog, and we expect to see some of those cost increases start to hit our margins in the coming quarters. That being said, we still have a very strong environment, obviously with the ability to raise prices, very low incentive levels. And so, we do expect at this point now with that additional visibility of another quarter to be able to maintain the current margins that we're showing, which obviously are very strong levels. I think we've seen consistently strong demand across our footprint, Eric. In addition, as we've gotten the starts up in the first quarter, we started almost 23,000 homes with good visibility to start for the next couple of quarters. And so that gives us more confidence in the number we can deliver for the full year. So just a little clear - a little more of a year coming into focus with what we're going to be able to accomplish. Anything different. It's - we talk about sustainability and growing the scale of our platform and doing it in a measured approach that allows us to hang on to those increases. So I wouldn't say, it's anything different. It's just further execution of the same strategy of growing our capacity for production, growing our market share market-by-market. And that's what our teams think about every day when they're getting up and going about their jobs is how I get a little better today and grab a little more production capacity in my marketplace. Thanks, Eric. And when you look, obviously, at the year-over-year increases, we started to see some very significant year-over-year increases in Q3. Last year, Q3 and Q4 were much more significant. So the year-over-year increases going forward are naturally not going to necessarily continue at the same pace they are right now. But we're still expecting a very strong year, very strong year-over-year increase for fiscal '21. If demand remains at the exact level it is today, it would be very challenging for us to get back to a historical relationship between total inventory and backlog. Demand is that good. We look at our starts capacity, neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood, week-by-week. And we are increasing that capacity over time to make sure it's sustainable. And we're doing it well with our trade partners in mind. So - but while we're doing that, demand continues to expand, to absorb that additional capacity we're putting into the marketplaces today, at the price points we're serving. Yeah. We've certainly seen very different seasonality throughout 2020. Stronger demand through the summer, fall, winter in 2020 than we've seen historically. So we're coming off of some unusually strong periods. But that being said, with what we've seen thus far in January, we're seeing increases in volume that we would expect to see. It remains to be seen whether we'll still see the same percentage relationships between our Q2 and Q1 that we've seen historically or not. But right now, we just see a very strong demand environment. Definitely some different patterns in buyer behavior than we've seen historically. But feeling good about what we can see going ahead. With a very strong Q1, where we see the same sort of patterns throughout the fiscal year, we historically have seen. I would expect there's probably be a bit of flattening of some of the historical patterns, but obviously, off to a very good start. And I think the way things are looking right now, we're optimistic about the spring. If you just look at our average sales price increase over quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter compared to our competitors. And yes, I would say our competitive advantage has increased and improved. But again, it really comes down to the ability to deliver the homes. And I think that's where we've gained the largest competitive advantage with the discipline around what we're doing and the focus on efficiency over the last couple of years. So it's a - it doesn't do any good to sell a house at any price, you can't deliver it. So we're focused on the delivery side of it and expanding our capacity via becoming more and more efficient through our processes. Yeah, we're very pleased with that transaction. And we look forward to that continuing to explore that business. It seems to be attracting a lot of capital and a lot of interest today. And we expect to be to take advantage of that. Thank you, Jack. You know, Su three weeks in, we rarely comment on a single month, much less just a few weeks. So - but suffice it to say, what we generally expect when we get into January, is we expect there to be a step-up in traffic and volume coming through our weekly sales pace. And so we have seen that. We've seen three weeks of weekly sales thus far, and there has been that discernible step-up in volume in January versus what we had seen in the December quarter. So we're encouraged by that. Where we are today with the program is we're still learning the business and the execution side of it. We were very pleased with the first transaction.

            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I'm pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding first quarter, which included a 98% increase in consolidated pretax income to over $1 billion, a 48% increase in revenues to $5.9 billion, and a 56% increase in net sales orders to 20,418. Our pretax profit margin for the quarter improved 440 basis points to 17.4%, while our earnings increased 84% to $2.14 per diluted share. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31 was 28%, and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 24.4%. These results reflect the strength of our homebuilding and financial services teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint, and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Housing market conditions remain very strong, and our teams are focused on maximizing returns and improving capital efficiency in each of our communities, while increasing our market share. However, we remain cautious regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic or other external factors may have on the economy and our operations in the future. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and experienced teams position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our home building operations and managing our product offering, incentives, home prices, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments. With 42,100 homes in inventory, an ample supply of lots and continued strong sales trends in January, we are well positioned for the spring selling season and the remainder of 2021. Mike? For first quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $1.95 billion, of which $1.13 billion was for finished lots, $490 million was for land development and $330 million was to acquire land, $290 million of our lot purchases in the first quarter were for Forestar. Bill? In closing, our results reflect the strength of our experienced operational teams, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions, and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts during this time have been remarkable. We are proud of your work ethic and your positive spirit as you continue safely helping our customers close on their much-anticipated new homes. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host the questions. I don't see it being much different than it's been in 2020, at least not for us. We set up and try to drive our communities in the most efficient way, making it the easiest possible way we can for our trades to get in, get out, get their job done. We've actually, I think, through this cycle, have been focused on the labor side and have created a lot of efficiency and have expanded our trade base just by making it easier for them to get in, get out and what they're doing. 2021, our volume is ramping up. I think that's going to continue to be a challenge. But we feel very good, I mean, we wouldn't be selling houses if we couldn't build them, so. The underwriting in the West is much more difficult, time lines are longer. So through this cycle, our community count has continued to slip down there. I will tell you, we have one of the best groups of people in the company in the West region. When we talk about platform, we talk about people, product price, and we are certainly - have a very strong platform out West. When the returns in Texas, Florida, Carolinas have been incredible, and everybody competes for capital in this company. So I will say the West is an area that I personally going to emphasize this year, and I think you'll see the growth return there. And I'll just add, our operational teams are doing a great job at controlling costs, where we see increases, we look for efficiencies to reduce cost. And I mean, to be honest, I think we were a little bit surprised a stick and brick per foot, actually it went down last quarter. That's just a phenomenal job by our people. Thanks, Steve. The volume we see today, Matt, as well as looking forward to more medium term, we just don't see a lot of overbuilding, a lot of excess supply in the marketplace relative to household formation demand. And so we want to maintain, as Bill said, adequate support of inventory for that medium term land. So that's why you're seeing our controlled lot position increased. Very capital-efficient with the options. We're also seeing a good start to the spring in January, which again, it's about confidence. And we don't want to put a number out there that we don't feel really good about. So we feel really good about that number. Our underwriting really hasn't changed much as we've seen absorptions increase, it does - when we're requiring a two-year cash back at a 10 a month absorption, you can buy more lots than you can a five a month absorption. So we have seen the scale of the deals get a little bigger, but the position that from a pricing and location standpoint, I don't see that we've given up much in the deals we're doing today versus the deals we were doing two or three, four years ago. Scale is bigger. The phase sizes are bigger. Lot prices have been pretty stable. And I think I said this on the last call, when I'm traveling and looking at deals, the deals that we put on the books this quarter, we're better than most of the deals that we had on the books. So it's very - it gives me a lot of confidence, and our guys are doing a great job. So I don't see deterioration in our lot position from marketability or really even a pricing standpoint. If you look at our average sales price, we are significantly more affordable than most of our peers in the homebuilding space. And our land portfolio and our operating structures are designed and geared to drive that affordability. So are we - when I look at the competitive makeup out there, both of the resale market, which is really, today, our primary competitor at this price points? And our peers in the industry, it's - I mean, we feel very good about our current position and which allows us to underwrite and execute the positions that we believe will keep us in this range. The demand out there, I think, is really driven by demographics. And I think it has been accelerated, because of the pandemic and people's desire to become - or to find a safe environment for their family. I really don't see that demand issue changing. I mean, it's - it accelerates. It's a long-term program, and it got accelerated. Now that's going to stay. So, I mean we are positioning. We are driving to take advantage of as much of that demand as we can. And it's - I mean, right now today, it's very good out there. And we talk to our operators all the time about being disciplined, focused and consistent and it starts in your communities. And that's how we're building capacity to deliver more homes by that execution at the community level. Yeah, actually, 70s [ph] are new 60. We're going to continue to try to grind that number higher. Ultimately, it comes down to relationships and execution in the field. And that's something we focus on every day. So it's my expectation over time is that we will continue to drag a point here, a point there and drive better and better efficiency, capital efficiency through our business and to our company and ultimately, probably the industry. Several years ago, we would - the spring selling season to kick in with Super Bowl effectively at the end of January, early February. The past several years, this year being no exception, we've seen that sales pace accelerate coming out of the holidays after January 1. Everything we're seeing has been the long-term trends that we've been experiencing really coming out of the downturn, COVID accelerated it. And it feels like right now that, that acceleration is kind of the new norm going forward. Thank you, Christine. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again with our second quarter results in April. And to the D.R. Horton team an outstanding first quarter. We're set up to have an unbelievable year. Stay humble, stay hungry and stay focused. Thank you."

            "name": "Bill Wheat",
            "content": "Net sales orders in the first quarter increased 56% to 20,418 homes, and the value of those orders was $6.4 billion, up 62% from $3.9 billion in the prior year. We sold 7,292 more homes this quarter than the same quarter last year, supporting our plan to achieve further gains in market share and scale during fiscal 2021. Our average number of active selling communities increased 3% from the prior year quarter and was up 1% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the first quarter was $314,200, up 4% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 18%, down from 20% in the prior year quarter. We are pleased with our sales pace to date in January, and have seen the volume improvement we expect as we head into the spring selling season. We remain well positioned for increased demand with our affordable product offerings, lot supply and housing inventories. Jessica? In the first quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.9%, down 130 basis points from 9.2% in the prior year quarter. The improvement in our SG&A ratio this quarter was better than our expectations and was due to strong leverage driven by our higher-than-expected volume of homes closed and the increase in our average selling price. Our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is at its lowest point for our first quarter in our history, and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure appropriately supports our business. Mike? Forestar, our majority owned subsidiary is a publicly traded residential lot manufacturer operating in 51 markets across 21 states. Our strategic relationship with Forestar has a well-capitalized lot supplier across much of our operating footprint is serving us well and is presenting opportunities for both companies to gain market share. Forestar is delivering on its high growth expectations and now expects to grow its lot deliveries by 30% to 35% in fiscal 2021 to a range of 13,500 to 14,000 lots. At December 31, Forestar's lot position increased 74% from a year ago to 77,500 lots, of which 52,300 are owned and 25,200 are controlled through purchase contracts. 67% of Forestar's owned lots are already under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under our Master Supply Agreement. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and has approximately $580 million of liquidity, which includes $240 million of unrestricted cash and $340 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. At December 31, Forestar's net debt-to-capital ratio was 31.8%. And their next senior note maturity is in 2024. With low leverage, ample liquidity and its relationship with D.R. Horton, Forestar is in a very strong position to grow their business and navigate through changing market conditions. Jessica? Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. During the three months ended December, our cash used in homebuilding operations was $269.2 million compared to $178.4 million in the prior year period. At December 31st, we had $3.9 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of $2.1 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.8 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facilities. We plan to continue maintaining higher homebuilding cash balances than in prior years to support the increased scale and activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. During the quarter, we issued $500 million of 1.4% senior notes due in 2027, and we repaid $400 million of 2.55% senior notes at their maturity. Our homebuilding leverage was 17.3% at the end of December with $2.5 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding and no senior note maturities in the next 12 months. At December 31st, our stockholders' equity was $12.5 billion and book value per share was $34.33, up 23% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months into December, our return on equity was 24.4% compared to 18.2% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $73 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in February. We repurchased one million shares of common stock for $69.8 million during the quarter and our remaining outstanding share repurchase authorization at December 31 was $466 million. Jessica? Sure. And Matt, you'll notice that most of that addition to the lot position did come in the form of options lots. We continue to significantly increase our option lot position. We had noted on our last call that we do expect our own lot to increase modestly, and they did kind of get back to a normal level there. But we've been on an ongoing effort to expand our relationships with developers across the country. Of course, our relationship with Forestar continues to bear fruit as well. So, a significant portion of the additions to our lot position through options came from our third-party developers and our relationship with Forestar. And with the significant growth we've seen in demand and significant volume increases that we've seen, that we certainly want to make sure we stay in position to maintain. We probably have stepped up our efforts to ensure that we're keeping our pipeline sufficiently out in front of us with the volume we're seeing today. And the fact that we're still heavy option does allow us to be a little more aggressive in tying things up. So it's, again, positioning for the future. Yeah, sure. We always see a higher ASP in our backlog than we do in our sales and our closings because higher priced homes generally are bigger and take longer to work their way through. So that's not necessarily unusual. But yes, so with our sales ASP being at 314 in this quarter, that's definitely showing a continuation of some price appreciation. And so in the near term, we would expect, I think to probably still see some potential upside. That been said, our operators and our teams and our people are very focused on providing affordability. And so we're going to keep an eye on the price points and the payments that our buyers need to have to afford to move into our homes. And so we never plan for significant price appreciation beyond a quarter or two because we always know that at some point, we will make some adjustments in our operations to make sure we keep our price points affordable. And so the guidance doesn't reflect all of our price. It doesn't reflect quite all of that price. It reflects that we would still continue to manage very closely on the affordability. Thank you. Can't emphasize enough that gross margin is not part of our underwriting hurdles, returns is our underwriting hurdle. And certainly, higher gross margins can generate higher returns. But we focus, first and foremost, on hitting returns, hitting our absorptions in each community. And then the market, sometimes will give you more margin than you may have underwritten. Michael, thank you. You touched on part of it. Deliveries were a little bit ahead of what we had guided to. In addition to ASP is a little higher, which drives a little more SG&A leverage. Something Jessica touched on before is the lower level of completed inventory, especially the completed specs that we're carrying the business today, able to operate the inventory portfolio very efficiently. And that requires less SG&A to maintain and care for those homes while they're sitting completed because we do run those costs through SG&A. So as we have less of those, we had around 5,000 a year ago. And today, we have about 1,600. So that's - that's an improvement and a tailwind as well. But nothing onetime. Yes, there are some changing conditions and the volume and pricing has helped, but nothing onetime in the quarter. And still the strongest demand is at the most affordable price. And that's been a trend that we've been seeing for quite a while. Obviously, we're very well positioned to take advantage of that. The environment right now with low interest rates, that's accommodated for that as well and it's certainly a benefit for that demand as well, which for right now, we don't really see that changing much in the near term. I also like the fact that you don't see existing home inventory levels sale - for sale at high levels, at all, supply is very tight for homes that are available in the next 60 days to 90 days. And that has been a consistent part of our business model for forever is to be an alternative to that used home and provide a customer with a new home on their time line. And Buck, just to clarify, the comment about doubling our investment this year refers to our entire rental platform, both multifamily and single family. Our total assets and the combined platform at the beginning of the year was $330 million. So we expect that $330 million more than double in fiscal '21. Thanks."

[Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Jessica, the floor is yours.\nJessica Hansen: Thank you, Tom, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 financial results. Before we get started, today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different.  All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Form 10-Q, all of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-K towards the end of next week. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Jessica. And good morning. We are also joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officers and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team finished the year with a solid fourth quarter, which included a 20% increase in consolidated pretax income to $2.1 billion and a 19% increase in revenues to $9.6 billion.  Our pretax profit margin for the quarter improved 10 basis points to 21.4%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 26% to $4.67. For the year, consolidated pretax income increased 42% to $7.6 billion on $33.5 billion of revenue, which increased 21%. Our pretax profit margin for the year improved 350 basis points to 22.8%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 45% to $16.51.  We closed a record of 83,518 this year in our whole building and single-family rental operations. And our homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues of 6.8% was an all-time low. Our home many return on inventory for. the year was 42.8% and our consolidated return on the equity was 34.5%. Our strong financial performance during a year of significant challenges and volatility reflects the strength of our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings.  Our homebuilding cash flow from operations for 2022 was $1.9 billion. Over the past 5 years, we have generated $7.5 billion of cash flow from homebuilding operations while growing our consolidated revenues by 138% and our earnings per share by 503%. During this time, we also more than doubled our book value per share, consistently kept our homebuilding leverage under 20% and increased our homebuilding liquidity by $1.8 billion, all while significantly increasing our returns on inventory and equity.  During most of the year, demand for our homes was strong. In June, we began to see a moderation in housing demand that has continued and accelerated through today. The rapid rise in mortgage rates, coupled with high inflation and general economic uncertainty, have made many buyers pause in their home buying decision or choose to not move forward with their home purchase. However, the supply of both new and resell homes at affordable price points remains limited and the demographics supporting housing demand remained favorable.  The uncertainty of this market transition may persist for some time and could get more challenging if mortgage rates continue increasing. However, we are well positioned to meet changing market conditions with our experienced teams, affordable product offerings, flexible lot supply and great trade and supplier relationships. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us financial flexibility.  We will continue to focus on turning our inventory and managing our product offerings, incentives, old pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to beat the market, optimize returns, increase market share and generate increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations. Mike?\nMichael Murray: Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 26% to $4.67 per share. And for the year, earnings per share increased 45% to $16.51. Net income for the quarter increased 22% to $1.6 billion. And for the year, net income increased 40% to $5.9 billion.  Our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 23% and to $9.4 billion on 23,212 homes closed, up from $7.6 billion on 21,937 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $403,700, up 17% from last year and up 3% sequentially. We closed fewer homes than we expected during the fourth quarter due to a slower sales pace, increased cancellations and continued construction delays.  In addition, we estimate that approximately 730 home closings in Florida and South Carolina were delayed from September due to Hurricane Ian. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: During the quarter, we continued to sell homes later in the construction cycle to better ensure the certainty of the home close date and mortgage rate for our homebuyers with almost no sales occurring prior to start of home construction. Our net sales orders in the fourth quarter decreased 15% to 13,582 homes, and our net sales order value was down 10% from the prior year to $5.4 billion.  Our cancellation rate during the fourth quarter was 32% compared to 19% in the prior year quarter and 24% in the third quarter. Our average number of active selling communities increased 8% from the prior year and was flat sequentially. The average sales price on net sales orders in the fourth quarter was $399,600, up 6% from the prior year but down 4% sequentially from the June quarter. In October, as mortgage rates continue to increase, our net sales orders were below prior year levels, and our cancellation rate remained elevated.  As a result, we currently expect our first quarter net sales orders to be down approximately 25% to 35% year-over-year. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 28.3% . up 140 basis points from the prior year quarter, but down 180 basis points sequentially from the June quarter. On a per square foot basis, our revenues were up 4% sequentially while our stick and brick cost per square foot increased 8% and our lot cost increased 3%. The decrease in our gross margin from the third to fourth quarter reflects the increase in our stick and brick costs and increased incentives provided to homebuyers to ensure the closings of our homes and backlog during the rapid rise in mortgage interest rates. We are offering mortgage interest rate locks and buydowns and other sales incentives to address affordability concerns and to drive sales traffic to our communities.  As we adjust to market conditions and focus on turning our inventory to maximize returns, our incentive levels have continued to increase, and we are adjusting base home prices where necessary. We expect our average sales price and home sales gross margin to decrease from current levels in fiscal 2023.  As a result, we are working with our trade partners and suppliers to reduce our construction costs on new home starts and are pleased with our early progress. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: In the fourth quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 6.7%, down 20 basis points from 6.9% in the prior year quarter. For the year, homebuilding SG&A expense was 6.8%, down 50 basis points from 7.3% in 2021.  Our annual homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is at its lowest point in our history, and we will continue to control our SG&A while ensuring that our platform adequately supports our business. In fiscal 2023, our homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues will likely increase from current levels. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: We started fewer homes this quarter as we work to position our inventory with an appropriate number of homes relative to market conditions. We started 13,100 homes during the quarter in our homebuilding operations as we began negotiations to lower our construction costs on future new home starts. We ended the year with 46,400 homes in inventory, down 3% from a year ago and down 18% sequentially.  27,200 of our total homes at September 30 were unsold of which 4,400 were completed. For homes we closed this quarter, our construction cycle time increased by a week compared to the third quarter, which reflects continued lingering supply chain issues. However, we are beginning to see some stabilization in cycle times on homes we have recently started, and we expect our cycle time to improve in fiscal 2023.  We expect our start pace in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 to increase versus our fourth quarter pace, and we will adjust our starts in homes and inventory to meet the level of demand in the market. Mike?\nMichael Murray: At September 30, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 573,000 lots, of which 23% were owned and 77% were controlled through purchase contracts. Our total homebuilding lot position decreased by 25,000 lots from June to September. 29% of our total owned lots are finished and 50% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them.  Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. We continually underwrite all of our lot and land purchases based on current and expected home prices and cost. We are actively managing our lot and land pipeline and our investments in lots, land and development to meet our needs during this transition in the housing market.  During the quarter, our homebuilding segment wrote off $34 million of option deposits and due diligence cost related to land and lot option contracts we terminated or expect to terminate in the future. We expect our level of option cost write-offs to remain elevated in fiscal 2023 as we manage our lot portfolio.  Our homebuilding segment had no inventory impairments during the quarter or the year. Our fourth quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $1.5 billion, down 19% from the prior year quarter and down 15% sequentially. Our current quarter investments consisted of $780 million for finished lots, $560 million for land development and $150 million to acquire land. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: For the fourth quarter, Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company reported total revenues of $381.4 million, 3,914 lots sold and pretax income of $66.4 million. For the full year, Forestar delivered 17,691 lots, generating $1.5 billion of revenues with a pretax profit margin of 15.5%.  At September 30, Forestar's owned and controlled lot position was 90,100 lots. 59% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer. $250 million of D.R. Horton's lot purchases in the fourth quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had approximately $620 million of liquidity at year-end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 26.9%.  Forestar is well positioned to meet changing market conditions with a strong capitalization, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Financial services pretax income in the fourth quarter was $2.4 million on $134 million of revenue, with a pretax profit margin of 1.8%. As expected, our financial services pretax profit margin decreased this quarter primarily due to a significant pull forward of revenue from rate lock commitments in the third quarter, as we discussed on last quarter's call.  Also during the fourth quarter, there were increased competitive pressures in the mortgage market and increased cost of rate locks provided to customers due to rising rates. For the year, financial services pretax income was $291 million, on $795 million of revenue, representing a 36.6% pretax profit margin.  We expect our financial services pretax profit margin for fiscal 2023 to be higher than the fourth quarter but below the full year of fiscal 2022. During the fourth quarter, 99% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 73% of our homebuyers.  FHA and VA loans accounted for 42% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 87%. First-time homebuyers represented 57% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Mike?\nMichael Murray: During fiscal 2022, our rental operations generated $510 million from the sale of 775 multifamily rental units and 774 single-family rental homes, earning pretax income of $202 million. In the fourth quarter, our rental operations generated $21 million of revenues from the sale of 96 single-family rental homes and incurred a pretax loss of $13 million, which were below our expectations going into the quarter.  We had several single-family rental projects in Florida, totaling 562 homes that were scheduled to close in September, but were delayed due to Hurricane Ian. These projects closed in October and will be reflected in our first quarter results. Also one multifamily project and multiple Single-family rental projects that were expected to be sold and closed in the fourth quarter were delayed due to changes in the capital markets that affected the timing of buyers' financing.  Our rental property inventory at September 30 was $2.6 billion, which included approximately $900 million of multifamily rental properties and $1.7 billion of single-family rental properties. As a reminder, our multifamily and single-family rental operating results are separately reported in our rental segment and are not included in our homebuilding segments homes closed revenues or inventories.  We expect our rental operations to generate significant increases in both revenues and profits in fiscal 2023 as our platform matures and expands across more markets. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity to provide a firm foundation for our operating platforms during changes in market conditions and to support our ability to provide consistent returns to our shareholders.  During fiscal 2022, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $1.9 billion and the cumulative cash generated from our homebuilding operations for the past 5 years was $7.5 billion. At September 30, we had $4 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility.  Our liquidity provides significant flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 13.2% at fiscal year-end and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 4.4%. Our consolidated leverage at September 30 was 23.8%, and consolidated leverage net of cash was 15.4%.  We repaid $350 million of senior notes at maturity this quarter and we have $700 million of senior notes that mature during fiscal 2023. At September 30, our stockholders' equity was $19.4 billion, and book value per share was $56.39 and up 35% from a year ago. For the year, our return on equity was 34.5%, an improvement of 290 basis points from 31.6% a year ago.  During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $78.2 million for a total of $316.5 million of dividends paid during the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for $251.7 million for a total of 14 million shares repurchased during the year for $1.1 billion. As a result, our outstanding share count is down 3% from a year ago. Based on our strong financial position, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 11% to $0.25 per share. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: As we look forward to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect challenging market conditions to persist with continued uncertainty regarding mortgage rates, the capital markets and general economic conditions that may significantly impact our business. As we have already mentioned, we are utilizing more incentives in today's market and are reducing home sales prices where necessary which will impact our average sales prices and gross margins more in the first quarter than the quarter we just completed.  We are providing detailed guidance for the first quarter as is our standard practice but due to the current uncertainty in the market, our ranges for expectations are wider than normal. We currently expect to generate consolidated revenues in our December quarter of $6 billion to $6.8 billion and our homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 15,000 to 16,500 homes.  We expect our home sales gross margin in the first quarter to be approximately 23% to 24% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter to be approximately 8% to 8.4%. We anticipate a financial services pretax profit margin of around 20% and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 23% in the first quarter.  Looking further out into fiscal 2023, we have less visibility due to the macro level uncertainties we have mentioned. It is too early to know what housing market conditions will be 3 to 6 months from now during the spring selling season, so we are not providing specific guidance for the full year yet. We will reassess each quarter and give more color on our expectations as we can. We are well positioned to aggregate market share in both our homebuilding and rental operations.  Our fiscal 2023 home closings volume, pricing and margins will be determined by future market conditions and our efforts to meet the market and improve our inventory turns, construction cycle times and costs. Our goal is to generate consolidated revenues in fiscal 2023 that are slightly higher than fiscal 2022.  However, the low end of our current range of expectations includes consolidated revenues potentially down from fiscal 2022 by a mid-teens percentage. We forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2023 of approximately 23% we expect to generate increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, and we plan to consistently repurchase shares to reduce our share count during the year with the amount of our repurchases dependent on cash flow, liquidity, market conditions and our investment opportunities.  We plan to continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, our rental operations, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares. David?\nDavid Auld: In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to operate effectively in changing economic conditions and continuing to aggregate market share.  We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts during 2022 were remarkable. This was a year in which we faced construction and operational challenges we have never faced before with periods of unsustainably high demand, followed by historic rise in mortgage rates.  Despite these challenges and market volatility, we closed the most homes in a year in our company's history, completing our 21st year as the largest builder in the United States with record profit and returns, and we are well positioned to continue improving our operations and providing homeownership opportunities to more American families in 2023. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI.\nStephen Kim: Thanks very much, guys, and thanks for all the information. Obviously, pretty solid performance in a tough environment. I wanted to ask you specifically about your starts outlook. Can you give us a sense for how much of an increase in starts we might expect in the December quarter, maybe year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter? And maybe alternatively, how many finished specs or total specs per community are you expecting to have as you enter the new calendar year?\nPaul Romanowski: Stephen, looking into the first quarter, we are finishing the year with 46,000 homes in inventory and positioned for our goals as we look forward to the year and looking to maintain a similar balance as we work through the first quarter. So expect that our starts will keep pace with our closings through the first quarter.\nStephen Kim: Got you. And then ...\nBill Wheat: Yes. In terms of the completed specs, Steve, we're in a more normal position now with having some completed specs across more of our communities. That puts us in a good position to sell in the current environment given that buyers are concerned about what their interest rates are going to be. So if we have homes that are ready to move into quickly. They can lock their rates with confidence and close on a known schedule.\nStephen Kim: So the level of completed specs you have now is you're comfortable with sort of maintaining that level, right? That's what you're saying?\nBill Wheat: Yes.\nStephen Kim: Okay. And then the second question relates to your comments about navigating the difficult environment or the uncertain environment by managing your product offerings and negotiating lower cost is certainly the negotiation of lower costs. I understand that's going to be ongoing. But the managing of your product offerings, can you give us a sense for how quickly you're able to swap out models or at least floor plans that you're offering in your communities.  Is that something that we could expect you to do in communities that are currently open? Or are we really looking at communities that are going to be new communities opening up. Maybe give us a sense for like what share of the communities you will have open, let's say, for the spring selling season will have a revamped product line.\nMichael Murray: In most of our communities across the country, Steve, we'll be able to start back smaller homes primarily and change specification levels in those homes. That we start -- have been starting in the most recent quarter and will be starting in the first quarter.  There are some communities that are a little more locked in on product and planned neighborhood phases that it may take 3 to 6 months to work through some changes in the product offerings. But by and large, most of our communities, those changes are starting today, and we'll continue to see that roll out through the next 6 to 9 months.\nDavid Auld: And Stephen, even with product lines that we've been offering as a spec builder, we release certain houses every month. So when the market is running red hot like it was first half plus of last year. You have a tendency and release the bigger houses because your that dollar profit per house is higher.  Now when a price point becomes much more important to the buyers. We made the release, they go from the 2,300 square foot 2-story down to the 1,600 square foot ranch, which drops the overall ASP of the community without really changing the product or impacting valuations within the community.\nStephen Kim: Great. That's really helpful.\nDavid Auld: We control that by which houses we will lease into production.\nOperator: The next question is coming from John Lovallo from UBS.\nJohn Lovallo: First one is the first quarter order guide implies quarter-over-quarter improvement, which would sort of buck normal seasonality. Can you just help us with some of the puts and takes there?\nBill Wheat: Well, really, we're just looking at our plans and what we're seeing right now week to week. We're already 5 weeks into our quarter. So we've got one month in the books. And as we just look at our pace that we're seeing right now and that we believe that that's where we're going to wind up.  There obviously seasonality, if you look at history, has been a little bit unusual in the last couple of years. And I think we're still in a little bit of an unusual time with what has happened with rates. But with our positioning across the board with our community count increasing, we feel like our order position in Q1 is in line with what we guided.\nJessica Hansen: And as our production got further along as well, we felt more comfortable loosening up a lot of the sales restrictions you've heard us talk about. Even though we're continuing to sell later in the process, with some negligible improvement on our cycle times, but getting further along in the construction cycles, we have more homes available for sale going into Q1 than we've had.\nJohn Lovallo: Makes sense. Okay. Great. And then the ASP in the fourth quarter down about 4% sequentially. How much of that was like-for-like pricing versus mix.\nBill Wheat: Yes, at this point, it's like-for-like. I mean, we're -- as we said, we're increasing incentives and then where necessary community by community, we're adjusting prices. And so I don't believe there's necessarily been a big change in mix yet. And so it's more likely from like-for-like.\nOperator: The next question today is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG.\nCarl Reichardt: You talked about cutting base prices where necessary. Can you give me a sense of how often it's been necessary that maybe a percentage of communities or percentage of orders this quarter where base prices were cut and what level of cuts are creating some elasticity in unit demand.\nPaul Romanowski: Carl, I don't know that we can get specific in terms of communities or by area. We are finding the market community by community and market by market. Those cuts on base have not been significant to this point. We have focused on financial incentives and interest rate and where needed to, we've been able to adjust price and find the market to drive additional traffic and sales.\nJessica Hansen: And a lot of our guide is coming from what we know we're going to put into the market in terms of when we're opening new communities or new phases, we can reset our base pricing that way. And than so we do expect our ASP to shift down throughout the year. But as Paul mentioned, to date, it's been more heavily incentivized than it has been base price cuts.\nCarl Reichardt: Okay. And then on cycle times, starting to see a little bit of easing and working with the trades and suppliers, would your guess be that your cycle times could get to sort of normal pre-pandemic levels in fiscal '23? Or is that too much to help for at this point?\nMichael Murray: Anecdotally, I was talking to a builder last week. He said he started a house in late August, and he's going to close it in December. So he was pretty excited about that. That's 1 story, 1 house out of a lot of houses.\nJessica Hansen: And builder equals construction superintended -- our employees.\nMichael Murray: He was really excited about that. So I think we're making the right progress. We're starting to see a little bit of progress pick up in the numbers of October completions. We got a little bit of time back there. Getting all the way back to where we want to be pre-pandemic levels, it might be by the end of the year for the starts that we have later in the year that we're pushing It through, but we're going to make that progress this year.\nDavid Auld: Carl, just -- we've talked about it, I think, for a while, but just the discipline in the industry today is it has translated into across-the-board slowdown in starts. And I think it will allow the trade base material suppliers to kind of get the feet under them.  And I've been accused of being overly optimistic at times, but I do think 2023 if the industry stays disciplined, we will get back into a situation where we can sell a house, now what it's going to go and what are we going to be able to deliver and that will be a good thing.\nCarl Reichardt: Well, it starts with one house. So I appreciate the color, guys.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan.\nMichael Rehaut: Great. I appreciate you taking my questions. First off, just wanted to get a sense of the cadence and progression of incentives as it works through your fiscal fourth quarter and into October and perhaps even into November. Obviously, a lot of that, I would presume as being reflected in the first quarter gross margin guidance.  But what I'm trying to get a sense is just the degree of magnitude of the change in trend and how we should be thinking about perhaps where incentives are today versus where they were 3 or 4 months ago?\nBill Wheat: It start with just looking -- taking a step back and looking at where interest rates were. At the end of the last quarter, mortgage rates were still in the low to mid-5s. And by the end of the quarter, they're in the high 6s.  And subsequent to the end of the quarter, they've now stepped into the 7s. And so we have been adjusting to reflect that. A lot of our incentives have been on the financing side with interest rate locks and buy downs to try to address the payment shock there from the interest rates. And that has increased sequentially through the quarter and has continued into October. So the levels have continued to increase.  We were focused on ensuring that we could close our backlog because we did have a lot of homes scheduled to close in September. And so we believe we did hold off on some price adjustments to ensure that we could close that backlog. And so price adjustments have started to fold in a little more commonly as we've stepped into Q1. So it's been a sequential increase along the way. And then what it will be going forward will depend largely on what happens with rates in the market and then our efforts to meet the market.  We are looking community by community to make adjustments in order to hit our sales pace and turn our inventory and maximize our returns. And so we're looking to find the market and find that pace community by community.\nMichael Rehaut: So I guess I appreciate that answer. I know obviously, projecting gross margins beyond the first quarter is somewhat difficult, but it would seem like given the trends that we're not yet at a point of stabilization. I guess my second question, and if you have any thoughts on that, that would be great.I guess  But second question, just on the SG&A guide for the first quarter, with consolidated revenue being a little bit below, obviously, it's not a surprise to see the SG&A come up. I'm also wondering if there's anything in that number around increased broker commissions to the market as part of encouraging the broker community in a softer environment? And how we should be thinking about that line item within SG&A over the next year?\nJessica Hansen: Sure, Mike. So builders report those things separately or differently, I should say. So broker commissions for us are actually in gross margin. So that is contemplated as one of the increased incentives in our gross margin guide and not an impact for us, particularly on SG&A.\nBill Wheat: And in terms of SG&A overall, with our ASPs expected to come down with revenues down a bit. That's driving an expected increase in our SG&A as a percentage of revenues. We're coming off of all-time lows there and are still positioning ourselves to continue to gain market share.  And so with essentially SG&A spend staying relatively stable with the exception of variable SG&A that moves with revenues or with profitability, that's resulting in the expected increase from all-time lows to a little bit higher level as a percentage of revenues in Q1.\nOperator: And the next question today is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley: Just a follow-up on the incentive side. I think I heard you say at the top that within financial services, you were including some , I think you said rate buydowns and things like that. So in the incentive comments you just made around reaching 6 or 7, I think I heard you say -- is that all in the gross margin? And is there additional incentives on the financial services side that we should look out for? Or is that kind of all in?\nBill Wheat: There's always some of those costs on both sides, Matt, and that can vary a bit depending on the nature of the incentives. But yes, both of our guides, the guidance for financial services margins going into Q1 as well as the guide for our gross margin on the homebuilding side reflect our anticipation for our level of incentives related to financing.\nMatthew Bouley: Understood. Okay. And then just secondly, you mentioned that you would -- I think I heard you say you would expect the option abandonments that occurred this quarter to kind of continue to occur. I mean should we expect the magnitude of that to increase? And then just kind of any update on actual impairment thoughts around your own land portfolio?\nMichael Murray: With the option write-off cost, as we evaluate projects at various decision points, we'll be working with various land sellers and developers and where we can't reach an agreement on our accommodation, we're not going to move forward with a bad deal. So if it doesn't make sense and what we expect the market conditions are or will be over the life of the project, that's the reason we have the option arrangement.  So we may have an increase in those costs, but we do take a pretty accurate look at those things, very realistic expectation, and we'll be very quick to move on those.\nDavid Auld: And I'll just add, both when the market was accelerating and now at the center pause, we are very disciplined in how we approach every economic decision on the land side. It's all about creating optionality and efficiency of capital. And that's been our program, and it's going to continue to be our program.\nJessica Hansen: In terms of your impairment question, even with our guide for gross margins today, we're still projecting for our gross margins to remain at very healthy levels that would signify that we're a long way off from any sort of broad-based impairments. We're also in a completely different financial position mid-cycle to prior cycles, which allows us some flexibility in terms of how we look at the land that we have on our balance sheet and what we plan to do with it going forward.  That being said, we do expect there to be some impairments along the way in weaker submarkets. But right now, I don't expect anything broadly based in the near term.\nMatthew Bouley: Makes sense.\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from the Cleveland Research Company.\nEric Bosshard: Context, if you could, around 2 things. First of all, the 23% to 24% gross margin in 1Q. Obviously, a component of that is what's going on with incentives and pricing. You talked today about savings on the cost side or changing the product mix. And so what I'm trying to understand is, is that a baseline the changes that you're making to support gross margin or change mix, can that number improve?  Can you just give us a little bit of sense of what's contributing to that and in terms of the things you're doing to protect gross margin, what the path forward might look like?\nPaul Romanowski: Yes, Eric. I think as we are out in the market with our trade partners and suppliers working to reduce cost to provide the best value we can to our homebuyers. And we provided the visibility into the first quarter with those gross margins.  What we're seeing which is encouraging early on in that isn't going to come through in homes to close for the next 6 to 9 months towards the end of the year. So we've still got the homes that we have in the ground with that cost structure -- but as we continue to find the market, we expect to see gross margins like we have guided to in the first quarter.\nDavid Auld: And we did suffer through extended bill cycle times. So the houses will be closing in Q1, our houses that were started and bear the cost of high lumber cost. And really trade shortages. So you've got the double whammy of high cost and a more normalized ASP.\nEric Bosshard: And just within that, is -- like today, can you comment, is that the floor? Or is there both upside and downside through the rest of the year relative to the 1Q gross margin?\nDavid Auld: It depends on what the capital markets and interest rates do. I mean it's -- if we see stabilization in interest rates, I feel very optimistic about what we can do this year. if we continue to see 100 basis point increase quarter-to-quarter to quarter, I think it's going to be a very challenging year.\nEric Bosshard: Okay. And then secondly, you mentioned single-family for rent, both of what you're doing and buyers of home of your homes from others. I'm just curious if you can give us a sense of how much of the business is single-family for rent, what the expectation is in '23 and if there's any risk or volatility around that buyer group.\nMichael Murray: So our approach to the single-family rental business is to build communities of traditional single-family homes. Rent those up and stabilization and then sell them to typically institutional owners of that sort of residential asset class. It's about $1.7 billion, I think, is our current investment in the single-family rental platform. We expect that's going to grow during '23.  Depending upon market conditions, probably not more growth than we had from the end of '21 to the end of '22, but we do expect growth in '23. And we still see that when we complete the homes and they go to market to lease, there's still good demand and people are needing a place to live, and they're choosing to live in these communities.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates.\nAlan Ratner: Thanks for all the great detail in a difficult market to forecast out here, so we appreciate it. I guess first question, just trying to triangulate all the comments you made about the margin outlook, the goals as far as revenue are concerned in '23. So if I look at your 1Q margin guide, it's down about 600 to 700 basis points from the peak a couple of quarters ago, and I think that's largely consistent with kind of the net price adjustments we've seen across the industry.  As you think about that versus your goal to grow revenues for the year or even maybe the low end of that range, what's the price sensitivity to achieving that goal? How low are you willing to take that margin in the near term, recognizing that maybe longer term, you have some potential cost relief coming or other things that could be offset.  But in order to hit your '23 target there? How low could that margin go before you kind of hold back and say, you know what, we're just going to slow the start pace. We're not going to chase that revenue growth because the price environment is too difficult.\nBill Wheat: Alan, there's always a balance. We're always balancing what we're doing on pricing and incentives and what that results in margin versus pace and turning inventory to generate the best return. And so we'll be trying to strike that balance across all our communities throughout the year.  It's too early and too uncertain to know what the year may bring in terms of the macro environment in terms of rates, in terms of the general economy to know exactly what those decisions may need to be. And so that's why we're trying to provide as much color as we can around how we're looking at things, but in reality, we don't have really any specificity or visibility to what those conditions may be into the spring and in to '23 so in terms of where the line is on where margin or pricing might need to go or what we're willing to do to push pace. I think remains to be seen. We're going to be making those decisions day to day, week to week as we march forward here.\nJessica Hansen: And as you know, we don't push or dictate that from a high level. It really is managed community by community, market by market so we can make sure we're maximizing our returns at the local level and then blend it overall.\nAlan Ratner: Okay. I appreciate the thoughts there. I guess on the Rental segment, so I hear the delays in Florida, but I thought I also heard maybe a couple of projects that you thought would close this quarter that got pushed out because of presumably the higher borrowing costs that your counterparties are experiencing and how that impacts the underwriting.  So I guess I'm just thinking out loud here, you do expect growth in that segment and certainly the inventory has been building. But how concerned or not concerned are you about what's going on with borrowing costs for those investors. I mean, we're hearing that there's a bit of a stalemate, if you will, or at least a widening bid-ask spread on the rental side as well given the difficulty underwriting to the new borrowing costs. So what's the sensitivity for you to achieve that growth? Is there any risk to that if borrowing costs remain elevated?\nPaul Romanowski: Alan, we have certainly seen from that buyer base in the credit markets and their ability to borrow soften, but there's still plenty of buyers out there. Like our buyers on the homebuyer side, they're taking a bit of a pause in some cases, just to evaluate the market.  But we've got about 7,400 homes in production on the single-family for rent side, and that's from beginning to those that are complete. We still expect to see people in that market. Not everyone needs to be in the credit markets or borrowing to purchase. And our single-family rental communities tend to be on the lower end side relative to apartment sizes.  And so we still feel good about that business, but we certainly did see communities that we expected to be sold and closed in the fourth quarter pushed into the second quarter.So...\nAlan Ratner: And when you look at your deals that are under construction or completed or close and if you underwrite those deals as if you're a buyer today, you're still seeing those penciling. In other words, you can make the math work and assume that a buyer theoretically can as well?\nPaul Romanowski: Yes. And we have been very conservative on our underwriting. We are really looking at each of those communities as we would on the for-sale side. And so the performance we saw on the ones that we sold in the market a year ago and through the last year, were far outperformed our underwriting. And so we still feel good about the position in the active communities that we have, and we will adjust as the market adjusts in terms of that business on a go forward.\nMichael Murray: And more of the issue, I think, Alan, related to a change in that buyer. They were -- just to say they were very excited would be an understatement to get their hands on the communities early in fiscal '22. We experienced some of the same construction delays in those products that we did in our single-family for sale business and we had expectations and buyer indications of interest willing to close on the projects prior to completion and prior to full stabilization. The markets come back and more normalized now and their expectation is that we get to a stabilized point before they're -- we're going to get a good valuation.\nAlan Ratner: If I could just sneak in one last one, and I apologize, but it's relevant to this topic here. In the environment where the capital markets remain tough and the borrowing costs continue to rise here, but you're still seeing good fundamentals at the community level, good occupancy, good rents.  Are you willing to kind of shift the strategy in the near term and kind of hold on to more of these assets on your balance sheet and wait for the transaction environment to improve? Or is the goal here really to turn the capital and then you're not looking to necessarily grow a portfolio of stabilized assets?\nBill Wheat: Our base business model is to sell the assets. That still generally will generate the best return. But we're going to make sure that we stay in a position from a capital perspective to be able to manage timing to manage a bit of a slower process, if necessary, due to some disruptions in the capital markets, which typically don't last that long. But we do want to make sure we stay in a flexible position to be able to manage timing when necessary.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James.\nBuck Horne: I was wondering if you could -- I think you mentioned the cancellation rate in October remained elevated. I was just wondering if directionally you could indicate whether that was the cancellation rate was higher or lower than what happened in the fourth quarter in October.\nJessica Hansen: Yes. We typically have volatility month-to-month in our can rate throughout the quarter, so we don't give it specifically for the month. But anything for us above the, call it, low 20s, high teens to low 20s is elevated, and we certainly did not see any market improvement in October as compared to Q4.\nBuck Horne: Okay. Appreciate that. And can we talk about any just regional differences in terms of how buyer traffic and interest levels have behaved as the progression of interest rates kind of marched higher either during the quarter through October. Just kind of walk us through the map and just kind of where things are -- how buyers are behaving in different geographies?\nMichael Murray: We've seen still see a lot of traffic in our models. We still see people coming in looking to get into a home, a little more challenging with the affordability sometimes to get them qualified. But as we see stabilization in rates. And when we see periods when rates have stabilized and that demand is there, we're able to meet it.  We do see in our sales process is that we're selling the large majority of our homes passed a certain stage of construction, not just from our restriction of that sale, but from the buyer wanting certainty of what that interest rate payment can be within the lock window that can be afforded to them.  And so that's been important for us to accelerate the cycle times, have more inventoried later in the production process that we can deliver within the interest rate lock window.\nBuck Horne: Right. I'm just curious, pockets of strength kind of geographically?\nDavid Auld: Just from geographically, it's the same markets that are experienced in inflow of buyers. I mean, I think our relocate percentage relocation buyers picked up last quarter again -- there is -- it's -- the market is, I think, evolving maybe is the best word.  There is still a migration out of urban or out of urban into the suburbs. And there's still housing formation taking place that exceeds the supply of homes. It's easy to get caught up in the short term. Our goal here is to stay focused on the long term. And I can tell you, our efforts are in positioning for now Q2, Q3, Q4 and '24 and '25.  And so we're trying to stay out of the short-term reaction, but where do we want to be as this platform continues to develop, improve and get built out.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs.\nSusan Maklari: My first question is going back to the land market a bit. Can you talk about what you're hearing from the sellers? And how are the renegotiations of some of those option contracts coming together. What is the pushback that you're getting if there is any? And how is that progressing and changing as the market is changing?\nPaul Romanowski: Yes, Susan. We have been very proactive with our land sellers and development partners and realistic in terms of expectations with the market as it moves. So largely, they have the understanding and working with us to keep those deals alive where we can. To the extent that it just the underwriting doesn't make sense.  Then we're having to make the decisions that we are. And we will, if needs be, have to walk away from some of those options. But that's why we have the option contracts in place and have made that shift with our land strategy. But by and large, they are reading the headlines like everyone else and understanding of where the market is. They ultimately want to be in a position to move through those lots and so have been relatively well received and receptive to come to the Table Talk.\nDavid Auld: And we treat our attempt to treat our development partners like they're part of the family. I mean, we're very transparent. They understand where we're headed and what our start pace is and what our expectations for that community is.  And coming out of the last downturn, we built relationships that are still existing today and our goals in every community, every division is to be kind of the favorite nation builder. And we are going to treat them better. So we really do believe in the transparency and consistency and audit and direct communication, and that's how you build relationships.\nSusan Maklari: Yes. Okay. And then can you talk a bit about capital allocation? As the market is changing, how are you thinking about the different uses of cash and especially maybe any thoughts on buybacks as we think about 2023?\nBill Wheat: Yes, Sue, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to it all. We're in a good, flexible position to be able to continue to provide returns to our shareholders, both in the terms of increased dividends and share repurchases. Obviously, we'll be adjusting in our business and how much we invest into land and to help home starts and into our rental business based on market conditions.  But at a base level, we do expect to generate an increase in our homebuilding cash from operations in fiscal 2023. And with that, that gives us even more flexibility to make those relative decisions, but continue with more of the same in terms of the balance and the consistency in the approach.\nOperator: Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions this morning. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back to David Auld for closing remarks.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Tom. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our first quarter results in January. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family for another remarkable year. Stay humble, stay hungry, stay focused, go compete and win every day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "During the quarter, we continued to sell homes later in the construction cycle to better ensure the certainty of the home close date and mortgage rate for our homebuyers with almost no sales occurring prior to start of home construction. Our net sales orders in the fourth quarter decreased 15% to 13,582 homes, and our net sales order value was down 10% from the prior year to $5.4 billion.  Our cancellation rate during the fourth quarter was 32% compared to 19% in the prior year quarter and 24% in the third quarter. Our average number of active selling communities increased 8% from the prior year and was flat sequentially. The average sales price on net sales orders in the fourth quarter was $399,600, up 6% from the prior year but down 4% sequentially from the June quarter. In October, as mortgage rates continue to increase, our net sales orders were below prior year levels, and our cancellation rate remained elevated.  As a result, we currently expect our first quarter net sales orders to be down approximately 25% to 35% year-over-year. Bill? We started fewer homes this quarter as we work to position our inventory with an appropriate number of homes relative to market conditions. We started 13,100 homes during the quarter in our homebuilding operations as we began negotiations to lower our construction costs on future new home starts. We ended the year with 46,400 homes in inventory, down 3% from a year ago and down 18% sequentially.  27,200 of our total homes at September 30 were unsold of which 4,400 were completed. For homes we closed this quarter, our construction cycle time increased by a week compared to the third quarter, which reflects continued lingering supply chain issues. However, we are beginning to see some stabilization in cycle times on homes we have recently started, and we expect our cycle time to improve in fiscal 2023.  We expect our start pace in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 to increase versus our fourth quarter pace, and we will adjust our starts in homes and inventory to meet the level of demand in the market. Mike? For the fourth quarter, Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company reported total revenues of $381.4 million, 3,914 lots sold and pretax income of $66.4 million. For the full year, Forestar delivered 17,691 lots, generating $1.5 billion of revenues with a pretax profit margin of 15.5%.  At September 30, Forestar's owned and controlled lot position was 90,100 lots. 59% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer. $250 million of D.R. Horton's lot purchases in the fourth quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had approximately $620 million of liquidity at year-end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 26.9%.  Forestar is well positioned to meet changing market conditions with a strong capitalization, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Bill? Stephen, looking into the first quarter, we are finishing the year with 46,000 homes in inventory and positioned for our goals as we look forward to the year and looking to maintain a similar balance as we work through the first quarter. So expect that our starts will keep pace with our closings through the first quarter. Carl, I don't know that we can get specific in terms of communities or by area. We are finding the market community by community and market by market. Those cuts on base have not been significant to this point. We have focused on financial incentives and interest rate and where needed to, we've been able to adjust price and find the market to drive additional traffic and sales. Yes, Eric. I think as we are out in the market with our trade partners and suppliers working to reduce cost to provide the best value we can to our homebuyers. And we provided the visibility into the first quarter with those gross margins.  What we're seeing which is encouraging early on in that isn't going to come through in homes to close for the next 6 to 9 months towards the end of the year. So we've still got the homes that we have in the ground with that cost structure -- but as we continue to find the market, we expect to see gross margins like we have guided to in the first quarter.

            "name": "Bill Wheat",
            "content": "Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 28.3% . up 140 basis points from the prior year quarter, but down 180 basis points sequentially from the June quarter. On a per square foot basis, our revenues were up 4% sequentially while our stick and brick cost per square foot increased 8% and our lot cost increased 3%. The decrease in our gross margin from the third to fourth quarter reflects the increase in our stick and brick costs and increased incentives provided to homebuyers to ensure the closings of our homes and backlog during the rapid rise in mortgage interest rates. We are offering mortgage interest rate locks and buydowns and other sales incentives to address affordability concerns and to drive sales traffic to our communities.  As we adjust to market conditions and focus on turning our inventory to maximize returns, our incentive levels have continued to increase, and we are adjusting base home prices where necessary. We expect our average sales price and home sales gross margin to decrease from current levels in fiscal 2023.  As a result, we are working with our trade partners and suppliers to reduce our construction costs on new home starts and are pleased with our early progress. Jessica? Financial services pretax income in the fourth quarter was $2.4 million on $134 million of revenue, with a pretax profit margin of 1.8%. As expected, our financial services pretax profit margin decreased this quarter primarily due to a significant pull forward of revenue from rate lock commitments in the third quarter, as we discussed on last quarter's call.  Also during the fourth quarter, there were increased competitive pressures in the mortgage market and increased cost of rate locks provided to customers due to rising rates. For the year, financial services pretax income was $291 million, on $795 million of revenue, representing a 36.6% pretax profit margin.  We expect our financial services pretax profit margin for fiscal 2023 to be higher than the fourth quarter but below the full year of fiscal 2022. During the fourth quarter, 99% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 73% of our homebuyers.  FHA and VA loans accounted for 42% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 87%. First-time homebuyers represented 57% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Mike? Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity to provide a firm foundation for our operating platforms during changes in market conditions and to support our ability to provide consistent returns to our shareholders.  During fiscal 2022, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $1.9 billion and the cumulative cash generated from our homebuilding operations for the past 5 years was $7.5 billion. At September 30, we had $4 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility.  Our liquidity provides significant flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 13.2% at fiscal year-end and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 4.4%. Our consolidated leverage at September 30 was 23.8%, and consolidated leverage net of cash was 15.4%.  We repaid $350 million of senior notes at maturity this quarter and we have $700 million of senior notes that mature during fiscal 2023. At September 30, our stockholders' equity was $19.4 billion, and book value per share was $56.39 and up 35% from a year ago. For the year, our return on equity was 34.5%, an improvement of 290 basis points from 31.6% a year ago.  During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $78.2 million for a total of $316.5 million of dividends paid during the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for $251.7 million for a total of 14 million shares repurchased during the year for $1.1 billion. As a result, our outstanding share count is down 3% from a year ago. Based on our strong financial position, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 11% to $0.25 per share. Jessica? Yes. In terms of the completed specs, Steve, we're in a more normal position now with having some completed specs across more of our communities. That puts us in a good position to sell in the current environment given that buyers are concerned about what their interest rates are going to be. So if we have homes that are ready to move into quickly. They can lock their rates with confidence and close on a known schedule. Yes. Well, really, we're just looking at our plans and what we're seeing right now week to week. We're already 5 weeks into our quarter. So we've got one month in the books. And as we just look at our pace that we're seeing right now and that we believe that that's where we're going to wind up.  There obviously seasonality, if you look at history, has been a little bit unusual in the last couple of years. And I think we're still in a little bit of an unusual time with what has happened with rates. But with our positioning across the board with our community count increasing, we feel like our order position in Q1 is in line with what we guided. Yes, at this point, it's like-for-like. I mean, we're -- as we said, we're increasing incentives and then where necessary community by community, we're adjusting prices. And so I don't believe there's necessarily been a big change in mix yet. And so it's more likely from like-for-like. It start with just looking -- taking a step back and looking at where interest rates were. At the end of the last quarter, mortgage rates were still in the low to mid-5s. And by the end of the quarter, they're in the high 6s.  And subsequent to the end of the quarter, they've now stepped into the 7s. And so we have been adjusting to reflect that. A lot of our incentives have been on the financing side with interest rate locks and buy downs to try to address the payment shock there from the interest rates. And that has increased sequentially through the quarter and has continued into October. So the levels have continued to increase.  We were focused on ensuring that we could close our backlog because we did have a lot of homes scheduled to close in September. And so we believe we did hold off on some price adjustments to ensure that we could close that backlog. And so price adjustments have started to fold in a little more commonly as we've stepped into Q1. So it's been a sequential increase along the way. And then what it will be going forward will depend largely on what happens with rates in the market and then our efforts to meet the market.  We are looking community by community to make adjustments in order to hit our sales pace and turn our inventory and maximize our returns. And so we're looking to find the market and find that pace community by community. And in terms of SG&A overall, with our ASPs expected to come down with revenues down a bit. That's driving an expected increase in our SG&A as a percentage of revenues. We're coming off of all-time lows there and are still positioning ourselves to continue to gain market share.  And so with essentially SG&A spend staying relatively stable with the exception of variable SG&A that moves with revenues or with profitability, that's resulting in the expected increase from all-time lows to a little bit higher level as a percentage of revenues in Q1. There's always some of those costs on both sides, Matt, and that can vary a bit depending on the nature of the incentives. But yes, both of our guides, the guidance for financial services margins going into Q1 as well as the guide for our gross margin on the homebuilding side reflect our anticipation for our level of incentives related to financing. Alan, there's always a balance. We're always balancing what we're doing on pricing and incentives and what that results in margin versus pace and turning inventory to generate the best return. And so we'll be trying to strike that balance across all our communities throughout the year.  It's too early and too uncertain to know what the year may bring in terms of the macro environment in terms of rates, in terms of the general economy to know exactly what those decisions may need to be. And so that's why we're trying to provide as much color as we can around how we're looking at things, but in reality, we don't have really any specificity or visibility to what those conditions may be into the spring and in to '23 so in terms of where the line is on where margin or pricing might need to go or what we're willing to do to push pace. I think remains to be seen. We're going to be making those decisions day to day, week to week as we march forward here. Our base business model is to sell the assets. That still generally will generate the best return. But we're going to make sure that we stay in a position from a capital perspective to be able to manage timing to manage a bit of a slower process, if necessary, due to some disruptions in the capital markets, which typically don't last that long. But we do want to make sure we stay in a flexible position to be able to manage timing when necessary. Yes, Sue, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to it all. We're in a good, flexible position to be able to continue to provide returns to our shareholders, both in the terms of increased dividends and share repurchases. Obviously, we'll be adjusting in our business and how much we invest into land and to help home starts and into our rental business based on market conditions.  But at a base level, we do expect to generate an increase in our homebuilding cash from operations in fiscal 2023. And with that, that gives us even more flexibility to make those relative decisions, but continue with more of the same in terms of the balance and the consistency in the approach."

            "content": "Thank you, Jessica. And good morning. We are also joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officers and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team finished the year with a solid fourth quarter, which included a 20% increase in consolidated pretax income to $2.1 billion and a 19% increase in revenues to $9.6 billion.  Our pretax profit margin for the quarter improved 10 basis points to 21.4%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 26% to $4.67. For the year, consolidated pretax income increased 42% to $7.6 billion on $33.5 billion of revenue, which increased 21%. Our pretax profit margin for the year improved 350 basis points to 22.8%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 45% to $16.51.  We closed a record of 83,518 this year in our whole building and single-family rental operations. And our homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues of 6.8% was an all-time low. Our home many return on inventory for. the year was 42.8% and our consolidated return on the equity was 34.5%. Our strong financial performance during a year of significant challenges and volatility reflects the strength of our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings.  Our homebuilding cash flow from operations for 2022 was $1.9 billion. Over the past 5 years, we have generated $7.5 billion of cash flow from homebuilding operations while growing our consolidated revenues by 138% and our earnings per share by 503%. During this time, we also more than doubled our book value per share, consistently kept our homebuilding leverage under 20% and increased our homebuilding liquidity by $1.8 billion, all while significantly increasing our returns on inventory and equity.  During most of the year, demand for our homes was strong. In June, we began to see a moderation in housing demand that has continued and accelerated through today. The rapid rise in mortgage rates, coupled with high inflation and general economic uncertainty, have made many buyers pause in their home buying decision or choose to not move forward with their home purchase. However, the supply of both new and resell homes at affordable price points remains limited and the demographics supporting housing demand remained favorable.  The uncertainty of this market transition may persist for some time and could get more challenging if mortgage rates continue increasing. However, we are well positioned to meet changing market conditions with our experienced teams, affordable product offerings, flexible lot supply and great trade and supplier relationships. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us financial flexibility.  We will continue to focus on turning our inventory and managing our product offerings, incentives, old pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to beat the market, optimize returns, increase market share and generate increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations. Mike? In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to operate effectively in changing economic conditions and continuing to aggregate market share.  We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts during 2022 were remarkable. This was a year in which we faced construction and operational challenges we have never faced before with periods of unsustainably high demand, followed by historic rise in mortgage rates.  Despite these challenges and market volatility, we closed the most homes in a year in our company's history, completing our 21st year as the largest builder in the United States with record profit and returns, and we are well positioned to continue improving our operations and providing homeownership opportunities to more American families in 2023. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. And Stephen, even with product lines that we've been offering as a spec builder, we release certain houses every month. So when the market is running red hot like it was first half plus of last year. You have a tendency and release the bigger houses because your that dollar profit per house is higher.  Now when a price point becomes much more important to the buyers. We made the release, they go from the 2,300 square foot 2-story down to the 1,600 square foot ranch, which drops the overall ASP of the community without really changing the product or impacting valuations within the community. We control that by which houses we will lease into production. Carl, just -- we've talked about it, I think, for a while, but just the discipline in the industry today is it has translated into across-the-board slowdown in starts. And I think it will allow the trade base material suppliers to kind of get the feet under them.  And I've been accused of being overly optimistic at times, but I do think 2023 if the industry stays disciplined, we will get back into a situation where we can sell a house, now what it's going to go and what are we going to be able to deliver and that will be a good thing. And I'll just add, both when the market was accelerating and now at the center pause, we are very disciplined in how we approach every economic decision on the land side. It's all about creating optionality and efficiency of capital. And that's been our program, and it's going to continue to be our program. And we did suffer through extended bill cycle times. So the houses will be closing in Q1, our houses that were started and bear the cost of high lumber cost. And really trade shortages. So you've got the double whammy of high cost and a more normalized ASP. It depends on what the capital markets and interest rates do. I mean it's -- if we see stabilization in interest rates, I feel very optimistic about what we can do this year. if we continue to see 100 basis point increase quarter-to-quarter to quarter, I think it's going to be a very challenging year. Just from geographically, it's the same markets that are experienced in inflow of buyers. I mean, I think our relocate percentage relocation buyers picked up last quarter again -- there is -- it's -- the market is, I think, evolving maybe is the best word.  There is still a migration out of urban or out of urban into the suburbs. And there's still housing formation taking place that exceeds the supply of homes. It's easy to get caught up in the short term. Our goal here is to stay focused on the long term. And I can tell you, our efforts are in positioning for now Q2, Q3, Q4 and '24 and '25.  And so we're trying to stay out of the short-term reaction, but where do we want to be as this platform continues to develop, improve and get built out. And we treat our attempt to treat our development partners like they're part of the family. I mean, we're very transparent. They understand where we're headed and what our start pace is and what our expectations for that community is.  And coming out of the last downturn, we built relationships that are still existing today and our goals in every community, every division is to be kind of the favorite nation builder. And we are going to treat them better. So we really do believe in the transparency and consistency and audit and direct communication, and that's how you build relationships. Thank you, Tom. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our first quarter results in January. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family for another remarkable year. Stay humble, stay hungry, stay focused, go compete and win every day. Thank you."

            "content": "Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 26% to $4.67 per share. And for the year, earnings per share increased 45% to $16.51. Net income for the quarter increased 22% to $1.6 billion. And for the year, net income increased 40% to $5.9 billion.  Our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 23% and to $9.4 billion on 23,212 homes closed, up from $7.6 billion on 21,937 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $403,700, up 17% from last year and up 3% sequentially. We closed fewer homes than we expected during the fourth quarter due to a slower sales pace, increased cancellations and continued construction delays.  In addition, we estimate that approximately 730 home closings in Florida and South Carolina were delayed from September due to Hurricane Ian. Paul? At September 30, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 573,000 lots, of which 23% were owned and 77% were controlled through purchase contracts. Our total homebuilding lot position decreased by 25,000 lots from June to September. 29% of our total owned lots are finished and 50% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them.  Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. We continually underwrite all of our lot and land purchases based on current and expected home prices and cost. We are actively managing our lot and land pipeline and our investments in lots, land and development to meet our needs during this transition in the housing market.  During the quarter, our homebuilding segment wrote off $34 million of option deposits and due diligence cost related to land and lot option contracts we terminated or expect to terminate in the future. We expect our level of option cost write-offs to remain elevated in fiscal 2023 as we manage our lot portfolio.  Our homebuilding segment had no inventory impairments during the quarter or the year. Our fourth quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $1.5 billion, down 19% from the prior year quarter and down 15% sequentially. Our current quarter investments consisted of $780 million for finished lots, $560 million for land development and $150 million to acquire land. Paul? During fiscal 2022, our rental operations generated $510 million from the sale of 775 multifamily rental units and 774 single-family rental homes, earning pretax income of $202 million. In the fourth quarter, our rental operations generated $21 million of revenues from the sale of 96 single-family rental homes and incurred a pretax loss of $13 million, which were below our expectations going into the quarter.  We had several single-family rental projects in Florida, totaling 562 homes that were scheduled to close in September, but were delayed due to Hurricane Ian. These projects closed in October and will be reflected in our first quarter results. Also one multifamily project and multiple Single-family rental projects that were expected to be sold and closed in the fourth quarter were delayed due to changes in the capital markets that affected the timing of buyers' financing.  Our rental property inventory at September 30 was $2.6 billion, which included approximately $900 million of multifamily rental properties and $1.7 billion of single-family rental properties. As a reminder, our multifamily and single-family rental operating results are separately reported in our rental segment and are not included in our homebuilding segments homes closed revenues or inventories.  We expect our rental operations to generate significant increases in both revenues and profits in fiscal 2023 as our platform matures and expands across more markets. Bill? In most of our communities across the country, Steve, we'll be able to start back smaller homes primarily and change specification levels in those homes. That we start -- have been starting in the most recent quarter and will be starting in the first quarter.  There are some communities that are a little more locked in on product and planned neighborhood phases that it may take 3 to 6 months to work through some changes in the product offerings. But by and large, most of our communities, those changes are starting today, and we'll continue to see that roll out through the next 6 to 9 months. Anecdotally, I was talking to a builder last week. He said he started a house in late August, and he's going to close it in December. So he was pretty excited about that. That's 1 story, 1 house out of a lot of houses. He was really excited about that. So I think we're making the right progress. We're starting to see a little bit of progress pick up in the numbers of October completions. We got a little bit of time back there. Getting all the way back to where we want to be pre-pandemic levels, it might be by the end of the year for the starts that we have later in the year that we're pushing It through, but we're going to make that progress this year. With the option write-off cost, as we evaluate projects at various decision points, we'll be working with various land sellers and developers and where we can't reach an agreement on our accommodation, we're not going to move forward with a bad deal. So if it doesn't make sense and what we expect the market conditions are or will be over the life of the project, that's the reason we have the option arrangement.  So we may have an increase in those costs, but we do take a pretty accurate look at those things, very realistic expectation, and we'll be very quick to move on those. So our approach to the single-family rental business is to build communities of traditional single-family homes. Rent those up and stabilization and then sell them to typically institutional owners of that sort of residential asset class. It's about $1.7 billion, I think, is our current investment in the single-family rental platform. We expect that's going to grow during '23.  Depending upon market conditions, probably not more growth than we had from the end of '21 to the end of '22, but we do expect growth in '23. And we still see that when we complete the homes and they go to market to lease, there's still good demand and people are needing a place to live, and they're choosing to live in these communities. And more of the issue, I think, Alan, related to a change in that buyer. They were -- just to say they were very excited would be an understatement to get their hands on the communities early in fiscal '22. We experienced some of the same construction delays in those products that we did in our single-family for sale business and we had expectations and buyer indications of interest willing to close on the projects prior to completion and prior to full stabilization. The markets come back and more normalized now and their expectation is that we get to a stabilized point before they're -- we're going to get a good valuation. We've seen still see a lot of traffic in our models. We still see people coming in looking to get into a home, a little more challenging with the affordability sometimes to get them qualified. But as we see stabilization in rates. And when we see periods when rates have stabilized and that demand is there, we're able to meet it.  We do see in our sales process is that we're selling the large majority of our homes passed a certain stage of construction, not just from our restriction of that sale, but from the buyer wanting certainty of what that interest rate payment can be within the lock window that can be afforded to them.  And so that's been important for us to accelerate the cycle times, have more inventoried later in the production process that we can deliver within the interest rate lock window."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America\u2019s builder, the largest builder in the United States. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton.\nJessica Hansen: Thank you, Paul and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Before we get started, today\u2019s call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K in its most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning\u2019s earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q tomorrow. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered a strong third quarter, highlighted by a 53% increase in earnings to $4.67 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 54% to $2.2 billion on a 21% increase in revenues and our consolidated pre-tax profit margin improved 540 basis points to 24.8%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 41.7% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 35.1%. These results reflect our experienced teams, their production capabilities and our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint. Housing market demand remained strong during most of the quarter. In June, we began to see a moderation in demand and an increase in cancellations due to the rapid rise in mortgage rate and continued inflationary pressures across most of the economy. The supply of both new and resale homes at affordable prices remains limited. Although demand has slowed from the frenzy pace we experienced over the past year, there are still qualified buyers in the market today as household formations continue and inflationary pressures drive rents higher. 54% of the homes we closed in the past 12 months were priced under $350,000 and our average sales price is approximately $100,000 lower than the average other public homebuilders, positioning us to continue aggregating share. There are still disruptions in the supply chain and tightness in the labor market that continue to delay the completion of our homes under construction. These construction delays and changes in demand environment led us to reduce our full year closing guidance for fiscal 2022. We remain purposefully \u2013 we purposely slowed our number of home starts in the third quarter to position our inventory to align with market conditions. Although the uncertainty of this market transition may persist from some time, we believe we are well positioned to meet changing market conditions with our experienced teams, affordable product offerings, flexible lot supply and their strong trade and supplier relationships. The strength of our balance sheet, liquidity and loan leverage provide a significant financial flexibility and we will continue managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize returns. Mike?\nMike Murray: Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 53% to $4.67 per diluted share compared to $3.06 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 48% to $1.6 billion on consolidated revenue of $8.8 billion, which was in line with our expectations. Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 18% to $8.3 billion on 21,308 homes closed, up from $7 billion on 21,588 homes closed in the prior year. Continued construction delays caused by disruptions in the supply chain and tightness in the labor market caused us to close fewer homes than expected during the quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $391,200, up 20% from the prior year quarter. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: During the quarter, we continued to sell homes later in the construction cycle to better ensure the certainty of the home close date for our homebuyers, with almost no sales occurring prior to start of home construction. In June, our sales pace slowed and our cancellation rate increased when mortgage interest rates rose significantly. The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 24% compared to 17% in the prior year quarter. As a result, our net sales orders in the third quarter decreased 7% to 16,693 homes and our total net sales order value increased 8% from the prior year to $6.9 billion. Our average number of active selling communities increased 5% from the prior year quarter and was up 1% sequentially. The average sales price of net sales orders in the third quarter was $415,800, up 16% from the prior year quarter. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the third quarter was 30.1%, up 120 basis points sequentially from the March quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were up 3.9% sequentially, while stick and brick cost per square foot increased 2.4%. The increase in our gross margin from March to June reflects the broad strength of the housing market we experienced most of this year. The strong demand for homes, combined with a limited supply allowed us to raise prices and maintain a very low level of sales incentives in most of our communities. As we have already mentioned, demand has moderated in June and to-date in July. As we adjust to current market conditions, we expect the pace of our sales price increases to slow during the fourth quarter and for our incentive levels to increase from historical lows. To address affordability concerns, we are offering mortgage interest rate locks and buy-downs to our buyers and we are beginning to offer other sales incentives as necessary on selected homes and inventory and to drive sales traffic to our communities. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be lower than the third quarter. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: In the third quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 6.6%, down 50 basis points from 7.1% in the prior year quarter. This quarter, our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was lower than any quarter in our history and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring their infrastructure adequately supports our business. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: We purposefully slowed our home starts to 17,900 homes this quarter, as we work to position our inventory with an appropriate number of homes relative to market conditions. We ended the quarter with 56,400 homes in inventory, up 19% from a year ago and down 6% sequentially. 27,200 of our total homes at June 30 were unsold, of which 1,400 were completed. For homes we closed this quarter, our construction cycle time increased by roughly 1 week compared to the second quarter as supply chain issues remain challenging as they have for the past year. However, we are beginning to see some stabilization in cycle times on homes we have recently started. During the quarter, we will evaluate demand and adjust our homes in inventory and starts pace to meet current market conditions. Mike?\nMike Murray: At June 30, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 600,000 lots, of which 22% were owned and 78% were controlled through purchase contracts. 24% of our total owned lots are finished and 47% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our large capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our third quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $1.75 billion, of which $890 million was for finished lots, $680 million was for land development, and $180 million was to acquire land. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: For the third quarter, Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company reported total revenues of $308.5 million and pre-tax income of $52.7 million. For the full year, Forestar now expects to deliver 17,000 lots and generate $1.4 billion of revenue with a pre-tax profit margin of greater than 14%. Forestar\u2019s owned and controlled lot position at June 30 totaled 97,000 lots, essentially flat with a year ago. 59% of Forestar\u2019s owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer D.R. Horton. $258 million of our finished lots purchased in the third quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had approximately $500 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 32.8%. Forestar is well-positioned to meet changing market conditions with its strong capitalization, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Financial services pre-tax income in the third quarter was $128.3 million, with a pre-tax profit margin of 50.5% compared to $70.3 million and 37.3% in the prior year quarter. The increase in our financial services pre-tax profit margin this quarter was primarily due to a significant acceleration of interest rate lot commitments. During the third quarter, a majority of our buyers in backlog for expected fourth quarter closings entered into interest rate lot commitments. These lots were executed earlier than normal due to the increase in mortgage rates, which resulted in higher-than-normal financial services revenue in the third quarter. This revenue acceleration will likely cause our financial services revenues and profits to be lower than normal in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, 99% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 69% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 41% of the mortgage company\u2019s volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 56% of the closings handled by the mortgage company this quarter. Mike?\nMike Murray: Our rental operations generated pre-tax income of $43 million on revenues of $110 million in the third quarter related to the sale of 1 multi-family rental property consisting of 298 units and 1 single-family rental property totaling 84 homes. During the 9 months ended June 30, our rental operations generated pre-tax income of $215 million on revenues of $489 million. Our rental property inventory at June 30 was $2 billion compared to $760 million a year ago. Rental property inventory at June 30 included approximately $700 million of multi-family rental properties and $1.3 billion of single-family rental properties. As a reminder, our multi-family and single-family rental sales and inventories are reported in our rental segment and are not included in our homebuilding segments homes closed, revenues or inventories. We continue to expect that our rental operations will generate approximately $800 million in revenues during fiscal 2022. We plan to continue growing our rental inventories as we position our rental operations to be a significant contributor to our revenues, profits, and returns in future years. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. At June 30, we had $2.8 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.6 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage was 17% at the end of June and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 12.1%. Our consolidated leverage at June 30 was 24.9% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 19.3%. At June 30, our stockholders\u2019 equity was $18.1 billion and book value per share was $52, up 35% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended June, our return on equity was 35.1% compared to 29.5% a year ago. During the first 9 months of the year, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $125 million. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $79.2 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in August. We repurchased 4.7 million shares of common stock for $310 million during the quarter for a total of 10.5 million shares repurchased fiscal year-to-date for $854.2 million, an increase of 29% compared to the same period a year ago. As a result, our outstanding share count at June 30 was down 3% from a year ago. We still expect our outstanding share count will be approximately 3% lower at the end of fiscal 2022 and the end of fiscal 2021. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: We are providing guidance for our fourth fiscal quarter. However, due to the current uncertainty in the market, the ranges for our volume and margin guidance are wider than normal. Based on the projected completion dates of our homes under construction and current market conditions, we expect to generate consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter of $10 billion to $10.8 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 23,500 to 25,500 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 29% to 29.8% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues to be around 6.3%. We anticipate our financial services pre-tax profit margin in the fourth quarter to be less than 20% due to the timing of revenues from interest rate lot commitments as we discussed earlier. We expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24% in the fourth quarter. We plan to continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, our rental operations, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity and consistently paying dividends and repurchasing shares. David?\nDavid Auld: In closing, our results and position reflecting our experienced teams and production capabilities, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across our multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions and continue aggregating market share. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. We are incredibly well positioned to continue improving our operations and providing home ownership opportunities to more American families. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from John Lovallo from UBS. John, your line is live.\nJohn Lovallo: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. First question is in early June, you had mentioned needing about 18,000 orders to hit the full year delivery target. I mean, the market has obviously changed since then, but you have delivered 59,000 year-to-date. There is another 29,000 in backlog, which would give you 88,000 deliveries without even converting any of the fourth quarter orders. So what I am trying to understand is does the lower delivery outlook reflect concerns about cancellations, construction delays or both?\nJessica Hansen: Both. We have had continued construction delays, but we also recognize the market has softened. And so we feel like we are very well positioned to deliver on what our new guide is for closings. But as I alluded to, I mean, our ranges are bigger than they normally would be, because of some of the uncertainty in the market. And so there is upside to our closings guide. There is also downside. I mean, we really are going to see how it plays out as we work throughout the quarter, but we are confident in our people are going to continue to improve and we will ultimately see some improvement in our construction cycle times and start converting houses to closings.\nJohn Lovallo: Great. Thank you. And then what has been your ability to resell the cancellations and has there been a meaningful ASP or margin hit to those sales?\nMike Murray: It\u2019s been \u2013 still been very strong, John. We have still been able to resell those cancellations. It just doesn\u2019t happen immediately. By the time you resell it and re-qualify a buyer through the mortgage process, it could be a 4 to 8-week to 12-week process sometimes. But we are still seeing good demand for the homes that we have.\nJohn Lovallo: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl, your line is live.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask about the change in cancellations as you guys look at this \u2013 is your sense that this is really just a mathematics issue, high rates, higher prices, folks can\u2019t afford or is this more psychological? In other words, folks are a little scared of what the value of their house might do? They are concerned about the economy or their jobs. I\u2019d just like sort of your sense, especially compared to past cycles of how you see the acceleration in cans, which you would attribute that to?\nDavid Auld: Hi, John. I think it\u2019s probably a little of both. I think payment shock was part of it. Toward the end of June, middle of June, we had a 100 basis point increase in long-term rates over about a 3 or 4-day period. I think that impacted it. Most people still remember 2008, \u201809, \u201810 when worst housing market I\u2019ve ever seen and values deteriorated, which again, not typical in our history of our country. So I will pause. I mean, I feel very good about where we are headed market wise and the response we are getting as we continue to sell houses out there. So \u2013 but you increase rates 100 basis points in 4 days, it does impact higher psyche.\nCarl Reichardt: Yes. Okay. Thanks, David. And then second question, just on the delays you are seeing in terms of vertical construction. How are delays related to horizontal? So is \u2013 are you seeing issues that would prevent you from getting the communities open that you have internally in your plan or if that were to change, would that be more a function just of a slowing market? Thanks.\nPaul Romanowski: I think it\u2019s a little bit of both. But yes, I mean we have seen delays in the permitting process and bringing communities online in addition to the delays that we have seen on the vertical side and so, if you look at that in aggregate and hence our guide to lower than what we had previously been guiding to. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s getting necessarily better today. Any different than we are starting to see it stabilize some on the vertical side, the horizontal side, I think will continue to be a challenge in terms of bringing new communities online on time.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks, Paul. Thanks, everybody.\nJessica Hansen: Thanks, Carl.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is live.\nStephen Kim: Great. Thanks very much, guys. Yes, I wanted to talk a little bit about your inventory management. You give a lot of statistics that are very helpful in terms of spec levels. Your finished specs are, I think, 1,400 still pretty well below normal. Your under construction specs are quite high, and I assume that\u2019s due to the cycle time. So \u2013 and then you gave some numbers around the land inventories \u2013 land spend. So I wanted to just ask where should we be thinking your finished specs? What is the desired level that you want to get to? And as that number increases, what should we expect to see for your under construction spec levels? And with the overarching view to try to get a sense for where you\u2019re construction, your CIP, construction and process inventory in dollars may go over the next couple of quarters as you see it?\nBill Wheat: Sure, Steve. In terms of our completed spec homes, we\u2019re always looking to sell those as quickly as we can. We\u2019ve been at abnormally low levels. Still the 1,400 we\u2019re at today is still relatively low. But if you look historically, we\u2019ve typically been at levels quite a bit higher. So I think we\u2019re seeing a return to a more normal level on completed specs, but the goal will always be to not have more than one or two completed specs at the community and continue to make sure that we move through those, and that they don\u2019t age. In terms of our overall production, historically, when we had historically normal cycle times, you could anticipate us turning our housing inventory, our number of homes and inventory twice each year. We\u2019ve been a little slower than that this year with the elongated cycle times. But we\u2019re looking to into next year hopeful that we will see the improvements in cycle times and could get to a more normal level there as well. And so we\u2019re adjusting our starts to reflect the current moderation in demand, and we will be monitoring demand very closely to determine the appropriate level of starts going forward. But then as part of that total production that we look to turn twice historically, our spec levels as a percentage of that total have ranged from the low 40s to the low 50s. And so right now, we\u2019re kind of in that normal total spec range overall. And \u2013 so we will just be adjusting our SAR space, looking at our overall homes and inventory and our spec levels and alongside demand over the coming months to position ourselves as best we can through the current market.\nStephen Kim: So just to clarify on that, Bill, do you think that your construction in progress in dollars is likely to rise as we go forward here over the next couple of quarters?\nBill Wheat: I think on a cost per home basis, we have been seeing that rise with inflation. And so I think there is an element of that, that yes, that will remain. But our homes and inventory, our total number of homes and inventory expected to decline in the fourth quarter from the current level. And that\u2019s fairly normal for us in the fourth quarter as well as we deliver more homes typically than we start in the fourth quarter.\nStephen Kim: Yes. Okay. So you got some seasonal factors there. Shifting gears to the incentive levels, amidst this buyer strike that we got right now. I guess I\u2019m curious, where the level of incentives are versus what is normal in your business, recognizing that recently, it\u2019s been incredibly low. But where are we now relative to what you would consider normal? And how much higher than normal do you expect to go near-term, meaning in the next quarter or so?\nDavid Auld: I would say right now, we\u2019re probably still lower than what we would consider a normal incentive. They are still a lot of buyers out there chasing homes, finding qualified buyers a little more difficult. Actually, reopening in the \u2013 some of our sales efforts has been interesting. So \u2013 but overall, I\u2019d say the incentive program today is probably less than normal. I anticipate at some point, it will return to normal. There is still not a lot of inventory out there for people to buy.\nJessica Hansen: And where they go will ultimately be tied to market demand, and we will do what we typically do, which is manage it market by market, community by community to maximize returns.\nStephen Kim: Absolutely. Well, thanks very much, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Eric, your line is live.\nEric Bosshard: Good morning, thank you. Just curious if you could drill down a bit more to the last 30 or 45 days where you\u2019ve seen the inflection? And I guess, specifically, I understand the comment, there is still a lot of buyers out there, but curious what has happened with cancellation rates? Obviously, the 24 in the quarter feels like that\u2019s more elevated in this more recent period of time. Where has that been? And what is the expectation for that as we look into 4Q?\nBill Wheat: Cancellation rates during the quarter. In the first part of the quarter, they were in the normal range. For us, we had been for a while below normal. So it was in the normal range. And then it did definitely increased sharply in June, which then brought the overall average for the quarter up. As far as today in July, I would still say it\u2019s elevated, has not continued on a trend much higher, but it still is at an elevated level. And so we\u2019re monitoring that along with our gross sales activity and responses to incentives and other affordability measures we\u2019re trying to provide for our homebuyers and we will be monitoring that very closely going forward. But like we\u2019ve said thus far, we\u2019re still seeing a very good level of core demand out there. We\u2019re reselling our cancellations rather smoothly thus far. And so we\u2019re hopeful that we will find some stability here in the demand environment in our sales and cans environment over the next few months.\nEric Bosshard: And then secondly, if you could, in terms of either mix or geography, I\u2019m curious if there is any variation or any difference in behavior on sort of entry level versus within the move up or higher end of your price points? So from a geographic standpoint, is there any differentiation or is the higher rates had a similar impact across price points, product and geographies?\nMike Murray: I think there is certainly more impact potentially on the buyers that are mortgage rate sensitive, but we still saw 56% of our closings were first-time homebuyers in the quarter. And we closed a substantial number of homes in June to those first-time homebuyers that need a place to live. We\u2019ve been able to provide some interest rate lot products from our mortgage company that\u2019s given those buyers comfort and certainty around payment, but they are still buying a home out of need and necessity. Buyers that are more discretionary in nature. And as question earlier alluded to qualification versus value expectations, they are probably more in the value expectations side of taking a pause this summer and seeing where the housing market goes. But the biggest part of our business is focused primarily on the first-time buyer, first-time move up and providing an affordable home. So we\u2019re still seeing people buying our homes out of need.\nEric Bosshard: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan. Mike, your line is live.\nMike Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate all the comments and guidance. I wanted to drill down a little bit if possible on the gross margin guidance and the current rate of incentives that we\u2019ve heard have increased over the last 1 or 2 months when we\u2019ve heard in our conversations with different private builders, incentives are up anywhere from 100 to 300 basis points. Your guidance midpoint is down only about roughly 100 bps sequentially. So, seeing that you\u2019re at the lower end of that let\u2019s say, if that range is accurate, the 100 to 300, so I just want to make \u2013 does that make sense to you in terms of those comments that make sense in terms of what we\u2019ve heard. And do you think this increase that you\u2019ve had in the last 1 or 2 months, has that, in effect, kind of brought sales pace back into a desired level or are you seeing incentives continue to rise as we\u2019re working through in July?\nBill Wheat: Mike, I\u2019ll start with the gross margin on these guys may chime in a little bit more on the trends on incentives going forward. Gross margin guide itself. It starts with our backlog as we enter quarter. And as we mentioned, we had a lot of buyers that locked in their mortgage rates that they are expecting to close in Q4. And so we have more visibility to those homes that we expect to close in Q4 to the margins we expect to see there. So that\u2019s the biggest piece of our visibility into our guide. We do still have some homes that we are selling in the current quarter that we will close, and those homes are more likely to be a little more exposed to the current incentive environment. And so we\u2019d expect there to be a few more incentives in some of those homes, which has been factored into the guide as well. And so I think you have many comments in the market around level of incentives, I don\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t say those are inaccurate at all. But our closings in the coming quarter will partially reflect some of the current environment, but will also reflect some buyers that are in backlog and have their rates locked and marching towards closing in Q4.\nMike Murray: The margin guidance, we talked about earlier is also reflective of the cost environment that we faced over the past 6 to 9 months as we started homes at different times and at different lumber pricing, frankly, was a big driver of it. General inflationary pressures across most of our cost categories, but certainly, the lumber has had a great deal of variability over the past 12 months. It rose significantly, fell off a bit, it went back up again and now it\u2019s back down. So as those homes push through the production process and deliver, they are going to have an impact on the gross margin as well.\nMike Rehaut: Great. No, that\u2019s very helpful. Appreciate that color. Secondly, you highlighted earlier in your prepared remarks about the continued levels of share repurchase. How should we \u2013 I know it\u2019s a little forward-looking. And you\u2019ve been on a pace over the last couple of years where you\u2019ve been reducing your share count low single digits. To the extent that we\u2019re in, obviously, a little bit of a softer market and that moderately softer levels continue. How should we think about share repurchase for fiscal \u201823. And assuming things don\u2019t fall off a cliff, but they are obviously still at a more moderate rate. Would you dial it back or given the strength of your balance sheet and still strong cash flows and very healthy margins, should we expect some level of continued share repurchase in \u201823?\nDavid Auld: Our plan from day 1 has been consistent over time, balanced with supporting the homebuilding inventories and funding the growth. I don\u2019t see that changing in \u201823, \u201824 or \u201825. We just \u2013 our goal is to be out there, operating consistently growing our market share, expanding homeownership opportunity for as many families as we possibly can. And I don\u2019t see that changing.\nMike Rehaut: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Matthew, your line is live.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. Just another one on gross margins, asked a different way here, I know the visibility to \u201823 is limited here. But I guess in an environment where incentives do return to normal, as David alluded to earlier, just curious if you could outline kind of how the gross margin of the business might look in such a scenario?\nBill Wheat: Well, anytime we see a change in market conditions. And right now, we do expect the level of price increases to moderate and start to flatten out. We\u2019ve already talked a bit about incentives rising. The top line is impacted quicker than our costs are. So we usually see two or three quarters where our higher costs are still coming through, and that puts some pressure on near-term margins. But then as that inflection begins, it opens the door up to be able to start addressing on the cost side. We\u2019ve already seen some relief from lumber, which that will start to be more of a tailwind for us in coming quarters. And then other categories really beginning with labor becomes an opportunity as well. And so our goal will be to do as much as we can on the cost side to offset the impact that we see from prices flattening and incentive levels to maintain as good a margin as we can balance with pace to generate the best returns that we can generate. Where that will be, will depend on \u2013 will be dependent on the strength of the housing market and demand.\nDavid Auld: Ultimately, it\u2019s going to come down to what drives the best return for that individual flag. Same formula we\u2019ve been working on \u2013 working with for the \u2013 coming out of the downturn. Our long-term focus is returning the best we can with the inventory that we put out there, and that\u2019s not going to change. We deemphasized gross margins when we could deliver every house we wanted to build as the construction process became more and more challenging we expanded margins because we were delivering every house we possibly can. At the end of the day, it\u2019s returned, it\u2019s ROI, it\u2019s ROE. That\u2019s our focus.\nMatthew Bouley: Got you. That\u2019s really helpful, gentlemen. Thank you for that. And then second one, I have to ask the impairment question, which obviously at a 30% gross margin. We\u2019re not near anything like that at this point, but given it is an investor concern here. So I guess the way to ask the question is within your portfolio, certainly, there is going to be communities below the average by definition. But is there any \u2013 would you be able to highlight or point to any portion of the portfolio that might be more vulnerable to something like impairments where the home price declines may not be as severe as you might look on a national average just basically, what portion of the portfolio would you consider to be potentially more vulnerable to impairments, the longer that this type of softness in housing persists? Thank you.\nJessica Hansen: Sure, Matt. I think you led with the most important point, which is we\u2019re starting at a 30% gross margin. So that really signifies that we\u2019re a long way off from any sort of broad-based impairments. It would take significant margin erosion from declines in home prices. We don\u2019t have any projects right now that are what we deem internally on our watch list because they are approaching a gross margin that we would have to do a more thorough impairment analysis and to really see even any sort of pickup in a watch list before we even get to the point of impairments, we\u2019d have to see a pretty big home price decline. So I wouldn\u2019t say there is any one piece of our portfolio right now. that we would point to as being at higher risk than others. But certainly, as we continue to move through a market transition, if there are certain markets where home prices come down further than others, those would be the ones we\u2019d point to first.\nMatthew Bouley: Alright. Thank you, Jessica. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Alan, your line is live.\nAlan Ratner: Hey, guys. Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. First one on incentives. And I know it\u2019s early innings as far as any meaningful increases there. But curious what you\u2019re seeing on the elasticity of those incentives where you are offering them? Are there certain markets where perhaps the incentives have been more effective at driving increased traffic and orders? And are there markets where based on what you\u2019re seeing so far, demand seems less elastic or maybe even inelastic to any increase in incentives.\nPaul Romanowski: Alan, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a definite pattern as of yet. I think that the incentives that we have put out, as we\u2019ve stated, are still at this point below historical norms are being effective in terms of driving the traffic. Traffic in total has slowed just based on the market conditions and the change that we\u2019ve already talked about. But generally speaking, those incentives have accomplished what we\u2019ve been trying to do in terms of driving additional traffic and converting the homes as our cancellation rate has rise. We\u2019ve been able to convert those homes that are completed, and we still have a lot of buyers with a near-term need to get into a house. And so we will adjust as the market needs to flag-by-flag community-by-community drive the returns we\u2019re looking for. And the pace is the driver of that.\nAlan Ratner: Got it. Appreciate that. Second question, I would love to drill in a little bit on your build for rent business. Only one communities sold this quarter, which was a bit lower than the last few quarters. But a lot of people have kind of talked about the \u2013 maybe the bull point where if kind of the core demand does soften for an extended period of time that there is all this capital on the sidelines targeting build for rent that perhaps might be able to fill at least part of that void. So curious what you\u2019re seeing in your conversations with build for rent investors and the parties that you\u2019re selling these communities to. Have you seen any shift in their appetite and as you market the next round of communities? I know you have some guidance for sales in the fourth quarter or maybe even thinking about early \u201823. What\u2019s your expectation for the demand in the BFR space?\nMike Murray: We still see very strong interest when we take communities to market and still very encouraged by that. Certainly, the valuation equation is heavily impacted by long-term financing costs for those investors. So \u2013 and in periods of volatility in those costs in their underwriting. It\u2019s a little longer to get the process completed with these transactions, but there is still tremendous demand for them. And they are still on the front end of it, as we see these communities begin to complete units and we open up to leasing, we\u2019re still seeing strong demand for people moving into the homes. And so that\u2019s ultimately very encouraging as we\u2019re creating cash flow assets that there is, as you mentioned, a lot of capital interested in investing in those assets today.\nAlan Ratner: A follow-up on that if I could. Have you shifted any communities that are earlier in the planning process from for sale to for rent when you look at your total lot pipeline, pushing 600,000 lots if you are selling 80,000 homes a year, which is kind of your run rate for the year, roughly, it would seem like that\u2019s a lot of land, probably more land than you need and perhaps there is an opportunity to shift some of that to BFR more so than perhaps you thought a quarter or two quarters ago?\nMike Murray: We certainly evaluate that in terms of demand for the \u2013 for sale in our portfolio. If pace slows down in a given market, then our land position gets a little longer in that market, looking for ways we always thought build to rent is a great way to more rapidly monetize land positions without cannibalizing for sale business because it\u2019s a different user of that real estate and different owner of the real estate. So, it brings other capital pools to bear. So, we certainly have repurposed projects that we originally may have identified 3 years to 4 years ago, is for sale. Today, they are being executed as for rent, and that process continues. I mean we underwrite our land buys on the basis of a for-sale purchase. We do not look at the valuations from a build-to-rent aspect in underwriting land buys.\nAlan Ratner: Appreciate that color. Thanks Mike.\nMike Murray: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Truman, your line is live.\nTruman Patterson: Hey. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Hoping you all could just give an update on your June order exit rate as well as what you are seeing in July? And then following up on Eric\u2019s question, one of your peers kind of gave a lay of the land based on metro or even regional performance. Just hoping you can give some color on the out or underperforming metros?\nJessica Hansen: I think we are all looking at each other. Can you specify your first question on exit rate again, so we make sure we answer the right question.\nTruman Patterson: Yes. Your June orders. Just trying to get an update there, what kind of the decline was and how July is trending?\nJessica Hansen: Okay. Well, we don\u2019t ever speak to monthly orders specifically. That being said, we did guide at a conference in early June that we expected our sales to be essentially flat for the quarter on a year-over-year basis, and we came in down 7%. So, that does tell you that in most of June because rates spiked pretty quickly after we made those comments, most of June, we did see softening and June would have been our worst sales month of the quarter, as a result of both the moderation in demand and the pickup in cancellation rates that we have already talked to. And then I think Bill said earlier in one of his Q&A responses that our can rate hasn\u2019t necessarily gotten worse since June, but it has stayed elevated into July, and sales have continued to be a challenge, but we do still see a decent level of demand out in the market and are selling and closing homes every day so far in July.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Perfect. And then any color on any kind of problem metros or metros you are seeing outside strength?\nDavid Auld: Yes. Texas, Florida, I think are going to continue to drive national numbers. General lines has continued to be stable and strong for us, we are really \u2013 from a historical norm, from my history with the company and my history in the industry. It\u2019s a good mark. I mean to talk about some areas being stressed or problematic. It just doesn\u2019t exist today. Is there a pause, is there a reset in kind of the prior expectation, yes, absolutely. Payment shock when rates go up 100 basis points in four days, yes, absolutely. But demographics, demand, the desire to get out of the areas, all those are enforced and continuing and our expectations for next year or that we are going to get back on pace. So, all good in D.R. Horton.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Perfect. And then Matt asked about kind of owned-land impairments. But I want to ask a little differently. You all really transformed your balance sheet compared to the prior cycle, heavy option land position. Have you all started to rework any of those deals? And what sort of market conditions would you really need to see in order to perhaps walk from any of the more recent contracts?\nMike Murray: We are constantly evaluating the land portfolio. That\u2019s one of the benefits of having the option position we have is that we get the chance to continue to make decisions about projects as we move through them. Those land projects that we have \u2013 and neighborhood projects that we have identified in the portfolio, very important to the future deliveries of the company, and we are going to continue to work through those neighborhoods. But everybody we work with understands that we are all working together in the same market conditions and a change at the front end of selling homes to home buyers will ripple all the way through the value chain, and it starts ultimately with the land. So, we will continue to rework our portfolio as needed. And we always are continually making adjustments to reflect current on-the-ground conditions, whether it\u2019s an acceleration or deceleration of the given project.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Thank you all.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the next question is coming from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Susan, your line is live.\nSusan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning everyone. My first question is going back to lumber. There are some changes that are coming through in the future, better aligning them with how builders actually take the lumber in. Given the volatility that you are seeing and the uncertainty in demand, are you considering \u2013 or would you think about perhaps starting to hedge some of those costs?\nMike Murray: Is that a sales pitch for Goldman? Sorry.\nSusan Maklari: No.\nMike Murray: We have historically not tried to hedge any of those positions, and we work with our local suppliers and partners to bring the lumber to the job sites to the best value possible. We have not yet seen how those markets are going to function or evaluate it yet if that\u2019s a possibility for us. But we will certainly look at things that make sense to offset risk in our business.\nSusan Maklari: Yes. Okay. I appreciate that. My second question is on land spend. You obviously talked about what you allocated in the quarter. As you think about the upcoming year, any initial thoughts on where that may go and how to think about it relative to where you have been this year and perhaps last year even?\nBill Wheat: Yes. Susan, we only own about 130,000 lots today. So, we are constantly buying lots more and more, a larger percentage of our purchases are of finished lots and that we essentially put into production almost on a just-in-time basis. So, we will be continuing to replenish our owned lot supply along the way. As Mike said, adjusting our optioned portfolio on a constant basis. So, I would expect there will still be a steady reinvestment and replenishment of our land pipeline. Obviously, as we see how the current market conditions transition here, we will be evaluating the depth and demand, the strength of the demand and then positioning our land and our lots and our homes and inventory to match those conditions as we go into next year. And our spend will then align with the plans that we set.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. Alright. Great. Thank you. Good luck with everything.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo Securities. Deepa, your line is live.\nDeepa Raghavan: Hi. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I had a follow-up on the prior question asked by Truman on market color. Wasn\u2019t clear if that was a volume comment that you provided or pricing? I had a question on pricing, though. Can you talk through any surprise elements within your orders pricing trends, moderation or decline or were you surprised the resilience in some of your markets?\nDavid Auld: Surprised. I don\u2019t know that surprised, it\u2019s probably a great turn. We are responding to and it\u2019s my belief, I think our belief that buyer demand is \u2013 I mean there is still more housing formations, job creations and there are homes being built. And so I think we have talked about elongated cycles in the past. This pause disruption, could it get worse, absolutely. But I have been doing this a long time. And in a conversation with one of our regional presidents a couple of days ago, we were talking about the market. And he and I both have been doing this a long time. Both have been in sales models when selling homes was very difficult. And this is probably the second best market ever. So, I guess I understand that there is uncertainty out there. But when you have people that want to buy homes, I mean we are going to adjust, we are going to figure out how to put those people in homes. That\u2019s what we do. And so that\u2019s market-by-market, flag-by-flag, division-by-division, however you want to cut it up, we are going to build, sell, start \u2013 we are going to start and close up [ph]. And create home ownership opportunities. That\u2019s what the mission of this company is. So, that\u2019s what we are going to do.\nBill Wheat: And Dave, it\u2019s in the current trends, it\u2019s still very early to determine exactly what magnitude of adjustments may occur. We are still evaluating that on a week-by-week basis when \u2013 as David said earlier, when rates spiked, there is an adjustment period. And we are in that adjustment period right now where buyers are \u2013 there is a little bit of a rate shock or a payment shock. And so they are adjusting expectations and we are going to how to adjust with them to make sure we get them into the homes that they want to purchase.\nDeepa Raghavan: Fair enough. My follow-up is on start space this quarter. The 17,000 starts pace, how much was trimmed by supply chain issues. And any thoughts on what could be a reasonable start pace near-term? I mean look, frankly, I am aware you are unable to provide volume thoughts into 2023, but under what circumstances would you expect to grow over the 85,000 units guided here for 2022, just based on the start space that you have been printing recently?\nPaul Romanowski: Deepa, looking at our starts and we purposefully reduced that start pace over the last quarter, again, to meet the market, and that\u2019s largely from production and production capacity. We had big start pace in the prior quarters leading into this and with continued challenges in the supply chain and the labor markets, giving our chance, giving our people and our vendors the ability to catch up and move those homes forward. And on a go-forward basis, we will adjust those start paces to market conditions. So, as we have mentioned, we are still early in this pause period an adjustment. And as we find our base, we will maintain start pace that we want to drive the units and deliveries we are looking for.\nJessica Hansen: And too early to say anything on fiscal \u201823, we will reassess in November. If we have a little bit more certainty in the market, then hopefully, we will be in a position to give some high-level guidance for the full year, but it\u2019s going to depend on the market. And if it\u2019s settled out, and we feel comfortable doing that or not. We are always going to position ourselves to grow and consolidate market share. But it\u2019s really going to be up to market conditions and what makes the most sense in terms of us maximizing our returns.\nBill Wheat: Part of that positioning going into next year is our number of homes and inventory. We have 56,000 homes in inventory, today, and we are guiding to close between 23.5 and 25.5 in the coming quarters. So, we are going to go into the year with inventory as well and we will supplement it with our start pace in Q4 and beyond to then drive to the volume levels that will drive next year.\nDeepa Raghavan: Fair enough. Thanks very much and good luck.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup. Anthony, your line is live.\nAsher Sohnen: Hi. This is Asher Sohnen on for Anthony. And I just wanted to ask, I think you are currently selling homes on land that was largely at least partially put under control prior to the pandemic. So, just looking at the prices for lots that you are putting under contract now and then trying to hold all else, would it be possible to sort of quantify how those gross margins on these new lots might compare to current gross margins? And just generally, very roughly how long before you start to exhaust that favorable cost basis?\nJessica Hansen: Land prices vary across the country and the rate of increases in land prices have varied. So, we have talked to you each quarter, what our lot costs have done on a square foot basis, and we have really not seen more than a low to mid-single digit increase in terms of what\u2019s flowing through our closings each quarter. And with the vast amount of land we are buying on a quarter-to-quarter basis and it all being contracted for at different dates over it maybe in the last year, it may be in the last 3 years that we contracted for it. we would expect to continue to see a relatively modest increase in lot costs flowing through in our future quarter closings.\nAsher Sohnen: Understood. Thanks. And then you slowed starts this quarter to better sort of match anticipated demand, if I heard correctly. So, just on a strategic level, do you see D.R. Horton is maybe trying to gain share in the housing slowdown, or how do you think about the level of discipline around supply/demand maybe among your peers and competitors compared to prior cycles?\nDavid Auld: I think compared to prior cycles, the entire industry is much more disciplined, much more focused on cash flow, much more focused on return, accelerating land prices. So, you look at our starts, you look at the industry starts, in June, I think very, very fast reaction to the rate increases. We will see what happens in July and August. But our expectation is that you are going to see starts stay disciplined. And when the rates stabilize and we can adjust pricing and offerings to the buyers and they are comfortable buying them, then I think you will see starts tick back up. But it\u2019s just a different world today than it was in \u201804, \u201805, \u201806. You have got a real business that\u2019s building assets today.\nBill Wheat: And then specific to market share gains, that\u2019s always a core part of our strategy.\nAsher Sohnen: Okay. Thanks. I will pass it over.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America. Rafe, your line is live.\nRafe Jadrosich: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments on the July trend. In June, you talked about the moderation with the affordability shock and the spike in mortgage rate. Has demand sort of continued to decelerate, or have we seen sort of a stabilization and reset?\nMike Murray: Hard to say. It\u2019s early into the quarter as to where we are. The past few summers, we have not seen much seasonal falloff. This year, I think we are seeing a little more seasonality. But we still see traffic in the models. We still see people out buying homes. It\u2019s not a zero environment. People are still moving into the homes that we complete and close. It\u2019s probably coming back to a little more normal seasonality, where the middle of the summer gets a little bit slower from a traffic perspective.\nRafe Jadrosich: Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then you commented on the material cost outlook and labor potentially coming down. Are you seeing land prices come down? Has there been any relief on that side with the slower demand in the market?\nPaul Romanowski: No, we really \u2013 I think as you look at this process, and again, we are really at a pause in the market. And one of the last things we see to come down is going to be the land. It\u2019s a little slower to react than first, we probably see it in the labor on a localized basis and the materials and then land will adjust over time based on market conditions, just like it always has. It\u2019s going to rise and flow a little behind housing demand.\nDavid Auld: I will also say, Rafe. We have a very deep pipeline of our plan that we have controlled for multiple years. And it does put us in a position where if we see the imbalance in land pricing versus future market expectations, we don\u2019t have to buy it. We have got the ability to pause in our land acquisition for an extended period if we think that\u2019s the prudent decision.\nRafe Jadrosich: Good. That makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to hand the call back to David Auld for closing remarks.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Paul. We appreciate everybody\u2019s time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our fourth quarter results in November. And to the D.R. Horton family, you are a driving force in the creation of affordable housing in this country. What you do is important. Don Horton and the entire executive team, thank you for your focus and hard work. Let\u2019s finish this year and move on to \u201823.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 53% to $4.67 per diluted share compared to $3.06 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 48% to $1.6 billion on consolidated revenue of $8.8 billion, which was in line with our expectations. Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 18% to $8.3 billion on 21,308 homes closed, up from $7 billion on 21,588 homes closed in the prior year. Continued construction delays caused by disruptions in the supply chain and tightness in the labor market caused us to close fewer homes than expected during the quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $391,200, up 20% from the prior year quarter. Paul? At June 30, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 600,000 lots, of which 22% were owned and 78% were controlled through purchase contracts. 24% of our total owned lots are finished and 47% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our large capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our third quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $1.75 billion, of which $890 million was for finished lots, $680 million was for land development, and $180 million was to acquire land. Paul? Our rental operations generated pre-tax income of $43 million on revenues of $110 million in the third quarter related to the sale of 1 multi-family rental property consisting of 298 units and 1 single-family rental property totaling 84 homes. During the 9 months ended June 30, our rental operations generated pre-tax income of $215 million on revenues of $489 million. Our rental property inventory at June 30 was $2 billion compared to $760 million a year ago. Rental property inventory at June 30 included approximately $700 million of multi-family rental properties and $1.3 billion of single-family rental properties. As a reminder, our multi-family and single-family rental sales and inventories are reported in our rental segment and are not included in our homebuilding segments homes closed, revenues or inventories. We continue to expect that our rental operations will generate approximately $800 million in revenues during fiscal 2022. We plan to continue growing our rental inventories as we position our rental operations to be a significant contributor to our revenues, profits, and returns in future years. Bill? It's been \u2013 still been very strong, John. We have still been able to resell those cancellations. It just doesn't happen immediately. By the time you resell it and re-qualify a buyer through the mortgage process, it could be a 4 to 8-week to 12-week process sometimes. But we are still seeing good demand for the homes that we have. I think there is certainly more impact potentially on the buyers that are mortgage rate sensitive, but we still saw 56% of our closings were first-time homebuyers in the quarter. And we closed a substantial number of homes in June to those first-time homebuyers that need a place to live. We've been able to provide some interest rate lot products from our mortgage company that's given those buyers comfort and certainty around payment, but they are still buying a home out of need and necessity. Buyers that are more discretionary in nature. And as question earlier alluded to qualification versus value expectations, they are probably more in the value expectations side of taking a pause this summer and seeing where the housing market goes. But the biggest part of our business is focused primarily on the first-time buyer, first-time move up and providing an affordable home. So we're still seeing people buying our homes out of need. The margin guidance, we talked about earlier is also reflective of the cost environment that we faced over the past 6 to 9 months as we started homes at different times and at different lumber pricing, frankly, was a big driver of it. General inflationary pressures across most of our cost categories, but certainly, the lumber has had a great deal of variability over the past 12 months. It rose significantly, fell off a bit, it went back up again and now it's back down. So as those homes push through the production process and deliver, they are going to have an impact on the gross margin as well. We still see very strong interest when we take communities to market and still very encouraged by that. Certainly, the valuation equation is heavily impacted by long-term financing costs for those investors. So \u2013 and in periods of volatility in those costs in their underwriting. It's a little longer to get the process completed with these transactions, but there is still tremendous demand for them. And they are still on the front end of it, as we see these communities begin to complete units and we open up to leasing, we're still seeing strong demand for people moving into the homes. And so that's ultimately very encouraging as we're creating cash flow assets that there is, as you mentioned, a lot of capital interested in investing in those assets today. We certainly evaluate that in terms of demand for the \u2013 for sale in our portfolio. If pace slows down in a given market, then our land position gets a little longer in that market, looking for ways we always thought build to rent is a great way to more rapidly monetize land positions without cannibalizing for sale business because it's a different user of that real estate and different owner of the real estate. So, it brings other capital pools to bear. So, we certainly have repurposed projects that we originally may have identified 3 years to 4 years ago, is for sale. Today, they are being executed as for rent, and that process continues. I mean we underwrite our land buys on the basis of a for-sale purchase. We do not look at the valuations from a build-to-rent aspect in underwriting land buys. Thank you. We are constantly evaluating the land portfolio. That's one of the benefits of having the option position we have is that we get the chance to continue to make decisions about projects as we move through them. Those land projects that we have \u2013 and neighborhood projects that we have identified in the portfolio, very important to the future deliveries of the company, and we are going to continue to work through those neighborhoods. But everybody we work with understands that we are all working together in the same market conditions and a change at the front end of selling homes to home buyers will ripple all the way through the value chain, and it starts ultimately with the land. So, we will continue to rework our portfolio as needed. And we always are continually making adjustments to reflect current on-the-ground conditions, whether it's an acceleration or deceleration of the given project. Is that a sales pitch for Goldman? Sorry. We have historically not tried to hedge any of those positions, and we work with our local suppliers and partners to bring the lumber to the job sites to the best value possible. We have not yet seen how those markets are going to function or evaluate it yet if that's a possibility for us. But we will certainly look at things that make sense to offset risk in our business. Hard to say. It's early into the quarter as to where we are. The past few summers, we have not seen much seasonal falloff. This year, I think we are seeing a little more seasonality. But we still see traffic in the models. We still see people out buying homes. It's not a zero environment. People are still moving into the homes that we complete and close. It's probably coming back to a little more normal seasonality, where the middle of the summer gets a little bit slower from a traffic perspective."

            "name": "Paul Romanowski",
            "content": "During the quarter, we continued to sell homes later in the construction cycle to better ensure the certainty of the home close date for our homebuyers, with almost no sales occurring prior to start of home construction. In June, our sales pace slowed and our cancellation rate increased when mortgage interest rates rose significantly. The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 24% compared to 17% in the prior year quarter. As a result, our net sales orders in the third quarter decreased 7% to 16,693 homes and our total net sales order value increased 8% from the prior year to $6.9 billion. Our average number of active selling communities increased 5% from the prior year quarter and was up 1% sequentially. The average sales price of net sales orders in the third quarter was $415,800, up 16% from the prior year quarter. Bill? We purposefully slowed our home starts to 17,900 homes this quarter, as we work to position our inventory with an appropriate number of homes relative to market conditions. We ended the quarter with 56,400 homes in inventory, up 19% from a year ago and down 6% sequentially. 27,200 of our total homes at June 30 were unsold, of which 1,400 were completed. For homes we closed this quarter, our construction cycle time increased by roughly 1 week compared to the second quarter as supply chain issues remain challenging as they have for the past year. However, we are beginning to see some stabilization in cycle times on homes we have recently started. During the quarter, we will evaluate demand and adjust our homes in inventory and starts pace to meet current market conditions. Mike? For the third quarter, Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company reported total revenues of $308.5 million and pre-tax income of $52.7 million. For the full year, Forestar now expects to deliver 17,000 lots and generate $1.4 billion of revenue with a pre-tax profit margin of greater than 14%. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at June 30 totaled 97,000 lots, essentially flat with a year ago. 59% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer D.R. Horton. $258 million of our finished lots purchased in the third quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had approximately $500 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 32.8%. Forestar is well-positioned to meet changing market conditions with its strong capitalization, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Bill? I think it's a little bit of both. But yes, I mean we have seen delays in the permitting process and bringing communities online in addition to the delays that we have seen on the vertical side and so, if you look at that in aggregate and hence our guide to lower than what we had previously been guiding to. I don't think that it's getting necessarily better today. Any different than we are starting to see it stabilize some on the vertical side, the horizontal side, I think will continue to be a challenge in terms of bringing new communities online on time. Alan, I don't think we've seen a definite pattern as of yet. I think that the incentives that we have put out, as we've stated, are still at this point below historical norms are being effective in terms of driving the traffic. Traffic in total has slowed just based on the market conditions and the change that we've already talked about. But generally speaking, those incentives have accomplished what we've been trying to do in terms of driving additional traffic and converting the homes as our cancellation rate has rise. We've been able to convert those homes that are completed, and we still have a lot of buyers with a near-term need to get into a house. And so we will adjust as the market needs to flag-by-flag community-by-community drive the returns we're looking for. And the pace is the driver of that. Deepa, looking at our starts and we purposefully reduced that start pace over the last quarter, again, to meet the market, and that's largely from production and production capacity. We had big start pace in the prior quarters leading into this and with continued challenges in the supply chain and the labor markets, giving our chance, giving our people and our vendors the ability to catch up and move those homes forward. And on a go-forward basis, we will adjust those start paces to market conditions. So, as we have mentioned, we are still early in this pause period an adjustment. And as we find our base, we will maintain start pace that we want to drive the units and deliveries we are looking for. No, we really \u2013 I think as you look at this process, and again, we are really at a pause in the market. And one of the last things we see to come down is going to be the land. It's a little slower to react than first, we probably see it in the labor on a localized basis and the materials and then land will adjust over time based on market conditions, just like it always has. It's going to rise and flow a little behind housing demand."

            "name": "David Auld",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered a strong third quarter, highlighted by a 53% increase in earnings to $4.67 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 54% to $2.2 billion on a 21% increase in revenues and our consolidated pre-tax profit margin improved 540 basis points to 24.8%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 41.7% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 35.1%. These results reflect our experienced teams, their production capabilities and our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint. Housing market demand remained strong during most of the quarter. In June, we began to see a moderation in demand and an increase in cancellations due to the rapid rise in mortgage rate and continued inflationary pressures across most of the economy. The supply of both new and resale homes at affordable prices remains limited. Although demand has slowed from the frenzy pace we experienced over the past year, there are still qualified buyers in the market today as household formations continue and inflationary pressures drive rents higher. 54% of the homes we closed in the past 12 months were priced under $350,000 and our average sales price is approximately $100,000 lower than the average other public homebuilders, positioning us to continue aggregating share. There are still disruptions in the supply chain and tightness in the labor market that continue to delay the completion of our homes under construction. These construction delays and changes in demand environment led us to reduce our full year closing guidance for fiscal 2022. We remain purposefully \u2013 we purposely slowed our number of home starts in the third quarter to position our inventory to align with market conditions. Although the uncertainty of this market transition may persist from some time, we believe we are well positioned to meet changing market conditions with our experienced teams, affordable product offerings, flexible lot supply and their strong trade and supplier relationships. The strength of our balance sheet, liquidity and loan leverage provide a significant financial flexibility and we will continue managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize returns. Mike? In closing, our results and position reflecting our experienced teams and production capabilities, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across our multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions and continue aggregating market share. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. We are incredibly well positioned to continue improving our operations and providing home ownership opportunities to more American families. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Hi, John. I think it's probably a little of both. I think payment shock was part of it. Toward the end of June, middle of June, we had a 100 basis point increase in long-term rates over about a 3 or 4-day period. I think that impacted it. Most people still remember 2008, \u201809, \u201810 when worst housing market I've ever seen and values deteriorated, which again, not typical in our history of our country. So I will pause. I mean, I feel very good about where we are headed market wise and the response we are getting as we continue to sell houses out there. So \u2013 but you increase rates 100 basis points in 4 days, it does impact higher psyche. I would say right now, we're probably still lower than what we would consider a normal incentive. They are still a lot of buyers out there chasing homes, finding qualified buyers a little more difficult. Actually, reopening in the \u2013 some of our sales efforts has been interesting. So \u2013 but overall, I'd say the incentive program today is probably less than normal. I anticipate at some point, it will return to normal. There is still not a lot of inventory out there for people to buy. Our plan from day 1 has been consistent over time, balanced with supporting the homebuilding inventories and funding the growth. I don't see that changing in \u201823, \u201824 or \u201825. We just \u2013 our goal is to be out there, operating consistently growing our market share, expanding homeownership opportunity for as many families as we possibly can. And I don't see that changing. Ultimately, it's going to come down to what drives the best return for that individual flag. Same formula we've been working on \u2013 working with for the \u2013 coming out of the downturn. Our long-term focus is returning the best we can with the inventory that we put out there, and that's not going to change. We deemphasized gross margins when we could deliver every house we wanted to build as the construction process became more and more challenging we expanded margins because we were delivering every house we possibly can. At the end of the day, it's returned, it's ROI, it's ROE. That's our focus. Yes. Texas, Florida, I think are going to continue to drive national numbers. General lines has continued to be stable and strong for us, we are really \u2013 from a historical norm, from my history with the company and my history in the industry. It's a good mark. I mean to talk about some areas being stressed or problematic. It just doesn't exist today. Is there a pause, is there a reset in kind of the prior expectation, yes, absolutely. Payment shock when rates go up 100 basis points in four days, yes, absolutely. But demographics, demand, the desire to get out of the areas, all those are enforced and continuing and our expectations for next year or that we are going to get back on pace. So, all good in D.R. Horton. Surprised. I don't know that surprised, it's probably a great turn. We are responding to and it's my belief, I think our belief that buyer demand is \u2013 I mean there is still more housing formations, job creations and there are homes being built. And so I think we have talked about elongated cycles in the past. This pause disruption, could it get worse, absolutely. But I have been doing this a long time. And in a conversation with one of our regional presidents a couple of days ago, we were talking about the market. And he and I both have been doing this a long time. Both have been in sales models when selling homes was very difficult. And this is probably the second best market ever. So, I guess I understand that there is uncertainty out there. But when you have people that want to buy homes, I mean we are going to adjust, we are going to figure out how to put those people in homes. That's what we do. And so that's market-by-market, flag-by-flag, division-by-division, however you want to cut it up, we are going to build, sell, start \u2013 we are going to start and close up [ph]. And create home ownership opportunities. That's what the mission of this company is. So, that's what we are going to do. I think compared to prior cycles, the entire industry is much more disciplined, much more focused on cash flow, much more focused on return, accelerating land prices. So, you look at our starts, you look at the industry starts, in June, I think very, very fast reaction to the rate increases. We will see what happens in July and August. But our expectation is that you are going to see starts stay disciplined. And when the rates stabilize and we can adjust pricing and offerings to the buyers and they are comfortable buying them, then I think you will see starts tick back up. But it's just a different world today than it was in \u201804, \u201805, \u201806. You have got a real business that's building assets today. I will also say, Rafe. We have a very deep pipeline of our plan that we have controlled for multiple years. And it does put us in a position where if we see the imbalance in land pricing versus future market expectations, we don't have to buy it. We have got the ability to pause in our land acquisition for an extended period if we think that's the prudent decision. Thank you, Paul. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our fourth quarter results in November. And to the D.R. Horton family, you are a driving force in the creation of affordable housing in this country. What you do is important. Don Horton and the entire executive team, thank you for your focus and hard work. Let's finish this year and move on to \u201823."

            "content": "Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the third quarter was 30.1%, up 120 basis points sequentially from the March quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were up 3.9% sequentially, while stick and brick cost per square foot increased 2.4%. The increase in our gross margin from March to June reflects the broad strength of the housing market we experienced most of this year. The strong demand for homes, combined with a limited supply allowed us to raise prices and maintain a very low level of sales incentives in most of our communities. As we have already mentioned, demand has moderated in June and to-date in July. As we adjust to current market conditions, we expect the pace of our sales price increases to slow during the fourth quarter and for our incentive levels to increase from historical lows. To address affordability concerns, we are offering mortgage interest rate locks and buy-downs to our buyers and we are beginning to offer other sales incentives as necessary on selected homes and inventory and to drive sales traffic to our communities. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be lower than the third quarter. Jessica? Financial services pre-tax income in the third quarter was $128.3 million, with a pre-tax profit margin of 50.5% compared to $70.3 million and 37.3% in the prior year quarter. The increase in our financial services pre-tax profit margin this quarter was primarily due to a significant acceleration of interest rate lot commitments. During the third quarter, a majority of our buyers in backlog for expected fourth quarter closings entered into interest rate lot commitments. These lots were executed earlier than normal due to the increase in mortgage rates, which resulted in higher-than-normal financial services revenue in the third quarter. This revenue acceleration will likely cause our financial services revenues and profits to be lower than normal in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, 99% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 69% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 41% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 56% of the closings handled by the mortgage company this quarter. Mike? Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. At June 30, we had $2.8 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.6 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage was 17% at the end of June and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 12.1%. Our consolidated leverage at June 30 was 24.9% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 19.3%. At June 30, our stockholders' equity was $18.1 billion and book value per share was $52, up 35% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended June, our return on equity was 35.1% compared to 29.5% a year ago. During the first 9 months of the year, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $125 million. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $79.2 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in August. We repurchased 4.7 million shares of common stock for $310 million during the quarter for a total of 10.5 million shares repurchased fiscal year-to-date for $854.2 million, an increase of 29% compared to the same period a year ago. As a result, our outstanding share count at June 30 was down 3% from a year ago. We still expect our outstanding share count will be approximately 3% lower at the end of fiscal 2022 and the end of fiscal 2021. Jessica? Sure, Steve. In terms of our completed spec homes, we're always looking to sell those as quickly as we can. We've been at abnormally low levels. Still the 1,400 we're at today is still relatively low. But if you look historically, we've typically been at levels quite a bit higher. So I think we're seeing a return to a more normal level on completed specs, but the goal will always be to not have more than one or two completed specs at the community and continue to make sure that we move through those, and that they don't age. In terms of our overall production, historically, when we had historically normal cycle times, you could anticipate us turning our housing inventory, our number of homes and inventory twice each year. We've been a little slower than that this year with the elongated cycle times. But we're looking to into next year hopeful that we will see the improvements in cycle times and could get to a more normal level there as well. And so we're adjusting our starts to reflect the current moderation in demand, and we will be monitoring demand very closely to determine the appropriate level of starts going forward. But then as part of that total production that we look to turn twice historically, our spec levels as a percentage of that total have ranged from the low 40s to the low 50s. And so right now, we're kind of in that normal total spec range overall. And \u2013 so we will just be adjusting our SAR space, looking at our overall homes and inventory and our spec levels and alongside demand over the coming months to position ourselves as best we can through the current market. I think on a cost per home basis, we have been seeing that rise with inflation. And so I think there is an element of that, that yes, that will remain. But our homes and inventory, our total number of homes and inventory expected to decline in the fourth quarter from the current level. And that's fairly normal for us in the fourth quarter as well as we deliver more homes typically than we start in the fourth quarter. Cancellation rates during the quarter. In the first part of the quarter, they were in the normal range. For us, we had been for a while below normal. So it was in the normal range. And then it did definitely increased sharply in June, which then brought the overall average for the quarter up. As far as today in July, I would still say it's elevated, has not continued on a trend much higher, but it still is at an elevated level. And so we're monitoring that along with our gross sales activity and responses to incentives and other affordability measures we're trying to provide for our homebuyers and we will be monitoring that very closely going forward. But like we've said thus far, we're still seeing a very good level of core demand out there. We're reselling our cancellations rather smoothly thus far. And so we're hopeful that we will find some stability here in the demand environment in our sales and cans environment over the next few months. Mike, I'll start with the gross margin on these guys may chime in a little bit more on the trends on incentives going forward. Gross margin guide itself. It starts with our backlog as we enter quarter. And as we mentioned, we had a lot of buyers that locked in their mortgage rates that they are expecting to close in Q4. And so we have more visibility to those homes that we expect to close in Q4 to the margins we expect to see there. So that's the biggest piece of our visibility into our guide. We do still have some homes that we are selling in the current quarter that we will close, and those homes are more likely to be a little more exposed to the current incentive environment. And so we'd expect there to be a few more incentives in some of those homes, which has been factored into the guide as well. And so I think you have many comments in the market around level of incentives, I don't I wouldn't say those are inaccurate at all. But our closings in the coming quarter will partially reflect some of the current environment, but will also reflect some buyers that are in backlog and have their rates locked and marching towards closing in Q4. Well, anytime we see a change in market conditions. And right now, we do expect the level of price increases to moderate and start to flatten out. We've already talked a bit about incentives rising. The top line is impacted quicker than our costs are. So we usually see two or three quarters where our higher costs are still coming through, and that puts some pressure on near-term margins. But then as that inflection begins, it opens the door up to be able to start addressing on the cost side. We've already seen some relief from lumber, which that will start to be more of a tailwind for us in coming quarters. And then other categories really beginning with labor becomes an opportunity as well. And so our goal will be to do as much as we can on the cost side to offset the impact that we see from prices flattening and incentive levels to maintain as good a margin as we can balance with pace to generate the best returns that we can generate. Where that will be, will depend on \u2013 will be dependent on the strength of the housing market and demand. Yes. Susan, we only own about 130,000 lots today. So, we are constantly buying lots more and more, a larger percentage of our purchases are of finished lots and that we essentially put into production almost on a just-in-time basis. So, we will be continuing to replenish our owned lot supply along the way. As Mike said, adjusting our optioned portfolio on a constant basis. So, I would expect there will still be a steady reinvestment and replenishment of our land pipeline. Obviously, as we see how the current market conditions transition here, we will be evaluating the depth and demand, the strength of the demand and then positioning our land and our lots and our homes and inventory to match those conditions as we go into next year. And our spend will then align with the plans that we set. And Dave, it's in the current trends, it's still very early to determine exactly what magnitude of adjustments may occur. We are still evaluating that on a week-by-week basis when \u2013 as David said earlier, when rates spiked, there is an adjustment period. And we are in that adjustment period right now where buyers are \u2013 there is a little bit of a rate shock or a payment shock. And so they are adjusting expectations and we are going to how to adjust with them to make sure we get them into the homes that they want to purchase. Part of that positioning going into next year is our number of homes and inventory. We have 56,000 homes in inventory, today, and we are guiding to close between 23.5 and 25.5 in the coming quarters. So, we are going to go into the year with inventory as well and we will supplement it with our start pace in Q4 and beyond to then drive to the volume levels that will drive next year. And then specific to market share gains, that's always a core part of our strategy."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America\u2019s Builder, the largest builder in the United States. At this time, all participants are have been placed on a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for your questions and comments after the presentation. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton.\nJessica Hansen: Thank you, Holly, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Before we get started, today\u2019s call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligations to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K and it\u2019s most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning\u2019s earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q in the next day or two. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding second quarter, highlighted by a, 59% [ph] increase in earnings to $4.03 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 60% to $1.9 billion on a 24% increase in revenues. And our consolidated pre-tax profit margin improved 520 basis points to 23.5%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended March 31st was 40.3%, and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 34%. These results reflect our experienced teams, the production capabilities and our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint. Housing market demand remained strong despite the recent increase in mortgage rates and we are focused on maximizing returns while continuing to aggregate market share. There are still significant challenges in the supply chain, including shortages in certain building materials and a very tight labor market. Our construction cycle times were extended further this quarter, and we continue to work on stabilizing and then reducing our cycle times to historical norms. After starting construction on 24,800 homes this quarter, our homes and inventory increased 30% from year ago with only 600 unsold completed homes across the nation. With 33,900 homes in backlog, 59,800 homes in inventory, a robust loss supply and strong trade and supplier relationships, we are well-positioned for consolidated revenue growth of greater than 25% this year. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage position us to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations, while managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace, and inventory levels to optimize returns. Mike?\nMike Murray: Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 59% to $4.03 per diluted share compared to $2.53 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 55% to $1.4 billion compared to $930 million. Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 22% to $7.5 billion on 19,828 homes closed, up from $6.2 billion on 19,701 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $378,200, up 21% from the prior year quarter, while the average size of our homes closed was down 1%. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: Our net sales orders in the second quarter decreased 10% to 24,340 homes, while the value increased 10% from the prior year to $9.7 billion. Our average number of active selling communities increased 1% from the prior year quarter and was up 4% sequentially. The average sales price of net sales orders in the second quarter was $400,600, up 23% from the prior year quarter. The cancellation rate for the second quarter was 16% compared to 15% in the prior year quarter. New home demand remains very strong despite the recent rise in mortgage rates. We are continuing to sell homes later in the construction cycle to better ensure the certainty of the home close date for our homebuyers with virtually no sales occurring prior to the start of home construction. We expect to continue managing our sales pace in the same manner for the rest of the year. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the second quarter was 28.9%, up 150 basis points sequentially from the December quarter. The increase in our gross margin for December to March reflects the broad strength of the housing market. The strong demand for homes, combined with a limited supply has allowed us to continue to raise prices and maintain a very low level of sales incentives in most of our communities. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were up 4.8% sequentially. While stick and brick cost per square foot increased 2.5% and our lot cost increased 2.8%. We expect our cost will continue to increase. However, with the strength of today's market conditions, we expect most cost pressures to be offset by price increases in the near-term. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the third quarter to be slightly better than the second quarter. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: In the second quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 6.8%, down 80 basis points from 7.6% in the prior year quarter. This quarter, our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was lower than any quarter in our history, and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our business. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: We started 24,800 homes during the quarter, up 5% from the second quarter last year, bringing our trailing 12-month starts to 95,300 homes. We ended the quarter with 59,800 homes in inventory, up 30% from a year ago. 26,000 of our total homes at March 31st were unsold, of which only 600 were completed. Our average construction cycle times for homes closed in the second quarter increased by almost two weeks since our first quarter and over two months from a year ago. Although we have not seen improvement in the supply chain yet, we continue working to stabilize and then reduce our construction cycle times to historical norms. Mike?\nMike Murray: At March 31st, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 570,000 lots, of which 23% were owned and 77% were controlled through purchase contracts. 23% of our total owned lots are finished and 47% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our large capital efficient lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our second quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.1 billion, of which $1.2 billion was for finished lots, $630 million was for land development and $260 million was to acquire land. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company continues to execute well. During the second quarter, Forestar reported total revenues of $421.6 million, and pre-tax income of $63.2 million. For the full year, Forestar expects to deliver 19,500 to 20,000 lots, and generate $1.7 billion of revenues with a pre-tax profit margin of 14% to 14.5%. At March 31, Forestar's owned and controlled lot position increased 14% from a year ago to 96,500 lives. 57% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $390 million of our finished lots purchased in the second quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton, and had approximately $580 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 29.9%. Forestar's strong capitalization, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton positions them to continue their profitable growth. Bill??\nBill Wheat: Financial services pre-tax income in the second quarter was $92.8 million with a pre-tax profit margin of 41.8%, compared to $107.7 million and 47.8% in the prior year quarter. For the quarter, 99% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes close by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 68% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 41% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 55% of the closings handled by the mortgage company this quarter. Mike?\nMike Murray: Our rental operations generated pre-tax income of $103 million on revenues of $223 million in the second quarter. During the quarter, we sold one multifamily rental property consisting of 126 units for $50 million, and we sold three single-family rental properties totaling 368 homes for $173 million. Our rental property inventory at March 31st was $1.5 billion, compared to $544 million a year ago. Rental property inventory at March 31st included approximately $600 million of multifamily rental properties and $900 million of single-family rental properties. As a reminder, our multifamily and single-family rental sales and inventories are reported in our rental segment and are not included in our homebuilding segments homes closed revenues or inventories. During the quarter, our rental operations subsidiary, DRH Rental, entered into a four-year $750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Availability under the rental revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation based on unrestricted cash and the book value of DRH rental real estate assets. There were no borrowings outstanding on the rental credit facility at quarter end. We now expect our rental operations to generate more than $800 million in revenues during fiscal 2022. Our third quarter rental sales will be lower than the second quarter and fourth quarter sales will be the highest of the year. We also now expect our total rental platform inventories to grow by more than $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 based on current projects in development and a significant pipeline of our future projects. We are positioning our rental operations to be a significant contributor to our revenues, profits and returns in future years. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic. At March 31st, we had $3.2 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage was 16.4% at the end of March and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 11.3%. Our consolidated leverage at March 31st was 24.9% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 18.9%. At March 31st, our stockholders' equity was $16.8 billion and book value per share was $47.66, up 33% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended March, our return on equity was 34% compared to 27.1% a year ago. During the first six months of the year, our cash used in homebuilding operations was $416 million, which reflects our increased homes and inventory to meet demand and the impact of extended construction cycle-times. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $79.1 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in May. We repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock for $266 million during the quarter for a total of 5.8 million shares repurchased fiscal year-to-date for $544.2 million, an increase of 30% compared to the same period a year ago. Subsequent to quarter end, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our common stock, replacing our prior authorization. The new authorization has no expiration date. We now expect to reduce our outstanding share count by 3% during fiscal 2022. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: As we look forward to the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect market conditions to continue to reflect strong demand from homebuyers with continuing supply chain challenges. We expect to generate consolidated revenues in our June quarter of $8.6 billion to $9 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in a range between 21,500 and 22,500 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the third quarter to be in the range of 29% to 29.5% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter to be around 6.6%. We anticipate a financial services pretax profit margin of approximately 40% and we expect our income tax rate to be roughly 24% in the third quarter. For the full fiscal year, we expect to generate consolidated revenues of $35.3 billion to $36.1 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in a range of 88,000 to 90,000 homes. We forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2022 of roughly 24%, and we now expect that our share repurchases will reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 3% at the end of fiscal 2022, compared to the end of fiscal 2021. We still expect to generate positive cash flow from our homebuilding operations this year, and we will continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, increasing our rental inventories, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares. David?\nDavid Auld: In closing, our results and positions reflect our experienced teams and production capabilities, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across our multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to continue aggregating market share and effectively operating in changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to invest the capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. We are incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations during the remainder of 2022 and in future years. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Carl, your line is live.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks very much. Morning everybody. I think at the end of -- or in January, you talked about orders being flat, maybe up slightly in the quarter. They were down 10. Can you talk a little bit about the progression of orders over the course of the quarter? And when I'm assuming you recognize that the production side was not catching up and in fact, was deteriorating and you decided to slow order pace, or is there a demand component to this as well?\nMike Murray: Carl, I think it was all our decision to slow sales orders based on production capacity. I think we saw and continue to see very good demand and more buyers, qualified buyers out there for our homes today when we release them for sale. But we did see during the quarter that our cycle times continue to extend, and we made the decision in several of our geographies to delay the release of homes until we could give a better delivery date to those customers and provide a better experience for them in the backlog process. So we saw a very strong demand in the quarter, but we did see the cycle times elongate. I think we added two weeks this quarter, unfortunately, and we wanted to make sure we did not create more buyers in backlog with an unhappy experience.\nCarl Reichardt: Great. Thanks Mike. And then you didn't discuss the Vidler Water transaction, and I would just like you to give an overview of the strategic rationale for that deal and whether or not this is a function of the assets related to water rights or if this is a business that you think potentially could grow? Thanks very much.\nJessica Hansen: Sure, Carl. We put out pretty much what we're going to say about Vidler in the press release in terms of the owning a portfolio of premium on rights and other water-related assets across several of our Southwest markets that generally lack adequate supply. We mentioned the total value of the transaction approximately $290 million and we do expect it to close in the next month or two. But considering it's subject to the successful completion of a tender offer, we don't have much to say at this time and I look forward to talking about that in coming quarters after it closes.\nCarl Reichardt: Well I tried. Thanks Jess, thanks everybody.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from John Lovallo with UBS. John, your line is live.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning guys and thank you for taking my questions. The first one is activity at some point will likely moderate given higher rates and higher prices. And the question I have and I think the concern that some investors have is that if and when activity does moderate, how does this sort of change, if at all, your thoughts on capital allocation? I mean, will you sort of back off on -- take the foot off the pedal on buying land and maybe switch more towards share buybacks and things of that nature?\nBill Wheat: Thanks John. We're always focused on aggregating market share and we're positioning ourselves to continue to do that through any economic cycle. Certainly, at some point, impact of rates and impact of affordability will have some impact on demand, and we certainly will adjust our capital allocation at that time. But we believe we're in a strong position to continue to grow. But certainly, those impacts on demand would impact our investment decisions in land at that point in time.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay, that's good to hear. And then on the option percentage getting up to 77%, I mean, that's much higher than think anyone thought it when the Forestar acquisition occurred and seeming going back a few years ago. I mean could this get much closer to, call it, 90% and that's just a random number, but just 90% plus, getting closer to what MVR does and how does this impact the strategy with Forestar, as its grown and become spread across a lot of your communities? I mean you do have the option to bring that ownership position down pretty significantly and still maintain the favorable contract terms. So, just curious how you're thinking about Forestar longer term?\nDavid Auld: From the overall auction lot percentage, we have been focused on it. We're going to continue to focus on it. There is -- obviously, it's going to be capped at 100%. But our goal is just to continue to get better and more efficient. And as to Forestar, very happy with Forestar. I mean -- at some point, yes, it will deconsolidate. But there's still a lot of markets that we think we can help scale Forestar into and if you look at just the earnings we're making, our shareholders are making of Forestar. It's a very good investment and kind of not a bad place to be -- but yes, at some point, it will deconsolidate, but it's more geared toward their platform build-out than it is our desire to liquidate some percentage of our shares.\nJohn Lovallo: Thanks guys.\nJessica Hansen: Thanks John.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is live.\nStephen Kim: Yeah. Thanks very much guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Obviously, with the big rise in rates, everyone's concerned that things are going to slow. I think John mentioned that that's people's expectations. I guess, two questions with respect to the rise in rates. One is, is there anything that you are planning in terms of the communities, which would likely come online in the next year or two, let's say, the next year, new communities opening. Where you're making adjustments to your planned home sizes, amenity levels or anything like that? And would that have an impact on the gross margin? And then secondly, can you just talk about why do you think we have not seen in your communities despite, obviously, affordability of being more judged. Why do you think we haven't seen it yet in terms of your conversations with customers, do you -- are they -- can you talk about the role of rate locks, or just anything that would be helpful for understanding why we maybe haven't seen anything yet?\nDavid Auld: Stephen, I think to your first question, in terms of community design, plan design, I think we are going to continue to focus the affordable range and work towards those buyers. I don't see a significant change in how we build, what we bill. But if it continues to be a push on affordability, then we'll put the appropriate homes in place. It may mean some smaller homes, but not a significant shift from where we are today. In terms of -- in our communities and in our sales offices, certainly, there is a concern from the buying public over rates, but selling later in the process like we do. We don't have as much exposure as we could if we were selling far out to the shifts and rate conditions. And that's why we've continued to restrict our sales to a later time frame, so that we're putting people in backlog at closer to the rate that they're going to close at.\nStephen Kim: That makes a lot of sense. In this quarter, can you give us a sense for how many of your closings were done with a rate lock that the closings I'm referring to, not the orders?\nJessica Hansen: Yes. So I looked at it actually on a forward-looking basis, and we have essentially our next month, so April, 100% locked. And then as you would expect, that percentage ticks down, but it's the majority of the quarter's closing that are locked and you got to get to four-plus months out before that's a more de minimis percentage.\nStephen Kim: Okay, great. Thanks very much guys.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates. Ivy, your line is live.\nIvy Zelman: Thank you. Good morning and congrats on the strong results. Maybe you guys can just give us some perspective on the rental business with both the merchant build single-family rental communities as well as your multifamily projects. Can you talk about how many of them you're developing them are already pre-sold. And have you seen any changes in valuation as it relates to selling with the surge in rates as we hear chatter that values at least within multifamily have really started to be pressured. And just the overall buying appetite that's out there with so much capital still appears to be chasing this asset class?\nMike Murray: Thank you, Ivy. We do see a lot of very strong demand and strong execution on the pricing; we do not sell any of our communities at this point during the development phase. We're selling them at -- in the lease-up phase at stabilization. So, we're seeing still very good demand and very good pricing execution on those transactions that we have closed on. So, current outlook, you would expect cap rates could be affected by rising interest rates, but we're also seeing very strong leasing demand and very strong rental growth, which certainly affect cap rate outlooks.\nJessica Hansen: And at a 40% to 50%-plus margin on these sales if the market were to soften a bit, we still expect to generate very strong profits and returns.\nIvy Zelman: Great. And then just secondly, with respect to the delay in and obviously, the industry is impacted. Can you walk us through on the development side with municipalities, like components of the overall impact is related to like the difference versus sourcing materials because some materials are not a problem anymore. So, everyone talks about it's a whack-a-mole, but what's it like on the development side as well as on the municipality side and how much of that is impacting the two-month year-over-year increase in cycle-time?\nMike Murray: Well, I think you've got certainly municipality challenges through the entitlement process in terms of bringing new lots to the market. And we still haven't seen full return of municipalities when you're talking about permitting and/or inspection process. So, it certainly is impacting some of that as we work through the supply chain challenges and then you finally move homes on to the next stage, it is -- we do see some delays in inspections and some of the municipality services that we were seeing. So, it's certainly been part of the impact to our cycle time extension.\nIvy Zelman: And let me just sneak in 1 last one, if I could. Just with respect to the inflation that we've seen. Can you be more specific on recognizing your land is predominantly controlled via option. Like what has changed on the pricing lot of inflation that you are buying outright? Are you seeing relative to a year ago? And maybe to be just general because it's obviously different by market.\nDavid Auld: I'd say the overall land market as track the sales price of homes. So, it is good to be in a position where we control 550,000 lots at prices contracted two years ago, three years ago, four years ago and not be in a position today where we have to go buy something. So, we are looking at that. We're monitoring it. I believe liquidity is going to drive market share gains and the ability to not be at risk of credit markets and/or banks is a huge competitive advantage for us and we're going to protect that. We're going to be conservative in our land searches there are good deals out there that we put under contract this year that we will take to close. But we are not in a position where we have to go buy anything. And we're going to, I think, see a significant benefit of that as we proceed through this market.\nIvy Zelman: Thank you. Good luck.\nDavid Auld: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Matthew your line is live.\nMatthew Bouley: Morning everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. Just another question on what you medium term perspective from what you can control in a scenario where housing activity were to slow, as we're talking about this morning, what does D.R. Horton do from a supply perspective? To what degree does your own plans for community replenishment or starts flex with these changes in interest rates and demand, just thinking again medium-term annual volume growth? How should we think about how you all are viewing that? Thank you.\nMike Murray: Matt, we're very much a bottom-up community level driven company, and we're going to evaluate demand we see at each individual community and submarket and look for home starts to match that demand that our local operators are seeing. And that couples with community replacement needs in those submarkets based upon demand we see in real-time in the field. So in the near term, we'll continue to adjust starts. In the more medium term, we'll look at subdivision openings and phase sizing. And then as well as Paul touched on before, we may be adjusting some product to some smaller sizes, if that's appropriate for the given market.\nMatthew Bouley: Got you. Okay. That's very helpful. And then secondly, just zooming in back to the very near-term, I think you've seen maybe in some of the housing data, maybe a little bit in our own survey work, it seems like some trends in the housing market might have become a little more choppy in recent weeks, perhaps not surprising given the move in interest rates. But just anything you're seeing on the leading edge, on the margin whether that's any sort of pockets of changes in demand or again, incentives appearing and various markets? Just anything you're seeing later into March and into April? Thank you.\nDavid Auld: The rate increase is -- it's eliminating some people from the home buy experience. But we still have more people qualify buyers trying to buy homes than we can produce today. One of the things that really, I think, has impressed me back in 2018 when you saw a rapid rise in rates, demand just was significantly reduced. And then after the rate shock to -- after the rate shock was mitigated, we saw demand come back and come back strong. But through this cycle, which is in even more rapid rate increases, yes, we've had people that don't qualify anymore, but the demand side is still very strong. So just the desire to own homes, and it may be the fact that prices have escalated very fast and rents are escalating even faster than the price of new homes and all the talk about inflation and then locking in your housing costs for 20 years. I mean, it is -- home ownership is a cherished thing today. And the people coming out of the -- millennials coming out or even individuals relocating from other markets to where the growth is taking place. Its just they want to own a home, they want to lock in their housing cost, and they want to get in the neighborhoods that they can raise families in.\nMatthew Bouley: Well, thank you for that David, and thanks everyone, and good luck.\nDavid Auld: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup. Anthony, your line is live.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning. Cancellation rates, I guess, picked up a 100 bps, maybe from record low levels. Would you characterize that as more kind of noise or maybe more clearly, customers no longer able to secure mortgages? Would you expect cancellations maybe decline again in 3Q if rates stay at their current level? And I think in the past, you've provided kind of a sensitivity analysis around sort of mid-single-digit, high single-digit backlog that potentially could be at risk with 100 bp rise in rates. Any sort of thoughts on how that has shaken out now that we're above 5% now on rates?\nJessica Hansen: Sure, Anthony. I mean we look at a 1% change in our cancellation rate is essentially flat. It's still abnormally low -- historically low. We typically run in the high teens to low 20s. And that's a can rate we're very comfortable running at. The main reason continues to be that buyers can't ultimately qualify for the home purchase. So, that 15%, 16%, 17% wherever it falls out each quarter, really no concerns from us on that end. In terms of rate sensitivity analysis, we did run the same sensitivity as we've talked to each of the last few quarters. I think rates have already kind of run up to where that was run at a couple of weeks ago, as we prepped for this call, but it had only ticked up to, call it, roughly 10% of buyers and backlog today would be at risk. As I mentioned earlier in answer to another question, all of April is already rate locked if they're going through a mortgage company. So, that piece wouldn't be at risk. And then we also would work to look to move people from a different loan product or see if they could document additional income. And then to kind of second some things that the guys have already said today, for those buyers that do unfortunately fall out because they can't qualify, there's no shortage of buyers behind them to take their place.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay, that's very helpful. And then just with higher rates, are you making any strategic shifts to target a different mix of buyers? Are you seeing buyers that you wouldn't normally talk to kind of moving down market to more affordable offerings and understanding your entire offering is fairly affordable, like which of your buyer types do you think is best positioned to maybe weather rising rates, does it move up, or any thoughts there?\nMike Murray: We really haven't made any significant shift and don't see a need to as rates rise. It's going to be more of that shock to payment for folks when they have to reset maybe the size home or price that they can then qualify for. So, we're going to catch those people that have been buying up that may fall down the price curve and/or size of home and still be able to pick them up in a majority of our communities. So, no real shift in what we're doing with any of our buyer demographics. We're still seeing strong demand, as everyone's mentioned, across the spectrum.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mike Rehaut with JPMorgan. Mike, your line is live.\nMike Rehaut: Hi thanks. Good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to revisit the can rate, which I think as you mentioned, Jessica, essentially flat and extremely low. We've kind of thought of it as a key metric to understand the potential impact of the rate move over the last 60, 90 days. And I was curious if you've seen any change throughout the quarter, Obviously, it was up 100 basis points versus a year ago, and I think 100 basis points, I believe, sequentially. But anything throughout the quarter that maybe perhaps you ended the quarter at a higher number than at the beginning. And if there's been any change in April, curious around that.\nJessica Hansen: It really was relatively flat throughout the quarter, give or take, a 1% change. So sequentially, we were -- I guess, we were both a year ago and in the last quarter, we were at 15%. This quarter, we were at 16%, and it was right around that range for the duration of the court.\nMike Rehaut: Okay. Also, throughout the quarter, you said that demand has remained strong, more demand than supply. I would presume then that as a result, your pricing power and the incentives that you've had in the marketplace really haven't changed at all. Obviously, your gross margins continue to improve. And you expect further margin improvement in the third quarter. Just wanted to make sure that was the case as well and it was the case for yourselves as well as if you witnessed any changes in the broader marketplace?\nBill Wheat: Mike, we have seen consistent ability to raise prices through the quarter, seeing consistent increases in our sales order pricing that then flow through our backlog and through our closing pricing. That's what gives us the confidence to say that our margins are going to be slightly better next quarter, because we can see those sales prices coming through in our closings in the next quarter. So to date, we have not seen a change in our ability to raise prices. I think naturally as we look a little bit longer term with the impact of rates and impact of overall price increases. At some point, we would expect that to moderate. But at this point, we have not seeing any signs that as of yet.\nMike Rehaut: Okay. One last quick one, if I could. Just the 3% reduction of year-end share count versus 2% previously. Sorry if I missed this earlier, but I just want to make sure, is that a function of a greater amount of dollars dedicated to share repurchase or in part driven by the recent reduction in share price in the market over the last couple of months?\nBill Wheat: A little bit of both, Mike. As we look at our capital allocation for the year, our expectations for how much we would utilize, I mean dollars we would utilize a share repurchase has gone up versus our prior estimates. But then certainly, the current valuation of our stock does allow us to buy more shares per dollar as well. And so it's a little bit of both, and that's allowed us to increase our estimate from 2% reduction to a 3% reduction.\nMike Rehaut: Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Truman, your line is live.\nTruman Patterson: Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to follow-up on one of John's questions previously. I realize that cycle times have been extended, you have 60,000 homes under construction, which ties up net working capital. But we're now halfway through the year. I'm just hoping you can give an update or possibly a number around your 2022 operating cash flow expectation. And then just on the capital allocation decision based on rate increasing, it seems like you're going to be a bit more -- or you're going to continue with programmatic share repurchase. But how do you balance this with potentially even increasing liquidity given all the commentary from the Fed and possibly having a rainy day fund, if you will?\nBill Wheat: Yes, it is a constant balance, Truman. We're not giving specific dollar guidance regarding our operating cash flow other than we do expect to generate positive cash flow from our homebuilding operations. On a consolidated basis, our operating cash flow also includes the investments we're making in our rental platform, which obviously are significant, increasing those by $1.5 billion this year. And then certainly one factor today that is tying up some of our capital is the extension of our build being longer than two months longer than a year ago, certainly does tie up a significant amount of capital. But certainly, we are working towards stabilizing that and improving those cycle times, which we would expect to start to bring that cash back some towards the end of fiscal 2022 and then certainly into fiscal 2023. So, it is a balance -- and as we plan our capital allocation, we plan our liquidity targets, we are just seeking to make sure we stay in as a strong and flexible position as possible to handle the -- what we see in the market today and position ourselves for further growth, aggregation and market share and generating returns to our shareholders.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Thanks for that. And then one final one on just current market conditions. Just are you seeing any metros that are maybe a little bit slower than the others? And then for the buyers purchasing today, I realize this might be somewhat of an unfair question, but how long have they been in the market? Were they really searching before rates started to move, or are we seeing incremental buyers continuing to come in after the higher rate environment that are kind of more recently entered, if you will.\nMike Murray: Truman, I think on the markets, we see markets have varying levels of performance and demand, but they're all very strong. relative to where they've been. I mean certainly, the migration patterns within the country and the areas that are gaining population have incredibly strong demand, but markets across our footprint, we still see more buyer demand than we have production capacity for today. And so we're still very encouraged by that. Some of those buyers have been in the marketplace for quite a while. Others are more recent entries, but we don't have any hard data we could share with you on how exactly long they've been conducting their search.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Thank you. And good luck in the upcoming year.\nMike Murray: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo. Deepa, your line is live.\nDeepa Raghavan: Thanks everyone for taking the question. Good morning. Of the supply chain incremental headwinds, is there a way to think about how much we're Omicron-related? I'm assuming that should be probably behind us now and how much is kind of carry forward? I think where I'm going with it is, are you baking in any sequential improvement off of that two weeks elongated cycle time assuming there must have been some relief from Omicron?\nJessica Hansen: Yes, I think we would agree with you on the Omicron front. I mean there's certainly still labor challenges in labor and manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, it's still harder to come by, but it does seem to be slightly improving. Drivers continue to be a really big area of need to be able to get products to job sites. In terms of if we're baking in any incremental improvement in our build times. I think, I would tell you for us to achieve the high end of our guidance range. And certainly to do any more of that, we would need to see improvement in our build times from what we've seen today. But we do feel like we're maybe in the early stages of that to where we felt comfortable still, although we lowered our closings guide. We did leave 90 in the range of closing 88 to 90 because we have the houses. It's just a matter of getting them completed and across the finish line with the buyer.\nDeepa Raghavan: Got it. Staying on the topic of the guide. I don't think you guided for the full year gross margins unless I missed it, but it does definitely look like you have some good tailwinds that can extend into Q4 and give you some good gross margin visibility. Do you want to provide any color on that for Q4?\nBill Wheat: Yes, Deepa, we do only guide one quarter out on gross margin, but I would agree with you that currently, we do have some tailwinds with the average prices that have been in our backlog and in our recent sales orders that, some of which will be homes that would close into Q4. I think we do have some tailwinds. But as we've said many times, our true visibility to margin really doesn't go far beyond the quarter. So we only guide specifically to Q3. But we do feel like we're still going to see very good gross margins through Q4 as well.\nDeepa Raghavan: That\u2019s very helpful color. Thanks very much and good luck.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Susan, your line is live.\nSusan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning. My first question is on the SG&A. I mean, obviously, the gross margin has been impressive, but so has your SG&A performance this year. You continue to come in well-below where we are modeled and where you've guided to, can you talk to the potential to continue to see that coming down now that we're solidly in that 6% range? And maybe where we can get to over time there?\nBill Wheat: Thank you, Sue. Obviously, an important part of our culture and our business model. We are very focused on ensuring that we stay very efficient with our overhead, while still making sure we're building our overhead and our infrastructure to support the growth. But with the price appreciation that we've seen alongside that that has certainly aided in dropping the SG&A percentage as a percentage of revenue a bit faster, and then honestly, than we would have modeled as well. And so we've been very pleased with that. Certainly, we want to make sure we continue to position ourselves adequately there. But with the prices that we have seen and that we see coming over the next quarter or so, we do expect to still see very good SG&A leverage with the guidance that we're providing for Q3, that assumes another 50 basis point year-over-year improvement in SG&A. So yes, we do see ourselves with an SG& A rate getting down into the sixes and four at least the near term staying there.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. All right. Thank you. And then my second question is a bit longer term. David made the comment earlier around consumer confidence. And overall, the desirability around homeownership today and how that perhaps is very different relative to where we were, certainly, coming out of the last cycle. Can you talk to what sustains that level of confidence in home ownership? And what that perhaps could mean even as rates do rise in terms of keeping that demand pool there and peoples willingness to continue to extend and really try and make that effort to get into the home?\nDavid Auld: I just -- I've been doing this for a long time. And the desire to own a home is, I think, kind of an American or part of the American culture. It gives you a sense of safety and a nest to build your family. So, I think the downturn in 2008, 2009, 2010 where home values were just decimated that put a big pause on the desire to own homes. I think as this cycle continues and I think it's going to continue to elongate, the housing formation, the desire to get close to neighborhood schools, all those things, it kind of returned home ownership to kind of the American dream again.  So, it's getting in a home today is harder. But it's not nearly as hard as it was when I bought my first home. So, it's it feels like it's almost a cultural shift from -- or a return to family community and I think the demand is significantly higher than the homes that can be produced. So.\nSusan Maklari: Okay, well thank you for those thoughts and good luck with everything.\nDavid Auld: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Jay McCanless with Wedbush. Jay, your line is live.\nJay McCanless: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to clarify, I think you've discussed this already, but in the closing guidance for the full year, that's not a shift to homes into the rental operation. That's just you guys slowing down production in the -- or slowing down orders in the field to keep up with production.\nJessica Hansen: It's -- when our homes are going to be completed and the ability to close those in what quarter, yes, there's no transition to build for rent in those numbers. We've kept our homebuilding for-sale completely separate from what we're reporting on a rental basis.\nMike Murray: We have a plan for both businesses. One for the for-sale side of the business and one for the rent side of the business. And the change in the guidance has nothing to do with transitioning communities from one to another. It's solely dealing with completion of homes, putting the buyer into a completed good-looking house when that house is ready.\nJay McCanless: Got it. Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. And then my second question, I think David earlier was talking about liquidity being the competitive advantage, especially with land prices moving up. I mean when does this lack of liquidity, I think, especially for some of the smaller private builders, when does that really force a bigger wave of M&A than what we've seen so far in post-COVID?\nDavid Auld: I don't know that it's going to force a larger M&A program. I do think that their inability to secure financing to move forward on different projects or even to start houses is going to open up market opportunity for us, both in our ability to aggregate market share on the home sale side and the ability to control longer and longer land positions at very favorable numbers. So, it's a -- when you look at the impact of a two-plus month expansion of our cycle time and what that's done to our liquidity, and then I understand that we are still building houses much faster than anybody else, and we started at -- and are going to continue to protect a very strong liquidity position. It's -- I got to believe there's tremendous pressure on the -- especially the private builders. And at some point, these guys have made a lot of money over their careers. And they're guaranteeing loans. And at some point, you're just not going to put everything at risk. So I do think that's going to open up market share gains for us. And we are very well-positioned to take those market -- that market when it does open.\nJay McCanless: Got it. That\u2019s great. And if I could sneak one more in, Bill it was encourage to hear that community count was up year-on-year and sequentially. How are you guys feeling about that for the full year just on a percentage change basis?\nBill Wheat: We're still looking at the low single-digit increase, but we -- yeah, it has been good to see more communities get opened, starting to basically replenish our communities from -- we ran them down a bit early a year to 18 months ago. So still see a solid incremental increase in communities.\nJessica Hansen: And organic growth in our core markets is still going to be the biggest driver, but we did add a few more new markets to our market count this quarter. We're now in 104 markets and have another list of markets behind that that we're planning to expand into as well.\nJay McCanless: That\u2019s great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse. Dan, your line is live.\nDan Oppenheim: Thanks very much. Just a quick question. Given the success that you've had in terms of Express Homes taking share generally, what you're seeing in terms of buyers coming in from competition now and just potentially market share for Express in this environment and how are you seeing that going out?\nDavid Auld: You cut out a little bit, Dan.\nDan Oppenheim: Sorry, in terms of the gains for Express in terms of market share, given the efficiency of affordability there, how you're seeing that in terms of the -- what's happening to the consumer right now?\nDavid Auld: I think we\u2019ll be able to produce great value at the lower end is a tremendous advantage that we have. The bar pool significantly deeper there, qualification may be a little tougher. But as kind of referenced before, people really want to buy home and especially their first home. So I see that segment of our business just continue to get stronger. And, whereas, somebody may have pushed up and price at a very low rate, which we have a lot of first-time homebuyers buying in the Horton brand, ultimately it comes down a payment. And if their desires to own home in a very, very nice community location, our competitive advantage just gets better and better.\nDan Oppenheim: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that's all the time we have for questions. I would now like to turn the floor back over to David for closing remarks.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Holly. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our third quarter results in July. And to the D.R. Horton family, Don Horton and the entire executive team, thank you and congratulate you on delivering an outstanding second quarter. We are incredibly well-positioned today. You once again have proven you are the best of the best in this industry. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's event. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 59% to $4.03 per diluted share compared to $2.53 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 55% to $1.4 billion compared to $930 million. Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 22% to $7.5 billion on 19,828 homes closed, up from $6.2 billion on 19,701 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $378,200, up 21% from the prior year quarter, while the average size of our homes closed was down 1%. Paul? At March 31st, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 570,000 lots, of which 23% were owned and 77% were controlled through purchase contracts. 23% of our total owned lots are finished and 47% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our large capital efficient lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our second quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.1 billion, of which $1.2 billion was for finished lots, $630 million was for land development and $260 million was to acquire land. Paul? Our rental operations generated pre-tax income of $103 million on revenues of $223 million in the second quarter. During the quarter, we sold one multifamily rental property consisting of 126 units for $50 million, and we sold three single-family rental properties totaling 368 homes for $173 million. Our rental property inventory at March 31st was $1.5 billion, compared to $544 million a year ago. Rental property inventory at March 31st included approximately $600 million of multifamily rental properties and $900 million of single-family rental properties. As a reminder, our multifamily and single-family rental sales and inventories are reported in our rental segment and are not included in our homebuilding segments homes closed revenues or inventories. During the quarter, our rental operations subsidiary, DRH Rental, entered into a four-year $750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Availability under the rental revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation based on unrestricted cash and the book value of DRH rental real estate assets. There were no borrowings outstanding on the rental credit facility at quarter end. We now expect our rental operations to generate more than $800 million in revenues during fiscal 2022. Our third quarter rental sales will be lower than the second quarter and fourth quarter sales will be the highest of the year. We also now expect our total rental platform inventories to grow by more than $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 based on current projects in development and a significant pipeline of our future projects. We are positioning our rental operations to be a significant contributor to our revenues, profits and returns in future years. Bill? Carl, I think it was all our decision to slow sales orders based on production capacity. I think we saw and continue to see very good demand and more buyers, qualified buyers out there for our homes today when we release them for sale. But we did see during the quarter that our cycle times continue to extend, and we made the decision in several of our geographies to delay the release of homes until we could give a better delivery date to those customers and provide a better experience for them in the backlog process. So we saw a very strong demand in the quarter, but we did see the cycle times elongate. I think we added two weeks this quarter, unfortunately, and we wanted to make sure we did not create more buyers in backlog with an unhappy experience. Thank you, Ivy. We do see a lot of very strong demand and strong execution on the pricing; we do not sell any of our communities at this point during the development phase. We're selling them at -- in the lease-up phase at stabilization. So, we're seeing still very good demand and very good pricing execution on those transactions that we have closed on. So, current outlook, you would expect cap rates could be affected by rising interest rates, but we're also seeing very strong leasing demand and very strong rental growth, which certainly affect cap rate outlooks. Well, I think you've got certainly municipality challenges through the entitlement process in terms of bringing new lots to the market. And we still haven't seen full return of municipalities when you're talking about permitting and/or inspection process. So, it certainly is impacting some of that as we work through the supply chain challenges and then you finally move homes on to the next stage, it is -- we do see some delays in inspections and some of the municipality services that we were seeing. So, it's certainly been part of the impact to our cycle time extension. Matt, we're very much a bottom-up community level driven company, and we're going to evaluate demand we see at each individual community and submarket and look for home starts to match that demand that our local operators are seeing. And that couples with community replacement needs in those submarkets based upon demand we see in real-time in the field. So in the near term, we'll continue to adjust starts. In the more medium term, we'll look at subdivision openings and phase sizing. And then as well as Paul touched on before, we may be adjusting some product to some smaller sizes, if that's appropriate for the given market. We really haven't made any significant shift and don't see a need to as rates rise. It's going to be more of that shock to payment for folks when they have to reset maybe the size home or price that they can then qualify for. So, we're going to catch those people that have been buying up that may fall down the price curve and/or size of home and still be able to pick them up in a majority of our communities. So, no real shift in what we're doing with any of our buyer demographics. We're still seeing strong demand, as everyone's mentioned, across the spectrum. Truman, I think on the markets, we see markets have varying levels of performance and demand, but they're all very strong. relative to where they've been.

The average sales price of net sales orders in the second quarter was $400,600, up 23% from the prior year quarter. The cancellation rate for the second quarter was 16% compared to 15% in the prior year quarter. New home demand remains very strong despite the recent rise in mortgage rates. We are continuing to sell homes later in the construction cycle to better ensure the certainty of the home close date for our homebuyers with virtually no sales occurring prior to the start of home construction. We expect to continue managing our sales pace in the same manner for the rest of the year. Bill? We started 24,800 homes during the quarter, up 5% from the second quarter last year, bringing our trailing 12-month starts to 95,300 homes. We ended the quarter with 59,800 homes in inventory, up 30% from a year ago. 26,000 of our total homes at March 31st were unsold, of which only 600 were completed. Our average construction cycle times for homes closed in the second quarter increased by almost two weeks since our first quarter and over two months from a year ago. Although we have not seen improvement in the supply chain yet, we continue working to stabilize and then reduce our construction cycle times to historical norms. Mike? Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company continues to execute well. During the second quarter, Forestar reported total revenues of $421.6 million, and pre-tax income of $63.2 million. For the full year, Forestar expects to deliver 19,500 to 20,000 lots, and generate $1.7 billion of revenues with a pre-tax profit margin of 14% to 14.5%. At March 31, Forestar's owned and controlled lot position increased 14% from a year ago to 96,500 lives. 57% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $390 million of our finished lots purchased in the second quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton, and had approximately $580 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 29.9%. Forestar's strong capitalization, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton positions them to continue their profitable growth. Bill??"

            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding second quarter, highlighted by a, 59% [ph] increase in earnings to $4.03 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 60% to $1.9 billion on a 24% increase in revenues. And our consolidated pre-tax profit margin improved 520 basis points to 23.5%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended March 31st was 40.3%, and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 34%. These results reflect our experienced teams, the production capabilities and our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint. Housing market demand remained strong despite the recent increase in mortgage rates and we are focused on maximizing returns while continuing to aggregate market share. There are still significant challenges in the supply chain, including shortages in certain building materials and a very tight labor market. Our construction cycle times were extended further this quarter, and we continue to work on stabilizing and then reducing our cycle times to historical norms. After starting construction on 24,800 homes this quarter, our homes and inventory increased 30% from year ago with only 600 unsold completed homes across the nation. With 33,900 homes in backlog, 59,800 homes in inventory, a robust loss supply and strong trade and supplier relationships, we are well-positioned for consolidated revenue growth of greater than 25% this year. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage position us to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations, while managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace, and inventory levels to optimize returns. Mike? In closing, our results and positions reflect our experienced teams and production capabilities, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across our multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to continue aggregating market share and effectively operating in changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to invest the capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. We are incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations during the remainder of 2022 and in future years. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. From the overall auction lot percentage, we have been focused on it. We're going to continue to focus on it. There is -- obviously, it's going to be capped at 100%. But our goal is just to continue to get better and more efficient. And as to Forestar, very happy with Forestar. I mean -- at some point, yes, it will deconsolidate. But there's still a lot of markets that we think we can help scale Forestar into and if you look at just the earnings we're making, our shareholders are making of Forestar. It's a very good investment and kind of not a bad place to be -- but yes, at some point, it will deconsolidate, but it's more geared toward their platform build-out than it is our desire to liquidate some percentage of our shares. Stephen, I think to your first question, in terms of community design, plan design, I think we are going to continue to focus the affordable range and work towards those buyers. I don't see a significant change in how we build, what we bill. But if it continues to be a push on affordability, then we'll put the appropriate homes in place. It may mean some smaller homes, but not a significant shift from where we are today. In terms of -- in our communities and in our sales offices, certainly, there is a concern from the buying public over rates, but selling later in the process like we do. We don't have as much exposure as we could if we were selling far out to the shifts and rate conditions. And that's why we've continued to restrict our sales to a later time frame, so that we're putting people in backlog at closer to the rate that they're going to close at. I'd say the overall land market as track the sales price of homes. So, it is good to be in a position where we control 550,000 lots at prices contracted two years ago, three years ago, four years ago and not be in a position today where we have to go buy something. So, we are looking at that. We're monitoring it. I believe liquidity is going to drive market share gains and the ability to not be at risk of credit markets and/or banks is a huge competitive advantage for us and we're going to protect that. We're going to be conservative in our land searches there are good deals out there that we put under contract this year that we will take to close. But we are not in a position where we have to go buy anything. And we're going to, I think, see a significant benefit of that as we proceed through this market. Thank you. The rate increase is -- it's eliminating some people from the home buy experience. But we still have more people qualify buyers trying to buy homes than we can produce today. One of the things that really, I think, has impressed me back in 2018 when you saw a rapid rise in rates, demand just was significantly reduced. And then after the rate shock to -- after the rate shock was mitigated, we saw demand come back and come back strong. But through this cycle, which is in even more rapid rate increases, yes, we've had people that don't qualify anymore, but the demand side is still very strong. So just the desire to own homes, and it may be the fact that prices have escalated very fast and rents are escalating even faster than the price of new homes and all the talk about inflation and then locking in your housing costs for 20 years. I mean, it is -- home ownership is a cherished thing today. And the people coming out of the -- millennials coming out or even individuals relocating from other markets to where the growth is taking place. Its just they want to own a home, they want to lock in their housing cost, and they want to get in the neighborhoods that they can raise families in. Thank you. I just -- I've been doing this for a long time. And the desire to own a home is, I think, kind of an American or part of the American culture. It gives you a sense of safety and a nest to build your family. So, I think the downturn in 2008, 2009, 2010 where home values were just decimated that put a big pause on the desire to own homes. I think as this cycle continues and I think it's going to continue to elongate, the housing formation, the desire to get close to neighborhood schools, all those things, it kind of returned home ownership to kind of the American dream again.  So, it's getting in a home today is harder. But it's not nearly as hard as it was when I bought my first home. So, it's it feels like it's almost a cultural shift from -- or a return to family community and I think the demand is significantly higher than the homes that can be produced. So. Thank you. I don't know that it's going to force a larger M&A program. I do think that their inability to secure financing to move forward on different projects or even to start houses is going to open up market opportunity for us, both in our ability to aggregate market share on the home sale side and the ability to control longer and longer land positions at very favorable numbers. So, it's a -- when you look at the impact of a two-plus month expansion of our cycle time and what that's done to our liquidity, and then I understand that we are still building houses much faster than anybody else, and we started at -- and are going to continue to protect a very strong liquidity position. It's -- I got to believe there's tremendous pressure on the -- especially the private builders. And at some point, these guys have made a lot of money over their careers. And they're guaranteeing loans. And at some point, you're just not going to put everything at risk. So I do think that's going to open up market share gains for us. And we are very well-positioned to take those market -- that market when it does open. You cut out a little bit, Dan. I think we'll be able to produce great value at the lower end is a tremendous advantage that we have. The bar pool significantly deeper there, qualification may be a little tougher. But as kind of referenced before, people really want to buy home and especially their first home. So I see that segment of our business just continue to get stronger. And, whereas, somebody may have pushed up and price at a very low rate, which we have a lot of first-time homebuyers buying in the Horton brand, ultimately it comes down a payment. And if their desires to own home in a very, very nice community location, our competitive advantage just gets better and better. Thank you, Holly. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our third quarter results in July. And to the D.R. Horton family, Don Horton and the entire executive team, thank you and congratulate you on delivering an outstanding second quarter. We are incredibly well-positioned today. You once again have proven you are the best of the best in this industry. Thank you."

            "content": "Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the second quarter was 28.9%, up 150 basis points sequentially from the December quarter. The increase in our gross margin for December to March reflects the broad strength of the housing market. The strong demand for homes, combined with a limited supply has allowed us to continue to raise prices and maintain a very low level of sales incentives in most of our communities. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were up 4.8% sequentially. While stick and brick cost per square foot increased 2.5% and our lot cost increased 2.8%. We expect our cost will continue to increase. However, with the strength of today's market conditions, we expect most cost pressures to be offset by price increases in the near-term. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the third quarter to be slightly better than the second quarter. Jessica? Financial services pre-tax income in the second quarter was $92.8 million with a pre-tax profit margin of 41.8%, compared to $107.7 million and 47.8% in the prior year quarter. For the quarter, 99% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes close by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 68% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 41% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 55% of the closings handled by the mortgage company this quarter. Mike? Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic. At March 31st, we had $3.2 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage was 16.4% at the end of March and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 11.3%. Our consolidated leverage at March 31st was 24.9% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 18.9%. At March 31st, our stockholders' equity was $16.8 billion and book value per share was $47.66, up 33% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended March, our return on equity was 34% compared to 27.1% a year ago. During the first six months of the year, our cash used in homebuilding operations was $416 million, which reflects our increased homes and inventory to meet demand and the impact of extended construction cycle-times. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $79.1 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in May. We repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock for $266 million during the quarter for a total of 5.8 million shares repurchased fiscal year-to-date for $544.2 million, an increase of 30% compared to the same period a year ago. Subsequent to quarter end, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our common stock, replacing our prior authorization. The new authorization has no expiration date. We now expect to reduce our outstanding share count by 3% during fiscal 2022. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year. Jessica? Thanks John. We're always focused on aggregating market share and we're positioning ourselves to continue to do that through any economic cycle. Certainly, at some point, impact of rates and impact of affordability will have some impact on demand, and we certainly will adjust our capital allocation at that time. But we believe we're in a strong position to continue to grow. But certainly, those impacts on demand would impact our investment decisions in land at that point in time. Mike, we have seen consistent ability to raise prices through the quarter, seeing consistent increases in our sales order pricing that then flow through our backlog and through our closing pricing. That's what gives us the confidence to say that our margins are going to be slightly better next quarter, because we can see those sales prices coming through in our closings in the next quarter. So to date, we have not seen a change in our ability to raise prices. I think naturally as we look a little bit longer term with the impact of rates and impact of overall price increases. At some point, we would expect that to moderate. But at this point, we have not seeing any signs that as of yet. A little bit of both, Mike. As we look at our capital allocation for the year, our expectations for how much we would utilize, I mean dollars we would utilize a share repurchase has gone up versus our prior estimates. But then certainly, the current valuation of our stock does allow us to buy more shares per dollar as well. And so it's a little bit of both, and that's allowed us to increase our estimate from 2% reduction to a 3% reduction. Yes, it is a constant balance, Truman. We're not giving specific dollar guidance regarding our operating cash flow other than we do expect to generate positive cash flow from our homebuilding operations. On a consolidated basis, our operating cash flow also includes the investments we're making in our rental platform, which obviously are significant, increasing those by $1.5 billion this year. And then certainly one factor today that is tying up some of our capital is the extension of our build being longer than two months longer than a year ago, certainly does tie up a significant amount of capital. But certainly, we are working towards stabilizing that and improving those cycle times, which we would expect to start to bring that cash back some towards the end of fiscal 2022 and then certainly into fiscal 2023. So, it is a balance -- and as we plan our capital allocation, we plan our liquidity targets, we are just seeking to make sure we stay in as a strong and flexible position as possible to handle the -- what we see in the market today and position ourselves for further growth, aggregation and market share and generating returns to our shareholders. Yes, Deepa, we do only guide one quarter out on gross margin, but I would agree with you that currently, we do have some tailwinds with the average prices that have been in our backlog and in our recent sales orders that, some of which will be homes that would close into Q4. I think we do have some tailwinds. But as we've said many times, our true visibility to margin really doesn't go far beyond the quarter. So we only guide specifically to Q3. But we do feel like we're still going to see very good gross margins through Q4 as well. Thank you, Sue. Obviously, an important part of our culture and our business model. We are very focused on ensuring that we stay very efficient with our overhead, while still making sure we're building our overhead and our infrastructure to support the growth. But with the price appreciation that we've seen alongside that that has certainly aided in dropping the SG&A percentage as a percentage of revenue a bit faster, and then honestly, than we would have modeled as well. And so we've been very pleased with that. Certainly, we want to make sure we continue to position ourselves adequately there. But with the prices that we have seen and that we see coming over the next quarter or so, we do expect to still see very good SG&A leverage with the guidance that we're providing for Q3, that assumes another 50 basis point year-over-year improvement in SG&A. So yes, we do see ourselves with an SG& A rate getting down into the sixes and four at least the near term staying there. We're still looking at the low single-digit increase, but we -- yeah, it has been good to see more communities get opened, starting to basically replenish our communities from -- we ran them down a bit early a year to 18 months ago. So still see a solid incremental increase in communities."

I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton.\nJessica Hansen: Thank you, Holly, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Before we get started, today\u2019s call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning\u2019s earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q later today or tomorrow. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding first quarter, highlighted by a 48% increase in earnings to $3.17 per diluted share. Our consolidated pretax income increased 45% to $1.5 billion. On a 19% increase in revenues and our consolidated pretax profit margin improved 380 basis points to 21.2%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31 was 38.5%, and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 32.4%. These results reflect our experienced teams, their production capabilities and our ability to leverage D.R. Horton\u2019s scale across our broad geographic footprint. Even with the recent rise in mortgage rates, housing market conditions remain very robust, and we are focused on maximizing returns while continuing to increase our market share. There are still significant challenges in the supply chain, including shortages in certain building materials and a very tight labor market. We are focused on building the infrastructure and processes to support a higher level of home starts while working to stabilize and then reduce construction cycle times to our historical norms. After starting construction on 25,500 homes this quarter, our homes and inventory increased 30% from a year ago to 54,800 homes with only 1,000 unsold completed homes across the nation. Our January home starts and net sales holders were in line with our targets, and we are well-positioned to achieve double-digit volume growth in 2022. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations, while managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales base and inventory levels to optimize returns. Mike?\nMike Murray: Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 48% to $3.17 per diluted share, compared to $2.14 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 44% to $1.1 billion, compared to $792 million. Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 17% to $6.7 billion on 18,396 homes closed, up from $5.7 billion on 18,739 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $361,800, up 19% from the prior year quarter, while the average size of our homes closed was down 1%. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: Our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 5% to 21,522 homes, while the value increased 29% from the prior year to $8.3 billion. A year ago, our first quarter net sales orders were up 56% due to the surge in housing demand during the first year of the pandemic when we had significantly more completed homes available to sale and prior to the significant supply chain challenges we\u2019ve experienced since. Our average number of active selling communities decreased 3% from the prior year quarter and was up 3% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the first quarter was $383,600, up 22% from the prior year quarter. The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 15%, down from 18% in the prior year quarter. New home demand remains very strong despite the recent rise in mortgage rates. Our local teams are continuing to sell homes later in the construction cycle so we can better ensure the certainty of the home close date for our homebuyers with virtually no sales occurring prior to start of home construction. We plan to continue managing our sales pace in the same manner during the spring, and we expect our number of net sales orders in our second quarter to be equal to the same quarter in the prior year were up by no more than a low-single digit percentage. Our January home sales and net sales order volume were in line with our plans, and we are well-positioned to deliver double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2022 with 29,300 homes in backlog, 54,800 homes in inventory, a robust lot supply and strong trade and supplier relationships. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the first quarter was 27.4%, up 50 basis points sequentially from the September quarter. The increase in our gross margin from September to December reflects the broad strength of the housing market. The strong demand for homes combined with a limited supply has allowed us to continue to raise prices and maintain a very low level of sales incentives in most of our communities. On a per square foot basis, our home sales revenues were up 3.4% sequentially while our cost of sales per square foot increased 2.9%. We expect our construction and lot costs will continue to increase. However, with the strength of today\u2019s market conditions, we expect to offset most cost pressures with price increases in the near-term. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be similar to or slightly better than the first quarter. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: In the first quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.5%, down 40 basis points from 7.9% in the prior year quarter. Our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was lower than any first quarter in our history, and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring our infrastructure adequately supports our business. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: We have increased our housing inventory in response to the strength of demand and are focused on expanding our production capabilities further. We started 25,500 homes during the quarter, up 12% from the first quarter last year, bringing our trailing 12-month starts to 94,200 homes. We ended the quarter with 54,800 homes in inventory, up 30% from a year ago. 25,600 of our total homes at December 31 were unsold, of which only 1,000 were completed. Our average cycle or average construction cycle time for homes closed in the first quarter has increased by almost two weeks since our fourth quarter and two months from a year ago. Although, we have not seen much improvement in the supply chain yet, we are focused on working to stabilize and then reduce our construction cycle times to historical norms. Mike?\nMike Murray: At December 31, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 550,000 lots, of which 24% were owned and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. 23% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 47% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our growing and capital-efficient lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position and is supporting our efforts to increase our production volume to meet demand. Our first quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.2 billion, of which $1.2 billion was for finished lots, $570 million was for land development and $390 million was to acquire land. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot manufacturer, operates in 55 markets across 23 states. Forestar continues to execute extremely well and now expects to grow its lot deliveries this year to a range of 19,500 to 20,000 lots with a pretax profit margin of 13.5% to 14%. At December 31, Forestar\u2019s owned and controlled lot position increased 33% from a year ago to 103,300 lots. 58% of Forestar\u2019s owned lots are under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer based on executed purchase and sale agreements. $330,000 million of our finished lots purchased in the first quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had approximately $500 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt to capital ratio of 33.9%. With its current capitalization, strong lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton, Forestar plans to continue profitably growing their business. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Financial services pretax income in the first quarter was $67.1 million with a pretax profit margin of 36.4% compared to $84.1 million and 44.9% in the prior year quarter. For the quarter, 98% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 66% of our home buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 44% of the mortgage company\u2019s volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 721 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 55% of the closings handled by the mortgage company this quarter. Mike?\nMike Murray: Our rental operations generated pretax income of $70.1 million on revenues of $156.5 million in the first quarter compared to $8.6 million of pretax income on revenues of $31.8 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2021. Our rental property inventory at December 31 was $1.2 billion compared to $386 million a year ago. We sold one multifamily rental property of 350 units for $76.2 million during the quarter. There were no sales of multifamily rental properties during the prior year quarter. We sold two single-family rental properties totaling 225 homes during the quarter for $80.3 million compared to one property sold in the prior year quarter for $31.8 million. At December 31, our rental property inventory included $519 million of multifamily rental properties and $642 million of single-family rental properties. As a reminder, our multifamily and single-family rental sales and inventories are reported in our rental segment and are not included in our homebuilding segments homes closed, revenues or inventories. In fiscal 2022, we continue to expect our rental operations to generate more than $700 million in revenues. We also expect to grow the inventory investment in our rental platform by more than $1 billion this year based on our current projects in development and our significant pipeline of future projects. We are positioning our rental operations to be a significant contributor to our revenues, profits and returns in future years. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. During the three months ended December, our cash used in homebuilding operations was $115 million as we invested significant operating capital to increase our homes and inventory to meet the current strong demand. At December 31, we had $4.1 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of $2.1 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. We believe this level of homebuilding cash and liquidity is appropriate to support the scale and activity of our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 17.3% at the end of December and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 6.9%. Our consolidated leverage at December 31 was 25.1%, and consolidated leverage net of cash was 15.2%. At December 31, our stockholders\u2019 equity was $15.7 billion and book value per share was $44.25, up 29% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended December, our return on equity was 32.4% compared to 24.4% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $80.1 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in February. We repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock for $278.2 million during the quarter. Our remaining share repurchase authorization at December 31 was $268 million. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: As we look forward to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we are expecting market conditions to remain similar with strong demand from homebuyers, but continuing supply chain challenges. We expect to generate consolidated revenues in our March quarter of $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in a range between 19,000 and 20,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be approximately 27.5% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter to be approximately 7.5%. We anticipate the financial services pretax profit margin in the range of 30% to 35%, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24% in the second quarter. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect to close between 90,000 and 92,000 homes, while we now expect to generate consolidated revenues of $34.5 billion to $35.5 billion. We forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2022 of approximately 24%, and we also continue to expect that our share repurchases will reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 2% at the end of fiscal 2022 compared to the end of fiscal 2021. We still expect to generate positive cash flow from our homebuilding operations this year after our investments in home building inventories to support double-digit growth. We will then continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among increasing the investment in our rental operations, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares. David?\nDavid Auld: In closing, our results reflect our experienced teams and production capabilities, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to capitalize on today\u2019s robust market and to effectively operate in changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividend and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. We are incredibly well positioned to continue growing and improving our operations in 2022. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.\nJessica Hansen: Holly, can you open the line for questions, please?\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from John Lovallo with UBS. John, your line is live.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking my questions. The first one, gross margins across the industry have risen to levels that are probably not sustainable over the longer term. I guess the question is, do you believe that this kind of mid to high 20% margin range could persist at DHI for maybe a couple of years? And then as we move forward, what has structurally changed in your opinion that would allow you to have trend margins that are maybe 100 to 200 basis points above the historical average?\nJessica Hansen: Sure, John. We\u2019re very pleased with where our gross margins have gotten through this cycle, and certainly, the strength in the market has been a large driver of that. We probably would never sit here today and say that those are sustainable at these levels through cycles. Typically, gross margin does get somewhat competed away when markets soften. That being said, we\u2019re at extremely strong levels today and can still generate very strong returns even with some margin compression, and we\u2019ll continue to meet the market over time. In terms of what we believe is sustainable, though, compared to our historical averages, certainly, we\u2019re carrying less interest in our cost of sales today. And with what we\u2019ve done from a deleveraging and our balance sheet focus, we would expect that to be a sustainable cost advantage. And then there\u2019s scale advantages with where we\u2019ve gotten in terms of our volume and our building efficiencies with our labor trades and our material suppliers, we would expect some component of the scale advantages to be sustainable as well.\nDavid Auld: And John, we talked a little bit about this. Internally, we talk a lot about it. The industry is changing. It\u2019s just a much more disciplined industry than it was through the last cycle. As we gained in market share as the other public gain in market share. There\u2019s just less \u2013 at least in my mind, my expectation is, there\u2019ll be less volatility at the cycle up and down. It\u2019s just the real businesses today, not speculators.\nJohn Lovallo: Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Okay. And then my second question, in an environment where rates are likely to rise here, what do you view as the strategic advantages of implementing a predominantly spec-focused building model and targeting entry-level buyers, perhaps maybe versus a build-to-order model targeting better financed buyers?\nMike Murray: First of all, John, what we would say is that we\u2019re able to more closely time the application for the mortgage, the qualification for the mortgage and the closing of that mortgage. So the buyer is spending less time in backlog when they\u2019re buying a house that has already started the production process that allows us to have fewer bad things happen to their potential credit profile where then they fall out of backlog and no longer qualify less interest rate risk while they\u2019re in that cycle. And then finally, just a continued focus on affordability, I mean we\u2019re going to continue to seek to be affordable for our homebuyers and our markets.\nJohn Lovallo: Got it. Thank you guys.\nMike Murray: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is live.\nStephen Kim: Yes. Thanks very much, guys. I appreciate all the color here. I was particularly intrigued by your comment about the number of homes you have under construction, 56,600, I think. And I think you also mentioned that your cycle time increased about two weeks. So correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but that would imply, I think, that your time from start to close is about 7.5 months. First of all, is that correct?\nJessica Hansen: Roughly, yes.\nDavid Auld: Yes.\nStephen Kim: Yes. So if I think about your 56,600 homes and assume that you\u2019ll \u2013 you assume basically a 7.5-month cycle time, that would imply that you should be able to close 45,280 over the next two quarters. Your guidance for the second \u2013 this next quarter is, I think, for 19,000 to 20,000 homes, so considerably less than half of that amount. And so I\u2019m curious as to \u2013 is there anything wrong with the way I\u2019m thinking about, how your homes on your construction should ultimately result in closings over the next two quarters, given your cycle time is 7.5 months. And if therefore, we should be thinking that there might be an acceleration in 3Q closings on that basis? Or if you \u2013 if this represents some conservatism about extending cycle times?\nMike Murray: Thank you, Steve. I think one of the things you need to look at is how long those houses have been in production. We started a substantial number of those homes in the most recent quarter. I think we stepped up our starts from Q4 to Q1 by about 3,000 homes. So those homes are obviously going to take a little longer to deliver in the process.\nPaul Romanowski: And as we\u2019re looking at the remainder of the year, the guidance we\u2019re providing for Q2 is based on where the homes are in construction today. But yes, as we look at the full year based on when we started the homes, and we look at where our guidance is for the full year, we are a bit more back-end loaded in terms of our closings in Q3 and Q4 than historically. We are part of that is because of the elongated construction times that we have not seen improved yet, and it\u2019s based on where our homes in construction currently set in terms of the construction cycle.\nStephen Kim: Yes. Great. That\u2019s very helpful. My second question relates to your initiatives in the rental area, which I think is \u2013 you\u2019ve talked about growing that inventory, and therefore, I would assume the associated revenues pretty significantly on a longer-term basis. My question is twofold: one, is there a rule of thumb that we could think what \u2013 let\u2019s say, every $1 billion of inventory on a steady-state basis might yield in terms of a level of revenues that we could be forecasting? And then secondly, conceptually, do you think that the demand for selling your rental properties is likely to be more resilient in the face of a rising rate environment than perhaps sales to folks who would be looking to actually move in? I know that\u2019s your core business, but nevertheless, there is so much concern that many people have about rising rates and the impact on the entry-level buyer that I was curious as to whether you felt like there was a backstop behind that buyer for rental operators that are sort of getting in line and would love to buy the homes that you\u2019re building for rent.\nPaul Romanowski: Well, I\u2019ll start, Steve. I guess, first, we\u2019re still growing this business and learning this business. Still a little bit early for us to be able to generalize on averages in terms of what level of revenue we might see per unit. We\u2019re building across our entire homebuilding footprint. So every property is unique in terms of size and the product and the market in which it\u2019s in. So we\u2019re individually underwriting each one relative to whether it\u2019s better for-rent community versus a for-sale community. Obviously, we\u2019ve been very pleased with the value that we\u2019ve been able to generate thus far and very excited about the opportunity of growing this business and adding value over time and been very pleased with the demand that there has been for our communities thus far and the execution that we\u2019ve seen in terms of our sales thus far.\nBill Wheat: Yes. Stephen, we see such strong demand today for this product in this low interest rate environment. And I think to your question of if we see rates tick up, do we see that shift? We like the ability to be in the market with this rental platform and be able to adjust to those shifts and market conditions. We do believe that we\u2019re going to continue to see strong demand. Maybe not as strong as it is today with such a new category, but we feel good about our position and the number of communities we\u2019re planning.\nStephen Kim: Sounds good. Thanks very much, guys.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mike Rehaut with JPMorgan. Mike, your line is live.\nMike Rehaut: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question I had was on the SG&A side. You came in nicely below your prior guidance at 7.5% versus 8% before versus your 8% guidance and down 40 bps year-over-year. You\u2019re also guiding for, I guess, 2Q guidance to be down only 10 bps year-over-year. So I was just curious around what were the sources of the significantly better-than-expected results in the first quarter, and why you don\u2019t expect further leverage in the second quarter similar to the first?\nBill Wheat: Sure. Thanks, Mike. In the current environment where we\u2019re seeing such significant average selling price increases. That\u2019s certainly one driver of the SG&A leverage on the P&L. A little difficult to predict exactly where the average ASP might fall in a particular quarter. The trend over time has been upward over the last several quarters, though, and that\u2019s certainly a contributor to it. So I would say, we\u2019re probably a little bit conservative in projecting out the level of increases in our ASPs. We are very actively building infrastructure to support the significant increase in scale that we have seen across our business over the last year and that we\u2019re projecting for the rest of the coming year, and so we are anticipating significant increases in our SG&A spend to support that. And so we\u2019re just basically balancing that versus our expectations for our closings. And with our closings expectations essentially roughly flat with last year in Q2 based on our guidance, we\u2019re not getting the volume leverage, but we are still seeing the leverage from selling price increases.\nMike Rehaut: Okay. Bill. So before I just hit on the second question, just to make sure I understand, given the expectation for the stronger revenue growth on a full year basis, it seems like it\u2019s safe to assume maybe more than like a 10 bps SG&A leverage for the full year. If I\u2019m thinking about that right, given you have the higher confidence, let\u2019s say, around an ASP for the full year at least. If you could comment on that, that would be helpful. And then secondly, just on the rental income side that was a source of upside, I believe, relative to our expectations. I believe relative to guidance as well, if I\u2019m not mistaken. 45% of a margin, is that the right \u2013 that 45%? Just any guidance or thoughts around how to think about the remainder of the year relative to the revenue generation you continue to expect?\nBill Wheat: Okay. Well, first to wrap up the SG&A question. We\u2019re not guiding specifically to the full year on SG&A. However, with the kind of heavier volume expected in our annual guidance in Q3 and Q4, we would expect to see more leverage on SG&A probably than 10 basis points in Q3 and Q4 versus Q2. With respect to the rental expectations, we\u2019ve guided annually to more than $700 million of revenue. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the margins and the execution we\u2019ve seen on the sales recently. The margin this quarter, obviously, was very strong. Some projects will continue to generate those margins, others could certainly be short of that. We haven\u2019t specifically guided to the margin on that business as of yet because each project is unique. In terms of volume in the coming quarter, we would expect Q2 volume to be relatively similar to Q1, and which we closed two single-family properties and one multifamily property. And then for the year, basically lining that out to the $700 million of revenue.\nMike Rehaut: Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Alan Ratner with Zelman. Alan, your line is live.\nAlan Ratner: Hey, good morning. Great quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, I might be parsing the comments a little bit too much here, so I just want to get some clarification. I think you guys said earlier that you expect to offset most cost increases with price increases. And obviously, up to this point, it\u2019s \u2013 based on the margin trajectory, you\u2019ve been able to offset more than the cost increases. So I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s a change in your thinking. Whether you\u2019re going to be maybe a little bit less aggressive pushing prices as 2022 progresses? Or am I reading too much into that comment?\nDavid Auld: I just \u2013 Alan, as we continue to increase our starts for demand, I would say at some point, there\u2019s going to be more of an equilibrium. And at that point, margins and ASPs should mitigate some \u2013 we don\u2019t know. Again, we\u2019re return-based absorption targets, start targets, being able to sustain a level of starts drives efficiencies through the entire process. We don\u2019t know what the future is. We do know that we can operate within that future and maximize the results, both returns and market share gains.\nJessica Hansen: And part of that thought process also, Alan, is our continued focus on affordability. And so although the market is really strong today and we continue to take price, we\u2019re probably not out there like some other builders trying to take every last dollar of price. We\u2019re doing what we can to meet the market and try to stay affordable in spite of rising cost conditions.\nAlan Ratner: Got it. Both of that makes a lot of sense, and Jessica, your follow-on comment there was actually something I was going to ask next and that\u2019s that your price increases, especially on the order side, have been very strong. And we\u2019re starting to hear from some builders talking about their desire to actually bring that average price back down a little bit over the next year or two as they introduce new communities. And maybe they\u2019re a little bit further out or maybe the floor plans are a bit smaller. So should we think about that similarly with you guys? Are you actually kind of looking at that average price and kind of your standing in the marketplace and trying to actually bring that down on at least an absolute basis going forward?\nDavid Auld: Alan, we\u2019re always focused on affordability. And we talk entirely about a sustainable run rate in these communities and that involves not overpricing at any point in time. So \u2013 but yes, we\u2019re looking at product. We\u2019re looking at communities, land, how do we drive more and more efficiency into the process so that we can maintain a more affordable living cost. And then that\u2019s \u2013 to me, that\u2019s market scale as consistency and starts. It\u2019s \u2013 as we continue to drive market share gains, consolidate labor, we\u2019re in a better position to acquire land and it\u2019s just an ongoing continuous effort to get a little bit better every day.\nAlan Ratner: Makes a lot of sense. If I can sneak in one last one just on January. You and others have obviously highlighted very strong demand continue in January. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve seen any notable shifts in sentiment or activity across your price points given the uptick here in rates? Are you seeing maybe more discretionary buyers jumping in because their concerned rates are going to continue climbing, so like in your active adult business or Emerald? Or has the strength been pretty consistent with what you\u2019ve seen prior to this move?\nMike Murray: Alan, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen in the last month any real discernible difference. We still have more buyers in all of our markets than we have homes available. And so we are continuing to release those homes at a later stage of construction and so meeting that demand with the inventory as it gets to that point in its construction cycle. So hard to gauge whether it\u2019s a significant shift of any sort, and we still are seeing strong demand across all of our markets and across all demand basis.\nDavid Auld: All price points.\nAlan Ratner: Perfect. All right. Thanks for the time, guys. Appreciate it.\nJessica Hansen: Thanks, Alan.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Carl, your line is live.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks. Hey, everybody. Paul, I think you are the one who said this that you\u2019re working to stabilize and then reduce cycle times. Pragmatically, what specifically do you do to make that happen, given that builders are outsourcers effectively? And why and how do you do that better at Horton than, say, a peer would?\nDavid Auld: Carl, I think a lot of the things at Horton is just because we just work harder than other. Everybody works hard, but our people are just phenomenal problem solvers, and it\u2019s a part of the culture, the decentralized nature. I mean they take ownership and they saw problems. What we have tried to do is guide the divisions to understand the capacity within communities and consistently start homes to meet that capacity and when they do that, the capacity increases because the people in those communities get a little better at building those houses. And we\u2019re seeing that in \u2013 I don\u2019t know what the industry average is, but I got to believe we are completing homes even though it is not to our historical norm steel more rapidly than our peers out there. But it\u2019s a consistent starts, limited product, limited options, making it easier for these traits to get in and get out, reducing the SKUs that we\u2019re asking our suppliers to hold and, in some cases, ordering early. In some cases \u2013 I mean anything, everything that we can do to eliminate or break a bottleneck and the people in the field are doing. And I can tell you 100 stories, but I\u2019m not going to.\nCarl Reichardt: Fair enough. Thanks, David. And then I wanted to ask about lot count. You\u2019re over 550,000 under control now and the buildup spend significant, right? I mean, I think it was up 40% last year. So at some point, these lots got to come to market. So if you think about how they might, is this \u2013 you could have bigger communities going forward. You could have more communities going forward. In existing markets, you could have new markets. Can you sort of break out as you look at your lot position now sort of as you grow where those different elements fit into the long-term puzzle here, kind of bigger communities, more communities in existing markets, i.e., potentially more share or new markets? Thanks.\nBill Wheat: Yes. D, all of the above. It will be\u2026\nCarl Reichardt: I said that one already, but in terms of sort of the long-term split is kind of what I\u2019m asking.\nBill Wheat: I don\u2019t know that we\u2019d see a big change in our long-term split. We are continually evaluating new markets. And at the same time, the mandate is to the teams in the field, aggregate your market share. We feel that local scale drives a lot of value in the business for us and the lot supply is a key part of it. I will tell you the frustration, it takes longer \u2013 just like it has to build a house, it takes longer to get a neighborhood approved. It takes longer to get lots built today than it did a year or two years ago. And so we\u2019re continuing to challenge that. So just like our housing supply has increased relative to our current delivery levels, our lot \u2013 controlled lot position has increased to support those lots coming on just taking longer to get into the finish line.\nJessica Hansen: And our market count has continued to expand. So we\u2019re in 102 markets today. That\u2019s up just four markets sequentially. We continue to fill out kind of the more Midwestern Ohio Valley part of our footprint and continue to look at additional markets that would make sense to expand into as well.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks, everybody.\nBill Wheat: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Matthew, your line is live.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. So have a question on cancellations and interest rates, just given how low cancellations are at this point. I know you do those stress tests on the backlog and have talked about sort of flexing 100 basis points increase in mortgage rates. But I guess to what degree does the speed of rates rising coupled with these extended cycle times play into all that? I mean we had a 50 basis point rise in just four weeks. You got buyers in backlog that may have to wait several months at this point. So how do we think about risk to an uptick in cancellations here? Thank you.\nBill Wheat: Well, I think as you look at those stress tests that we do, and we\u2019ve run it again and seeing a slight uptick in it, but still nominal and the interest rate increase we\u2019ve seen today have spurred further demand much more so than knock people out of qualification and ability to qualify.\nJessica Hansen: And I think Mike mentioned earlier, but that\u2019s also part of the key to selling homes later in the construction cycle as they\u2019re not having to lock for longer or be worried about what an interest rate move does. So if we\u2019re selling closer to the time of completion and home closing, there\u2019s less risk in that regard as well.\nMatthew Bouley: Yes. Okay. Good. That makes sense. And then second one on the cycle times again. Maybe they improve at some point, maybe they don\u2019t. But assuming there\u2019s not a significant amount of new building products capacity coming online this year. Are there any structural changes you\u2019re making to the supply chain? Even if it\u2019s not possible in every single building material, is there anything you can do with more prefab packages? For example, I heard you say earlier, simplification of SKUs. And any of these changes you\u2019re making today, are they structural in nature? Or is it simply adjusting to whatever the market is at any point?\nMike Murray: I think as David mentioned before, I mean, it\u2019s everything everywhere. We definitely empower our local business leaders to solve the bottlenecks that are unique to their market, and there are some that are broader in nature and our national purchasing team and regional purchasing teams do a great job of partnering with those manufacturers and our trade partners to give them more forward visibility to our expected demands and then help to understand how that product gets from point of manufacturer through distribution, kind of get the product that\u2019s being earmarked for us into the distribution chain through it on to our job sites when we need it. Not always a perfect process. We would certainly like it to be faster, but it\u2019s increased communication, simplification of product and a lot of anything we need to do market by market.\nMatthew Bouley: Great. Well, thank you for the color.\nMike Murray: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Susan, your line is live.\nSusan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nDavid Auld: Good morning.\nSusan Maklari: My first question is, is thinking about the potential use for more incentives in the market \u2013 given the fact that the inventory is so low, do you think that the likelihood of us seeing any real meaningful increase there is actually much more \u2013 is actually much lower than it has been in the past. Do you think that we would need to see just a lot more on the ground in order for anything to meaningfully change?\nDavid Auld: I don\u2019t see any change in the incentives coming. It\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m sure at some point, the inventory will catch up with demand. It is still significantly out of balance, especially if you\u2019re looking at the areas where the Florida, the Texas, the Arizonas, even across the Midwest where you have job growth and influx of people. It\u2019s \u2013 you never say never, but the difficulty of getting lots on the ground and then getting houses built is \u2013 it\u2019s going to be very difficult to catch up with demand anytime in the next couple of years.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. That\u2019s helpful.\nMike Murray: Susan, you touched on it with the level of inventory out there, the use of incentives. I think you\u2019d have to see a significant increase in the level of unsold inventories, especially unsold completed inventories. And today, we\u2019re at 1,000 unsold completed homes at the end of December, very low for us this time of the year to be carrying that few homes.\nSusan Maklari: Right. Okay. Thank you for that. And then my follow-up is, thinking about the operational pressures in the industry, even if the supply chain on the material side does eventually catch up and things there normalized, do you think that we could be facing an overall tighter labor environment and construction relative to where we were before COVID? And if so, how do you think about your ability to overcome that and continue to increase the level of production that you can deliver?\nDavid Auld: It goes back to market scale and even within submarkets being able to control a labor base and keeping them busy, keeping them in the same location. I just can\u2019t over \u2013 I can\u2019t oversell that advantage where you\u2019ve got a program where we\u2019re releasing 15, 20, 30 houses every month, month after month after month after month. The aggregation of labor in those kinds of communities is \u2013 it\u2019s very advantageous in today\u2019s world. And it also gives you the ability to kind of direct some of that labor through the two or three or four or five a month absorption communities. So it\u2019s market scale. It\u2019s \u2013 again, everything that we\u2019ve done, simplifying the product, trying to maintain affordability and then having well-located communities with long running times, so.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Good luck.\nDavid Auld: Thank you.\nJessica Hansen: Thanks, Susan.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Eric, your line is live.\nEric Bosshard: Good morning.\nDavid Auld: Good morning.\nEric Bosshard: A couple of things. First of all, the outlook on costs, if you could just provide some clarity on where that goes and especially, trying to figure out the movement in lumber, how that is flowing through? Where were trough lumber and where the lumber impact goes going forward, especially on the cost side?\nJessica Hansen: Sure. So I\u2019ll start with lumber and then somebody else can chime in on the rest of our cost structure. Lumber costs have remained really volatile as I know you\u2019re aware. We have had some opportunities to purchase at costs that were well below the peaks we saw, I guess, last spring and into the summer. However, those reductions in prices lasted a shorter period of time than we really expected and really probably hoped and lumber has been on the rise again for the last few months. So there\u2019s been other supply chain delays that also caused the volatility in lumber prices. We do hope that we\u2019ll see a mix that leans towards slightly lower costs in Q2, which is baked into our Q2 gross margin guide for flat to slightly up gross margins, but then we do expect our lumber cost to trend back up in our closing starting in Q3. And other costs?\nMike Murray: It\u2019s kind of a mixed bag, but we would generally be seeing slight cost pressures in most places and so that\u2019s been offset by price increases, I think. Some of the lumber relief we should see in Q2, early Q3, will help with some of that as well, but as Jessica mentioned, lumber prices have gone back up, and so those will be flowing through closings later this fiscal year.\nJessica Hansen: And really with home prices continue to increase, I mean, generally, all costs typically follow. And so we really wouldn\u2019t expect to see much in the way of cost relief until you see some sort of slowdown in home price appreciation.\nEric Bosshard: Okay. And then secondly, it seems like just a math equation, but I know there\u2019s more to it than that. But the incremental \u2013 the modest increase in the revenue guide for the year with the same deliveries, it appears that it\u2019s just looking at price and extrapolating that out, but what else were the considerations and taking a bit more optimistic position on the full year revenue growth, especially in front of the selling season?\nBill Wheat: Yes, Eric, it really is just an extrapolation of where we see prices now. We\u2019ve got a few more months of visibility into our selling prices and where our closing prices moved up to in Q1 and what our visibility is going into Q2 that we feel like the sales prices that are baked in and that we have visibility to that justified increasing, a pretty nice increase in our annual revenue guide. But obviously, with the continued challenges on the supply chain, construction cycle times elongating, we didn\u2019t really feel like we had any more room on the volume side as of yet. So it\u2019s really solely priced, and we feel good about that guidance for the year.\nEric Bosshard: Okay. That makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America. Rafe, your line is live.\nRafe Jadrosich: Hi, it\u2019s Rafe. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nDavid Auld: Good morning.\nRafe Jadrosich: I wanted to just start on the rental business. Can you talk a little bit about the returns you\u2019re targeting in the rental business? And how that could compare to homebuilding longer-term? And then will you be targeting different markets in the rental business compared to the homebuilding segment?\nMike Murray: So Rafe, what we\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re growing that business pretty aggressively, and we\u2019ve been very pleased with actually the returns that, that business is produced on a trailing 12-month basis. The profits that segments generated relative to its inventory investment have been about 20% and that\u2019s in a heavy growth ramp. So we would expect to see that continue to increase, especially when we get to have more of the projects delivering on a more consistent basis. And I would say that the markets we seek to serve with that, it\u2019s going to line up very well with our homebuilding for sale footprint as well. We\u2019ve seen a lot of markets accept the product very well, and the investor base very excited about those projects as well.\nRafe Jadrosich: And then on \u2013 in terms of the pace of your home starts, obviously, the average ticked up a lot in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, I think about $1,000 a month. What\u2019s allowing you to increase that pace sequentially? And then how should we think about that going forward?\nPaul Romanowski: Yes. I think that that\u2019s in line with our plans and what we have set forth across all of our divisions and communities. We target an absorption pace per community plan well ahead to make sure that we have those permits in hand and lots in front of us. It\u2019s not easier today to put lots on the ground any more than it is easier to build a home, but we have incredible operators in the field who stay ahead of this and it\u2019s allowed us to continually sequentially quarter-over-quarter increase our start pace and that\u2019s a cadence that we hope to continue. The real key to our ability to do that is our lot position, having that long lot position controlled and strong supplier relationships on will and the developer side puts our operators and positions to continue to start and increase our start base.\nRafe Jadrosich: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Mike, your line is live.\nMike Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of follow-ups here, and maybe first one ties into the last one a little bit, but the order guidance for your fiscal 2Q being flat to low-single digits. It seems like you\u2019ve been pretty successful getting some inventory rebuild both sequentially and year-on-year. Your comps get a little easier in 2Q versus 1Q. So can you just talk about the moving pieces on that order guide? And why there can be some upside there?\nMike Murray: I think we\u2019re still seeing a restriction on sales relative to where the inventory is getting to in production. So we\u2019re still waiting to sell the homes closer to the delivery date, and so that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s really the real driver is on our sales expectation. Our comp is still up against a 35% increase last year in the second quarter. It does certainly get to be a much easier comp in Q3 and Q4 this year from a sales perspective.\nMike Dahl: Got it. Okay. And my second question, I wanted to follow-up on one of Steve\u2019s questions from earlier around kind of rentals being potentially a backstop for sale because it\u2019s kind of an interesting concept, especially as you scale that side of your business and the partnerships you have with buyers of those assets. And so if the idea is, at some point in time, if for-sale demand were to slow, there could be an institutional buyer that would be looking at additional communities that you may have currently built as for sale, but someone may want to buy wholesale and turn to rentals. Can you talk a little bit more about how you would view opportunities like that? And I know the economics and the returns can look very different so maybe just even conceptually, what it would have to take in terms of what the moving pieces around the return dynamics, if you were to look at bulk sale in our community that was not intended for bulk sale at some point in the future?\nDavid Auld: Yes. Mike, I\u2019ve always \u2013 we\u2019ve always believed that the rental platform when we get it built out will derisk our land portfolio because it does give us another lever. But from a just a philosophical standpoint, we believe in the fore sale business. We believe home ownership in the country is very important. Today, our goal is to deliver more homes because the demand is there, and it\u2019s hard to believe, five years from now, homes are going to be more affordable than they are today. So every family we can get in the home, we feel like we \u2013 is a win for us and for that family. When we look at the risk in the rental platform, the ability to scale that up, the segment that\u2019s going to create \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a real business all on its own. And because of the geographic platform and the embedded divisions within that geography, our ability to scale that and touch every market is \u2013 we see as just great opportunity for our shareholders and for our people internally.\nMike Dahl: Okay. Thanks, Dave.\nDavid Auld: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Ken, your line is live.\nKen Zener: Good morning, everybody.\nDavid Auld: Hey, Ken.\nKen Zener: You guys were better because you paid for your own phones. I have two simple questions. One, obviously, with insatiable demand, how you guys are approaching the cycle time in construction? Basically, it looks like your investments in your inventory units are slowing, right? Cycle time is up 5% sequentially. You guys rose inventory 14%. Is that pretty much the move that you guys will pursue into the second half if the cycle times continue to compress that you\u2019ll just throw more units into the ground to compensate for that slower cycle time?\nDavid Auld: We have start targets and we talk about consistent sustainable starts driving ultimately sales and closings, and it\u2019s based on the capacity within divisions to deliver those homes.\nKen Zener: Okay. That\u2019s fine. I mean it seems to me that\u2019s the way you\u2019re approaching it. And I guess, realizing these conference call is long already, David, could you just \u2013 we spoke about this in the past, the interest rate you paid on your first home. You highlighted obviously the very strong demand, strong job growth. Can you guys just comment \u2013 I mean we recently wrote about it, but can you comment on the fact with your perspective about your comfort with the real rates being negative now compared to when you took your first mortgage rate? Just as a kind of a broad thought. Appreciate it.\nDavid Auld: It\u2019s a great time. Housing is more affordable today than it certainly was in the 1980s. The ability to get into a house, lock down your homeownership or your housing cost for the next 20 years is a significant driving force in what\u2019s going on because as overall cost inflation, interest rates, as those continue to move up, the people that have bought a house today, even if it\u2019s at a price that\u2019s 15%, 20% higher than it was last year, are \u2013 I mean it\u2019s just a great thing. So the other thing, Ken, that we really don\u2019t talk much about, but it\u2019s \u2013 when I was 20, I mean that was just \u2013 that was what was expected. You figured out a way to buy a house and that became less cool for use of a stupid term, as the millennials came into their 20s. But what I\u2019m seeing and what my millennial daughter is telling me is, now it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s a big part of the narrative on social media is, it\u2019s \u2013 people want to own homes again. And it\u2019s just \u2013 I think I\u2019m amazed sometimes at some of the conversations around housing and I look at what it was and look at what it is. I look at the \u2013 just the demographic demand that\u2019s out there, I look at the wealth effect of everything that\u2019s happened over the last 10 years and the American public is. They\u2019re in a good place, and from an affordability standpoint, home ownership is better than it was in the 1980s. So I\u2019m very optimistic about what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m very optimistic about this company, and I\u2019m just in all of our people and how \u2013 what they are accomplishing out there, so.\nKen Zener: Thank you.\nDavid Auld: I don\u2019t know if I answer your question, but I thought you got it I think.\nKen Zener: All is clear. Thank you.\nJessica Hansen: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Truman, your line is live.\nTruman Patterson: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions here. So David, just want to follow-up on one of your prior comments about the public scanning market share, and I know it might be difficult to generalize, but I\u2019m hoping to understand what you\u2019re hearing on the ground from local operators regarding some of your private builder competitors. Are they expecting their home inventory to jump significantly through 2022, expecting strong activity or strong active land or community count growth? Or are you expecting more of the same of a pretty constrained environment for your private builder peers? And I\u2019m also asking this in light that you won\u2019t make up 10% plus of the market, you all had really nice order growth in the quarter. But when you look at new home sales in the fourth quarter, it was down more than 20% plus. So I\u2019m really hoping you can help us think through this as we move through 2022.\nDavid Auld: We actually were talking about this and getting ready for the call. The private builders and even some of the smaller public builders are going to have very difficult time delivering houses. I mean we\u2019re having \u2013 it is hard for us. I mean it\u2019s probably harder to complete and finish a house today as it\u2019s been in my career in homebuilding. And as these private guys who don\u2019t have our scale, who don\u2019t have our ability to driver result, their houses are setting and that\u2019s going to cut off their access to the next house they start. Anecdotally, we are talking to the builders end markets, they\u2019re just tired. They don\u2019t \u2013 they\u2019ve got six, seven, eight banks. They\u2019re sideways with two of them, and they\u2019re looking to us to take out their log supply and they maybe become a developer for us in that market. So it\u2019s \u2013 if the supply chains don\u2019t loosen up, I think you\u2019re going to see the consolidation accelerate in the market by the big box because what is the big constraint on the market on housing is the ability to get lots in front of you. And the private guys, they don\u2019t have that ability that publics do and that\u2019s \u2013 so when you look at new home sales decline, that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with demand, that has to be built \u2013 60% of the homes being built out, they\u2019re being built by non-public. And I think all of this cycle, you\u2019re going to see that group\u2019s ability to start houses continue to deteriorate and that is going to get picked up by the public. Even if the overall housing market \u2013 new home housing market declines, I think the top 10 [indiscernible] are going to pick up market share and they\u2019re going to continue to grow. So that\u2019s what happening.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Interesting. There\u2019s clearly been a lot of discussion with the Fed likely raising rates this year. We can debate what sort of impact that might have on demand versus lack of supply and everything, but hypothetically, let\u2019s say, demand does soften, which consumer segment do you all think holds up relatively better between entry-level, move-up, luxury, active adult? And are there any geographies that you all think might underperform?\nJessica Hansen: This is \u2013 probably, I know somewhat of a contrarian view the way the market. Sometimes it reacts to entry-level builders, but we generally continue to think about an entry-level buyer as a buyer out of need rather than discretion. So although as prices continue to rise and/or rates are to increase and affordability gets negatively impacted, you do lose a subset of entry-level buyers that can qualify from. We do expect over the long-term that to continue to be the lion\u2019s share of the demand, which is why we continue to focus on affordability, because as I said, those buyers are buying out of need. Whereas the further the price curve you go, that\u2019s a more discretionary buyer, maybe a little bit more financially savvy that is more focused on timing of an interest rate versus just an absolute monthly payment.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: In the interest of time, your final question is coming from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Deepa, your line is live.\nDeepa Raghavan: Hi, thanks very much for squeezing me in. A couple ones for me. So let me ask on the affordability issue. We look at trends, it just doesn\u2019t correlate to the concern that\u2019s out there on affordability. And Dave, like you pointed out, rates are still historically low and it looks like we could end up having the whole \u2013 the industry, the homebuilders could end up having good pricing power this year, too. My question is, is the affordability issue being raised too ahead of its time? Or do you believe 2022 or 2023 can be structurally impaired or impacted from some buyers being priced out in this continually tight imbalanced environment?\nMike Murray: As we\u2019ve seen in our sales offices and demand, we\u2019re not seeing people being priced out to can be read today, and we\u2019re generally focused at a price point lower than most of our competitors in the markets that we serve. What I would say is that going forward, you see very good household income growth inflation is certainly out there. It\u2019s across the board and as someone touched on before. We could be at negative real interest rates to own a home, so it\u2019s a very powerful economic decision to go ahead and buy a house today and lock in that interest rate relative to current inflation expectations. So still feel very good about the demand we\u2019re seeing into 2022. Hard to predict much beyond that because you just don\u2019t know, but we do like what we see in 2022 for sure.\nDeepa Raghavan: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Dave, when we met you last summer, you mentioned expanding in Ohio Valley in parts of Midwest as newer markets. But can you talk through what\u2019s the economic engine that will drive job growth there? It\u2019s hard for us to conceive that post COVID with people decided to pack their bags and move to Ohio just because they can work remotely.\nDavid Auld: Yes. There is a big population base there now. You\u2019ve got some of the best universities in the country that are there. You\u2019re seeing a migration out of what we\u2019ve historically been the tech areas and/or the think tank areas, financial areas into these incubators, which are these major universities. I\u2019m just \u2013 I\u2019m a big believer that long-term, the quality of life, just the access to really smart people is going to drive companies and grow companies into these markets. You see it in Austin. You see it in Nashville, Columbus. It\u2019s just across Indianapolis. There are brilliant people starting what are going to be great big companies that that find that that environment just a better place to be than some of the what has historically been high tech, high income markets. And the population of the U.S., it \u2013 those towns, those cities are great cities, and they offer a lot and that\u2019s what...\nDeepa Raghavan: All right. Thanks \u2013 yeah. Thanks very much. Appreciate the color and good luck.\nDavid Auld: Thank you.\nOperator: That is all the time we have for questions today. I would like to turn the floor back over to David Auld for any closing comments.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Holly. We appreciate everybody\u2019s time on the call today and look forward to speak with you in our second quarter results in April and our the D.R. Horton family, outstanding first quarter. It\u2019s amazing what\u2019s the \u2013 our people are accomplishing it there, and Don Horton and the entire executive team are humbled with the opportunity to represent you. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 48% to $3.17 per diluted share, compared to $2.14 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 44% to $1.1 billion, compared to $792 million. Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 17% to $6.7 billion on 18,396 homes closed, up from $5.7 billion on 18,739 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $361,800, up 19% from the prior year quarter, while the average size of our homes closed was down 1%. Paul? At December 31, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 550,000 lots, of which 24% were owned and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. 23% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 47% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our growing and capital-efficient lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position and is supporting our efforts to increase our production volume to meet demand. Our first quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.2 billion, of which $1.2 billion was for finished lots, $570 million was for land development and $390 million was to acquire land. Paul? Our rental operations generated pretax income of $70.1 million on revenues of $156.5 million in the first quarter compared to $8.6 million of pretax income on revenues of $31.8 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2021. Our rental property inventory at December 31 was $1.2 billion compared to $386 million a year ago. We sold one multifamily rental property of 350 units for $76.2 million during the quarter. There were no sales of multifamily rental properties during the prior year quarter. We sold two single-family rental properties totaling 225 homes during the quarter for $80.3 million compared to one property sold in the prior year quarter for $31.8 million. At December 31, our rental property inventory included $519 million of multifamily rental properties and $642 million of single-family rental properties. As a reminder, our multifamily and single-family rental sales and inventories are reported in our rental segment and are not included in our homebuilding segments homes closed, revenues or inventories. In fiscal 2022, we continue to expect our rental operations to generate more than $700 million in revenues. We also expect to grow the inventory investment in our rental platform by more than $1 billion this year based on our current projects in development and our significant pipeline of future projects. We are positioning our rental operations to be a significant contributor to our revenues, profits and returns in future years. Bill? First of all, John, what we would say is that we're able to more closely time the application for the mortgage, the qualification for the mortgage and the closing of that mortgage. So the buyer is spending less time in backlog when they're buying a house that has already started the production process that allows us to have fewer bad things happen to their potential credit profile where then they fall out of backlog and no longer qualify less interest rate risk while they're in that cycle. And then finally, just a continued focus on affordability, I mean we're going to continue to seek to be affordable for our homebuyers and our markets. Thanks, John. Thank you, Steve. I think one of the things you need to look at is how long those houses have been in production. We started a substantial number of those homes in the most recent quarter. I think we stepped up our starts from Q4 to Q1 by about 3,000 homes. So those homes are obviously going to take a little longer to deliver in the process. Alan, I don't think we've seen in the last month any real discernible difference. We still have more buyers in all of our markets than we have homes available. And so we are continuing to release those homes at a later stage of construction and so meeting that demand with the inventory as it gets to that point in its construction cycle. So hard to gauge whether it's a significant shift of any sort, and we still are seeing strong demand across all of our markets and across all demand basis. I think as David mentioned before, I mean, it's everything everywhere. We definitely empower our local business leaders to solve the bottlenecks that are unique to their market, and there are some that are broader in nature and our national purchasing team and regional purchasing teams do a great job of partnering with those manufacturers and our trade partners to give them more forward visibility to our expected demands and then help to understand how that product gets from point of manufacturer through distribution, kind of get the product that's being earmarked for us into the distribution chain through it on to our job sites when we need it. Not always a perfect process. We would certainly like it to be faster, but it's increased communication, simplification of product and a lot of anything we need to do market by market. Thank you. Susan, you touched on it with the level of inventory out there, the use of incentives. I think you'd have to see a significant increase in the level of unsold inventories, especially unsold completed inventories. And today, we're at 1,000 unsold completed homes at the end of December, very low for us this time of the year to be carrying that few homes. It's kind of a mixed bag, but we would generally be seeing slight cost pressures in most places and so that's been offset by price increases, I think. Some of the lumber relief we should see in Q2, early Q3, will help with some of that as well, but as Jessica mentioned, lumber prices have gone back up, and so those will be flowing through closings later this fiscal year. So Rafe, what we're seeing is we're growing that business pretty aggressively, and we've been very pleased with actually the returns that, that business is produced on a trailing 12-month basis. The profits that segments generated relative to its inventory investment have been about 20% and that's in a heavy growth ramp. So we would expect to see that continue to increase, especially when we get to have more of the projects delivering on a more consistent basis. And I would say that the markets we seek to serve with that, it's going to line up very well with our homebuilding for sale footprint as well. We've seen a lot of markets accept the product very well, and the investor base very excited about those projects as well. I think we're still seeing a restriction on sales relative to where the inventory is getting to in production. So we're still waiting to sell the homes closer to the delivery date, and so that's kind of what's really the real driver is on our sales expectation. Our comp is still up against a 35% increase last year in the second quarter. It does certainly get to be a much easier comp in Q3 and Q4 this year from a sales perspective. As we've seen in our sales offices and demand, we're not seeing people being priced out to can be read today, and we're generally focused at a price point lower than most of our competitors in the markets that we serve. What I would say is that going forward, you see very good household income growth inflation is certainly out there. It's across the board and as someone touched on before. We could be at negative real interest rates to own a home, so it's a very powerful economic decision to go ahead and buy a house today and lock in that interest rate relative to current inflation expectations. So still feel very good about the demand we're seeing into 2022. Hard to predict much beyond that because you just don't know, but we do like what we see in 2022 for sure."

            "content": "Our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 5% to 21,522 homes, while the value increased 29% from the prior year to $8.3 billion. A year ago, our first quarter net sales orders were up 56% due to the surge in housing demand during the first year of the pandemic when we had significantly more completed homes available to sale and prior to the significant supply chain challenges we've experienced since. Our average number of active selling communities decreased 3% from the prior year quarter and was up 3% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the first quarter was $383,600, up 22% from the prior year quarter. The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 15%, down from 18% in the prior year quarter. New home demand remains very strong despite the recent rise in mortgage rates. Our local teams are continuing to sell homes later in the construction cycle so we can better ensure the certainty of the home close date for our homebuyers with virtually no sales occurring prior to start of home construction. We plan to continue managing our sales pace in the same manner during the spring, and we expect our number of net sales orders in our second quarter to be equal to the same quarter in the prior year were up by no more than a low-single digit percentage. Our January home sales and net sales order volume were in line with our plans, and we are well-positioned to deliver double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2022 with 29,300 homes in backlog, 54,800 homes in inventory, a robust lot supply and strong trade and supplier relationships. Bill? We have increased our housing inventory in response to the strength of demand and are focused on expanding our production capabilities further. We started 25,500 homes during the quarter, up 12% from the first quarter last year, bringing our trailing 12-month starts to 94,200 homes. We ended the quarter with 54,800 homes in inventory, up 30% from a year ago. 25,600 of our total homes at December 31 were unsold, of which only 1,000 were completed. Our average cycle or average construction cycle time for homes closed in the first quarter has increased by almost two weeks since our fourth quarter and two months from a year ago. Although, we have not seen much improvement in the supply chain yet, we are focused on working to stabilize and then reduce our construction cycle times to historical norms. Mike? Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot manufacturer, operates in 55 markets across 23 states. Forestar continues to execute extremely well and now expects to grow its lot deliveries this year to a range of 19,500 to 20,000 lots with a pretax profit margin of 13.5% to 14%. At December 31, Forestar's owned and controlled lot position increased 33% from a year ago to 103,300 lots. 58% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer based on executed purchase and sale agreements. $330,000 million of our finished lots purchased in the first quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had approximately $500 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt to capital ratio of 33.9%. With its current capitalization, strong lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton, Forestar plans to continue profitably growing their business. Bill? And as we're looking at the remainder of the year, the guidance we're providing for Q2 is based on where the homes are in construction today. But yes, as we look at the full year based on when we started the homes, and we look at where our guidance is for the full year, we are a bit more back-end loaded in terms of our closings in Q3 and Q4 than historically. We are part of that is because of the elongated construction times that we have not seen improved yet, and it's based on where our homes in construction currently set in terms of the construction cycle. Well, I'll start, Steve. I guess, first, we're still growing this business and learning this business. Still a little bit early for us to be able to generalize on averages in terms of what level of revenue we might see per unit. We're building across our entire homebuilding footprint. So every property is unique in terms of size and the product and the market in which it's in. So we're individually underwriting each one relative to whether it's better for-rent community versus a for-sale community. Obviously, we've been very pleased with the value that we've been able to generate thus far and very excited about the opportunity of growing this business and adding value over time and been very pleased with the demand that there has been for our communities thus far and the execution that we've seen in terms of our sales thus far. Yes. I think that that's in line with our plans and what we have set forth across all of our divisions and communities. We target an absorption pace per community plan well ahead to make sure that we have those permits in hand and lots in front of us. It's not easier today to put lots on the ground any more than it is easier to build a home, but we have incredible operators in the field who stay ahead of this and it's allowed us to continually sequentially quarter-over-quarter increase our start pace and that's a cadence that we hope to continue. The real key to our ability to do that is our lot position, having that long lot position controlled and strong supplier relationships on will and the developer side puts our operators and positions to continue to start and increase our start base."

            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding first quarter, highlighted by a 48% increase in earnings to $3.17 per diluted share. Our consolidated pretax income increased 45% to $1.5 billion. On a 19% increase in revenues and our consolidated pretax profit margin improved 380 basis points to 21.2%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31 was 38.5%, and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 32.4%. These results reflect our experienced teams, their production capabilities and our ability to leverage D.R. Horton's scale across our broad geographic footprint. Even with the recent rise in mortgage rates, housing market conditions remain very robust, and we are focused on maximizing returns while continuing to increase our market share. There are still significant challenges in the supply chain, including shortages in certain building materials and a very tight labor market. We are focused on building the infrastructure and processes to support a higher level of home starts while working to stabilize and then reduce construction cycle times to our historical norms. After starting construction on 25,500 homes this quarter, our homes and inventory increased 30% from a year ago to 54,800 homes with only 1,000 unsold completed homes across the nation. Our January home starts and net sales holders were in line with our targets, and we are well-positioned to achieve double-digit volume growth in 2022. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations, while managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales base and inventory levels to optimize returns. Mike? In closing, our results reflect our experienced teams and production capabilities, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to capitalize on today's robust market and to effectively operate in changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividend and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. We are incredibly well positioned to continue growing and improving our operations in 2022. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. And John, we talked a little bit about this. Internally, we talk a lot about it. The industry is changing. It's just a much more disciplined industry than it was through the last cycle. As we gained in market share as the other public gain in market share. There's just less \u2013 at least in my mind, my expectation is, there'll be less volatility at the cycle up and down. It's just the real businesses today, not speculators. Yes. I just \u2013 Alan, as we continue to increase our starts for demand, I would say at some point, there's going to be more of an equilibrium. And at that point, margins and ASPs should mitigate some \u2013 we don't know. Again, we're return-based absorption targets, start targets, being able to sustain a level of starts drives efficiencies through the entire process. We don't know what the future is. We do know that we can operate within that future and maximize the results, both returns and market share gains. Alan, we're always focused on affordability. And we talk entirely about a sustainable run rate in these communities and that involves not overpricing at any point in time. So \u2013 but yes, we're looking at product. We're looking at communities, land, how do we drive more and more efficiency into the process so that we can maintain a more affordable living cost. And then that's \u2013 to me, that's market scale as consistency and starts. It's \u2013 as we continue to drive market share gains, consolidate labor, we're in a better position to acquire land and it's just an ongoing continuous effort to get a little bit better every day. All price points. Carl, I think a lot of the things at Horton is just because we just work harder than other. Everybody works hard, but our people are just phenomenal problem solvers, and it's a part of the culture, the decentralized nature. I mean they take ownership and they saw problems. What we have tried to do is guide the divisions to understand the capacity within communities and consistently start homes to meet that capacity and when they do that, the capacity increases because the people in those communities get a little better at building those houses. And we're seeing that in \u2013 I don't know what the industry average is, but I got to believe we are completing homes even though it is not to our historical norm steel more rapidly than our peers out there. But it's a consistent starts, limited product, limited options, making it easier for these traits to get in and get out, reducing the SKUs that we're asking our suppliers to hold and, in some cases, ordering early. In some cases \u2013 I mean anything, everything that we can do to eliminate or break a bottleneck and the people in the field are doing. And I can tell you 100 stories, but I'm not going to. Good morning. I don't see any change in the incentives coming. It's \u2013 I'm sure at some point, the inventory will catch up with demand. It is still significantly out of balance, especially if you're looking at the areas where the Florida, the Texas, the Arizonas, even across the Midwest where you have job growth and influx of people. It's \u2013 you never say never, but the difficulty of getting lots on the ground and then getting houses built is \u2013 it's going to be very difficult to catch up with demand anytime in the next couple of years. It goes back to market scale and even within submarkets being able to control a labor base and keeping them busy, keeping them in the same location. I just can't over \u2013 I can't oversell that advantage where you've got a program where we're releasing 15, 20, 30 houses every month, month after month after month after month. The aggregation of labor in those kinds of communities is \u2013 it's very advantageous in today's world. And it also gives you the ability to kind of direct some of that labor through the two or three or four or five a month absorption communities. So it's market scale. It's \u2013 again, everything that we've done, simplifying the product, trying to maintain affordability and then having well-located communities with long running times, so. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. Yes. Mike, I've always \u2013 we've always believed that the rental platform when we get it built out will derisk our land portfolio because it does give us another lever. But from a just a philosophical standpoint, we believe in the fore sale business. We believe home ownership in the country is very important. Today, our goal is to deliver more homes because the demand is there, and it's hard to believe, five years from now, homes are going to be more affordable than they are today. So every family we can get in the home, we feel like we \u2013 is a win for us and for that family. When we look at the risk in the rental platform, the ability to scale that up, the segment that's going to create \u2013 it's going to be a real business all on its own. And because of the geographic platform and the embedded divisions within that geography, our ability to scale that and touch every market is \u2013 we see as just great opportunity for our shareholders and for our people internally. You bet. Hey, Ken. We have start targets and we talk about consistent sustainable starts driving ultimately sales and closings, and it's based on the capacity within divisions to deliver those homes. It's a great time. Housing is more affordable today than it certainly was in the 1980s. The ability to get into a house, lock down your homeownership or your housing cost for the next 20 years is a significant driving force in what's going on because as overall cost inflation, interest rates, as those continue to move up, the people that have bought a house today, even if it's at a price that's 15%, 20% higher than it was last year, are \u2013 I mean it's just a great thing. So the other thing, Ken, that we really don't talk much about, but it's \u2013 when I was 20, I mean that was just \u2013 that was what was expected. You figured out a way to buy a house and that became less cool for use of a stupid term, as the millennials came into their 20s. But what I'm seeing and what my millennial daughter is telling me is, now it's \u2013 that's a big part of the narrative on social media is, it's \u2013 people want to own homes again. And it's just \u2013 I think I'm amazed sometimes at some of the conversations around housing and I look at what it was and look at what it is. I look at the \u2013 just the demographic demand that's out there, I look at the wealth effect of everything that's happened over the last 10 years and the American public is. They're in a good place, and from an affordability standpoint, home ownership is better than it was in the 1980s. So I'm very optimistic about what's going on. I'm very optimistic about this company, and I'm just in all of our people and how \u2013 what they are accomplishing out there, so. I don't know if I answer your question, but I thought you got it I think. We actually were talking about this and getting ready for the call. The private builders and even some of the smaller public builders are going to have very difficult time delivering houses. I mean we're having \u2013 it is hard for us. I mean it's probably harder to complete and finish a house today as it's been in my career in homebuilding. And as these private guys who don't have our scale, who don't have our ability to driver result, their houses are setting and that's going to cut off their access to the next house they start. Anecdotally, we are talking to the builders end markets, they're just tired. They don't \u2013 they've got six, seven, eight banks. They're sideways with two of them, and they're looking to us to take out their log supply and they maybe become a developer for us in that market. So it's \u2013 if the supply chains don't loosen up, I think you're going to see the consolidation accelerate in the market by the big box because what is the big constraint on the market on housing is the ability to get lots in front of you. And the private guys, they don't have that ability that publics do and that's \u2013 so when you look at new home sales decline, that doesn't have anything to do with demand, that has to be built \u2013 60% of the homes being built out, they're being built by non-public. And I think all of this cycle, you're going to see that group's ability to start houses continue to deteriorate and that is going to get picked up by the public. Even if the overall housing market \u2013 new home housing market declines, I think the top 10 [indiscernible] are going to pick up market share and they're going to continue to grow. So that's what happening. Yes. There is a big population base there now. You've got some of the best universities in the country that are there. You're seeing a migration out of what we've historically been the tech areas and/or the think tank areas, financial areas into these incubators, which are these major universities. I'm just \u2013 I'm a big believer that long-term, the quality of life, just the access to really smart people is going to drive companies and grow companies into these markets. You see it in Austin. You see it in Nashville, Columbus. It's just across Indianapolis. There are brilliant people starting what are going to be great big companies that that find that that environment just a better place to be than some of the what has historically been high tech, high income markets. And the population of the U.S., it \u2013 those towns, those cities are great cities, and they offer a lot and that's what... Thank you. Thank you, Holly. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speak with you in our second quarter results in April and our the D.R. Horton family, outstanding first quarter. It's amazing what's the \u2013 our people are accomplishing it there, and Don Horton and the entire executive team are humbled with the opportunity to represent you. Thank you."

            "content": "Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the first quarter was 27.4%, up 50 basis points sequentially from the September quarter. The increase in our gross margin from September to December reflects the broad strength of the housing market. The strong demand for homes combined with a limited supply has allowed us to continue to raise prices and maintain a very low level of sales incentives in most of our communities. On a per square foot basis, our home sales revenues were up 3.4% sequentially while our cost of sales per square foot increased 2.9%. We expect our construction and lot costs will continue to increase. However, with the strength of today's market conditions, we expect to offset most cost pressures with price increases in the near-term. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be similar to or slightly better than the first quarter. Jessica? Financial services pretax income in the first quarter was $67.1 million with a pretax profit margin of 36.4% compared to $84.1 million and 44.9% in the prior year quarter. For the quarter, 98% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 66% of our home buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 44% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 721 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 55% of the closings handled by the mortgage company this quarter. Mike? Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. During the three months ended December, our cash used in homebuilding operations was $115 million as we invested significant operating capital to increase our homes and inventory to meet the current strong demand. At December 31, we had $4.1 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of $2.1 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. We believe this level of homebuilding cash and liquidity is appropriate to support the scale and activity of our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 17.3% at the end of December and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 6.9%. Our consolidated leverage at December 31 was 25.1%, and consolidated leverage net of cash was 15.2%. At December 31, our stockholders' equity was $15.7 billion and book value per share was $44.25, up 29% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended December, our return on equity was 32.4% compared to 24.4% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $80.1 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in February. We repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock for $278.2 million during the quarter. Our remaining share repurchase authorization at December 31 was $268 million. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year. Jessica? Yes. Stephen, we see such strong demand today for this product in this low interest rate environment. And I think to your question of if we see rates tick up, do we see that shift? We like the ability to be in the market with this rental platform and be able to adjust to those shifts and market conditions. We do believe that we're going to continue to see strong demand. Maybe not as strong as it is today with such a new category, but we feel good about our position and the number of communities we're planning. Sure. Thanks, Mike. In the current environment where we're seeing such significant average selling price increases. That's certainly one driver of the SG&A leverage on the P&L. A little difficult to predict exactly where the average ASP might fall in a particular quarter. The trend over time has been upward over the last several quarters, though, and that's certainly a contributor to it. So I would say, we're probably a little bit conservative in projecting out the level of increases in our ASPs. We are very actively building infrastructure to support the significant increase in scale that we have seen across our business over the last year and that we're projecting for the rest of the coming year, and so we are anticipating significant increases in our SG&A spend to support that. And so we're just basically balancing that versus our expectations for our closings. And with our closings expectations essentially roughly flat with last year in Q2 based on our guidance, we're not getting the volume leverage, but we are still seeing the leverage from selling price increases. Okay. Well, first to wrap up the SG&A question. We're not guiding specifically to the full year on SG&A. However, with the kind of heavier volume expected in our annual guidance in Q3 and Q4, we would expect to see more leverage on SG&A probably than 10 basis points in Q3 and Q4 versus Q2. With respect to the rental expectations, we've guided annually to more than $700 million of revenue. We've been very pleased with the margins and the execution we've seen on the sales recently. The margin this quarter, obviously, was very strong. Some projects will continue to generate those margins, others could certainly be short of that. We haven't specifically guided to the margin on that business as of yet because each project is unique. In terms of volume in the coming quarter, we would expect Q2 volume to be relatively similar to Q1, and which we closed two single-family properties and one multifamily property. And then for the year, basically lining that out to the $700 million of revenue. Yes. D, all of the above. It will be... I don't know that we'd see a big change in our long-term split. We are continually evaluating new markets. And at the same time, the mandate is to the teams in the field, aggregate your market share. We feel that local scale drives a lot of value in the business for us and the lot supply is a key part of it. I will tell you the frustration, it takes longer \u2013 just like it has to build a house, it takes longer to get a neighborhood approved. It takes longer to get lots built today than it did a year or two years ago. And so we're continuing to challenge that. So just like our housing supply has increased relative to our current delivery levels, our lot \u2013 controlled lot position has increased to support those lots coming on just taking longer to get into the finish line. Thank you. Well, I think as you look at those stress tests that we do, and we've run it again and seeing a slight uptick in it, but still nominal and the interest rate increase we've seen today have spurred further demand much more so than knock people out of qualification and ability to qualify. Yes, Eric, it really is just an extrapolation of where we see prices now. We've got a few more months of visibility into our selling prices and where our closing prices moved up to in Q1 and what our visibility is going into Q2 that we feel like the sales prices that are baked in and that we have visibility to that justified increasing, a pretty nice increase in our annual revenue guide. But obviously, with the continued challenges on the supply chain, construction cycle times elongating, we didn't really feel like we had any more room on the volume side as of yet. So it's really solely priced, and we feel good about that guidance for the year."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call for D.R. Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions].  I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Senior Vice President of Communications for D.R. Horton.\nJessica Hansen: Thank you, Tom. And good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 financial results.  Before we get started, today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Form 10-Q, all of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-K late next week. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the presentations section under News & Events for your reference. Now I will turn the call over to David Auld, our Executive Vice Chair.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Jessica. And good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Paul Romanowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  When we talk about our results, I'd like to congratulate Paul on his well-deserved promotion to CEO that was effective October 1. We have been preparing for this transition internally for quite some time. We are positioning our leadership throughout the company for the future, and I will still be actively involved as executive vice chair of board of directors. Our executive team remains in place with the same individuals and Paul has the support of our executive, region, and division leadership. He is a proven leader who has been successful throughout his group.  Now on to our results. The D.R. Horton team finished the year with solid fourth quarter results, highlighted by earnings of $4.45 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income was $2 billion on a 9% increase in revenues to $10.5 billion, with a pre-tax profit margin of 19.2%. For the year, earnings per diluted share was $13.82 and our consolidated pre-tax income was $6.3 billion on a 6% increase in revenues to $35.5 million, with a pre-tax profit margin of 17.8%. We closed a record 91,204 homes and apartments this year in our homebuilding and rental operations. Our cash flow from operations for 2023 was $4.3 billion. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the year was 29.7% and our return on equity was 22.7%. Despite continued high mortgage rates and inflationary pressures, our net sales orders increased 39% from the prior-year quarter. As a result, both new and existing homes at affordable price points is limited and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable.  We are focused on consolidating market share by supplying more homes at affordable price points to meet homebuyer demand, while maximizing the returns and capital efficiency in each of our communities.  With improvements in both labor capacity and availability of materials, our cycle times are decreasing, positioning us to improve our housing inventory turns. We are well-positioned with our experienced operators, affordable product offerings, flexible lot supply, and strong capital and liquidity positions to generate strong cash flows and produce consistent returns.  We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, including returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: Earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 5% to $4.45 per diluted share compared to $4.67 per share in the prior-year quarter. Earnings for the year decreased 16% to $13.82 per diluted share compared to $16.51 in fiscal 2022.  Net income for the quarter decreased 7% to $1.5 billion on consolidated revenues of $10.5 billion. And for the year, net income decreased 19% to $4.7 billion on revenues of $35.5 billion. Our fourth quarter home sales revenues were $8.8 billion on 22,928 homes closed compared to $9.4 billion on 23,212 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $382,900, up 1% sequentially and down 5% from the prior-year quarter. Mike?\nMichael Murray: Our net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 39% to 18,939 homes and order value increased 34% from the prior year to $7.3 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 21%, up from 18% sequentially and down from 32% in the prior-year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 2% sequentially and up 10% from the prior year. The average price of net sales orders in the fourth quarter was $383,100, up 1% sequentially and down 4% from the prior-year quarter. To adjust to changing market conditions and higher mortgage rates, we have increased our use of incentives and are reducing the size of our homes where possible to provide better affordability for our homebuyers. We expect to continue utilizing a higher level of incentives in fiscal 2024, particularly rate buydowns in the current interest rate environment.  Our sales volumes can be significantly affected by changes in mortgage rates and other economic factors. However, we will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the fourth quarter was 25.1%, up 180 basis points sequentially from the June quarter. The increase in our gross margin from June to September reflects the slight increase in our average sales price and lower stick and brick costs on homes closed during the quarter.  On a per square-foot basis, home sales revenues were up 2.5% sequentially, while stick and brick cost per square foot decreased 2.5% and lot costs increased 6%. As Mike mentioned, we expect to continue offering a higher level of incentives in fiscal 2024 to help address affordability. Due to recent increases in volatility in mortgage rates, our incentive costs have increased on recent sales, and we expect our homebuilding gross margins to be lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: In the fourth quarter, our homebuilding SG&A expenses increased by 2% from last year and homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 6.6%, down 10 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. For the year, homebuilding SG&A was 7.1% of revenues, up 30 basis points from fiscal 2022. We will continue to control our SG&A while ensuring that our platform adequately supports our business. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: We started 21,100 homes in the September quarter, down 8% from the June quarter. We ended the year with 42,000 homes in inventory, down 9% from a year ago and down 4% sequentially. 27,000 of our total homes at September 30th were unsold, of which 7,000 were completed.  For homes we closed in the fourth quarter, our construction cycle time decreased by a month from the third quarter, reflecting improvements in the supply chain. We will continue to manage our homes and inventory and starts pace based on market conditions, and we expect further improvements in our cycle times and housing inventory turns in fiscal 2024. Mike?\nMichael Murray: Our homebuilding lot position at September 30th consisted of approximately 568,000 lots, of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. 35% of our total owned lots are finished and 54% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our fourth quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land, and development totaled $2.3 billion, up 7% sequentially. Our current quarter investments consisted of $1.5 billion for finished lots, $580 million for land development and $290 million for land acquisition. For the year, our homebuilding investments in lots, land, and development totaled $8 billion, up 6% from fiscal 2022. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: In the fourth quarter, our rental operations generated $217 million of pre-tax income on $1.4 billion of revenues from the sale of 3,006 single-family rental homes and 1,582 multifamily rental units.  For the full year, our rental operations generated $524 million of pre-tax income on $2.6 billion of revenues from the sale of 6,175 single-family rental homes and 2,112 multifamily rental units.  Our rental property inventory at September 30th was $2.7 billion, which consisted of $1.3 billion of single-family rental properties and $1.4 billion of multifamily rental properties. Our rental operations generated significant increases in both revenues and profits this year as our platform is maturing and expanding across more markets. Due to the rise in interest rates and volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets, we are not providing separate guidance for our rental closings in fiscal 2024. Based on the current pipeline of rental projects, we do expect to have more multifamily unit closings in fiscal 2024 than in fiscal 2023. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company, reported revenues of $550 million for the fourth quarter on 4,986 lots sold with pre-tax income of $95 million. For the full year, Forestar delivered 14,040 lines, generating $1.4 billion of revenues and $222 million of pre-tax income with a pre-tax profit margin of 15.4%.  Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at September 30th was 79,200 lots. 60% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $410 million of our finished lots purchased in the fourth quarter were from Forestar.  Forestar had approximately $1 billion of liquidity at year-end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 5.5%. Forestar is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots in the homebuilding industry and to consolidate significant market share over the next few years, with its strong balance sheet, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton.  Mike?\nMichael Murray : Financial Services earned $85 million of pre-tax income in the fourth quarter on $220 million of revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 38.9%. For the year, financial services earned $283 million of pre-tax income on $802 million of revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 35.3%.  During the fourth quarter, virtually all of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 76% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 51% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 725 at an average loan-to-value ratio of 87%. First-time home buyers represented 55% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter.  Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our balanced capital approach is disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic to support our operating platform and produce consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity, which provides us with flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions.  During fiscal 2023, our consolidated cash provided by operations was $4.3 billion, and our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $3.1 billion. Over the past five years, our homebuilding operations have generated $9.6 billion of cash flow. At September 30th, we had $7.5 billion of consolidated liquidity, consisting of $3.9 billion of cash and $3.6 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities. We repaid $400 million of senior notes this quarter, and our debt at September 30th totaled $5.1 billion with no senior note maturities in fiscal 2024.  Our consolidated leverage at September 30th was 18.3% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 5.1%. At September 30th, our stockholders' equity was $22.7 billion and book value per share was $67.78, up 20% from a year ago. For the year, our return on equity was 22.7%.  During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $84 million for a total of $341 million of dividends paid during the year. We repurchased 3.5 million shares of common stock for $423 million during the quarter. And for the year, we repurchased 11.1 million shares for $1.2 billion, which reduced our outstanding share count by 3% from the prior year-end. In October, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our common stock, replacing our previous authorization. Based on our strong financial position and cash flow, our board also increased our quarterly cash dividend by 20% to $0.30 per share. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: As we look forward to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect challenging market conditions to persist with continued uncertainty regarding mortgage rates, the capital markets and general economic conditions that may significantly impact our business.  In our December quarter, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 18,500 to 19,000 homes.  We expect our home sales gross margin in the first quarter to be approximately 23.7% to 24.2% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter to be around 7.7% to 7.9%.  We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin of between 20% and 25%, and we expect our income tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 24.5% in the first quarter. We are well positioned to continue consolidating market share in both our home building and rental operations. Our fiscal 2024 home closings volume, pricing, and margins in our homebuilding, rental, financial services, and Forestar businesses will be determined by market conditions and our efforts to meet the market by balancing pace and price to maximize returns.  For the full year of fiscal 2024, we expect to generate consolidated revenues of approximately $36 billion to $37 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 86,000 to 89,000 homes.  We forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2024 in the range of 24% to 24.5%. We expect to generate approximately $3 billion of cash flow from our homebuilding operations. We also plan to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of our common stock to continue reducing our outstanding share count in addition to dividend payments of around $400 million.  We will continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, our rental operations, maintaining conservative leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend, and consistently repurchasing shares.  David?\nDavid Auld : In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, and broad geographic footprint across 118 markets. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and loan leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to meet changing market conditions and continue aggregating market share.  We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, while consistently returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.  Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and our work. Due to your efforts, we just completed our 22nd consecutive year as the largest and strongest builder in the United States, and we look forward to working together to improve our operations and provide homeownership opportunities to more American families during 2024.  With my transition to executive vice chair, this will be my last public earnings call. It has been an honor and a privilege to represent and report on the D.R. Horton team's remarkable efforts for the past 10 years.  Thank you all again. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question this morning is coming from John Lovallo from UBS.\nJohn Lovallo: First question is just on the gross margin in the quarter of 25.1%. That was well above your expectations, above, I believe, 23.5% to 24%. Despite what seems like a greater use of incentives and perhaps even a higher cost of incentives, can you just help us kind of work through some of the puts and takes on gross margin in the quarter versus your expectations?\nBill Wheat: The second half of the fiscal year, we had a little more relative stability in the rate environment, and so we were able to level off our incentives really in Q3 and Q4. We also then had a little bit of price traction that allowed our average sales price to tick up just a tad in the fourth quarter. And then really, one of the biggest benefits was we did see continued improvement in lumber costs. And so, our overall stick and brick costs on our homes came down in the quarter. We do think we basically realized the majority of that lumber cost benefit in the near term and within the more recent rise in interest rates and the use of incentives. That's why we're guiding down for Q1, but we had some benefits that supported the increase in gross margin in Q4.\nJohn Lovallo: Maybe sticking with gross margin. As we look forward into the first quarter, the 23.7% to 24.2%, if we think about the sequential decline that's implied in there, it sounds like there's going to be higher incentives and, again, maybe a little bit of higher costs. You mentioned that the lumber benefit might be through. What are the other sort of puts and takes that we should consider in that sequential margin?\nMichael Murray: I think you summed it up pretty well, John. I think we see higher incentives coming forward with the rapid rise in interest rates through the last six weeks or so. A little bit of moderation last week, which was helpful, but one week doesn't make a trend, I don't think. And we do sell a significant number of the homes we closed in the quarter during that quarter. I think for the fourth quarter, 39% of our closings were sold in the quarter. So we're at a pretty real-time indication of margins in the business as it comes through.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore. \nStephen Kim: Congratulations on the good results. You gave an interesting \u2013 well, you gave a guide for $3 billion in homebuilding cash flow for next year. I wanted to get a sense from you, how much of that do you think is going to be benefited by a reduction in work in process inventory?\nBill Wheat: We are able with our improved cycle times. We are seeing improved inventory turns and our assumption next year is that we will see some further improvement in cycle times and inventory turns. So we are able to operate with a relatively lower level of homebuilding inventory. However, we're also guiding to a volume increase. And so, I don't necessarily expect an absolute decrease in our homes and inventory, but we do expect to be turning it faster. So that's definitely a contributing factor to the cash flow.\nStephen Kim: But not an actual reduction in the WIP levels, okay. That's helpful. So that means that it's really coming from the income and, I guess, maybe a reduction in land assets? Would that be fair?\nBill Wheat: Or it's just an improvement in our turns of our land assets. So, yes, primarily from profits that's resulting from the improved turns.\nStephen Kim: Second question is related to rate buydowns. Could you give us a sense for what the average rate actually used in the quarter, in your September quarter, was for your customers. And if we were to look at sort of what your average is for, let's say, orders being taken today, what would that average rate be?\nPaul Romanowski: The average rate can move quite a bit through the quarter, but we tend to stay about 1 to 1.25 points below market at any given time. And today, we're offering on an FHA government loans, roughly in the 5.99% rate and, on a conventional 6.25%, which is right in that range of 1.25, 1.5 below today.\nStephen Kim: And is that what most people are actually using?\nPaul Romanowski: About 60% of our total closings are used with some form of a rate buy-down. And so, a big percentage of \u2013 and the most successful incentive we have seen has been to impact that monthly cost of homeownership through some form of rate buy down.\nStephen Kim: Sorry, just to clarify, you're saying that 60% of your closings in some form of buy down, do you know what the average rate cutting across all of the kinds of buy-downs that people are using, what that actual rate was underpinning the mortgages?\nPaul Romanowski: I'm going to say probably in the 6-ish range.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Joe Ahlersmeyer from Deutsche Bank.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Congrats on executing so well this year. I appreciate also the effort to give the visibility for the full year here. I just wanted to talk maybe about those inventory turns a little bit further. Your guidance for closing suggests something above 2 times on your current homes and inventory level. I know that's an important threshold for you guys. Just wondering maybe then what the starts look like over the next couple of quarters to make sure that you deliver on that closing guidance in the back half, but also sort of gear up for growth again in 2025, while maintaining that 2x target, how the starts could look?\nJessica Hansen: Our starts should tick down a little bit sequentially, but our base case, subject to market conditions, as everything and the strength of the spring, is that we would expect to increase our search gradually, quarter to quarter as we move throughout the year, to position ourselves to deliver on the guidance that we've talked about and then obviously to also exit 2024 position to grow into 2025. So we're working market by market, community by community to improve our production capabilities. And what we want to do is make sure that as we're increasing our starts that it's sustainable. So that's why you're just going to see it gradually happen throughout the year.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Thinking about your return on inventory on a trailing basis, it has been normalizing, of course. But where do you think that can settle out if you've got headwinds maybe on the profitability side from land and incentives, the tailwinds from that production efficiency. Could we actually sort of settle out here in the high 20s? Is that realistic?\nBill Wheat: Well, the way we're running our business, the way we underwrite our land deals, that's our focus, with our focus on purchasing finished lots and as many deals as we can. Yes, our goal would be to keep that return on inventory in the homebuilding business as high as we can. And so, definitely, mid- to high 20s is a good level for us. It does fluctuate with where gross margins are. So we've been coming down off of some of the peak gross margins we saw last year, but definitely mid to high 20s is a level that we're striving to achieve.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG.\nCarl Reichardt: Joe stole one of my questions. But looking at the guide for next year, are you anticipating much alteration in mix in terms of geography or price points? And I'm particularly interested in some of the smaller markets where you all are really the only large builder, a couple of the acquisitions you've done. What percentage of deliveries next year do you think might come from markets like that, however you want to define it?\nMichael Murray: Don't probably have a good breakdown of deliveries by market, stratified by market size or recent entrants, but we do expect to see probably a rotation to smaller home footprints and introduction of smaller plans where we can get municipality approvals. Again, just to maintain the affordability, I think we will see that we're going to continue to roll with starts, but the compressed cycle times that we've gotten out of our construction process is going to allow us to deliver a lot more homes on fewer homes carried in inventory at any given quarter end date.\nJessica Hansen: Carl, this doesn't perfectly answer your question, but I do want to let people know that in our investor presentation we're going to post, as we usually do, post the call, we've updated our market share dominant slide pretty dramatically to make sure it aligns with all of the markets we operate in. We did a lot of work with Zonda and our internal data. And so, now instead of just reporting on the top 50 US housing markets and where we rank in those, we're talking about all 118. And so, it will give you some more insight into where we are in terms of whether we're number 1, top 5, top 10. Out of the 118 markets we're in today, only 7 we're not top 10 in and we went through those last night and they are all markets that we essentially have just entered within the last year or two. So we would expect to be top 10 very quickly and then move up into the top 5 and certainly continue to work on becoming number 1.  So it doesn't answer geographic mix, but I did want to kind of plug the fact that we gave incremental data on market share that we hadn't historically put out there.\nCarl Reichardt: Just as a follow-up, I know you're not guiding on the rental business in 2024, it's becoming a bigger portion of PTI and obviously taking up some balance sheet. From an institutional investor perspective on both multifamily and single family, how has that appetite fared for the projects you're selling at stabilized occupancy? Obviously, spreads have come in there, but there's also a lot of capital, I would guess, chasing both asset classes. So I'm just sort of curious what you're seeing from those customers.\nPaul Romanowski: We are still seeing strong interest, Carl, from the institutional investors that are out there. As you mentioned, the spreads have come in. And we're going to see some volatility in gross margin as we move through this process and move through the markets of higher rates, but still seeing consistent activity. I still feel we are in a great position to be the dominant supplier of single-family rental and continuing to grow our multifamily platform.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mike Rehaut from J.P. Morgan. \nMike Rehaut: I wanted to focus for a moment on the fiscal 2024 closings growth guidance of up 4% to 7%. It seems like that's a little bit below maybe what you typically shoot for in kind of like a high single-digit range, if I'm not mistaken. And I'm just curious if that's a function of maybe the current backdrop with the recent move in rates. Also, obviously, your backlog is still down over 20% year-over-year. Just kind of wondering if there's a little bit of a timing gap here given the backlog, maybe given the current environment, that high single-digit rate is something we should think about you guys maybe returning to in 2025, all else equal?\nJessica Hansen: Great question, Mike. We expected it. We do talk about always positioning ourselves for growth, and you typically hear us talk about plus or minus 10% is how we're going to position the company. If you look at how we're exiting 2023 though and our guide for fiscal 2024 closing, it does already assume our typical 2 times housing turn, actually a little bit better than that at the high end. So 2.04 times to 2.11 times would be our guide. And so, it's already incorporating our improvement in cycle times. And if we continue to be able to have success with that throughout the year, we'll consider that in what we talk about publicly in terms of what we're able to deliver for fiscal 2024. But as we sit here in November, that's a realistic expectation for closing with the visibility that we have today. It's not necessarily that we've seen a big falloff in demand. Obviously, our sales were up very strong. And so, it's more a function of the houses we have in inventory and our cycle times.\nMichael Murray: This is Mike. Just following on with that is that our lot position is very strong right now. We own 50,000 lots that are finished, and there's obviously more that are in the controlled portion of our portfolio, that \u2013 as we see the market unfold for the year, we will be able to accelerate starts to meet any increased demand.  Coming into 2023, we saw a rate spike at the end 2022 and we were a little concerned about the year and the outlook we gave last year at this time. And the team stepped up and delivered a great year in fiscal 2023 and against that backdrop. So positioning for conservatism in the year, but always are \u2013 have a desire to grow and to grow in that double-digit level.\nMike Rehaut: I guess also just wanted to circle back. You had mentioned with regard to sticks and bricks, 6% lot inflation. Is that something that has been accelerating, I guess, not just sticks and bricks, but maybe just more broadly, where is a lot as well as construction cost inflation for the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis? And how do you expect that to play out in 2024 based on current trends? And would that require some amount of price appreciation to offset, let's say, to maintain your fiscal \u2013 your first quarter gross margins?\nBill Wheat: Mike, sticks, and bricks, we've been \u2013 the last couple of quarters have been seeing the benefit of lower lumber costs. However, across most other cost categories, in the vertical construction costs, we are still seeing modest inflation. So on a year-over-year basis in the quarter, our stick and brick costs were down 3.5% on a per square foot basis. But our lot costs were up 11%. So we're seeing more inflation in our lot costs. And so, as we look forward into fiscal 2024, we would expect to continue to see inflation in our lot costs as land moves through and development cost inflation continues. And I think we would still expect to still see some modest inflation in some of the other stick and brick categories. There has been some recent moderation in lumber costs. As we move through 2024, we'd expect to see some benefit from. But overall, I think we still expect costs to show moderate inflation. As far as price appreciation with the current rate environment, the volatility and the recent rise in rates, we're not expecting any price appreciation. Our base case would probably expect a little bit of downward pressure on prices. And as we've already talked about, we are using higher incentives going into the first part of the year.  Now rate environment can change. Strength of the market can change as we go into the spring, and so we'll adjust depending on what we see in the market as we get further into the year.\nJessica Hansen: Carl asked about geographic mix, but that's a good point here in terms of just our reported average sales price. We are continuing to shift, as we said in our prepared remarks, to more and more of our smaller floor plans to address affordability issues in the market. So we could have some downward pressure on price that's solely just a function of product mix.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. \nMatthew Bouley: Just given all the, of course, interest rate volatility these past several weeks, I'm curious. Number one, given what you're doing with rate buy-downs, are you finding that sales pace is reacting quickly to these sort of numbing moves in interest rates? That's number one. And number two, I guess, just any color on your own sales pace into October and November, how you're kind of thinking about seasonality of orders here in the first quarter?\nPaul Romanowski: As you know, we don't report on sales \u2013 forecast on sales, but we are pleased with our sales thus far into October. And you certainly see fluctuations in traffic when we see the kind of moves that we've seen over the last couple of weeks, both up and down in rates. But with our ability to hold stable rates through our interest rate incentives, we've been able to convert pretty consistently with the buyers that we've had out there. But any time you have fluctuations in rates, we're going to see people pause for a period of time until they settle into the reality of what they can afford.\nJessica Hansen: We're also going into the seasonally slowest time of the year. So November and December typically are the slowest sales months as you get to the holidays. So, we're going to continue to focus ourselves on meeting the market, but not making any drastic adjustments to our business plan, and we're going to wait and see how the spring unfolds and make sure that we're continuing to start houses going into the spring.\nMatthew Bouley: Secondly, on the rental side, I know you're not guiding the top line in 2024. You did mention that multifamily units would be \u2013 I think you said, would be rising in 2024 year-over-year. Clearly, there is a lot of supply coming online, I think, in the multifamily world broadly. What can you say around the margin side and what you might be expecting on the margins of those multifamily unit sales next year?\nMichael Murray: I think we will see probably margins compress a bit on those multifamily sales just if interest rates have come up and cap rates tend to come up. The question of how much supply is out there is really specific to a given project in a given submarket that that project serves. And our team has done a great job of looking at those submarkets when we made the decision to move forward with the projects, cognizant of what was available in the marketplace, both ahead of us and behind us from a supply perspective. So we feel pretty good about being able to deliver into a healthy demand environment. We're still seeing good lease-ups in our rental properties, in line with expectations. So we're very encouraged by that.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman and Associates.\nAlan Ratner: First off, congrats to Paul and David, and good luck with the transition. Second, I think the topic that we get the most questions on are the sustainability of the rate buydowns that you guys are offering and the industry is offering right now. I guess my question to you, and I hear through \u2013 I listened through some of your comments on the puts and takes on margin and lot cost inflation starting to accelerate and maybe stick and brick costs also inflecting higher again after being a good guide this year. Is there a point where you look at your margin, which, obviously, it's very healthy today, but a point where it becomes harder to continue buying down that rate 100 basis points, 150 basis points, and what is that threshold for you?\nMichael Murray: We're going to operate the neighborhoods, but focused on return as usual, Alan, and it's going to be a pace and a price conversation continually. And the rates buy-downs, the incentives that we offer, it's just part of the mix of the cost environment that we deal with. And while we've seen some nice relief in the stick and brick cost, we have had some price pressure on other sides of it, but fuel prices have come down. That should give us a little bit of relief across a pretty broad spectrum of commodities as well as delivery costs. So it's a constant give-and-take on the cost and the margins. And our primary focus and guiding star is returns.\nJessica Hansen: And we're going into the year with a very strong start. We did say that our gross margins are expected to decline in Q1, but we're coming off a 25.1% in Q4, which is below the peaks that we achieved last year. But it's still a very healthy gross margin that gives us some room to meet the market and maximize returns and still post very healthy returns.\nAlan Ratner: Makes sense. Absolutely. The starting point is certainly very healthy, Jessica. So I appreciate that. Second question, would love to hear your thoughts on just credit availability in general. On one hand, I think there's certainly a nice tailwind to the public builders given your balance sheet and access to liquidity and capital and the ability to use that to take market share. On the other hand, your suppliers and your trades are certainly dependent on credit availability to fund their businesses, and headlines out of the Fed report yesterday, obviously, point to continued tightening there and your land developers probably are dependent on bank credit as well. So in your conversations with trades and suppliers and developers, are you starting to see any indications of stress throughout the channel as a result of credit tightening? And on the flip side, are you seeing any opportunities come from that?\nPaul Romanowski: I think anytime you see rates like they have been in the capital markets, a bit in flux, then we're going to see some headwinds from our developers, from less capitalized builders. And it will create some opportunities, but we feel like we've got a good plan and open communications with our vendors, our trades and our lot suppliers to continue to work through those processes.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. \nAnthony Pettinari: Congratulations on the transition to David and Paul. I'm wondering, understanding your entire offering is fairly affordable, I'm wondering if there's a specific buyer type you're seeing as kind of best positioned to weather higher for longer rates. Are your move-up buyers meaningfully outperforming first-time buyers? Are you seeing more buyers move down market to more affordable offerings? I'm just wondering what you're seeing there and if you're making any sort of strategic shifts to target a different mix of buyers.\nMichael Murray: I think our buyers are focused primarily on affordability. And for us, the way we deliver that affordability is through the monthly payment process. And that's obviously been a big driver for the rate buydowns, but also introducing smaller product footprints. De-amenitizing some of the homes a bit and letting people do things to improve their homes after the closing when their financial position perhaps has changed and they can afford a little more. But it's continuing to hit a price point relative to median income, so that we can find a place to work in that family's budget.\nJessica Hansen: And we still really like over half of our business being first-time homebuyers because despite what's happening with interest rates, those buyers need a place to live. They don't already own a home, so they're not a discretionary buyer. They're in the market looking at buy versus rent opportunities. So, if we can stay competitive with the rental market on that front, we're going to continue to capture first-time homebuyer market share.\nAnthony Pettinari: Just following up on something Mike said, I think this time last year, you elected not to give very detailed full-year outlook for 2023 with the volatile rate environment. I guess big picture, can you talk about what is giving you confidence to provide more detailed guidance now with mortgage rates near 8%? Is it just the experience of kind of managing through higher rates and the success of the buy-down? Or are you seeing something different with the consumer? Just wondering how you could contrast where we are now versus 12 months ago?\nMichael Murray: I think 12 months ago, we were facing two big issues. We were still trying to solve the production supply chain challenges and our cycle times were very elongated. So we had a hard time determining exactly what homes we're going to finish and deliver. And that was also a big interaction with the rate buy-down process because we can only buy rates down for certain forward amount of time in a cost-effective manner, and so being able to pinpoint when those homes would deliver into the buy-down environment.  You touched on the second point with the rates. Yes, we start facing some rate uncertainty and increases, but we have been able to manage through that over the past 12 months, and the team has delivered a really strong year.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Ken Zener from Seaport Research Partners.\nKen Zener: I'd like to take a step back just to bridge three CEOs, if we could here. So it was 10 years ago \u2013 David, congratulations \u2013 that you got on the call. At the time \u2013 and it's going to be about margins. Don talked about at the time 20-10-10, so 20% gross margin, 2 turns. David, as we all recall, when you came on shortly thereafter, Express, obviously, a great product. And you guys pulled gross margins down to \u2013 guidance in the 19%, 21% focusing on asset turns, consistent with Don's comments, and it's been great. Now, Paul, I certainly want to give you a chance to give your fingerprints on this. Could you comment on those prior \u2013 well, CEOs' comments, why it's different today and perhaps tie that into your to top rising comments on your exposure to non-top 50 markets. That's my first question.\nPaul Romanowski: Well, the team that's at the table is a team that was at the table last quarter last year and the prior several. We have a great position and are aligned as a company, not just from this group, but with our regional leadership and our division leadership. And we have continued to focus on returns community by community. And we have the benefit now of a wider footprint across the geographic area that we've expanded on, which is going to continue to provide strength for us and supply as we continue to expand in those markets. So the short version is we feel really good about where we are. I don't feel the need to put a stamped footprint or fingerprint on something unique and different because we have a strong team and a great operation in play, and a good playbook that we are executing on every day.\nDavid Auld: Ken, I was going to try to stay off this Q&A. Everything \u2013 you go back 45-year history, the goal of the company is to be the low-cost provider of affordable housing and create opportunities for first-time homebuyers to get in a home. And everything we've done through those years has been to position the company a little bit better and a little bit stronger. And the awakening of 2008, 2009 and 2010, I think, created a discipline in operations that made the transition from margin to return pretty much an industry standard today. You listen to other builder calls and everybody is talking about returns, cash flow, deleveraging and derisking their land pipeline. I don't see that changing. The industry has matured, the market share consolidation by the publics, the difficulty of putting lots on the ground, the difficulty of building houses, restrictions on capital, all of those things are forcing a discipline on the industry and allowing the \u2013 what I think the national builders to gain market share quarter after quarter after quarter after quarter. So our internal focus is going to continue to be project by project, driving improvements to efficiency, simplifying product, making it \u2013 even as overall individual component price increases, the availability of housing to the first-time homebuyer continues to be there. So that's our goal. That's all we think about every day.  And I think, earlier, somebody said something about sustainable. Everything we do, if it's not sustainable, we leave it in the trash pile and move on. So scalable, sustainable, consistent, and transparent. That's this team that's built alignment throughout our company, and I don't see that changing. Paul will do things differently than I do. He's taller than I am. That's a good thing. Coming down the ladder, I feel very good about the position we're in. Never been as well-positioned as a company.\nKen Zener: Yes. I can see Paul was taller. I was watching some of his YouTube videos. I guess not everybody is focused on returns as you. And I would say that you're \u2013 I'm sorry. So focused on returns, I'd like you to expand on your comments that \u2013 if you're taking down \u2013 54% of your options are finished, is that a fair basis for your mix of closings coming from finished lots? And are those geared more toward the non-top 50 markets, which is about a third of your closings?\nJessica Hansen: So to the first part of your question, we're over 60% of the houses that we're closing today were developed this past fiscal year on a lot developed by a third party. So the 54% is kind of a minimum that we would expect to take down finished because in a lot of cases, as you likely recall, industry practices for \u2013 we have hundreds of land professionals across the country that are very good at what they do. So they'll go out, source the land, negotiate it with the land seller, put it under contract and then we'll go find a third-party developer. So in a lot of cases, some of that stuff and the other 45% that we maybe today has not identified who's going to develop it. By the time we bring it on our balance sheet, it will be from a third party. And then in terms of the markets where we're buying more finished lots versus not, do you expect that to skew?\nPaul Romanowski: No, I don't expect that to skew. Ken, we continue to build our developer partnerships in all markets. And I would expect that, over time, you'll continue to see a rise, not a reduction in the number of lots we buy fully developed as we derisk our balance sheet and our lot pipeline.\nKen Zener: Thank you very much. Thank you, David.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Ken. I appreciate the support through the years.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs.\nSusan Maklari: My first question is around the community count growth. Any thoughts there on how we should be thinking about that for 2024? Is something in that mid to high single-digit range as you talked about in the past still a reasonable goal?\nJessica Hansen: On a year-over-year basis, Sue, yes. I think we would expect \u2013 as we look at fiscal 2024, we've driven a lot of increased absorption out of our communities for quite some time now. And so we're shifting to some of that growth now coming from just incremental community count and continuing to expand our footprint. So I think mid to high single is a good base case. We don't specifically guide the community count for a reason. It's pretty hard to predict just because there are so many moving pieces to communities coming on and offline, but I do think that's a reasonable base case assumption that we'll obviously update as we move throughout the year if necessary.\nSusan Maklari: You're guiding to buying back $1.5 billion of stock over the next year, which is up versus the $1 billion that you did in this past year. Can you just talk about what's driving that confidence? How you're thinking about the cash generation of the business as you go forward from here and what that could mean in terms of capital allocation priorities?\nBill Wheat: It's been the goal of ours to consistently repurchase shares over time and grow that over time. And so, this is just another step in that progression. And in the business, as we see I'd say, increased visibility and confidence in our ability to generate cash flow into fiscal 2024. That's given us a little more certainty around being able to guide a little more specifically to that growth than we have in the past.  As Mike said earlier, a year ago, we were concerned about our production capacity and how quickly we could actually deliver homes. We have more certainty around that today. And so, with that, that gives us more visibility around our cash flow. And so, repurchases, dividends, distributions to shareholders are an important part of our of our capital allocation. And so, as we're guiding to $3 billion of homebuilding cash flow with $1.5 billion of that going to share repurchase, another $400 million going to dividends, that's obviously a very important part of our capital allocation.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America.\nRafe Jadrosich: I wanted to just follow up on the comments on the lot cost outlook, up 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Is there something that's driving that higher near term? Or is that sort of the run rate we should be expecting as we go into fiscal 2024?\nBill Wheat: That is our current run rate. It has been inflecting a bit higher. It reflects several things. Obviously, land prices time over a number of years have increased incrementally. But we've also seen significant inflation in development costs and all that includes in that, whether it's the infrastructure costs themselves along with costs from government permits and regulations and requirements there as well as lengthening the time of development. The development time lines have lengthened dramatically, which then adds to, obviously, the costs associated with it. So there has been pretty strong inflation across really all of our markets on lots getting developed. And there's still a shortage of lots out there in the market for builders as well. And so, that is our current run rate. Whether that's going to accelerate further or whether we might see some moderation over time, I don't think we have visibility to that, but we do still expect to see probably stronger lot cost inflation than our other inflation in our stick and brick costs as we go in 2024.\nRafe Jadrosich: On the rental outlook, there are some signs that rents are coming down. And as you mentioned earlier, cost of capital is higher. How do you think about incremental investments in rental in this current rate environment? Is there a level of rates where you pull back? And if demand is weaker, like how do you handle what you've invested there? Like, would you sell at retail or just continue to rent them out? Just how could you handle that in different rate environments?\nPaul Romanowski: We are watching it closely, and we continue to be in the market with stabilized assets. And we just like \u2013 as we sell homes, we watch the market closely, look at what demand is and what that pricing is. We don't intend to continue to hang on to stuff and significantly increase our balance sheet. So while we're indicating that we may see some choppiness in margins as we flow through this market, but we still feel good about the demand that's out there, we feel good about our position and the platform and intend to continue to grow the platform and be positioned to do so, but we'll watch it closely in the coming quarters and adjust accordingly.\nMichael Murray: The strategic value of the platform for us to be a very good multifamily developer is significant as a land user. Being a residential developer, we've done that for a long time. And now going into the multifamily development side, we become a better buyer of land parcels and a better partner for land sellers. And so, strategically, it's a business we're going to stay in, going to continue to scale that business, but we will be opportunistic and responsive to market conditions with what we do.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW.\nJade Rahmani: Not sure if this was stated earlier, but could you get the percentage of your buyers that are taking some kind of mortgage buy down or interest rate incentive? And secondly, what percentage are taking the full-term buy down?\nPaul Romanowski: It's about 60% of our buyers are utilizing some type of rate buy-down and a fair chunk of those \u2013 I don't have specific numbers \u2013 almost all are permanent 30-year buy-down.\nJade Rahmani: On the rental business, could you talk to a rough ballpark of exit cap rates that \u2013 or acquisition cap rates that the purchases of your development assets are looking to achieve?\nMichael Murray: Sort of be across the board. It's going to vary significantly by market and what the interest rate environment was at the time we made the acquisition. So it's hard to pin it down to any one cap rate or even a relevant range. Because like with many expectations over the life of the project, from cost and rental side, there's a lot of actuals prove different than the assumptions we made that come out. And so, fortunately, we've been able to see some really strong execution by the teams and picking good projects and executing well on those projects, and that's showing up in the results. And we're just going to try to keep working in that direction. But it's hard for me to give you a number of what a ballpark cap rate was at the time we did a pro forma on a deal and when we decided to go forward with it.\nPaul Romanowski: And we have been very conservative in our underwriting and expectations for our single-family rental business and making sure that we feel good about it as a for-sale position as well as a for-rent, and underwriting it to the lowest of those guidelines for our operators, so that we aren't stretching on cap rates that are all driven potentially by interest environment.\nOperator: And our final question this morning is coming from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Dahl: Congrats, Paul. Congrats, David. I wanted to ask a follow-up about margin, and I appreciate you're not giving full guidance and you're thinking about returns, not margins, but some of the qualitative comments around expectations for maybe a little bit of downward pressure on price, obviously, some potential just mix, outright price pressure, then the added incentives, the lot costs, it sounds like you're bracing for further margin declines beyond 1Q. Is that fair? Or is there any order of magnitude that you can help us with on some of the other moving pieces that you're contemplating around margins beyond 1Q?\nJessica Hansen: I probably wouldn't use the word bracing for. We feel like we're in a very strong financial position to weather whatever we find in front of us, whether it's upside or downside. And we're going to do what we always do, which is continue to adjust to market conditions. We're not in a position to give a full-year guide. We likely may never do that again because margin really is a function of market conditions, and we're going to meet the market week in and week out. And we haven't seen the spring yet, which is the biggest driver of our full-year margin and where we land for the year in terms of gross margins, obviously. So as you alluded to, there are a lot of moving pieces and a lot of that's going to be dependent on what happens in the spring.  But if we do find ourselves in a market where we have more downward house price pressure, then we'll also be looking to adjust our cost structure at the same time. In a typical downward house price market, we do have the ability to adjust our cost structure, not in perfectly real time, but we're not going to sit there in a vacuum and just reduce home prices and not adjust the other components that go into our business.  So we feel very good. Like I said earlier, where we're starting from, a 25.1% exit rate in Q4 to weather whatever the year looks like and to continue to maximize returns.\nDavid Auld: Mike, I'm pretty optimistic. We've never been positioned to execute from a product location, lot supply and have gained efficiency through the last two or three years that I think we'll continue on. So I think 2024 is going to be a good year given a lack of some catastrophic event. So it's just \u2013 ultimately, in this business, it's about who can produce houses the most efficient at the lower cost and drive the best returns. And we have never been positioned as a company to do that better than we are right now.\nMichael Dahl: No, it's certainly a strong starting point. And then relatedly, just the cash flow strength is also continuing to be unique in this cycle. The $3 billion in cash from homebuilding ops, for the last couple of years, you've had some offsets from the accelerated multifamily or rental operations, some other assets. In the current environment, given what you've already articulated on multifamily, I know you still have a big backlog of under construction, but when we're trying to bridge that cash flow from homebuilding ops down to kind of a true free cash number, anything that we should be thinking about in terms of potential offsets from rentals or other parts of your business? Or do you think the majority of that will actually flow through to free cash?\nBill Wheat: As we did comment earlier, our pipeline of multifamily deals is growing, and we expect higher deliveries on multifamily. So I do expect our investments on the multifamily side of rental to show an increase in fiscal 2024. The single-family side, I think, is uncertain as to whether that will grow or not. It's going to \u2013 we're evaluating that in market conditions and where the rate environment is, as Mike and Paul commented earlier, but do expect some offset on the multifamily side.\nMichael Murray: Within the build-to-rent portfolio, we have a lot of optionality at various points in the development phases of those projects. As we start development, as we plan, vertical product, start construction, and then decide at the point we're ready with homes, do we go to rent or go to lease, go to rent or go to sale on those, so we can respond almost in real time to what the market is and not take a long duration risk on that asset.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Q&A session. I would now like to hand the floor back to Paul Romanowski for closing remarks.\nPaul Romanowski: Thanks, Tom. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in January to share our first quarter results.  I would like to thank David for his leadership, guidance, and support throughout my career. Our company has produced remarkable results during his tenure as CEO, and he has positioned us for continued success. To the D.R. Horton team, thank you for your incredible efforts in fiscal 2023. We are well-positioned heading into the new year, and I look forward to everything we will accomplish together in fiscal 2024.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 5% to $4.45 per diluted share compared to $4.67 per share in the prior-year quarter. Earnings for the year decreased 16% to $13.82 per diluted share compared to $16.51 in fiscal 2022.  Net income for the quarter decreased 7% to $1.5 billion on consolidated revenues of $10.5 billion. And for the year, net income decreased 19% to $4.7 billion on revenues of $35.5 billion. Our fourth quarter home sales revenues were $8.8 billion on 22,928 homes closed compared to $9.4 billion on 23,212 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $382,900, up 1% sequentially and down 5% from the prior-year quarter. Mike? We started 21,100 homes in the September quarter, down 8% from the June quarter. We ended the year with 42,000 homes in inventory, down 9% from a year ago and down 4% sequentially. 27,000 of our total homes at September 30th were unsold, of which 7,000 were completed.  For homes we closed in the fourth quarter, our construction cycle time decreased by a month from the third quarter, reflecting improvements in the supply chain. We will continue to manage our homes and inventory and starts pace based on market conditions, and we expect further improvements in our cycle times and housing inventory turns in fiscal 2024. Mike? In the fourth quarter, our rental operations generated $217 million of pre-tax income on $1.4 billion of revenues from the sale of 3,006 single-family rental homes and 1,582 multifamily rental units.  For the full year, our rental operations generated $524 million of pre-tax income on $2.6 billion of revenues from the sale of 6,175 single-family rental homes and 2,112 multifamily rental units.  Our rental property inventory at September 30th was $2.7 billion, which consisted of $1.3 billion of single-family rental properties and $1.4 billion of multifamily rental properties. Our rental operations generated significant increases in both revenues and profits this year as our platform is maturing and expanding across more markets. Due to the rise in interest rates and volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets, we are not providing separate guidance for our rental closings in fiscal 2024. Based on the current pipeline of rental projects, we do expect to have more multifamily unit closings in fiscal 2024 than in fiscal 2023. Bill? The average rate can move quite a bit through the quarter, but we tend to stay about 1 to 1.25 points below market at any given time. And today, we're offering on an FHA government loans, roughly in the 5.99% rate and, on a conventional 6.25%, which is right in that range of 1.25, 1.5 below today. About 60% of our total closings are used with some form of a rate buy-down. And so, a big percentage of \u2013 and the most successful incentive we have seen has been to impact that monthly cost of homeownership through some form of rate buy down. I'm going to say probably in the 6-ish range. We are still seeing strong interest, Carl, from the institutional investors that are out there. As you mentioned, the spreads have come in. And we're going to see some volatility in gross margin as we move through this process and move through the markets of higher rates, but still seeing consistent activity. I still feel we are in a great position to be the dominant supplier of single-family rental and continuing to grow our multifamily platform. As you know, we don't report on sales \u2013 forecast on sales, but we are pleased with our sales thus far into October. And you certainly see fluctuations in traffic when we see the kind of moves that we've seen over the last couple of weeks, both up and down in rates. But with our ability to hold stable rates through our interest rate incentives, we've been able to convert pretty consistently with the buyers that we've had out there. But any time you have fluctuations in rates, we're going to see people pause for a period of time until they settle into the reality of what they can afford. I think anytime you see rates like they have been in the capital markets, a bit in flux, then we're going to see some headwinds from our developers, from less capitalized builders. And it will create some opportunities, but we feel like we've got a good plan and open communications with our vendors, our trades and our lot suppliers to continue to work through those processes. Well, the team that's at the table is a team that was at the table last quarter last year and the prior several. We have a great position and are aligned as a company, not just from this group, but with our regional leadership and our division leadership. And we have continued to focus on returns community by community. And we have the benefit now of a wider footprint across the geographic area that we've expanded on, which is going to continue to provide strength for us and supply as we continue to expand in those markets. So the short version is we feel really good about where we are. I don't feel the need to put a stamped footprint or fingerprint on something unique and different because we have a strong team and a great operation in play, and a good playbook that we are executing on every day. No, I don't expect that to skew. Ken, we continue to build our developer partnerships in all markets. And I would expect that, over time, you'll continue to see a rise, not a reduction in the number of lots we buy fully developed as we derisk our balance sheet and our lot pipeline. We are watching it closely, and we continue to be in the market with stabilized assets. And we just like \u2013 as we sell homes, we watch the market closely, look at what demand is and what that pricing is. We don't intend to continue to hang on to stuff and significantly increase our balance sheet. So while we're indicating that we may see some choppiness in margins as we flow through this market, but we still feel good about the demand that's out there, we feel good about our position and the platform and intend to continue to grow the platform and be positioned to do so, but we'll watch it closely in the coming quarters and adjust accordingly. It's about 60% of our buyers are utilizing some type of rate buy-down and a fair chunk of those \u2013 I don't have specific numbers \u2013 almost all are permanent 30-year buy-down. And we have been very conservative in our underwriting and expectations for our single-family rental business and making sure that we feel good about it as a for-sale position as well as a for-rent, and underwriting it to the lowest of those guidelines for our operators, so that we aren't stretching on cap rates that are all driven potentially by interest environment.

            "content": "Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the fourth quarter was 25.1%, up 180 basis points sequentially from the June quarter. The increase in our gross margin from June to September reflects the slight increase in our average sales price and lower stick and brick costs on homes closed during the quarter.  On a per square-foot basis, home sales revenues were up 2.5% sequentially, while stick and brick cost per square foot decreased 2.5% and lot costs increased 6%. As Mike mentioned, we expect to continue offering a higher level of incentives in fiscal 2024 to help address affordability. Due to recent increases in volatility in mortgage rates, our incentive costs have increased on recent sales, and we expect our homebuilding gross margins to be lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Jessica? Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company, reported revenues of $550 million for the fourth quarter on 4,986 lots sold with pre-tax income of $95 million. For the full year, Forestar delivered 14,040 lines, generating $1.4 billion of revenues and $222 million of pre-tax income with a pre-tax profit margin of 15.4%.  Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at September 30th was 79,200 lots. 60% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $410 million of our finished lots purchased in the fourth quarter were from Forestar.  Forestar had approximately $1 billion of liquidity at year-end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 5.5%. Forestar is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots in the homebuilding industry and to consolidate significant market share over the next few years, with its strong balance sheet, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton.  Mike? Our balanced capital approach is disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic to support our operating platform and produce consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity, which provides us with flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions.  During fiscal 2023, our consolidated cash provided by operations was $4.3 billion, and our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $3.1 billion. Over the past five years, our homebuilding operations have generated $9.6 billion of cash flow. At September 30th, we had $7.5 billion of consolidated liquidity, consisting of $3.9 billion of cash and $3.6 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities. We repaid $400 million of senior notes this quarter, and our debt at September 30th totaled $5.1 billion with no senior note maturities in fiscal 2024.  Our consolidated leverage at September 30th was 18.3% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 5.1%. At September 30th, our stockholders' equity was $22.7 billion and book value per share was $67.78, up 20% from a year ago. For the year, our return on equity was 22.7%.  During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $84 million for a total of $341 million of dividends paid during the year. We repurchased 3.5 million shares of common stock for $423 million during the quarter. And for the year, we repurchased 11.1 million shares for $1.2 billion, which reduced our outstanding share count by 3% from the prior year-end. In October, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our common stock, replacing our previous authorization. Based on our strong financial position and cash flow, our board also increased our quarterly cash dividend by 20% to $0.30 per share. Jessica? The second half of the fiscal year, we had a little more relative stability in the rate environment, and so we were able to level off our incentives really in Q3 and Q4. We also then had a little bit of price traction that allowed our average sales price to tick up just a tad in the fourth quarter. And then really, one of the biggest benefits was we did see continued improvement in lumber costs. And so, our overall stick and brick costs on our homes came down in the quarter. We do think we basically realized the majority of that lumber cost benefit in the near term and within the more recent rise in interest rates and the use of incentives. That's why we're guiding down for Q1, but we had some benefits that supported the increase in gross margin in Q4. We are able with our improved cycle times. We are seeing improved inventory turns and our assumption next year is that we will see some further improvement in cycle times and inventory turns. So we are able to operate with a relatively lower level of homebuilding inventory. However, we're also guiding to a volume increase. And so, I don't necessarily expect an absolute decrease in our homes and inventory, but we do expect to be turning it faster. So that's definitely a contributing factor to the cash flow. Or it's just an improvement in our turns of our land assets. So, yes, primarily from profits that's resulting from the improved turns. Well, the way we're running our business, the way we underwrite our land deals, that's our focus, with our focus on purchasing finished lots and as many deals as we can. Yes, our goal would be to keep that return on inventory in the homebuilding business as high as we can. And so, definitely, mid- to high 20s is a good level for us. It does fluctuate with where gross margins are. So we've been coming down off of some of the peak gross margins we saw last year, but definitely mid to high 20s is a level that we're striving to achieve. Mike, sticks, and bricks, we've been \u2013 the last couple of quarters have been seeing the benefit of lower lumber costs. However, across most other cost categories, in the vertical construction costs, we are still seeing modest inflation. So on a year-over-year basis in the quarter, our stick and brick costs were down 3.5% on a per square foot basis. But our lot costs were up 11%. So we're seeing more inflation in our lot costs. And so, as we look forward into fiscal 2024, we would expect to continue to see inflation in our lot costs as land moves through and development cost inflation continues. And I think we would still expect to still see some modest inflation in some of the other stick and brick categories. There has been some recent moderation in lumber costs. As we move through 2024, we'd expect to see some benefit from. But overall, I think we still expect costs to show moderate inflation. As far as price appreciation with the current rate environment, the volatility and the recent rise in rates, we're not expecting any price appreciation. Our base case would probably expect a little bit of downward pressure on prices. And as we've already talked about, we are using higher incentives going into the first part of the year.  Now rate environment can change. Strength of the market can change as we go into the spring, and so we'll adjust depending on what we see in the market as we get further into the year. It's been the goal of ours to consistently repurchase shares over time and grow that over time. And so, this is just another step in that progression. And in the business, as we see I'd say, increased visibility and confidence in our ability to generate cash flow into fiscal 2024. That's given us a little more certainty around being able to guide a little more specifically to that growth than we have in the past.  As Mike said earlier, a year ago, we were concerned about our production capacity and how quickly we could actually deliver homes. We have more certainty around that today. And so, with that, that gives us more visibility around our cash flow. And so, repurchases, dividends, distributions to shareholders are an important part of our of our capital allocation. And so, as we're guiding to $3 billion of homebuilding cash flow with $1.5 billion of that going to share repurchase, another $400 million going to dividends, that's obviously a very important part of our capital allocation. That is our current run rate. It has been inflecting a bit higher. It reflects several things. Obviously, land prices time over a number of years have increased incrementally. But we've also seen significant inflation in development costs and all that includes in that, whether it's the infrastructure costs themselves along with costs from government permits and regulations and requirements there as well as lengthening the time of development. The development time lines have lengthened dramatically, which then adds to, obviously, the costs associated with it. So there has been pretty strong inflation across really all of our markets on lots getting developed. And there's still a shortage of lots out there in the market for builders as well. And so, that is our current run rate. Whether that's going to accelerate further or whether we might see some moderation over time, I don't think we have visibility to that, but we do still expect to see probably stronger lot cost inflation than our other inflation in our stick and brick costs as we go in 2024. As we did comment earlier, our pipeline of multifamily deals is growing, and we expect higher deliveries on multifamily. So I do expect our investments on the multifamily side of rental to show an increase in fiscal 2024. The single-family side, I think, is uncertain as to whether that will grow or not. It's going to \u2013 we're evaluating that in market conditions and where the rate environment is, as Mike and Paul commented earlier, but do expect some offset on the multifamily side."

            "name": "David Auld",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica. And good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Paul Romanowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  When we talk about our results, I'd like to congratulate Paul on his well-deserved promotion to CEO that was effective October 1. We have been preparing for this transition internally for quite some time. We are positioning our leadership throughout the company for the future, and I will still be actively involved as executive vice chair of board of directors. Our executive team remains in place with the same individuals and Paul has the support of our executive, region, and division leadership. He is a proven leader who has been successful throughout his group.  Now on to our results. The D.R. Horton team finished the year with solid fourth quarter results, highlighted by earnings of $4.45 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income was $2 billion on a 9% increase in revenues to $10.5 billion, with a pre-tax profit margin of 19.2%. For the year, earnings per diluted share was $13.82 and our consolidated pre-tax income was $6.3 billion on a 6% increase in revenues to $35.5 million, with a pre-tax profit margin of 17.8%. We closed a record 91,204 homes and apartments this year in our homebuilding and rental operations. Our cash flow from operations for 2023 was $4.3 billion. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the year was 29.7% and our return on equity was 22.7%. Despite continued high mortgage rates and inflationary pressures, our net sales orders increased 39% from the prior-year quarter. As a result, both new and existing homes at affordable price points is limited and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable.  We are focused on consolidating market share by supplying more homes at affordable price points to meet homebuyer demand, while maximizing the returns and capital efficiency in each of our communities.  With improvements in both labor capacity and availability of materials, our cycle times are decreasing, positioning us to improve our housing inventory turns. We are well-positioned with our experienced operators, affordable product offerings, flexible lot supply, and strong capital and liquidity positions to generate strong cash flows and produce consistent returns.  We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, including returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Paul? In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, and broad geographic footprint across 118 markets. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and loan leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to meet changing market conditions and continue aggregating market share.  We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, while consistently returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.  Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and our work. Due to your efforts, we just completed our 22nd consecutive year as the largest and strongest builder in the United States, and we look forward to working together to improve our operations and provide homeownership opportunities to more American families during 2024.  With my transition to executive vice chair, this will be my last public earnings call. It has been an honor and a privilege to represent and report on the D.R. Horton team's remarkable efforts for the past 10 years.  Thank you all again. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Ken, I was going to try to stay off this Q&A. Everything \u2013 you go back 45-year history, the goal of the company is to be the low-cost provider of affordable housing and create opportunities for first-time homebuyers to get in a home. And everything we've done through those years has been to position the company a little bit better and a little bit stronger. And the awakening of 2008, 2009 and 2010, I think, created a discipline in operations that made the transition from margin to return pretty much an industry standard today. You listen to other builder calls and everybody is talking about returns, cash flow, deleveraging and derisking their land pipeline. I don't see that changing. The industry has matured, the market share consolidation by the publics, the difficulty of putting lots on the ground, the difficulty of building houses, restrictions on capital, all of those things are forcing a discipline on the industry and allowing the \u2013 what I think the national builders to gain market share quarter after quarter after quarter after quarter. So our internal focus is going to continue to be project by project, driving improvements to efficiency, simplifying product, making it \u2013 even as overall individual component price increases, the availability of housing to the first-time homebuyer continues to be there. So that's our goal. That's all we think about every day.  And I think, earlier, somebody said something about sustainable. Everything we do, if it's not sustainable, we leave it in the trash pile and move on. So scalable, sustainable, consistent, and transparent. That's this team that's built alignment throughout our company, and I don't see that changing. Paul will do things differently than I do. He's taller than I am. That's a good thing. Coming down the ladder, I feel very good about the position we're in. Never been as well-positioned as a company. Thank you, Ken. I appreciate the support through the years. Mike, I'm pretty optimistic. We've never been positioned to execute from a product location, lot supply and have gained efficiency through the last two or three years that I think we'll continue on. So I think 2024 is going to be a good year given a lack of some catastrophic event. So it's just \u2013 ultimately, in this business, it's about who can produce houses the most efficient at the lower cost and drive the best returns. And we have never been positioned as a company to do that better than we are right now."

            "content": "Our net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 39% to 18,939 homes and order value increased 34% from the prior year to $7.3 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 21%, up from 18% sequentially and down from 32% in the prior-year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 2% sequentially and up 10% from the prior year. The average price of net sales orders in the fourth quarter was $383,100, up 1% sequentially and down 4% from the prior-year quarter. To adjust to changing market conditions and higher mortgage rates, we have increased our use of incentives and are reducing the size of our homes where possible to provide better affordability for our homebuyers. We expect to continue utilizing a higher level of incentives in fiscal 2024, particularly rate buydowns in the current interest rate environment.  Our sales volumes can be significantly affected by changes in mortgage rates and other economic factors. However, we will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share. Bill? Our homebuilding lot position at September 30th consisted of approximately 568,000 lots, of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. 35% of our total owned lots are finished and 54% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our fourth quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land, and development totaled $2.3 billion, up 7% sequentially. Our current quarter investments consisted of $1.5 billion for finished lots, $580 million for land development and $290 million for land acquisition. For the year, our homebuilding investments in lots, land, and development totaled $8 billion, up 6% from fiscal 2022. Paul? Financial Services earned $85 million of pre-tax income in the fourth quarter on $220 million of revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 38.9%. For the year, financial services earned $283 million of pre-tax income on $802 million of revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 35.3%.  During the fourth quarter, virtually all of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 76% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 51% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 725 at an average loan-to-value ratio of 87%. First-time home buyers represented 55% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter.  Bill? I think you summed it up pretty well, John. I think we see higher incentives coming forward with the rapid rise in interest rates through the last six weeks or so. A little bit of moderation last week, which was helpful, but one week doesn't make a trend, I don't think. And we do sell a significant number of the homes we closed in the quarter during that quarter. I think for the fourth quarter, 39% of our closings were sold in the quarter. So we're at a pretty real-time indication of margins in the business as it comes through. Don't probably have a good breakdown of deliveries by market, stratified by market size or recent entrants, but we do expect to see probably a rotation to smaller home footprints and introduction of smaller plans where we can get municipality approvals. Again, just to maintain the affordability, I think we will see that we're going to continue to roll with starts, but the compressed cycle times that we've gotten out of our construction process is going to allow us to deliver a lot more homes on fewer homes carried in inventory at any given quarter end date. This is Mike. Just following on with that is that our lot position is very strong right now. We own 50,000 lots that are finished, and there's obviously more that are in the controlled portion of our portfolio, that \u2013 as we see the market unfold for the year, we will be able to accelerate starts to meet any increased demand.  Coming into 2023, we saw a rate spike at the end 2022 and we were a little concerned about the year and the outlook we gave last year at this time. And the team stepped up and delivered a great year in fiscal 2023 and against that backdrop. So positioning for conservatism in the year, but always are \u2013 have a desire to grow and to grow in that double-digit level. I think we will see probably margins compress a bit on those multifamily sales just if interest rates have come up and cap rates tend to come up. The question of how much supply is out there is really specific to a given project in a given submarket that that project serves. And our team has done a great job of looking at those submarkets when we made the decision to move forward with the projects, cognizant of what was available in the marketplace, both ahead of us and behind us from a supply perspective. So we feel pretty good about being able to deliver into a healthy demand environment. We're still seeing good lease-ups in our rental properties, in line with expectations. So we're very encouraged by that. We're going to operate the neighborhoods, but focused on return as usual, Alan, and it's going to be a pace and a price conversation continually. And the rates buy-downs, the incentives that we offer, it's just part of the mix of the cost environment that we deal with. And while we've seen some nice relief in the stick and brick cost, we have had some price pressure on other sides of it, but fuel prices have come down. That should give us a little bit of relief across a pretty broad spectrum of commodities as well as delivery costs. So it's a constant give-and-take on the cost and the margins. And our primary focus and guiding star is returns. I think our buyers are focused primarily on affordability. And for us, the way we deliver that affordability is through the monthly payment process. And that's obviously been a big driver for the rate buydowns, but also introducing smaller product footprints. De-amenitizing some of the homes a bit and letting people do things to improve their homes after the closing when their financial position perhaps has changed and they can afford a little more. But it's continuing to hit a price point relative to median income, so that we can find a place to work in that family's budget. I think 12 months ago, we were facing two big issues. We were still trying to solve the production supply chain challenges and our cycle times were very elongated. So we had a hard time determining exactly what homes we're going to finish and deliver. And that was also a big interaction with the rate buy-down process because we can only buy rates down for certain forward amount of time in a cost-effective manner, and so being able to pinpoint when those homes would deliver into the buy-down environment.  You touched on the second point with the rates. Yes, we start facing some rate uncertainty and increases, but we have been able to manage through that over the past 12 months, and the team has delivered a really strong year. The strategic value of the platform for us to be a very good multifamily developer is significant as a land user. Being a residential developer, we've done that for a long time. And now going into the multifamily development side, we become a better buyer of land parcels and a better partner for land sellers. And so, strategically, it's a business we're going to stay in, going to continue to scale that business, but we will be opportunistic and responsive to market conditions with what we do. Sort of be across the board. It's going to vary significantly by market and what the interest rate environment was at the time we made the acquisition. So it's hard to pin it down to any one cap rate or even a relevant range. Because like with many expectations over the life of the project, from cost and rental side, there's a lot of actuals prove different than the assumptions we made that come out. And so, fortunately, we've been able to see some really strong execution by the teams and picking good projects and executing well on those projects, and that's showing up in the results. And we're just going to try to keep working in that direction. But it's hard for me to give you a number of what a ballpark cap rate was at the time we did a pro forma on a deal and when we decided to go forward with it. Within the build-to-rent portfolio, we have a lot of optionality at various points in the development phases of those projects. As we start development, as we plan, vertical product, start construction, and then decide at the point we're ready with homes, do we go to rent or go to lease, go to rent or go to sale on those, so we can respond almost in real time to what the market is and not take a long duration risk on that asset."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton.\nJessica Hansen: Thank you, Paul, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Before we get started, today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K and its most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q early next week. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News & Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the third quarter, the D.R. Horton team delivered solid results, highlighted by earnings of $3.90 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income was $1.8 billion on an 11% increase in revenues to $9.7 billion, with a pre-tax profit margin of 18.3%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 31.8%, and our return on equity for the same period was 24.3%. Despite continued high mortgage rates and inflationary pressures, our net sales orders increased 37% from the prior-year quarter, as the supply of both new home and existing homes at affordable price points is limited and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable. We are focused on consolidating market share by supplying more homes to meet homebuyer demand, while maximizing the returns and capital efficiency each of -- in each of our communities. With improvements in both labor capacity and availability of materials, our cycle times are decreasing, positioning us to release homes for sale earlier in the construction cycle. We are pleased that we were able to increase our homebuilding starts to 22,900 homes this quarter, which was supported by a 6% sequential increase in our active selling communities. Our homebuilding operating margins are lower than the record high margins we reported last year due to cost inflation and pricing adjustments and incentives we implemented to address homebuyer affordability challenges caused by higher mortgage rates. However, our margins improved sequentially from the March to June quarter as home prices and incentives have stabilized and some reductions in construction costs are now being realized in our homes closed. We are well-positioned with our experienced operators, diverse product offerings, flexible lot supply, and strong capital and liquidity position to produce and sustain consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company, including returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 16% to $3.90 per diluted share, compared to $4.67 per share in the prior-year quarter. Net income for the quarter decreased 19% to $1.3 billion on consolidated revenues of $9.7 billion. Our third quarter home sales revenues were $8.7 billion on 22,985 homes closed, compared to $8.3 billion on 21,308 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $378,600, flat sequentially and down 3% from the prior-year quarter. Mike?\nMike Murray: Our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 37% to 22,879 homes, and order value increased 26% from the prior year to $8.7 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 18%, flat sequentially and down from 24% in the prior-year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 6% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. The average price of net sales orders in the third quarter was $381,100, up 2% sequentially and down 8% from the prior-year quarter. To adjust to changing market conditions and higher mortgage rates over the past year, we increased our use of incentives and reduced the sizes of our homes to provide better affordability to homebuyers. Although home prices and incentives have begun to stabilize, we expect to continue utilizing a higher level of incentives as compared to last year. Our sales volumes can be significantly affected by changes in mortgage rates and other economic factors. However, we will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the third quarter was 23.3%, up 170 basis points sequentially from the March quarter. The decrease in our gross margin from March to June reflects a decrease in incentive costs and lower stick-and-brick costs on homes closed during the quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues and lot costs were both flat sequentially, while stick-and-brick cost per square foot decreased 4%. As Mike mentioned, we continue to -- we expect to continue offering a higher level of incentives as compared to 2022. But due to the recent stabilization in home prices and some reductions in both incentives and construction costs, we expect our homebuilding gross margins to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: In the third quarter, our homebuilding SG&A expenses increased by 6% from last year and homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 6.7%, up 10 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date homebuilding SG&A was 7.2% of revenues, up 30 basis points from the same period last year as we've maintained the capacity of our platform to grow market share. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: We started 22,900 homes in the June quarter, up 15% from the March quarter. We ended the quarter with 43,800 homes in inventory, down 22% from a year ago and flat sequentially. 25,000 of our homes at June 30 were unsold, of which 5,700 were completed. For homes we closed in the third quarter, our construction cycle time decreased by over a month from the second quarter, reflecting improvements in the supply chain. We expect to see a further decrease in our cycle time for homes closed in the fourth quarter. We will continue to [ingest] (ph) our homes and inventory and starts pace based on market conditions. Mike?\nMike Murray: Our homebuilding lot position at June 30 consisted of approximately 555,000 lots, of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. 34% of our total owned lots are finished and 53% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital-efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our third quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.2 billion, up 25% from the prior-year quarter and 27% sequentially. Our current quarter investments consisted of $1.2 billion for finished lots, $700 million for land development, and $290 million for land acquisition. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: During the quarter, our rental operations generated $162 million of pre-tax income on $667 million of revenues from the sale of 1,754 single-family rental homes and 230 multi-family rental units. Our rental property inventory at June 30 was $3.3 billion, which consisted of $1.9 billion of single-family rental properties and $1.4 billion of multi-family rental properties. Our rental operations are generating significant increases in both revenues and profits this year, as our platform expands across more markets. For the fourth quarter, we expect our rental revenues to be greater than our third quarter and our rental profit margin to be lower than our third quarter. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company, reported total revenues of $369 million for the third quarter on 3,812 lots sold with pre-tax income of $62 million. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at June 30 was 73,000 lots. 57% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $270 million of our finished lots purchased in the third quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had more than $780 million of liquidity at quarter-end, with a net debt to capital ratio of 19.1%. Forestar is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots in the homebuilding industry and to aggregate significant market share over the next few years with its strong balance sheet, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Mike?\nMike Murray: Financial services earned $94 million of pre-tax income in the third quarter on $229 million of revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 41.2%. During the quarter, 99% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 74% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 51% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 723 and an average loan to value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 56% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic to support and to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity, which provides us with flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. During the first nine months of the year, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $2.1 billion and our consolidated cash provided by operations was $2.3 billion. At June 30, we had $4.6 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $2.6 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Homebuilding debt at June 30 totaled $2.7 billion, which includes $400 million of senior notes that we redeemed early in July. Our homebuilding leverage was 11.1% at the end of June and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 0.7%. Our consolidated leverage at June 30 was 22%, and consolidated leverage net of cash was 11.2%. At June 30, our stockholders' equity was $21.7 billion, and book value per share was $64.03, up 23% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended June, our return on equity was 24.3%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $85 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in August. We repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock for $343 million during the quarter for a total of 7.7 million shares repurchased fiscal year-to-date for $764 million. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: As we look forward, we expect current market conditions to continue with uncertainty regarding mortgage rates, the capital markets and general economic conditions that may significantly impact our business. For the full year, we currently expect to close between 82,800 and 83,300 homes in our homebuilding operations and between 6,500 and 7,000 homes and units in our rental operations. We expect our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2023 to be in a range of $34.7 billion to $35.1 billion. We expect to generate greater than $3 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2023, primarily from our homebuilding operations. We also expect our fiscal 2023 share repurchases to be approximately $1.1 billion, similar to last year. For the fourth quarter, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of $9.7 billion to $10.1 billion, and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 22,800 to 23,300 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be approximately 23.5% to 24%, and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 6.7% to 6.8%. We anticipate our financial services pre-tax profit margin of around 30% to 35%, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24.5% in the fourth quarter. We will continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, our rental operations, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares. David?\nDavid Auld: In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform to sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth and cash flow, while continuing to aggregate market share. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your continued focus and hard work. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is live.\nStephen Kim: Thanks very much guys. Impressive quarter once again. So, congratulations on that. I wanted to talk about your construction -- your pace of construction and your goals going forward. You talked about growing your starts this quarter versus last quarter. But when we just look back maybe a year, year and a half ago, there were a couple of quarters where you started even more. You started about 25,000 units a quarter. I wanted to get a sense from you as to whether or not you feel like that's a level that you could achieve in the near term, and if not why not? And then also if you could talk about whether seasonality is going to be a factor we should be thinking about with respect to your starts cadence?\nPaul Romanowski: Yes, Stephen, we have seen, as we talked, about a 30-day reduction in our cycle time and see consistency and improvement as we travel throughout our divisions and seen pretty good balance with our trades and all the supplies that we need to continue with improvement in cycle time. If you look at our starts pace, it did tick up some and stayed pretty consistent with our closings, which is a cadence that we expect to see as we look towards the fourth quarter. Based on our sales pace and the strength of the market, and where we have the lots and the ability to push that up a little bit, we will, but not looking to outpace the market and continue to keep in that cadence and position ourselves for continued growth.\nStephen Kim: Okay. So, it sounds like I didn't really get a sense for whether 25,000 is a significant figure in your mind. And why is that a level that we couldn't achieve or revisit? Simply because it wasn't that long ago where you actually did that for, like I said, two quarters in a row. And then also if I could tack on a second question about your rental platform. You did give some guidance regarding [revs] (ph) being higher, but margins being lower relative to -- in 4Q relative to 3Q. Could you talk about your plans for rental inventory in dollars carried on the balance sheet? Where should we be thinking you're going to take that level of investment, which I think is $3.3 billion, if I'm not mistaken, right now? Is that going to grow meaningfully as we look into 2024 and beyond, or is that a level that you feel comfortable with, maybe even begin to harvest some of that? Thanks.\nDavid Auld: Hey, Steve, as to the 25,000 starts per quarter, we are very focused on increasing -- incrementally increasing starts quarter to quarter to quarter. And we believe that as we continue this process, we will consolidate the labor availability capacity. And with labor and material consolidation, our ability to program out our starts and then continue to build the houses and gain efficiency in that process, it's just an ongoing effort. So, do we have a target out there of we've got to get to this number? No. Our target is market by market, flag by flag, how do we consolidate these markets and increase our market share. And just by the nature of doing that, we're going to get bigger and bigger and bigger. And I'll let Mike reply to the rental question.\nMike Murray: Hey, Stephen. So, we expect that the margin on the fourth quarter closings in the rental segment will probably have a lower profit margin, largely on the basis of a mix of projects that are delivering between Q3 and then into Q4. A lot of it's on a cost basis difference between those homes that were built at different times and when they're delivering.\nPaul Romanowski: And then, in terms of our forward investment level, we're at a total of about $3.3 billion of inventory today. We've seen a significant growth ramp in that over the last two years. We do expect to continue to grow that platform and we will see our inventory levels continue to grow over the next couple of years, but we do expect that growth pace to moderate from what it's been in the last two years.\nStephen Kim: Okay. Great. Thanks very much, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Joe Ahlersmeyer from Deutsche Bank. Joe, your line is live.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Thanks, and good quarter, guys.\nDavid Auld: Thank you.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: I wanted to follow up on the community count. That's up about 9% year-to-date, calendar year-to-date that is. And I'm just wondering is there anything in there that we should consider that's more temporary in nature? I'm not going to straight-line that release or anything that sequential number, but should we expect that to go down into the back half, or are we going to sustain those levels? And then I have a follow-up.\nJessica Hansen: Sure, Joe. We've been really focused on our flag count. I mean, we clearly have the lot position to open new communities and to grow our community count, whereas the last couple of years, it's not moved more than a low-single digit percentage. We do feel like we're positioned to be closer to the mid-single digits going forward. So not necessarily 9% going forward, but around the mid-single digits quarter-to-quarter. There can be some choppiness just determining when we close out of communities and ultimately bring them online, but our lot position is there and our operators are focused on growing their flag count.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Makes sense. And just thinking about the homes and inventory number, that was actually sequentially flattish the last couple quarters, even as you did grow those communities. So, is it right to think that maybe this is part of returning to higher levels of inventory unit turnover? Or should we expect that the total homes and inventory will sort of catch up on a lag as you continue to grow starts?\nPaul Romanowski: We're very focused on improving our inventory turn and as our construction cycle times have improved, that's facilitating that. You look historically, we typically when we go into a year with our number of homes in inventory, we've been able to turn that 2 times in the following year. The last couple of years has been slower than that, and so we're looking to get back to that more historic inventory turn level as we look to fiscal '24.\nDavid Auld: That is a -- going back to the start question, that is a factor in our start pace is making sure that we have the capacity to continue to deliver these houses in a more -- in a faster and more efficient way. It all flows together so that we can actually deliver more houses with fewer homes and inventory quarter-to-quarter, quarter-to-quarter.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: That's great to hear. Thanks very much, and good luck.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from John Lovallo from UBS. John, your line is live.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is, it looks like the sequential improvement or the sequential cadence of orders from the second quarter to third quarter was better than normal seasonality by a bit. I mean, I think normal seasonality would suggest down about 5%. It looks like they were down about 1%. As we move into the fourth quarter, how should we sort of think about seasonality, which looks like it's typically down, call it, 15% to 20% on a quarter-over-quarter basis? Is that a reasonable way to think about the fourth quarter, or are the dynamics getting a little bit better out there where you might be able to do a bit better than that?\nPaul Romanowski: Yeah. Thanks, John. I think we are seeing more normal seasonality this year in terms of just demand traffic patterns. And so, I think our base expectations would be that orders would show a bit closer to normal seasonality going forward. But to our approach in trying to be as consistent as we can and providing starts pace and a consistent level of inventory, we're still a short supply of inventory out there in the existing home market and in the new home market. We're going to make sure we've got enough homes out there to capture whatever demand there may be. And so, our hope would be, over the longer term, we could see a bit more consistency there. But there still is a natural seasonality and an ebb-and-flow to consumer demand that I think is getting back to a more normal level.\nDavid Auld: And I do believe that we're going to have a lot more houses to sell this year, given the shortened cycle time and our ability to give people a date certain to close. So, we were limited in the number homes last year. So, the comparison this quarter to last quarter, a year-ago quarter, is probably going to -- it's going to look better than typical seasonality.\nJohn Lovallo: That makes sense. Okay. And then maybe just a bigger picture question. If we look at 2019, D.R. Horton delivered 57,000 homes, in that ballpark, versus the -- close to 83,000 homes expected this year. Industry-wide single-family starts were pretty similar in 2019 to what's expected today. Obviously, Horton and the publics have been gaining share for years, but this is close to a 45%, 50% jump since 2019. So, I guess, the question is, how sustainable are these gains? How important is your build strategy to this performance? And maybe how important is the lack of existing home inventory just to overall homebuilder success today?\nDavid Auld: I think, yes, yes, and yes. We've been focused for years now on simplifying this business and creating a level of consistency that didn't exist in the '80s, '90s, or early 2000s. And jokingly I call it building a real business, and I believe we have and are doing that. And coming out of the downturn, there was tremendous opportunity to consolidate market. But we didn't have the liquidity or balance sheet to do it. So, as we have grown through this last 15 years, 20 years -- 15 years, I guess, our goal has been to create a company with a balance sheet and the liquidity to take advantage of any disruptions in the market. And since 2019, it just seems like, at least quarterly, you either coming out of it or going into it another disruption. So, it's the power of the platform and we talk a lot about it. I think you're seeing it play out. It's people, it's location, product, it's just trying to simplify the business and create affordability to a level nobody else can achieve. And that's going to consolidate these markets.\nJohn Lovallo: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl, your line is live.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Bill, you mentioned stick and brick down 4% per foot, I think, year-on-year. Could you break that out in terms of what materials are helping most, obviously, lumber and then labor? And the reason I ask is, I'm assuming that we're starting to see some leverage from the single-family and multi-family rental platform. Part of the reason you're trying to grow that business is to add scale in your markets to lower overall construction costs. So, I'm wondering if that's starting to help there.\nBill Wheat: Right now, as we look at the components of the home across the materials, it is primarily lumber right now. There are some minor moves in both directions, really across the other components of the homes. It's primarily lumber there. I think we are on the front edge of starting to realize some improvement in labor as the homes that we have been starting over the last quarter or two have been at a lower cost than what we had there for a while. But I think we still expect a bit more improvement there with lumber. And then really, the forward cost structure really depends on what the capacity of the industry is and what all builders are doing. So, a bit more improvement there, but as we continue to add scale, which does include our rental platform as well, we definitely have advantages and opportunities to continue to leverage that to drive our cost structure down, especially relative to the rest of the industry.\nCarl Reichardt: Okay. Thank you, Bill. And then David, the private builders we're talking to, we've seen sort of -- you mentioned normal seasonality to a slower market maybe than they had expected starting the summer. I don't know if that's just the particular vagaries of being small and private. They can't -- harder to buydowns, more capital constraints to do higher-end. But you purchased a private during the quarter and you've got presence in a lot of markets where the smaller privates really make up the bulk of your competitors, in some cases, all of them. Has there been much movement in terms of interest willingness or need to sell among the privates right now, just given what they're facing relative to what the publics have advantage-wise? Thanks.\nDavid Auld: Carl, we talk about it a lot, seems like in the last couple of years, but it is really hard to put a lot on the ground. It is really hard to build houses. And these private guys, now, they've got to struggle with capital from either private or banks increasing in cost. So, do we have the opportunity to talk to a lot of these guys? Yes, we do. But it's going to take unique opportunities for us to invite them into the family, because we do have a special culture here and we're not going to screw it up trying to force a square peg in a round hole.\nJessica Hansen: Excited about the most recent [indiscernible] Truland in terms of already having been one of our largest lot developers in our Gulf Coast region. And so, we picked up Truland's homebuilding operations, but Nathan Cox and his team will continue to be a key component in terms of developing lots to us and for us in the Gulf Coast.\nDavid Auld: And I will say, I've had a personal relationship with Nathan Cox for 15 plus years, and he is an example of somebody that absolutely mirrors our culture. He's a super quality guy. He's built a good company, and somebody who we're going to be in business with for a long, long time.\nCarl Reichardt: Great. I appreciate it. Thanks all.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Carl.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan. Mike, your line is live.\nMike Rehaut: Great. Thanks. Appreciate it. I wanted to circle back to an earlier answer that you gave around -- thoughts around your 4Q demand and order trends. Last month, you had Lennar talk about their third quarter orders being a little bit above 2Q and KB talking about normal seasonality being muted in the third -- in their third quarter, all based on not only strong demand but also kind of filling a void for the lack of supply that's out there and the strong demand that new homebuilders can provide as a result. So, just going back to your comments, I think, Bill, you kind of said, perhaps normal seasonality. David, I think I heard you say perhaps better than normal seasonality. I was hoping to kind of get a finer-tuned answer there in terms of what you think your capacity is to meet demand. Again, is there an ability to take orders that is similar to the third quarter level if you see the demand there? And I would assume you'd be just as interested in taking as much share as you can. Or going back to an earlier question as well, is there any type of production constraints that might hold you back there a little bit?\nJessica Hansen: Sure, Mike. So, I mean, we're not in this for quarterly results. We're in this for the long term and to build as much shareholder value as we can over the long term. So, quarter to quarter to quarter, as you've heard David say over and over, we're focused on being consistent, and, as we've talked about, it's all tied to our starts pace. So, we're not managing to a sales number in Q4. If the market's there and our cycle times continue to improve, we might be able to see a little bit better than normal seasonality. If the market were to weaken for some reason or we don't get as many homes started ultimately, it could be less than normal seasonality. Right now, we feel like we're positioned to increase our starts slightly from where we were in Q3. And also, as we've talked about, our construction cycle times have continued to improve and our flag count has grown. So, we feel like we're very well-positioned. But frankly, we're more focused on positioning for '24 at this point than we are worried about Q4. I mean, we're going to finish out the year very strong and generate strong returns and continue to add to book value and position ourselves to go do the same in 2024.\nMike Rehaut: Okay. I appreciate that. I guess, maybe then turning to '24, when you look at your backlog conversion at the beginning of the year relative to what you deliver, at best, you kind of hit a 4 times -- maybe low 4 times turnover. In other words, your backlog turned over 4 times in terms of the amount of closings you were able to achieve. The height was in 2020 at 4.8 times. It looks like, on a rough basis, you'd probably be closer to 5 times or above, maybe even 6 times, given where potentially your backlog could be at the end of this fiscal year. So, given the fact that you're looking for community count growth, is it still reasonable to expect kind of a high-single or even low-double digit closings growth number for next year, or, again, just given the physical constraints of turnover and other -- the fact that cycle times are improving, but not back to where they were, any other items to consider?\nBill Wheat: Sure, Mike. As we're looking to fiscal '24, we're -- and we've talked about this before. We always try to position ourselves with our lot position, with our homes and inventory so that we are in a position to deliver close to a double-digit growth, high-single, 10% type growth. And so, that's what we're doing again, is positioning our inventory so that we're in the position there in the market that we see today. I think it's there for us if we can get our lot positions and our homes in inventory ready for that. And with improved cycle times, that helps us improve our inventory turnover. And I think we focus a lot more on our inventory turn, our inventory conversion than we do backlog. Backlog is just really just a factor of when we choose to sign a sales contract on a home. We focus on our starts pace, what homes we have in inventory, and then we adjust when we're going to release those for sale based on when we have confidence that we can deliver that home. So, every home we start, we will close. And if we're turning those faster, then that will improve the inventory turnover and improve -- honestly, improves your visibility to see what our closings are going to be as well. So it's really about our starts pace, our inventory positioning, and then how efficiently can we turn that.\nJessica Hansen: And as a reminder, we sell and close generally 35% to 40% of our homes intra-quarter, so you never see those in our backlog that we're reporting at a quarter-end anyway, which is why Bill is alluding to home starts and our homes in inventory being a better driver and an indicator of what we're going to close in a forward period.\nMike Rehaut: Great. Thanks so much.\nJessica Hansen: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Matthew, your line is live.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask about lot costs. I think you said lots on a per square foot basis were actually flat sequentially, which is maybe a little surprising, given the shortage of lots out there, as you alluded to. Could you speak to a little around what's implied near term in your margin guidance around lot costs? And then just sort of more broadly, how are you thinking about managing inflation in lots going forward? Thank you.\nMike Murray: What we're seeing today in the closings are lots that were contracted and acquired quite some time ago and coming through. So, we're not seeing a lot of cost pressure coming through. Going forward, along with the lot scarcity, we're expecting to see lot costs coming through in forward margins at a higher level. There has certainly been inflation in land and in lot development costs and in finished lot prices. So, we expect to see that, but that's factored into our guidance and the way we're planning for the business next year.\nMatthew Bouley: Okay. Got it. Thank you for that. And then, secondly, just on the topic of mortgage rate buydowns, I'm curious if you can kind of educate us a little around how that dynamic may change depending where prevailing mortgage rates go. So, if we were to see a rise in mortgage rates from here, for example, what level or what ability do you have to -- what's kind of the maximum level of rate buydown, I guess, you could do? And conversely, if rates were to come down, would you continue to buy down rates by the same amount, or would you actually reduce kind of the size of your mortgage rate buydowns? Just curious around how all that may play out. Thank you.\nPaul Romanowski: Yeah. The rate buydown for us has been an effective incentive and to help us provide, as we've improved our cycle time as well, a certainty of close date and a certainty of home payment. And we have stayed roughly a point below the market, and we'll have to measure that as we move forward depending on where rates move, whether that be up or down. But we have found it to be our -- one of our most effective incentives, and we have been consistent in that execution and we'll continue to explore that as the interest rates move on a go-forward basis.\nMatthew Bouley: All right. Well, thank you, and good luck.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Eric, your line is live.\nEric Bosshard: Thanks. The gross margin progress in the quarter was notable and you talked about, I guess, a bit more progress in 4Q. I'm curious if you could help us get a sense of how we should be thinking about the path of gross margins from here. You've done a good job historically outlining ranges. But in the world, which seems like it's stabilizing for you now, how should we think about the range of path of gross margin?\nBill Wheat: Yeah, Eric, it's -- what we have visibility to is basically what's in our backlog and what's been in our recent sales, and then, we certainly have visibility to what our recent cost levels have been. So, we've been seeing the costs on our more recent starts be lower. So, we've got some visibility to what that could produce. So, right now, as we look at our recent backlog in sales, we see a sequential modest improvement in margin up to kind of the high-23%-s to 24% range in Q4. You used the word stabilization. Last quarter, we used that word quite a bit. And so, we -- and we're still seeing that. And so, I think we are kind of settling into a more stable period here in terms of our costs, and demand has been pretty steady as well. So, I think we certainly don't see a trajectory in margin forever upward, but the modest improvement into the coming quarter looks like a pretty sustainable level here in the near-to-medium term.\nMike Murray: A lot of tailwind from limited inventory supply at affordable price points are helpful to margins. And then, interest rates are the biggest risk to margins. Significant increases in interest rates will compress our margins.\nEric Bosshard: Within this, you mentioned a moment ago, buying rates down a point below market has been a silver bullet or something that's been a catalyst for consumers to go ahead and sign a contract. I'm curious if you're seeing that's just the way it's going to be, or if you're seeing consumers becoming more comfortable with the reality in the days of a 3% mortgage are long gone. I guess, what I'm trying to figure out is, can you get away with buying down rates less now? Are you seeing consumers a bit less sensitive? Or is this the medium-term reality that we should expect?\nPaul Romanowski: Yeah. The interest rate buydown is an incentive like many that we use, and we have a lot of different levers that we may pull market-by-market or community-by-community based on the needs of the buyers walking in the door. That has certainly been a hot button today because of the meteoric rise in rates and people's adjustment to that. As that adjusts, it will just ebb and flow with different incentives, whether that's closing costs or price or included features. It's been a good tool for us today. We will adjust to the market as it comes at us.\nJessica Hansen: It was still on a majority of the homes we closed in the third quarter, but it was at a lower percentage than it was in Q2 in terms of the number of buyers utilizing that incentive.\nEric Bosshard: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Ken Zener from Seaport Research Partners. Ken, your line is live.\nKen Zener: Good morning, everybody.\nDavid Auld: Good morning, Ken.\nKen Zener: I want to take -- well, two questions here. One, I just want to kind of focus on capital and cash flow, and the other is going to be about just where we are on kind of the level of business by community versus the past. So, your ability to match EPS to cash flow has been improving, I think, $3 billion of cash flow, and I think about $4 billion in net income, so about 75%. Obviously, multi-family plays into that. But could you specifically talk to the 53% of option lots that you expect to be finished? What limits this from going higher, perhaps, and what kind of factors determine whether you're taking down finished or raw land in those options structures? And just refresh us on what that raw first developed lot cost is so we can understand the inflation inherent in those raw lots.\nJessica Hansen: Sure. I'll start, Ken, and then I'm sure Mike or someone is going to chime in on the true ops piece of it. But in terms of the 53% that we said in our scripted remarks of our option lots that we expect to be purchase-finished, that's just at a point in time. So that's where we've already determined who's going to develop those lots for us, and we know we're going to take them down as a finished lot. That's by no means a ceiling. We're now closing 60%-plus of our houses quarter-to-quarter on a lot purchased from a third-party developer. And so, we -- in the normal course of business, we'll contract with a land seller as D.R. Horton, put the option [on the] (ph) contract and then we'll go find a land developer. So, the 53% is more of a floor than necessarily a ceiling.\nMike Murray: I think you said it very well. We're going to take a piece of dirt and title it, and then, in that process, look to work with a third-party developer in some cases to assign that contract to. They'll acquire the land parcels and then they'll complete the lot development and sell us finished lots that we'll then start constructing homes on over time. So that 53% expected would go up, but we will choose, in some cases, to develop the neighborhood ourselves. In every one of our markets, we have great teams in place that are capable of developing their own lots, as well as negotiating to buy finished lots from third-party developers.\nBill Wheat: And Ken, to circle back to your initial comment about capital and cash flow and percentage of cash flows relative to our earnings, we are seeing a big improvement in that this year, and that's what we're expecting to see this year. I would tell you that, that big move is being driven primarily by the improvement in our cycle times -- by our construction cycle times. We don't have as much capital tied up per home in our homes in inventory, because we're turning those faster. Definitely, our land shift over many years has been a component of that over time. But this year, specifically, it's more about our homes and inventory turnover improving.\nKen Zener: Great. And so, I guess, just a follow-up to that, why would you want to develop land as opposed to, like, other builders or one specifically that is [indiscernible] of that? And then the other question, which I'm still struggling with when I just try to normalize housing is your starts pace or your pace per community is about 4.6 this year. It used to be about 3.6. Why is that the new normal, basically? I mean, I don't want to push down sales pace for no reason. But like, why are we so far above where we used to be as an industry? It's not just you guys. If you could explain that? Thank you.\nPaul Romanowski: Yeah. I think on the lot development question, we have talented teams across our platform. And there are instances where it's important to us in our starts pace is we have to have a lot on the ground. And so, controlling that process and being good at producing that lot is a talent that we're going to retain, and we have to continue to exercise that in order to do so. And some deals just make more sense for us to develop from a timing perspective and/or structure and/or size. And so, we're going to make that decision community-by-community across the platform. In terms of our absorption per community, I just -- I think that you've seen some larger communities that may be a portion of that impacting sales and positioning of those communities to drive more efficient activity, both on the construction and sales side.\nBill Wheat: Yeah, I'm not sure I've got an answer for you for sure, Ken. If you don't know the answer, I'm sure we don't either in terms of why the industry has improved. The only thing I could come up with is, you have seen a shift in this industry to focus more on returns. And as we focused on returns, that really comes down to being more efficient with every asset you have. And so, if you can improve your absorption, improve your turns in each community, your returns on capital are improving. And so, perhaps you're seeing a little bit of that come through in your observation of looking at higher pace, higher absorptions over time across the industry.\nKen Zener: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital. Mike, your line is live.\nMike Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of follow-ups on the rental side. So, there was a pretty well-publicized deal between yourselves and a large SFR company. Within the quarter and the guide, any color you can provide on how much of that deal already closed in 3Q? And whether or not the increase in the guide for the year reflects the full closing of that, or if there's going to be some carryover into fiscal '24?\nJessica Hansen: Sure. Our guide does and will continue to just incorporate the homes that we've closed and our leasing pace and when those projects are available to be sold and marketed. And so, we've sold projects on a one-off basis, but as we continue to scale that business, it's opening up additional interested investors who -- there's institutional money that doesn't necessarily want to buy just one project at a time. They're interested in buying a portfolio of projects. The deal you're talking about was press speculation. We haven't publicly commented on any specifics of that transaction. But when we look at our rental communities, whether we're selling multiple projects to one investor or not, they are all individual real estate transactions. And so, we would continue to point to our disclosures on a unit basis in terms of the number of completed homes we have and rental units in terms of what that forward pace of sales looks like, and we'll continue to do sales of individual projects, and I'm sure we'll continue to do packages of sales going forward.\nMike Dahl: Okay, got it. And I guess a follow-up there, so without the specifics. Given the total units you are now guiding to and the inventory that you've outlined, you will close a significant portion of your existing inventory in 4Q. And so, I fully understand that this is a growth part of your business for the next couple of years. But just circling back to a question, I think, earlier on the call around specifics on '24, should we be thinking that you've kind of pulled forward the timing of when some of that inventory you might have expected to close in terms of closing in '23 versus '24, so maybe it's a little lower in '24, or are you really in a position where even with this increased guide, you can keep growing in '24 off that?\nJessica Hansen: We've generally been talking about our rental platform combined, but in our 10-Q, you can see a breakdown and we do give our unit breakdowns separately. So, '24 is going to be a pretty big growth year from a multi-family perspective and we're going to continue to scale the single family. But as we scale both sides of the business, it could still be choppy quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year, with ultimate overall growth on an annual basis expected.\nMike Dahl: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Alan, your line is live.\nAlan Ratner: Hey, guys. Good morning. So, very impressive progress on the cycle times and the cost front. I'm guessing what we are seeing now is probably somewhat of a lagged effect of the big pull back in starts the industry saw late last year and the negotiating power you had over the trades at that time and, of course, the pull back in lumber. You are not the only ones ramping your start pace now. I think we are hearing similar messages from most of your larger competitors. Maybe some of that is at the expense of the smaller privates, but I think it is clear the industry start pace is going to be accelerating here for the next handful of quarters at least. So, what are your thoughts on the sustainability of the progress you have made on cycle times and costs heading into '24? And more specifically, what are you seeing from your trades? Are they ramping their headcount in anticipation of an accelerating start pace going forward? Are they seeing more capacity out there that would support this type of growth without cost inflation following?\nDavid Auld: Yes, it's something we work on every day. Aggregating market share involves aggregating trade base and materials within those communities. And we've been talking about a consistent start pace when we've been talking about simplifying the process and making it easier for our trades to get to and from the job with the right materials, with a complete understanding of what they're doing. That is allowing us to aggregate these trades. Our goal, our communication is we want to be the builder they want to work for. And we do a lot of things to try to make their job easier and more profitable without coming in and trying to renegotiate price every quarter. So, is it sustainable? Yes. I think that we are going to continue to focus on that. And as time goes on, we'll get better at it, and basically build capacity month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, on a continual basis.\nAlan Ratner: Got it. Appreciate the thoughts there. Second, Jessica, you mentioned earlier that while you're still offering mortgage rate buydowns on the majority of closings, it did tick a little bit lower quarter-over-quarter in terms of the share of closings that had those buydowns. I was curious if you -- a, if you had that specific data you could share with us? But, b, are you seeing any sensitivity to demand in the communities maybe where you are dialing back those buydowns? On one hand, the buydowns are probably putting you guys in such a strong competitive advantage versus the resale market. But on the other hand, with inventory as tight as it is and demand seemingly pretty strong, it would seem like you should have some ability to pull back on those without impacting demand too much. I'm just curious the interplay between that.\nPaul Romanowski: The use of the rate buy downs is about 10% less than it has been as we look over the last few quarters. And that sensitivity is a community by community and buyer by buyer process. We have great sales agents in each of our communities that go through that experience with every buyer that walks in and finding what's important to them is what they do very well. And so, we'll continue, as we mentioned, to utilize that. And certainly that reduction shows some stability in rates. Although they've moved up, they've remained in a similar range. And I think people getting comfortable with their purchasing power has allowed some of the relief of that use and/or them not being as concerned about it as the thing that is important to them in the purchase.\nAlan Ratner: Great. Appreciate the color. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Truman, your line is live.\nTruman Patterson: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for fitting me in. First, this has been touched on a little bit earlier in the call, but just trying to get a big picture overview of the banking environment and what it means for Horton. Has the banking environment currently negatively impacted your developer partners kind of outside of 4 Star, their ability to access capital for future projects? For smaller private builders, are you actually seeing them kind of pull back on spec construction, land deals, et cetera?\nMike Murray: I think with a lot of the third-party developers we work with, we have a long relationship with them. And in a lot of cases, their banking or financing sources are kind of looking through their developer, looking through to the land contract and working with us and they take great comfort in that. And we've been able to continue to sign up new deals over the past quarter that have secured new financing commitments for the third-party developers through the process. Is it as easy as it was or as inexpensive as it was? Certainly not. It is more challenging. I do think that the banking industry is being more selective in who and at what levels they're choosing to support third-party developers. On the private builder side, we've probably seen a little more opportunity to step into some positions and help those builders with some liquidity and opportunities by taking some of their lots or stepping into different positions. So, it has been, if anything, a bit accretive to the business, and we're just here to help.\nTruman Patterson: Perfect. Thank you. And then, you all have discussed previously about rotating to smaller square footage offerings to combat affordability. Any way you can help us think about -- are you seeing consumers actually prefer these smaller square footage homes over the past six months? Or based on the offerings that you have out there, are consumers still kind of preferring the larger square footage homes?\nJessica Hansen: They prefer what they can afford. So, what we generally see is that buyers continue to want as much square footage as they can get, but they're constrained by what they can afford, which is why we continue to start more and more of our smaller floor plans. We did see a slight tick down on a year-over-year basis again by about 2% in the terms of square footage on our homes closed. It was flat sequentially. So, we would expect just continued very gradual moves down in our average square footage today.\nTruman Patterson: All right. Thank you, and good luck in '24.\nJessica Hansen: Thanks, Truman.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America. Rafe, your line is live.\nRafe Jadrosich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned that build cycles have come down 30 days from peak levels and you expect them to continue in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about where they are now versus historical levels? And then, beyond the fourth quarter as you look into next year, how should we think about further potential improvement, like what that could do for your asset turns?\nPaul Romanowski: Yeah, we are -- today down that 30 days puts us at about five-and-a-half months in our current cycle time, which is still slightly above our historical averages. And so, we see a trend towards -- more towards our normalized and consistent cycle times. That's going to depend on labor availability and our ability to continue to aggregate that labor. As you see start space increase across the country, we could certainly see some pressure on that, but feel comfortable in our position and with the trade capacity that we have in labor out in the markets today.\nMike Murray: Our build time of that at five-and-a-half months has come down about a month, and we probably have another month, month-and-a-half to go to get back to where we have been historically when we're operating at a more efficient level. And then, there's probably another 45 days to 60 days after that, what we call, construction completion until we hit the home closing date. So on average, we're looking to get to a 2 or a little better than 2 times turn of inventory units implies that six to slightly less than six months start to closing cycle time.\nRafe Jadrosich: Thank you. That's helpful. So there's still more opportunity. And then, just on the rental profit outlook for the fourth quarter, the guidance is units will be up quite a bit, but you're thinking about rental profits being down. Should we think about gross margins there being lower than kind of core homebuilding longer term? Is there any dynamic that's driving that margin kind of cadence short-term, or is this something we should be thinking about it longer-term?\nBill Wheat: Yeah, it's really a short-term thing, as Mike mentioned earlier, part of it is the mix of the projects that we see coming through and the time in which those homes were constructed was the time when we were seeing higher construction costs as well. So, we really see that as a Q4 event and as we look longer-term from a gross margin perspective and really pre-tax margin perspective, we would expect the rental to still be higher than our homebuilding margins overall. Maybe a little bit of anomaly here in Q4, but not a long-term phenomenon.\nRafe Jadrosich: Great. Very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. That's all the questions we have time for today. I would now like to hand the call back to David Auld for closing remarks.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Paul. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our fourth quarter results in November. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family on producing a solid third quarter. Continue to compete, win every day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference.

            "name": "Mike Murray",
            "content": "Our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 37% to 22,879 homes, and order value increased 26% from the prior year to $8.7 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 18%, flat sequentially and down from 24% in the prior-year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 6% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. The average price of net sales orders in the third quarter was $381,100, up 2% sequentially and down 8% from the prior-year quarter. To adjust to changing market conditions and higher mortgage rates over the past year, we increased our use of incentives and reduced the sizes of our homes to provide better affordability to homebuyers. Although home prices and incentives have begun to stabilize, we expect to continue utilizing a higher level of incentives as compared to last year. Our sales volumes can be significantly affected by changes in mortgage rates and other economic factors. However, we will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share. Bill? Our homebuilding lot position at June 30 consisted of approximately 555,000 lots, of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. 34% of our total owned lots are finished and 53% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital-efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our third quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.2 billion, up 25% from the prior-year quarter and 27% sequentially. Our current quarter investments consisted of $1.2 billion for finished lots, $700 million for land development, and $290 million for land acquisition. Paul? Financial services earned $94 million of pre-tax income in the third quarter on $229 million of revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 41.2%. During the quarter, 99% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 74% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 51% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 723 and an average loan to value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 56% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Bill? Hey, Stephen. So, we expect that the margin on the fourth quarter closings in the rental segment will probably have a lower profit margin, largely on the basis of a mix of projects that are delivering between Q3 and then into Q4. A lot of it's on a cost basis difference between those homes that were built at different times and when they're delivering. What we're seeing today in the closings are lots that were contracted and acquired quite some time ago and coming through. So, we're not seeing a lot of cost pressure coming through. Going forward, along with the lot scarcity, we're expecting to see lot costs coming through in forward margins at a higher level. There has certainly been inflation in land and in lot development costs and in finished lot prices. So, we expect to see that, but that's factored into our guidance and the way we're planning for the business next year. A lot of tailwind from limited inventory supply at affordable price points are helpful to margins. And then, interest rates are the biggest risk to margins. Significant increases in interest rates will compress our margins. I think you said it very well. We're going to take a piece of dirt and title it, and then, in that process, look to work with a third-party developer in some cases to assign that contract to. They'll acquire the land parcels and then they'll complete the lot development and sell us finished lots that we'll then start constructing homes on over time. So that 53% expected would go up, but we will choose, in some cases, to develop the neighborhood ourselves. In every one of our markets, we have great teams in place that are capable of developing their own lots, as well as negotiating to buy finished lots from third-party developers. I think with a lot of the third-party developers we work with, we have a long relationship with them. And in a lot of cases, their banking or financing sources are kind of looking through their developer, looking through to the land contract and working with us and they take great comfort in that. And we've been able to continue to sign up new deals over the past quarter that have secured new financing commitments for the third-party developers through the process. Is it as easy as it was or as inexpensive as it was? Certainly not. It is more challenging. I do think that the banking industry is being more selective in who and at what levels they're choosing to support third-party developers. On the private builder side, we've probably seen a little more opportunity to step into some positions and help those builders with some liquidity and opportunities by taking some of their lots or stepping into different positions. So, it has been, if anything, a bit accretive to the business, and we're just here to help. Our build time of that at five-and-a-half months has come down about a month, and we probably have another month, month-and-a-half to go to get back to where we have been historically when we're operating at a more efficient level. And then, there's probably another 45 days to 60 days after that, what we call, construction completion until we hit the home closing date. So on average, we're looking to get to a 2 or a little better than 2 times turn of inventory units implies that six to slightly less than six months start to closing cycle time."

            "content": "Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 16% to $3.90 per diluted share, compared to $4.67 per share in the prior-year quarter. Net income for the quarter decreased 19% to $1.3 billion on consolidated revenues of $9.7 billion. Our third quarter home sales revenues were $8.7 billion on 22,985 homes closed, compared to $8.3 billion on 21,308 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $378,600, flat sequentially and down 3% from the prior-year quarter. Mike? We started 22,900 homes in the June quarter, up 15% from the March quarter. We ended the quarter with 43,800 homes in inventory, down 22% from a year ago and flat sequentially. 25,000 of our homes at June 30 were unsold, of which 5,700 were completed. For homes we closed in the third quarter, our construction cycle time decreased by over a month from the second quarter, reflecting improvements in the supply chain. We expect to see a further decrease in our cycle time for homes closed in the fourth quarter. We will continue to [ingest] (ph) our homes and inventory and starts pace based on market conditions. Mike? During the quarter, our rental operations generated $162 million of pre-tax income on $667 million of revenues from the sale of 1,754 single-family rental homes and 230 multi-family rental units. Our rental property inventory at June 30 was $3.3 billion, which consisted of $1.9 billion of single-family rental properties and $1.4 billion of multi-family rental properties. Our rental operations are generating significant increases in both revenues and profits this year, as our platform expands across more markets. For the fourth quarter, we expect our rental revenues to be greater than our third quarter and our rental profit margin to be lower than our third quarter. Bill? Yes, Stephen, we have seen, as we talked, about a 30-day reduction in our cycle time and see consistency and improvement as we travel throughout our divisions and seen pretty good balance with our trades and all the supplies that we need to continue with improvement in cycle time. If you look at our starts pace, it did tick up some and stayed pretty consistent with our closings, which is a cadence that we expect to see as we look towards the fourth quarter. Based on our sales pace and the strength of the market, and where we have the lots and the ability to push that up a little bit, we will, but not looking to outpace the market and continue to keep in that cadence and position ourselves for continued growth. And then, in terms of our forward investment level, we're at a total of about $3.3 billion of inventory today. We've seen a significant growth ramp in that over the last two years. We do expect to continue to grow that platform and we will see our inventory levels continue to grow over the next couple of years, but we do expect that growth pace to moderate from what it's been in the last two years. We're very focused on improving our inventory turn and as our construction cycle times have improved, that's facilitating that. You look historically, we typically when we go into a year with our number of homes in inventory, we've been able to turn that 2 times in the following year. The last couple of years has been slower than that, and so we're looking to get back to that more historic inventory turn level as we look to fiscal '24. Yeah. Thanks, John. I think we are seeing more normal seasonality this year in terms of just demand traffic patterns. And so, I think our base expectations would be that orders would show a bit closer to normal seasonality going forward. But to our approach in trying to be as consistent as we can and providing starts pace and a consistent level of inventory, we're still a short supply of inventory out there in the existing home market and in the new home market. We're going to make sure we've got enough homes out there to capture whatever demand there may be. And so, our hope would be, over the longer term, we could see a bit more consistency there. But there still is a natural seasonality and an ebb-and-flow to consumer demand that I think is getting back to a more normal level. Yeah. The rate buydown for us has been an effective incentive and to help us provide, as we've improved our cycle time as well, a certainty of close date and a certainty of home payment. And we have stayed roughly a point below the market, and we'll have to measure that as we move forward depending on where rates move, whether that be up or down. But we have found it to be our -- one of our most effective incentives, and we have been consistent in that execution and we'll continue to explore that as the interest rates move on a go-forward basis. Yeah. The interest rate buydown is an incentive like many that we use, and we have a lot of different levers that we may pull market-by-market or community-by-community based on the needs of the buyers walking in the door. That has certainly been a hot button today because of the meteoric rise in rates and people's adjustment to that. As that adjusts, it will just ebb and flow with different incentives, whether that's closing costs or price or included features. It's been a good tool for us today. We will adjust to the market as it comes at us. Yeah. I think on the lot development question, we have talented teams across our platform. And there are instances where it's important to us in our starts pace is we have to have a lot on the ground. And so, controlling that process and being good at producing that lot is a talent that we're going to retain, and we have to continue to exercise that in order to do so. And some deals just make more sense for us to develop from a timing perspective and/or structure and/or size. And so, we're going to make that decision community-by-community across the platform. In terms of our absorption per community, I just -- I think that you've seen some larger communities that may be a portion of that impacting sales and positioning of those communities to drive more efficient activity, both on the construction and sales side. The use of the rate buy downs is about 10% less than it has been as we look over the last few quarters. And that sensitivity is a community by community and buyer by buyer process. We have great sales agents in each of our communities that go through that experience with every buyer that walks in and finding what's important to them is what they do very well. And so, we'll continue, as we mentioned, to utilize that. And certainly that reduction shows some stability in rates. Although they've moved up, they've remained in a similar range. And I think people getting comfortable with their purchasing power has allowed some of the relief of that use and/or them not being as concerned about it as the thing that is important to them in the purchase. Yeah, we are -- today down that 30 days puts us at about five-and-a-half months in our current cycle time, which is still slightly above our historical averages. And so, we see a trend towards -- more towards our normalized and consistent cycle times. That's going to depend on labor availability and our ability to continue to aggregate that labor. As you see start space increase across the country, we could certainly see some pressure on that, but feel comfortable in our position and with the trade capacity that we have in labor out in the markets today."

I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the third quarter, the D.R. Horton team delivered solid results, highlighted by earnings of $3.90 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income was $1.8 billion on an 11% increase in revenues to $9.7 billion, with a pre-tax profit margin of 18.3%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 31.8%, and our return on equity for the same period was 24.3%. Despite continued high mortgage rates and inflationary pressures, our net sales orders increased 37% from the prior-year quarter, as the supply of both new home and existing homes at affordable price points is limited and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable. We are focused on consolidating market share by supplying more homes to meet homebuyer demand, while maximizing the returns and capital efficiency each of -- in each of our communities. With improvements in both labor capacity and availability of materials, our cycle times are decreasing, positioning us to release homes for sale earlier in the construction cycle. We are pleased that we were able to increase our homebuilding starts to 22,900 homes this quarter, which was supported by a 6% sequential increase in our active selling communities. Our homebuilding operating margins are lower than the record high margins we reported last year due to cost inflation and pricing adjustments and incentives we implemented to address homebuyer affordability challenges caused by higher mortgage rates. However, our margins improved sequentially from the March to June quarter as home prices and incentives have stabilized and some reductions in construction costs are now being realized in our homes closed. We are well-positioned with our experienced operators, diverse product offerings, flexible lot supply, and strong capital and liquidity position to produce and sustain consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company, including returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Paul? In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform to sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth and cash flow, while continuing to aggregate market share. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your continued focus and hard work. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Hey, Steve, as to the 25,000 starts per quarter, we are very focused on increasing -- incrementally increasing starts quarter to quarter to quarter. And we believe that as we continue this process, we will consolidate the labor availability capacity. And with labor and material consolidation, our ability to program out our starts and then continue to build the houses and gain efficiency in that process, it's just an ongoing effort. So, do we have a target out there of we've got to get to this number? No. Our target is market by market, flag by flag, how do we consolidate these markets and increase our market share. And just by the nature of doing that, we're going to get bigger and bigger and bigger. And I'll let Mike reply to the rental question. Thank you. That is a -- going back to the start question, that is a factor in our start pace is making sure that we have the capacity to continue to deliver these houses in a more -- in a faster and more efficient way. It all flows together so that we can actually deliver more houses with fewer homes and inventory quarter-to-quarter, quarter-to-quarter. And I do believe that we're going to have a lot more houses to sell this year, given the shortened cycle time and our ability to give people a date certain to close. So, we were limited in the number homes last year. So, the comparison this quarter to last quarter, a year-ago quarter, is probably going to -- it's going to look better than typical seasonality. I think, yes, yes, and yes. We've been focused for years now on simplifying this business and creating a level of consistency that didn't exist in the '80s, '90s, or early 2000s. And jokingly I call it building a real business, and I believe we have and are doing that. And coming out of the downturn, there was tremendous opportunity to consolidate market. But we didn't have the liquidity or balance sheet to do it. So, as we have grown through this last 15 years, 20 years -- 15 years, I guess, our goal has been to create a company with a balance sheet and the liquidity to take advantage of any disruptions in the market. And since 2019, it just seems like, at least quarterly, you either coming out of it or going into it another disruption. So, it's the power of the platform and we talk a lot about it. I think you're seeing it play out. It's people, it's location, product, it's just trying to simplify the business and create affordability to a level nobody else can achieve. And that's going to consolidate these markets. Carl, we talk about it a lot, seems like in the last couple of years, but it is really hard to put a lot on the ground. It is really hard to build houses. And these private guys, now, they've got to struggle with capital from either private or banks increasing in cost. So, do we have the opportunity to talk to a lot of these guys? Yes, we do. But it's going to take unique opportunities for us to invite them into the family, because we do have a special culture here and we're not going to screw it up trying to force a square peg in a round hole. And I will say, I've had a personal relationship with Nathan Cox for 15 plus years, and he is an example of somebody that absolutely mirrors our culture. He's a super quality guy. He's built a good company, and somebody who we're going to be in business with for a long, long time. Thank you, Carl. Good morning, Ken. Yes, it's something we work on every day. Aggregating market share involves aggregating trade base and materials within those communities. And we've been talking about a consistent start pace when we've been talking about simplifying the process and making it easier for our trades to get to and from the job with the right materials, with a complete understanding of what they're doing. That is allowing us to aggregate these trades. Our goal, our communication is we want to be the builder they want to work for. And we do a lot of things to try to make their job easier and more profitable without coming in and trying to renegotiate price every quarter. So, is it sustainable? Yes. I think that we are going to continue to focus on that. And as time goes on, we'll get better at it, and basically build capacity month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, on a continual basis. Thank you, Paul. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our fourth quarter results in November. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family on producing a solid third quarter. Continue to compete, win every day. Thank you."

            "content": "Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the third quarter was 23.3%, up 170 basis points sequentially from the March quarter. The decrease in our gross margin from March to June reflects a decrease in incentive costs and lower stick-and-brick costs on homes closed during the quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues and lot costs were both flat sequentially, while stick-and-brick cost per square foot decreased 4%. As Mike mentioned, we continue to -- we expect to continue offering a higher level of incentives as compared to 2022. But due to the recent stabilization in home prices and some reductions in both incentives and construction costs, we expect our homebuilding gross margins to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Jessica? Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company, reported total revenues of $369 million for the third quarter on 3,812 lots sold with pre-tax income of $62 million. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at June 30 was 73,000 lots. 57% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $270 million of our finished lots purchased in the third quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had more than $780 million of liquidity at quarter-end, with a net debt to capital ratio of 19.1%. Forestar is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots in the homebuilding industry and to aggregate significant market share over the next few years with its strong balance sheet, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Mike? Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic to support and to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity, which provides us with flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. During the first nine months of the year, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $2.1 billion and our consolidated cash provided by operations was $2.3 billion. At June 30, we had $4.6 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $2.6 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Homebuilding debt at June 30 totaled $2.7 billion, which includes $400 million of senior notes that we redeemed early in July. Our homebuilding leverage was 11.1% at the end of June and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 0.7%. Our consolidated leverage at June 30 was 22%, and consolidated leverage net of cash was 11.2%. At June 30, our stockholders' equity was $21.7 billion, and book value per share was $64.03, up 23% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended June, our return on equity was 24.3%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $85 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in August. We repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock for $343 million during the quarter for a total of 7.7 million shares repurchased fiscal year-to-date for $764 million. Jessica? Right now, as we look at the components of the home across the materials, it is primarily lumber right now. There are some minor moves in both directions, really across the other components of the homes. It's primarily lumber there. I think we are on the front edge of starting to realize some improvement in labor as the homes that we have been starting over the last quarter or two have been at a lower cost than what we had there for a while. But I think we still expect a bit more improvement there with lumber. And then really, the forward cost structure really depends on what the capacity of the industry is and what all builders are doing. So, a bit more improvement there, but as we continue to add scale, which does include our rental platform as well, we definitely have advantages and opportunities to continue to leverage that to drive our cost structure down, especially relative to the rest of the industry. Sure, Mike. As we're looking to fiscal '24, we're -- and we've talked about this before. We always try to position ourselves with our lot position, with our homes and inventory so that we are in a position to deliver close to a double-digit growth, high-single, 10% type growth. And so, that's what we're doing again, is positioning our inventory so that we're in the position there in the market that we see today. I think it's there for us if we can get our lot positions and our homes in inventory ready for that. And with improved cycle times, that helps us improve our inventory turnover. And I think we focus a lot more on our inventory turn, our inventory conversion than we do backlog. Backlog is just really just a factor of when we choose to sign a sales contract on a home. We focus on our starts pace, what homes we have in inventory, and then we adjust when we're going to release those for sale based on when we have confidence that we can deliver that home. So, every home we start, we will close. And if we're turning those faster, then that will improve the inventory turnover and improve -- honestly, improves your visibility to see what our closings are going to be as well. So it's really about our starts pace, our inventory positioning, and then how efficiently can we turn that. Yeah, Eric, it's -- what we have visibility to is basically what's in our backlog and what's been in our recent sales, and then, we certainly have visibility to what our recent cost levels have been. So, we've been seeing the costs on our more recent starts be lower. So, we've got some visibility to what that could produce. So, right now, as we look at our recent backlog in sales, we see a sequential modest improvement in margin up to kind of the high-23%-s to 24% range in Q4. You used the word stabilization. Last quarter, we used that word quite a bit. And so, we -- and we're still seeing that. And so, I think we are kind of settling into a more stable period here in terms of our costs, and demand has been pretty steady as well. So, I think we certainly don't see a trajectory in margin forever upward, but the modest improvement into the coming quarter looks like a pretty sustainable level here in the near-to-medium term. And Ken, to circle back to your initial comment about capital and cash flow and percentage of cash flows relative to our earnings, we are seeing a big improvement in that this year, and that's what we're expecting to see this year. I would tell you that, that big move is being driven primarily by the improvement in our cycle times -- by our construction cycle times. We don't have as much capital tied up per home in our homes in inventory, because we're turning those faster. Definitely, our land shift over many years has been a component of that over time. But this year, specifically, it's more about our homes and inventory turnover improving. Yeah, I'm not sure I've got an answer for you for sure, Ken. If you don't know the answer, I'm sure we don't either in terms of why the industry has improved. The only thing I could come up with is, you have seen a shift in this industry to focus more on returns. And as we focused on returns, that really comes down to being more efficient with every asset you have. And so, if you can improve your absorption, improve your turns in each community, your returns on capital are improving. And so, perhaps you're seeing a little bit of that come through in your observation of looking at higher pace, higher absorptions over time across the industry. Yeah, it's really a short-term thing, as Mike mentioned earlier, part of it is the mix of the projects that we see coming through and the time in which those homes were constructed was the time when we were seeing higher construction costs as well. So, we really see that as a Q4 event and as we look longer-term from a gross margin perspective and really pre-tax margin perspective, we would expect the rental to still be higher than our homebuilding margins overall. Maybe a little bit of anomaly here in Q4, but not a long-term phenomenon."

I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are excited to announce that we recently closed our [1 millionth] home a first for any homebuilder. We are both humbled and proud to have been a part of a million families achieving their dream of home ownership over the past 45 years. For the second quarter, the D.R. Horton team delivered solid results, highlighted by earnings of $2.73 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income was $1.2 billion on $8 billion in revenues with a pre-tax profit margin of 15.6%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended March 31 was 35.1%. And our consolidated return-on-equity for the same period was 27.2%. Spring selling season is off to an encouraging start with our net sales orders increasing 73% sequentially from the first quarter. Despite higher mortgage rates and inflationary pressures, demand improved during the quarter due to normal seasonal factors, coupled with our use of incentives and pricing adjustments to adapt to changing market conditions. Although higher interest rates and economic uncertainty may persist for some time, the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points remains limited and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable. We are well-positioned to navigate changing market conditions with our experienced operators, affordable product offerings, flexible lot supply and great trade and supplier relationships. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility. We will continue to focus on managing our product offerings, incentives, home prices, sales pace and inventory levels to meet the market, consolidate market-share, optimize returns and generate increased operating cash flow. Mike?\nMike Murray: Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 32% to $2.73 per diluted share compared to $4.03 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter decreased 34% to $942 million on consolidated revenues of $8 billion. Our second quarter home sales revenues were $7.4 billion, a 19,664 homes closed compared to $7.5 billion on 19,828 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $378,800, down 2% sequentially and essentially flat with the prior year quarter. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: Our net sales orders in the second quarter decreased 5% to 23,142 homes and order value decreased 11% from the prior year to $8.6 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 18%, up from 16% in the prior year quarter, but down 27% sequentially. Our average number of active selling communities was up 3%, both sequentially and year-over-year. The average sales price of net sales orders in the second quarter was $372,900, down 7% from the prior year quarter and up 1% sequentially. To adjust the change in market conditions and higher mortgage rates, we have continued offering incentives and reducing the prices and sizes of our homes where necessary to provide better affordability to homebuyers and to optimize the returns on our inventory investments. We expect to continue offering a similar level of incentives throughout 2023 and we are seeing indications that our average sales price and incentive levels are beginning to stabilize. Our sales volume in the third quarter and for the rest of the year will depend on the continued strength of the Spring selling season and general market conditions, which can be significantly affected by changes in mortgage rates and other economic factors. We will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the second quarter was 21.6%, down 230 basis points sequentially from the December quarter. The decrease in our gross margin from December to March reflects the impact of higher sales incentives and home price reductions. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were down 1% sequentially. Stick and brick cost per square foot increased 1% and lot costs were up 5%. We are continuing to work with our trade partners and suppliers to reduce our construction costs on new home starts. We are making some limited progress in these efforts, but are also still experiencing some cost increases due to the overall inflationary environment. However, with the benefits of lower lumber costs, the average cost of our homes closed is beginning to stabilize, and we see indications that our home sales gross margin is also starting to stabilize around current levels. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: In the second quarter, our homebuilding SG&A expenses increased by 8% from last year, and homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.3%, up 50 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. We are controlling our SG&A while ensuring our platform adequately supports our business. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: We started 19,900 homes this quarter and ended the quarter with 43,600 homes in inventory, down 27% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. 24,800 of our homes at March 31 were unsold, of which 6,400 were completed. For homes we closed this quarter, our construction cycle time decreased 12 days from the first quarter reflecting our efforts to improve our cycle times and improvements in the supply chain. We will continue to evaluate demand and adjust our homes and inventory and start pace based on current market conditions. Mike?\nMike Murray: Our homebuilding lot position at March 31 consisted of approximately 547,000 lots, of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. 32% of our total owned lots are finished and 53% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. We are actively managing our investments in lots, land and development based on current market conditions. During the quarter, our homebuilding segment incurred $900,000 of inventory impairments and wrote off $13 million of option deposits and due diligence costs related to land and lot purchase contracts. We expect our level of option cost write-offs remain somewhat elevated in fiscal 2023 as we continue to manage our lot portfolio through changing market conditions. Our second quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $1.7 million, down 19% from the prior year quarter and flat sequentially. Our current quarter investments consisted of $980 million for finished lots, $590 million for land development and $150 million for land acquisition. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Financial services pretax income in the second quarter was $86 million on $216 million of revenues with a pretax profit margin of 39.6%. During the second quarter, 99% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 76% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 46% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 723 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. The First-time homebuyers represented 55% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Mike?\nMike Murray: Our rental operations generated $224 million of revenues during the second quarter from the sale of 721 single-family rental homes, earning pretax income of $35 million. Our rental property inventory at March 31 was $3.3 billion, which included approximately $2.1 billion of single-family rental properties and $1.2 billion of multifamily rental properties. We expect our rental operations to generate significant increases in both revenues and profits in fiscal 2023 as our platform matures and expands across more markets. For the third quarter, we expect our rental revenues to be similar to our first and second quarters. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company reported total revenues of $302 million on 2,979 lots sold and pretax income of $36 million for the second quarter. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at March 31 was 76,400 lots. 54% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $220 million of our finished lots purchased in the second quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had more than $650 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 25.2%. Forestar is well positioned to meet changing market conditions with its strong capitalization, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity, which provides us the flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. During the first six months of the year, our cash provided by both our consolidated and homebuilding operations was $1.5 billion. At March 31, we had $4.4 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of $2.4 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. We repaid $300 million of 4.75% senior notes in February at maturity and we have $400 million of senior notes that will mature in August. Our homebuilding leverage was 11.5% at the end of March, and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 1.5%. Our consolidated leverage at March 31 was 22.4%, and consolidated leverage net of cash was 12.3%. At March 31, our stockholders' equity was $20.7 billion, and book value per share was $60.73, up 27% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended March, our return on equity was 27.2%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $85.6 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in May. We repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for $303 million during the quarter for a total of 4.5 million shares repurchased fiscal year-to-date for $421 million. Subsequent to quarter end, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our common stock, replacing our prior authorization. The new authorization has no expiration date. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: As we look forward, we expect current market conditions to continue with uncertainty regarding mortgage rates, the capital markets and general economic conditions that may significantly impact our business. We are providing detailed guidance for the third quarter as is our standard practice. We are also providing incremental guidance for the full year now that we have seen the beginning of the Spring selling season with good homebuyer demand and signs of stabilization in pricing, incentives and cost sense. We currently expect to generate consolidated revenues in our June quarter of $8 billion to $8.5 billion, and homes closed by our humbling operations to be in the range of 20,000 to 21,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be approximately 21% to 22% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter to be in the range of 7.2% to 7.5%. We anticipate a financial services pretax profit margin of around 30%, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24% to 24.5% in the third quarter. We are well positioned to continue aggregating market share in both our homebuilding and rental operations. For the full year, we currently expect to close between 77,000 and 80,000 homes in our homebuilding operations, and between 4,000 and 5,000 homes and units in our rental operations. We expect our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2023 to be in the range of $31.5 billion to $33 billion. We forecast an income tax rate for the year of approximately 24%. We expect to generate increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations and on a consolidated basis in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. We also plan to repurchase shares at a similar dollar amount as last year to reduce our share count with the volume of our repurchases dependent on cash flow, liquidity, market conditions and our investment opportunities. We have $400 million of senior notes that matured during the remainder of the year, which we are positioned to repay from cash. We will continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, our rental operations, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares. David?\nDavid Auld: In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions and continue aggregating market share. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your continued focus and hard work. And a special thank you from Don Horton, our Founder and Executive Chairman, to the countless D.R. Horton employees and trade partners over the past 45 years. We participate in the countless D.R. Horton -- we participated in and contributed to our journey to build, sell and close 1 million homes. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from John Lovallo at UBS.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning, guys and thank you for taking my questions. The first one is, to the extent you can comment on April trends, I mean it sounds like from what we can gather from March checks in April has trended along pretty nicely. And along those same lines, if we think about the third quarter, typical absorption declining, call it, 10% sequentially. Is that a reasonable way as a starting point as we move into the third quarter here? Or how are you thinking about that?\nJessica Hansen: Sure. We continue to be pleased with our sales pace in April. You heard us say stabilize a lot on the call, and we really feel like we've seen signs of that and everything has continued into April as we would like to see. In terms of what our Q3 sales look like versus our Q2 sales, typically, it can go either way. A lot of times, it's dead on within a few houses. So we could be slightly up. We could be slightly down. Sales-wise sequentially, it's going to be dependent though on the continued strength of the Spring, what happens with mortgage rates and anything else, obviously, economics that could drive that. But right now, it feels pretty good.\nJohn Lovallo: Makes sense. And then just given the demand is holding up reasonably well, do you think there could be somewhat of an industry, I don't want to say land grab, but more of a push towards companies going out and trying to buy more land as maybe expectations reset a bit more positively to you ahead looking into 2024?\nMike Murray: I think you can look across the board and see that most builders have a pretty good lot portfolio out in front of them. I know we're over roughly 550,000 lots controlled that were owned. So we feel really good about the positioning we have for handling increased demand as well as if we needed -- if demand moderates, we've got flexibility in that portfolio. We will look to continue to add on to our portfolio where it makes sense on a deal-by-deal market-by-market basis. Haven't seen evidence of a big land grab yet.\nJohn Lovallo: Got it. Thanks very much guys.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Stephen Kim at Evercore ISI.\nStephen Kim: Thanks very much guys. I got to start off with a comment, which is that if you do the high end of your guide for closings this year, effectively, you'll have had pretty stable closings in '21, '22 and '23, which is a pretty remarkable achievement given the volatility in the adverse environment we saw late last year. So congrats to you guys on that. Now regarding the -- I wanted to talk about market share. One of the things that we've seen as -- I see as an emerging trend is that builders such as yourselves are going to be able to gain share, particularly from some of your private guys who are more dependent upon regional and local banks. So I wanted to ask you whether you think that a lot of the strength that you've been seeing recently is -- can be attributed to market share gains, and if so, does that mean that you can continue to see your volumes to rebound without seeing a commensurate rise in overall costs, which was a theme that people were wrestling with over the last few months?\nDavid Auld: Stephen, in markets where we have our largest market share controlled the largest market share. We see much more stability in both cost and demand and deliveries and margin. So it's our expectation as we continue to consolidate markets. There's going to be kind of a new norm and stability of margin and cost structure, to be honest with you. It allows -- as we get more efficient and more efficient in delivering houses, we can hit the affordability requirements and still maintain margin. So why we focus on it, it's not just about the number of houses, but controlling the percentage of the market that gives us more access to trades, materials and a stronger relationship with developers and third-party realtors, which all drive our business.\nStephen Kim: Great. That's encouraging. Appreciate that. Second question relates to what degree you're able to ratchet back incentives looking ahead? I know you sort of talked about a stable environment, and I get that. But I also know that you are probably going to be adjusting what sort of product you put out to market. I would guess that probably has a little bit more of a value orientation. And I'm curious as to whether you anticipate over the medium term that you will be able to ratchet back your incentives as you roll out some more inherently affordable product by design?\nPaul Romanowski: Stephen, as we see stability in the market, it certainly allows us to pull back on incentives and where we have the opportunity, and we have some pricing power. We're taking advantage of that. We aren't seeing a significant change in what we offer in the market. We have some smaller homes that we've been able to put out and where it makes sense, we're taking advantage of that. So we do see an opportunity to continue to peel back on incentives and take advantage of pricing power on a go-forward basis.\nJessica Hansen: And as with everything, we're not directing anything globally nationwide, community by community, market by market, our local operators are making those decisions to maximize returns at the local level.\nStephen Kim: Great. Thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Carl Reichardt at BTIG.\nCarl Reichardt: Hi, everybody. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Last couple of quarters, there's been sort of a mixed bag in terms of geographic performance for builders with the Southeast Texas pretty good and the West weak. I'm curious in one quarter, and I know we're going to see some of this information when you guys put the stuff up on the site. But was there any sort of significant recovery in some of the markets that have been weaker, David, in the first quarter, especially in the West in terms of orders?\nDavid Auld: Carl, it's less, it's about positioning. We like the way we're positioned out there and then driving stability. So consistency, stability, flag count, I'm not sure that we saw significant improvement. But again, it's a part of the overall contributor, so.\nJessica Hansen: Yes. Most of our pickup really was absorption versus community count. Our overall community count was only up 3% sequentially. We saw three of our regions up better than normal seasonality, but call it, still less than 60%. And then we have the Southeast, East and North that were much higher. The North is a lot of new communities, new markets, but the Southeast and the East are just showing the continued strength, particularly in Florida and the Carolinas.\nCarl Reichardt: Okay. Thanks Jess. And then on supply chain, you mentioned -- or sorry, on the cycle times, you mentioned down 12 days. And I'm curious if that was just really all supply chain improvement or, to some extent, sort of mix and moving down to quicker homes to turn? And then are you expecting additional improvement in the back half of the year in that metric?\nMike Murray: Yes. Carl, that was primarily supply chain improvements, finally getting houses through various stages of construction, being better organized and prepared with the labor. And we saw improvement sequentially throughout the quarter, and we're continuing to see improvement in early construction stage movements of homes more recently started. So yes, we expect to see better cycle times as we progress through the year.\nCarl Reichardt: I appreciate it all. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Mike Rehaut at JPMorgan.\nMike Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question, I wanted to get a sense. You mentioned that incentives have stabilized or recently stabilized. And based on our conversations with certain privates, there has been somewhat of an improvement in net pricing throughout the March quarter. I'm curious if you saw that as well? In other words, that net pricing by March end was better than the beginning of the year. And if so, all else equal, with that point, your 3Q gross margin towards the higher end of the range or even a little bit above, if you're expecting stabilization from here on in, particularly in this metric?\nBill Wheat: Yes, Mike, I think the key word we keep using here is stabilization. We've started to see pricing and incentive levels stabilized during the quarter. Naturally, as that stabilization remains in place a bit longer, you are able to tighten things up a bit. And as we've been able to move through the Spring selling season. Community by community, we see strength, we see good turns. We're able to tighten those things up. So that's certainly overall an expectation, but it's community by community. So there are still places where we are seeing pricing still slightly decline, some places where we're seeing it stabilize, some places we're able to start pushing it up a little bit. So on a net basis, as we look forward, we expect our margins to stabilize around current levels. So that's why our guidance range anticipates perhaps slightly below this quarter, perhaps a little above this quarter. And it's too early to know for sure how that will play out over the remainder of the coming quarter.\nMike Rehaut: Okay. I appreciate that, Bill. I guess, secondly, maybe building on another question around ASP, how should we think about directionally ASPs, not just for the back half of this year, but into fiscal '24. Is it something where you feel like at current levels, there's been -- most of the adjustment has been made or I guess more specifically, I'm even thinking about potential product mix changes to continue to address affordability if you wouldn't want to try and drive ASP may be a little bit lower in fiscal '24, just to more fully address perhaps the market or affordability challenges, et cetera?\nBill Wheat: Yes, Mike, I think that's just all part of the mix here, slightly reductions in the size of our homes trying to address the affordability equation. That's an ongoing effort for us. And that's why we leave a little room around current levels there because we were always going to try to be as affordable as we can. But at the same time, if we have a good market and we're able to take advantage of some pricing power, we will do that also community by community. So stabilization is the word for the day and obviously, we don't guide sales prices very far out. And it's largely going to be dependent ultimately on market conditions over the remainder of the year and what happens in the rate environment.\nMike Rehaut: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Matthew Bouley at Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to follow up on Steve's question from earlier around sort of what's happening with credit tightening from regional banks. And of course, the smaller private builders generally leveraging the regional banking system. Are you actually seeing any changes competitively yet from those smaller builders in terms of land acquisition starts? How are you guys sort of reacting to any changing conditions from those builders? Thank you.\nPaul Romanowski: We haven't really seen any significant shift in how they're operating in the market. A lot of builders certainly have come out of the end of this calendar year and had inventory that they may have gone through cancellations. They've been working through that product. Not seeing significant starts on a go-forward basis for most of the smaller privates or regional, and we certainly have picked up a few land positions, a lot of positions here and there, but no significant shift in how they're addressing the market.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. And then secondly, it looks like you started less homes than you sold during the quarter. I think you guys have previously spoken about sort of aligning starts and sales pace. How are you guys thinking about that going forward? Is there any room to kind of push a little harder on starts here going forward given some of these improving demand trends?\nJessica Hansen: Yes. We were in a transition in the last couple of quarters, it was more closely to sales. But really, our focus is tied closings in our search space. And if you look at that, we were kind of neck and neck this quarter. And so with our guide for next quarter and what we're trying to do market by market, community by community to build back our production capabilities, we would expect our starts to increase. The extent to which will be dependent on a lot of different factors, but we do expect our starts to increase next quarter.\nMatthew Bouley: All right. Thanks Jessica. Thanks everyone. Good luck.\nJessica Hansen: Thanks Matt.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Truman Patterson at Wolfe Research.\nTruman Patterson: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First, hoping to get an update on your mortgage business and the overall environment. Are you seeing any distress in the market from mid-tier banks, tightening of mortgage warehouse financing or tightening in consumer credit or lending standards for agency, non-agency loans? We've heard that it's been kind of business as usual, but I wanted to get your thoughts.\nBill Wheat: Yes, obviously, with all the headlines that we've had this quarter, we have been watching that market very closely, having a lot of conversation with our banking relationships, but I would echo what you heard. At the moment, it's still business as usual. But obviously, that's something we'll continue to monitor. We just renewed our mortgage warehouse facility this quarter, and we kept basically the same bank group in place. And so that -- that market is still functioning and working as normal. But obviously, if we see further distress in that market, that's something we'll need to be prepared to adjust to.\nTruman Patterson: Bill, that relates to both D.R. Horton and kind of the broader market, those comments?\nBill Wheat: Yes, absolutely. We all see the same headlines there. And depending on what happens in the rate environment and across the spectrum of banks, so there could be further headlines, obviously. But today, no, we have not seen a significant impact.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Perfect. And then just an update on construction costs outside of lumber. It seems like they've been relatively sticky. And Bill, I think you even mentioned some costs might be increasing a little bit. But could you just give us an update on how you're viewing the magnitude of potential cost savings moving through the year really into 2024? Should we really see improvement outside of lumber? Or are things just pretty stable at this point?\nMike Murray: I think we're seeing a lot of stability. A lot of the increases that we were taking over the past year have stopped. But we're seeing the effects of those increases coming through more recent starts would be at the more stable cost benefiting from the lumber commodity price declines. But we're getting to the point we're starting to anniversary well into some normalized lumber market pricing. So I'm not expecting to see huge changes in our cost inputs, but they certainly have been -- increases have been a little bit sticky.\nTruman Patterson: All right. Thank you, all. And good luck on the upcoming quarter.\nMike Murray: Thanks Truman.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Anthony Pettinari at Citi.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning. Your net order ASP was up, I think, 1% quarter-over-quarter, which is a little bit better than we were expecting. Just wondering if there's any kind of mix effects that you'd call out there, whether regionally or product type kind of given the commentary around incentive stabilizing?\nMike Murray: I think it's pretty much like-for-like. We saw a stabilizing market through the quarter. And in fact, about half of the homes we delivered this quarter were sold in the quarter. And so we feel pretty good about market conditions right now. We've seen good stabilization in pricing and incentive levels and when we see that, we're hitting absorptions in the communities at a community-by-community level, we're looking to adjust incentive levels and pricing.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the full year outlook, does that assume kind of mortgage rates around current levels? And if rates were to moderate a bit, do you have maybe some room to flex up production? Or should we think about that 80,000 to sort of an upper limit of where you could go for the year?\nBill Wheat: I think the range we provided for the year is a realistic range given current conditions and our homes that we currently have an inventory and in production, as we've already stated, we do expect to incrementally increase our starts in the coming quarters. We saw a nice step-up in our starts this quarter and would expect that to incrementally improve from here. But in terms of significant upside to the delivery this year, I think we would say that our current range is a realistic one under all circumstances.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. And the mortgage rate assumptions around the full year guidance or just kind of around where we are or anything you'd call out there?\nBill Wheat: Yes, current conditions. We guide based on current conditions. If things change, that obviously could affect our outlook.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Susan Maklari at Goldman Sachs.\nSusan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning. My first question is, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the rental side of the business? As we've seen the for sale side, get a little better in the quarter. Are you seeing any shift there? And how are you thinking about the outlook the rentals?\nPaul Romanowski: We have seen good pace on our ability to rent up both our apartments and single-family for rent. We have seen stability in rent rates. They've been increasing quite a bit over the prior 12 months, and we've seen stability there. On the purchase side, we still see activity in the market. We have certainly some units that we pushed out and sold consistent this quarter really would last in terms of number of units. And although we have seen the number of buyers back off some and a little bit of tightening in credit in terms of their ability to get to these financed, but we still see pretty solid demand for the communities that we have out to market.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. That's helpful. And then given the outlook and the trajectory demand the way it seems to be coming together. Can you talk a bit about your appetite for land acquisitions? Land spend, I believe you said was about flat sequentially. How are you thinking about that as we go through the next couple of quarters?\nBill Wheat: We're really just continuing to look at replenishing the supply market by market. We've got a good lot position, a good flexible lot position. So we'll continue to incrementally to just replenish it. I don't necessarily expect significant moves 1 way or the other. But as our volume of sales and closings increase, then we'll be -- to be replenishing a little bit more to match that.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. Thank you, and good luck.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Eric Bosshard at Cleveland Research.\nEric Bosshard: Good morning. Two things. First of all, I think the gross margin in the quarter was a bit better than you had targeted. What was different that drove the relative better gross margin performance?\nBill Wheat: I think the main difference was our pricing stabilized at a slightly higher level than we were projecting. We were not seeing signs of stabilization at the end of the Q1. But once we've gotten into the spring, we've been able to see that really start to stabilize. So I think that -- I think we're seeing that stabilization a little sooner or a little earlier than we would have projected a quarter ago.\nMike Murray: We definitely saw a strong start to the spring selling season in the March quarter. And as I mentioned before, half the homes we closed were sold in the quarter. So they benefited from some of the stabilizing and improving price environment. We carried a fair number of completed specs in the quarter.\nEric Bosshard: Okay. And then secondly, in regards to incentives or pricing. I'm curious if you can help with the what the average rate on closings is? I'm just trying to get a sense of where rate buy downs are part of the effort, the magnitude of what that looks like, what the -- I guess, in other words, what the magic number of rates or the bull side that you need to get rates to get consumers comfortable closing on homes?\nJessica Hansen: Yes. So our average general buy down is typically a point on the loan value. So I would say there's been a lot of headlines out there talking about 5.5%. It fluctuates probably a little bit, but 5.5% is relatively reasonable in terms of what a consumer is okay with at this point.\nBill Wheat: Roughly 60%, 65% of our buyers are utilizing that buy down through our mortgage company. And so they're getting that benefit of that point buy down.\nEric Bosshard: And then regarding the trend within that, has there been any change within that? Or is that kind of the bulls out that works? And obviously, the mortgage market moves around, but is that 5.5% the 60 to 65 , has there been any variability in the trend around either of those?\nPaul Romanowski: It's been pretty consistent certainly throughout the quarter, and rates have stayed relatively consistent. And we will fluctuate our rate to the market based on what we see in the overall market rates. So for the last quarter, it's hovered right around that 5.5% and seems to be accepted by our homebuyers.\nEric Bosshard: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Alan Ratner at Zelman & Associates.\nAlan Ratner: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Nice quarter. First question, obviously, you guys are an entry-level builder, but you do have exposure at different price points in segments as well. So I'm curious if you're seeing any notable differences in terms of demand trends across your price points? And similar to that effect, we have heard in recent quarters that -- and I think you guys mentioned this as well that there was a reluctance of buyers to kind of sit in backlog for a long period of time given the volatility in rates and you guys were holding specs off until they were further along in the construction process. Has that changed at all? Are you seeing -- with the stability now are you seeing more willingness to maybe sit in backlog for a longer period of time?\nMike Murray: I think we are seeing some buyers willing to buy earlier in the production process. There's been a little bit of stability in market rates, and they feel good about that. But the better thing for us is we're seeing our cycle times improve. So we're still able to give them sort of a shorter period of time in backlog than they would have had six months or certainly a year ago. And so there's a confidence level that we're able to sell from that helps that buyer quite a bit.\nAlan Ratner: Got it. And on the price point question, any notable differences that move up and active adult recognizing it's a smaller part of your business?\nPaul Romanowski: No, Alan. We really haven't seen market to market a significant difference in terms of levels of demand as we go up and down the price curve, even where we are at the higher end of the price market in any given market, we're still at the value price point for that price. So we're still seeing that demand. And for us, if they've come off of a $700,000 price, that means they may be looking for 6 or 5. And so we are catching those people, I think, as they move down the curve.\nJessica Hansen: And what still hasn't changed is the amount of existing home inventory out there and available. That remains very limited. And so if somebody does want to home at a higher price point or a lower price point, new construction is where they can find it right now.\nDavid Auld: And you also have the trend of migration from high cost state to lower cost states, what seems like a high price point in Florida where our Florida operators is a relatively low price for somebody coming from New York or California.\nAlan Ratner: Understood. If I can squeeze in a follow-up on the rental segment. If I look at the average order price of your SFR homes, it's come down quite significantly. And I'm sure there might be some mix involved there since we're talking about a relatively small number of homes. But is that 25%, 30% decline in per unit price. I think this quarter's average was in the low 300s. Is that representative of what's going on in the market today? Or have the trends mirrored the for-sale market?\nMike Murray: I think we've seen certainly through the fall with the disruption in the capital markets, increases in cap rates for disposition of those properties. But largely what we saw this quarter was a change in mix of geographies of where those homes were being delivered and related rental rates and NOIs on those projects. So still feel good about the overall platform for sure. Very excited about the opportunities that are in front of us with that and excited that the capital markets have been stabilizing a little bit, which is going to help execution for sure, on the disposition of those properties.\nPaul Romanowski: And also expect, on a go-forward basis, to see a little more variability in our rental platform just because we're selling whole communities at a time, and they could be townhomes or smaller homes or geographic location can cause that to move around a little more than our for-sale business.\nBill Wheat: Until the volume and the number of projects closing in the quarter gets up to larger level in a steady state, you're going to see a little bit more lumpiness in the quarter-to-quarter stats there.\nDavid Auld: And I will say it's very difficult to put a lot on the ground had to get a house build, very little inventory out there and a lot of money chasing investment properties. So we think we have high hopes for this product segment.\nAlan Ratner: Appreciate the color. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Rafe Jadrosich at Bank of America.\nRafe Jadrosich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask, how do you think about how your ability to offer rate buy downs impacts demand and sort of a volatile mortgage rate environment? Do you see volatility in weekly traffic and demand as mortgage rates move around? Or is your ability to offer rate buy down to prevent that?\nPaul Romanowski: I think you could certainly see, as rates shift in traffic, you're going to see that change either up or down. But the sales cycle time isn't immediate. And so our agents and our realtor partners do a good job of maintaining those buyer relationships and our ability to offer some stability in and that rate helps us really at the close.\nDavid Auld: And just certainty of payment gives the confidence to the buyer and at a 5.5% rate, we have more qualified buyers than we do at a 6.5% rate. So it opens up ownership to more people if you're able to present that.\nJessica Hansen: Much easier to manage to the interest rate environment when now you're talking about 20 to 50 basis point moves in rates versus what we were experiencing in the back half of last year. I mean it's just not as impactful as what we had to manage through last year.\nRafe Jadrosich: Thank you. And then just following up on an earlier question on how the gross margin came in versus your initial guidance for the quarter. It sounded like the pricing stability was higher than projected. Is it -- did you start to raise prices at all during the quarter and then the gross margin improved throughout the quarter? Or was there a better elasticity where you didn't have to lower prices as much as you anticipated to sell homes that had the current rate?\nBill Wheat: Versus the guidance we gave, it was the latter. We did not have to lower as much as we had been projecting necessarily. But in terms of how we're actually managing community by community that's a mix bag as we got into the spring, and we did, as Mike said, we sold about half our homes that we closed this quarter in the quarter. So as we started hitting our pace, seeing solid demand into the spring, definitely in certain communities, we are starting to push pricing up, carefully, but are pushing it up.\nRafe Jadrosich: Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Buck Horne at Raymond James.\nBuck Horne: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Before we leave the rental segment altogether, I wanted to just maybe drill down a little bit further in terms of breaking apart your expectations for single-family rental versus multifamily for the remainder of the year. You mentioned that there's been some backing up of cap rate expectations, I guess, with higher cost of capital and disruptions in the capital markets. Is that more pronounced on multifamily versus SFR or vice versa? Or kind of -- what are you seeing in terms of buyer expectations for stabilized cap rates in either segment?\nMike Murray: What are we -- other than saying higher than they were a year ago. On a go-forward basis, it does seem to have stabilized. I don't think it has been changing between the multifamily and the single-family rental. The relative gap that's there has not changed. Generally, the multifamily projects underwrite at a slightly lower cap rate. Like-for-like, it's a more established market. It's a more known market, but still very pleased with the performance we're getting from that segment and the disposition opportunities ahead of us over the next several quarters.\nBuck Horne: Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate that. And maybe just kind of hypothetically just thinking ahead here with challenges in the regional banking environment and maybe more capital constraints for -- particularly for smaller and your regional private competition -- homebuilding competition that is, would you think that it's possible that more M&A opportunities might open up either later this year or in the next year if there's just more capital constraints on some of your small private competition out there?\nDavid Auld: Well, we do believe that the capital constraints for the privates and smaller builders is going to be impactful in -- we see opportunities. We evaluate the opportunities and based upon positioning people in market that they have, we'll pursue them or not. But here regardless, it's going to help us aggregate markets, whether it's via acquisition or picking up a lots or just providing more inventory availability than can be done by a private or a small region. So It's an opportunity for us.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Alex Barron at Housing Research Center.\nAlex Barron: Yes. Thank you. I was hoping we could think a big talk -- big picture. At the end of 2020, there was a lot of demand and everybody just took a lot of orders and then suddenly ran into supply chain issues in the following year, as demand is pretty good here at 6%, 6.5% rates. If rates were to go down, say, below 6% or towards 5% in the next year or something, what do you guys think you could do differently this time around to be able to capture and deliver on those homes? Meaning have you guys thought of doing warehousing of materials or hiring crews to some level of the deliveries or some type of vertical integration? Any thoughts around anything you do different to be able to grow and not just kind of keep your deliveries limited?\nDavid Auld: I think there is just a built-in capacity issue in the industry. And even when you think you've got everything solved, then something else happens. I mean the transformers that bring some innovations for life could be a huge issue and getting lots delivered within the next 12 to 15 months. And so you're constantly looking at how are you positioned, where can we pick up incremental capacity, both in trade and in lines, and from a division level push, that is really kind of what we've been focused on, simplifying our operations, consolidating markets, consolidating trade capacity. And how do we improve our logistics of getting materials to communities. But it's just within the entire industry, if we had 100% of the trade material capacity, it would still be constructed. It's very difficult for lots on the ground, very difficult to get house built. And I do think that's why we're gaining market share because we are 100% focused on controlling capacity throughout the supply chain.\nAlex Barron: Okay. And in terms of the land supply, I mean, you guys have shifted materially in the last few years. What percentage of your lots you own versus how many you option? And you obviously acquired Forestar to kind of help in that process but is there anything else that you could do to I guess, grow Forestar or do something to shift your ability to increase that ratio of going to option even more?\nDavid Auld: Well, let's just continue to work. I mean it's day-in, day-out, developing great -- our development partners and then building a trust relationship with them where they know when we bring up a deal or they bring us a deal that there's going to be the highest level of execution from a housing standpoint of anybody in the industry. And it is hard work. It's to build relationships over time and maintain trust through any kind of market. So -- but we're just going to continue to work on it. Try to get a little better next year. That's -- there's no magic wand to make all that happen. It's hard work. It's trust, it's transparency. It's building relationships.\nAlex Barron: All right. Well, best of luck on your road back to 100,000.\nJessica Hansen: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Mike Dahl at RBC Capital Markets.\nMikeDahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow up on the lot side. A couple of comments already on the call, but you note the flexibility in your current portfolio, not necessarily getting too aggressive on offense. Yes, I'm still expecting somewhat elevated option write-offs. I guess I'm wondering, clearly, as the markets improved, probably some deals that you have in your existing book maybe you didn't think they would pencil a quarter or two ago and now they might be. Any way that you could kind of ballpark quantify what deals you think have kind of come back into the underwriting box on what makes sense today versus things you might have thought you would walk from prior?\nMike Murray: We have so many deals under contract and evaluation at any point in time. It would be really hard for us to have any sense of what fell out or was falling out and leading our global operations teams to think this deal doesn't work anymore, and now it might. I can tell you, as David said, anytime we have an opportunity to get finished lots that are increasingly difficult to get produced these days, we are aggressively looking for ways to work with our development partners, landowners to make the deals work and to find ways to bring those lots to market. So it's a constant evaluation process and the transparency and the relationships we've built over 45 years of doing this really help us achieve that.\nMikeDahl: Got it. Okay. And then second question, just on capital allocation. With the buyback based on dollar figure in terms of the guide, obviously, you're moving the stock that doesn't necessarily buy as much as it would have a quarter or two ago. So when we're thinking about incremental capital allocation and the balance sheet and the cash flow expectations, I guess what's -- do you think you'll keep targeting more of that dollar figure? Or should we expect as the year goes on, that you move back to more targeting a certain level of either dilution offset or net share count reduction?\nBill Wheat: Yes. It's always -- obviously, we're looking at both the dollars invested as well as the impact on the share count, and you will never hear me complain about a higher stock price for sure and with respect to our repurchase activity. So -- but end of the day, it's dollars that we're investing. And so we look at our cash flow, we look at our earnings, we look at our liquidity levels, we look at our projections going forward to the extent that our projections are improving and our cash flow prospects are improving versus what we had previously thought then that increases the chance of increasing share repurchase levels. But as of right now, and as we're looking at the rest of the year and our positioning there and our needs for our capital to invest in the business, guiding to around the same level of dollar investment as last year is still where we expect to be, but that's something we'll be constantly reevaluating.\nMikeDahl: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Jay McCanless at Wedbush.\nJay McCanless: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So if my math is right, I think this is the fifth quarter in a row where average selling communities have been up year-over-year. I guess, and I think you talked a little bit about this earlier, David, what are the headwinds remaining to continuing that kind of growth streak? And I'm presuming that the lot count you have right now could support further growth, but maybe just talk about that trajectory?\nDavid Auld: It's going to be market to market, I can tell you. Kind of what Mike said earlier, where we have an opportunity to pick up finished lots on some kind of role or take. We're going to pursue that aggressively. It's consolidating, it's like controlling the lumber yard. If you control the lots, you control the capacity, the ability to meet capacity. So I would anticipate the committed count continue to decline. When it was declining because every time we open community, it sold out immediately, which is a good thing. But the market is normalizing. There's much more stability from the -- are much better ability to kind of look at the market, understand the absorption, set a start pace and kind of drive an efficient production operation. So I guess, loans -- that's a long way to say, yes, I do think you're going to see our community count continue to move on.\nJay McCanless: Okay. Great. It is a high-class problem to have. And I guess the question I have, pre-COVID, could you remind us for the fiscal second and fiscal third quarter historically, what was the percentage of homes that you would sell and close intra-quarter?\nJessica Hansen: That really bounces around quite a bit, and it doesn't really have a whole lot of seasonality. It's just kind of dependent on our inventory position at the time, which is why we were able to sell and close 50% of our homes this quarter, intra-quarter sold and closed at the same quarter, which is very high. A more normalized range would be somewhere between 30% and 40%. So when we think about Q3, it could still be elevated, but we don't necessarily expect to replicate the 50%.\nDavid Auld: Well, our backlog going into this quarter is much better than - much better position. So.\nJessica Hansen: Yes.\nJay McCanless: Okay. Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nDavid Auld: Again, things just feel to be normalizing.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to David Auld for closing remarks.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Holly. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our third quarter results in July. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton team in producing a solid second quarter. Continue to compete and continue to win every day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 32% to $2.73 per diluted share compared to $4.03 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter decreased 34% to $942 million on consolidated revenues of $8 billion. Our second quarter home sales revenues were $7.4 billion, a 19,664 homes closed compared to $7.5 billion on 19,828 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $378,800, down 2% sequentially and essentially flat with the prior year quarter. Paul? Our homebuilding lot position at March 31 consisted of approximately 547,000 lots, of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. 32% of our total owned lots are finished and 53% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. We are actively managing our investments in lots, land and development based on current market conditions. During the quarter, our homebuilding segment incurred $900,000 of inventory impairments and wrote off $13 million of option deposits and due diligence costs related to land and lot purchase contracts. We expect our level of option cost write-offs remain somewhat elevated in fiscal 2023 as we continue to manage our lot portfolio through changing market conditions. Our second quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $1.7 million, down 19% from the prior year quarter and flat sequentially. Our current quarter investments consisted of $980 million for finished lots, $590 million for land development and $150 million for land acquisition. Bill? Our rental operations generated $224 million of revenues during the second quarter from the sale of 721 single-family rental homes, earning pretax income of $35 million. Our rental property inventory at March 31 was $3.3 billion, which included approximately $2.1 billion of single-family rental properties and $1.2 billion of multifamily rental properties. We expect our rental operations to generate significant increases in both revenues and profits in fiscal 2023 as our platform matures and expands across more markets. For the third quarter, we expect our rental revenues to be similar to our first and second quarters. Paul? I think you can look across the board and see that most builders have a pretty good lot portfolio out in front of them. I know we're over roughly 550,000 lots controlled that were owned. So we feel really good about the positioning we have for handling increased demand as well as if we needed -- if demand moderates, we've got flexibility in that portfolio. We will look to continue to add on to our portfolio where it makes sense on a deal-by-deal market-by-market basis. Haven't seen evidence of a big land grab yet. Yes. Carl, that was primarily supply chain improvements, finally getting houses through various stages of construction, being better organized and prepared with the labor. And we saw improvement sequentially throughout the quarter, and we're continuing to see improvement in early construction stage movements of homes more recently started. So yes, we expect to see better cycle times as we progress through the year. I think we're seeing a lot of stability. A lot of the increases that we were taking over the past year have stopped. But we're seeing the effects of those increases coming through more recent starts would be at the more stable cost benefiting from the lumber commodity price declines. But we're getting to the point we're starting to anniversary well into some normalized lumber market pricing. So I'm not expecting to see huge changes in our cost inputs, but they certainly have been -- increases have been a little bit sticky. Thanks Truman. I think it's pretty much like-for-like. We saw a stabilizing market through the quarter. And in fact, about half of the homes we delivered this quarter were sold in the quarter. And so we feel pretty good about market conditions right now. We've seen good stabilization in pricing and incentive levels and when we see that, we're hitting absorptions in the communities at a community-by-community level, we're looking to adjust incentive levels and pricing. We definitely saw a strong start to the spring selling season in the March quarter. And as I mentioned before, half the homes we closed were sold in the quarter. So they benefited from some of the stabilizing and improving price environment. We carried a fair number of completed specs in the quarter. I think we are seeing some buyers willing to buy earlier in the production process. There's been a little bit of stability in market rates, and they feel good about that. But the better thing for us is we're seeing our cycle times improve. So we're still able to give them sort of a shorter period of time in backlog than they would have had six months or certainly a year ago. And so there's a confidence level that we're able to sell from that helps that buyer quite a bit. I think we've seen certainly through the fall with the disruption in the capital markets, increases in cap rates for disposition of those properties. But largely what we saw this quarter was a change in mix of geographies of where those homes were being delivered and related rental rates and NOIs on those projects. So still feel good about the overall platform for sure. Very excited about the opportunities that are in front of us with that and excited that the capital markets have been stabilizing a little bit, which is going to help execution for sure, on the disposition of those properties. What are we -- other than saying higher than they were a year ago. On a go-forward basis, it does seem to have stabilized. I don't think it has been changing between the multifamily and the single-family rental. The relative gap that's there has not changed. Generally, the multifamily projects underwrite at a slightly lower cap rate. Like-for-like, it's a more established market. It's a more known market, but still very pleased with the performance we're getting from that segment and the disposition opportunities ahead of us over the next several quarters. We have so many deals under contract and evaluation at any point in time.

            "content": "Our net sales orders in the second quarter decreased 5% to 23,142 homes and order value decreased 11% from the prior year to $8.6 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 18%, up from 16% in the prior year quarter, but down 27% sequentially. Our average number of active selling communities was up 3%, both sequentially and year-over-year. The average sales price of net sales orders in the second quarter was $372,900, down 7% from the prior year quarter and up 1% sequentially. To adjust the change in market conditions and higher mortgage rates, we have continued offering incentives and reducing the prices and sizes of our homes where necessary to provide better affordability to homebuyers and to optimize the returns on our inventory investments. We expect to continue offering a similar level of incentives throughout 2023 and we are seeing indications that our average sales price and incentive levels are beginning to stabilize. Our sales volume in the third quarter and for the rest of the year will depend on the continued strength of the Spring selling season and general market conditions, which can be significantly affected by changes in mortgage rates and other economic factors. We will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share. Bill? We started 19,900 homes this quarter and ended the quarter with 43,600 homes in inventory, down 27% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. 24,800 of our homes at March 31 were unsold, of which 6,400 were completed. For homes we closed this quarter, our construction cycle time decreased 12 days from the first quarter reflecting our efforts to improve our cycle times and improvements in the supply chain. We will continue to evaluate demand and adjust our homes and inventory and start pace based on current market conditions. Mike? Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company reported total revenues of $302 million on 2,979 lots sold and pretax income of $36 million for the second quarter. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at March 31 was 76,400 lots. 54% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $220 million of our finished lots purchased in the second quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had more than $650 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 25.2%. Forestar is well positioned to meet changing market conditions with its strong capitalization, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Bill? Stephen, as we see stability in the market, it certainly allows us to pull back on incentives and where we have the opportunity, and we have some pricing power. We're taking advantage of that. We aren't seeing a significant change in what we offer in the market. We have some smaller homes that we've been able to put out and where it makes sense, we're taking advantage of that. So we do see an opportunity to continue to peel back on incentives and take advantage of pricing power on a go-forward basis. We haven't really seen any significant shift in how they're operating in the market. A lot of builders certainly have come out of the end of this calendar year and had inventory that they may have gone through cancellations. They've been working through that product. Not seeing significant starts on a go-forward basis for most of the smaller privates or regional, and we certainly have picked up a few land positions, a lot of positions here and there, but no significant shift in how they're addressing the market. We have seen good pace on our ability to rent up both our apartments and single-family for rent. We have seen stability in rent rates. They've been increasing quite a bit over the prior 12 months, and we've seen stability there. On the purchase side, we still see activity in the market. We have certainly some units that we pushed out and sold consistent this quarter really would last in terms of number of units. And although we have seen the number of buyers back off some and a little bit of tightening in credit in terms of their ability to get to these financed, but we still see pretty solid demand for the communities that we have out to market. It's been pretty consistent certainly throughout the quarter, and rates have stayed relatively consistent. And we will fluctuate our rate to the market based on what we see in the overall market rates. So for the last quarter, it's hovered right around that 5.5% and seems to be accepted by our homebuyers. No, Alan. We really haven't seen market to market a significant difference in terms of levels of demand as we go up and down the price curve, even where we are at the higher end of the price market in any given market, we're still at the value price point for that price. So we're still seeing that demand. And for us, if they've come off of a $700,000 price, that means they may be looking for 6 or 5. And so we are catching those people, I think, as they move down the curve. And also expect, on a go-forward basis, to see a little more variability in our rental platform just because we're selling whole communities at a time, and they could be townhomes or smaller homes or geographic location can cause that to move around a little more than our for-sale business. I think you could certainly see, as rates shift in traffic, you're going to see that change either up or down. But the sales cycle time isn't immediate.

            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are excited to announce that we recently closed our [1 millionth] home a first for any homebuilder. We are both humbled and proud to have been a part of a million families achieving their dream of home ownership over the past 45 years. For the second quarter, the D.R. Horton team delivered solid results, highlighted by earnings of $2.73 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income was $1.2 billion on $8 billion in revenues with a pre-tax profit margin of 15.6%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended March 31 was 35.1%. And our consolidated return-on-equity for the same period was 27.2%. Spring selling season is off to an encouraging start with our net sales orders increasing 73% sequentially from the first quarter. Despite higher mortgage rates and inflationary pressures, demand improved during the quarter due to normal seasonal factors, coupled with our use of incentives and pricing adjustments to adapt to changing market conditions. Although higher interest rates and economic uncertainty may persist for some time, the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points remains limited and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable. We are well-positioned to navigate changing market conditions with our experienced operators, affordable product offerings, flexible lot supply and great trade and supplier relationships. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility. We will continue to focus on managing our product offerings, incentives, home prices, sales pace and inventory levels to meet the market, consolidate market-share, optimize returns and generate increased operating cash flow. Mike? In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions and continue aggregating market share. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your continued focus and hard work. And a special thank you from Don Horton, our Founder and Executive Chairman, to the countless D.R. Horton employees and trade partners over the past 45 years. We participate in the countless D.R. Horton -- we participated in and contributed to our journey to build, sell and close 1 million homes. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Stephen, in markets where we have our largest market share controlled the largest market share. We see much more stability in both cost and demand and deliveries and margin. So it's our expectation as we continue to consolidate markets. There's going to be kind of a new norm and stability of margin and cost structure, to be honest with you. It allows -- as we get more efficient and more efficient in delivering houses, we can hit the affordability requirements and still maintain margin. So why we focus on it, it's not just about the number of houses, but controlling the percentage of the market that gives us more access to trades, materials and a stronger relationship with developers and third-party realtors, which all drive our business. Carl, it's less, it's about positioning. We like the way we're positioned out there and then driving stability. So consistency, stability, flag count, I'm not sure that we saw significant improvement. But again, it's a part of the overall contributor, so. And you also have the trend of migration from high cost state to lower cost states, what seems like a high price point in Florida where our Florida operators is a relatively low price for somebody coming from New York or California. And I will say it's very difficult to put a lot on the ground had to get a house build, very little inventory out there and a lot of money chasing investment properties. So we think we have high hopes for this product segment. And just certainty of payment gives the confidence to the buyer and at a 5.5% rate, we have more qualified buyers than we do at a 6.5% rate. So it opens up ownership to more people if you're able to present that. Well, we do believe that the capital constraints for the privates and smaller builders is going to be impactful in -- we see opportunities. We evaluate the opportunities and based upon positioning people in market that they have, we'll pursue them or not. But here regardless, it's going to help us aggregate markets, whether it's via acquisition or picking up a lots or just providing more inventory availability than can be done by a private or a small region. So It's an opportunity for us. I think there is just a built-in capacity issue in the industry. And even when you think you've got everything solved, then something else happens. I mean the transformers that bring some innovations for life could be a huge issue and getting lots delivered within the next 12 to 15 months. And so you're constantly looking at how are you positioned, where can we pick up incremental capacity, both in trade and in lines, and from a division level push, that is really kind of what we've been focused on, simplifying our operations, consolidating markets, consolidating trade capacity. And how do we improve our logistics of getting materials to communities. But it's just within the entire industry, if we had 100% of the trade material capacity, it would still be constructed. It's very difficult for lots on the ground, very difficult to get house built. And I do think that's why we're gaining market share because we are 100% focused on controlling capacity throughout the supply chain. Well, let's just continue to work. I mean it's day-in, day-out, developing great -- our development partners and then building a trust relationship with them where they know when we bring up a deal or they bring us a deal that there's going to be the highest level of execution from a housing standpoint of anybody in the industry. And it is hard work. It's to build relationships over time and maintain trust through any kind of market. So -- but we're just going to continue to work on it. Try to get a little better next year. That's -- there's no magic wand to make all that happen. It's hard work. It's trust, it's transparency. It's building relationships. It's going to be market to market, I can tell you. Kind of what Mike said earlier, where we have an opportunity to pick up finished lots on some kind of role or take. We're going to pursue that aggressively. It's consolidating, it's like controlling the lumber yard. If you control the lots, you control the capacity, the ability to meet capacity. So I would anticipate the committed count continue to decline. When it was declining because every time we open community, it sold out immediately, which is a good thing. But the market is normalizing. There's much more stability from the -- are much better ability to kind of look at the market, understand the absorption, set a start pace and kind of drive an efficient production operation. So I guess, loans -- that's a long way to say, yes, I do think you're going to see our community count continue to move on. Well, our backlog going into this quarter is much better than - much better position. So. Again, things just feel to be normalizing. Thank you, Holly. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our third quarter results in July. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton team in producing a solid second quarter. Continue to compete and continue to win every day."

            "content": "Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the second quarter was 21.6%, down 230 basis points sequentially from the December quarter. The decrease in our gross margin from December to March reflects the impact of higher sales incentives and home price reductions. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were down 1% sequentially. Stick and brick cost per square foot increased 1% and lot costs were up 5%. We are continuing to work with our trade partners and suppliers to reduce our construction costs on new home starts. We are making some limited progress in these efforts, but are also still experiencing some cost increases due to the overall inflationary environment. However, with the benefits of lower lumber costs, the average cost of our homes closed is beginning to stabilize, and we see indications that our home sales gross margin is also starting to stabilize around current levels. Jessica? Financial services pretax income in the second quarter was $86 million on $216 million of revenues with a pretax profit margin of 39.6%. During the second quarter, 99% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 76% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 46% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 723 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. The First-time homebuyers represented 55% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Mike? Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity, which provides us the flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. During the first six months of the year, our cash provided by both our consolidated and homebuilding operations was $1.5 billion. At March 31, we had $4.4 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of $2.4 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. We repaid $300 million of 4.75% senior notes in February at maturity and we have $400 million of senior notes that will mature in August. Our homebuilding leverage was 11.5% at the end of March, and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 1.5%. Our consolidated leverage at March 31 was 22.4%, and consolidated leverage net of cash was 12.3%. At March 31, our stockholders' equity was $20.7 billion, and book value per share was $60.73, up 27% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended March, our return on equity was 27.2%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $85.6 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in May. We repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for $303 million during the quarter for a total of 4.5 million shares repurchased fiscal year-to-date for $421 million. Subsequent to quarter end, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our common stock, replacing our prior authorization. The new authorization has no expiration date. Jessica? Yes, Mike, I think the key word we keep using here is stabilization. We've started to see pricing and incentive levels stabilized during the quarter. Naturally, as that stabilization remains in place a bit longer, you are able to tighten things up a bit. And as we've been able to move through the Spring selling season. Community by community, we see strength, we see good turns. We're able to tighten those things up. So that's certainly overall an expectation, but it's community by community. So there are still places where we are seeing pricing still slightly decline, some places where we're seeing it stabilize, some places we're able to start pushing it up a little bit. So on a net basis, as we look forward, we expect our margins to stabilize around current levels. So that's why our guidance range anticipates perhaps slightly below this quarter, perhaps a little above this quarter. And it's too early to know for sure how that will play out over the remainder of the coming quarter. Yes, Mike, I think that's just all part of the mix here, slightly reductions in the size of our homes trying to address the affordability equation. That's an ongoing effort for us. And that's why we leave a little room around current levels there because we were always going to try to be as affordable as we can. But at the same time, if we have a good market and we're able to take advantage of some pricing power, we will do that also community by community. So stabilization is the word for the day and obviously, we don't guide sales prices very far out. And it's largely going to be dependent ultimately on market conditions over the remainder of the year and what happens in the rate environment. Yes, obviously, with all the headlines that we've had this quarter, we have been watching that market very closely, having a lot of conversation with our banking relationships, but I would echo what you heard. At the moment, it's still business as usual. But obviously, that's something we'll continue to monitor. We just renewed our mortgage warehouse facility this quarter, and we kept basically the same bank group in place. And so that -- that market is still functioning and working as normal. But obviously, if we see further distress in that market, that's something we'll need to be prepared to adjust to. Yes, absolutely. We all see the same headlines there. And depending on what happens in the rate environment and across the spectrum of banks, so there could be further headlines, obviously. But today, no, we have not seen a significant impact. I think the range we provided for the year is a realistic range given current conditions and our homes that we currently have an inventory and in production, as we've already stated, we do expect to incrementally increase our starts in the coming quarters. We saw a nice step-up in our starts this quarter and would expect that to incrementally improve from here. But in terms of significant upside to the delivery this year, I think we would say that our current range is a realistic one under all circumstances. Yes, current conditions. We guide based on current conditions. If things change, that obviously could affect our outlook. We're really just continuing to look at replenishing the supply market by market. We've got a good lot position, a good flexible lot position. So we'll continue to incrementally to just replenish it. I don't necessarily expect significant moves 1 way or the other. But as our volume of sales and closings increase, then we'll be -- to be replenishing a little bit more to match that. I think the main difference was our pricing stabilized at a slightly higher level than we were projecting. We were not seeing signs of stabilization at the end of the Q1. But once we've gotten into the spring, we've been able to see that really start to stabilize. So I think that -- I think we're seeing that stabilization a little sooner or a little earlier than we would have projected a quarter ago. Roughly 60%, 65% of our buyers are utilizing that buy down through our mortgage company. And so they're getting that benefit of that point buy down. Until the volume and the number of projects closing in the quarter gets up to larger level in a steady state, you're going to see a little bit more lumpiness in the quarter-to-quarter stats there. Versus the guidance we gave, it was the latter. We did not have to lower as much as we had been projecting necessarily. But in terms of how we're actually managing community by community that's a mix bag as we got into the spring, and we did, as Mike said, we sold about half our homes that we closed this quarter in the quarter. So as we started hitting our pace, seeing solid demand into the spring, definitely in certain communities, we are starting to push pricing up, carefully, but are pushing it up. Yes. It's always -- obviously, we're looking at both the dollars invested as well as the impact on the share count, and you will never hear me complain about a higher stock price for sure and with respect to our repurchase activity. So -- but end of the day, it's dollars that we're investing. And so we look at our cash flow, we look at our earnings, we look at our liquidity levels, we look at our projections going forward to the extent that our projections are improving and our cash flow prospects are improving versus what we had previously thought then that increases the chance of increasing share repurchase levels. But as of right now, and as we're looking at the rest of the year and our positioning there and our needs for our capital to invest in the business, guiding to around the same level of dollar investment as last year is still where we expect to be, but that's something we'll be constantly reevaluating."

There will be an opportunity to ask questions on today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] During today\u2019s Q&A, we ask that participants limit themselves to one question and one follow-up. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton.\nJessica Hansen: Thank you, Paul, and good morning.

After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered a solid first quarter, highlighted by earnings of $2.76 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income was $1.3 billion, on a 3% increase in revenue with a pre-tax profit margin of 17.5%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31 was 39.5% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 31.5%. Beginning in June 2022 and continuing through today, we have seen a moderation in housing demand due to affordability challenges caused by the significant rise in mortgage rates, coupled with high inflation and general economic uncertainty. Despite these pressures, we still closed over 17,000 homes and sold more than 13,000 homes in what is typically the seasonally slowest quarter of the year. We have seen increased sales activity in the first few weeks of January. While higher mortgage rates and economic uncertainty may persist for some time, the supply of both new and resale homes at a portable price points remains limited, and the demographics supporting housing demand remained favorable. We are well-positioned to navigate the current challenging market conditions with our experienced operators, affordable product offerings, flexible lot supply and great creative supplier relationships. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility. We will continue to focus on turning our inventory and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to meet market, optimize returns, consolidate market share and generate increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations. Mike?\nMike Murray: Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 13% to $2.76 per diluted share compared to $3.17 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter decreased 16% to $958.7 million, on a 3% increase in consolidated revenues to $7.3 billion. Our first quarter home sales revenues were $6.7 billion, on 17,340 homes closed compared to $6.7 billion on 18,396 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $386,900, up 7% from the prior year quarter and down 4% sequentially. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: During the quarter, we continued to sell homes later in the construction cycle to better ensure the certainty of the home close date and mortgage rate for our home buyers with almost no sales occurring prior to start of home construction. Our cancellation rate for the first quarter was 27%, down from 32% sequentially, but still elevated from our typical levels. Our net sales orders in the first quarter decreased 38% to 13,382 homes, and our order value decreased 40% from the prior year to $4.9 million. Our average number of active selling communities increased 4% from the prior year quarter and was down 1% sequentially. The average sales price of net sales orders in the first quarter was $367,900, down 4% from the prior year quarter. We are continuing to offer mortgage interest rate locks and buy-downs and other incentives to drive traffic to our communities, and we are reducing home prices where necessary to optimize the returns on our inventory investments. Our second quarter sales volume will depend on the strength of its spring selling season, and we currently expect significantly higher levels of net sales orders in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter based on historical seasonal trends, current market conditions and our inventory of completed homes available for sale. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the first quarter was 23.9%, down 440 basis points sequentially from the September quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were down 4% sequentially, stick-and-brick cost per square foot increased 2% and lock costs were flat. The decrease in our gross margin from September to December was in line with our expectations and reflects the increased construction costs we incurred during 2022, along with higher sales incentives and home price reductions. We expect both our average sales price and home sales gross margin to decrease further in our second quarter for fiscal 2023. We are continuing to work with our trade partners and suppliers to reduce our construction costs on new home starts. We are making progress in these efforts, but we do not expect to see much benefit from lower costs on homes closed in fiscal 2023. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: In the first quarter, our homebuilding SG&A expenses increased by 6% from last year and homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.8%, up 30 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. We are controlling our SG&A during this market transition while ensuring our platform adequately supports our business. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: We slightly increased our home starts from the last quarter to 13,900 homes and ended the quarter with 43,200 homes in inventory, down 21% from a year-ago and down 7% sequentially. 27,800 of our homes at December 31 were unsold, of which 7,100 were completed. We are focused on improving our housing inventory turnover. With more completed homes not available for sale, we expect our mix of homes sold and closed in the same quarter to increase back towards our normal historical levels. For homes we closed this quarter, our construction cycle time fully increased by a few days compared to fourth quarter, which reflects lingering supply chain issues. However, we are seeing some stabilization in cycle times on homes that we have recently started and we expect the cycle times to improve during fiscal 2023. We will continue to evaluate demand and adjust our homes and inventory and start pace based on current market conditions. Mike?\nMike Murray: Our home building lot position at December 31st consisted of approximately 551,000 lots, of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. Our total homebuilding lot position decreased by 22,000 lots from September to December. 32% of our total owned lots are finished and 53% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. We continually underwrite all of our lot and land purchases based on future expected home prices and cost. We are actively managing our investments in lots, land, and development based on current market conditions. During the quarter, our Homebuilding segment incurred $4.8 million of inventory impairments and wrote off $19.4 million of option deposits and due diligence costs related to land and lot purchase contracts. We expect our level of option cost write-offs remain elevated in fiscal 2023 as we manage our lot portfolio. Our first quarter home building investments in lots, land, and development totaled $1.7 billion, down 21% from the prior year quarter and up 16% sequentially. Our current quarter investments consisted of $900 million for finished lots, $690 million for land development, and $130 million to acquire land. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Financial services pre-tax income in the first quarter was $18.2 million on $137 million of revenues with a pre-tax profit conversion of 13.3%. The lower profitability of our financial services business this quarter was primarily due to lower gains on sales and mortgages, increased competitive conditions, and a lower volume of interest rate lots by homebuyers during the December quarter. We expect our financial services to pre-tax profit margin for fiscal 2023 to be higher than the first quarter, but lower than the full year of fiscal 2022. During the first quarter, 99% from mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed to buyer home building operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 77% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans are accounted for 45% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 7.2 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time home buyers represented 55% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Mike?\nMike Murray: Our rental operations generated $328 million of revenues during the first quarter from the sale of 694 single-family rental homes and 300 multi-family rental units, earning pre-tax income of $110 million. Our rental property inventory at December 31st was $2.9 billion, which included approximately $1.9 billion of single-family rental properties and $1 billion of multi-family rental properties. We expect our rental operations to generate significant increases in both revenues and profits in fiscal 2023 as our platform matures and expands across more markets. For the second quarter, we currently expect no multifamily rental sales and to close fewer single-family rental homes than in the first quarter. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company reported total revenues of $216.7 million on 2,263 lots sold and pre-tax income of $27.9 million for the first quarter. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at December 31st was 82,300 lots. 57% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $190 million of our finished lots purchased in the first quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had more than $580 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 28.7%. Forestar is well-positioned to meet the current challenging market conditions with its strong capitalization, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity to provide a firm foundation for our operated platforms during changes in market conditions and to support our ability to provide consistent returns to our shareholders. During the first three months of the year, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $313.9 million, and our consolidated cash provided by operations was $829.1 million. At December 31st, we had $4 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Our liquidity provides significant flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 12.8% at the end of December, and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 4.4%. Our consolidated leverage at December 31st was 22% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 13.3%. At December 31st, our stockholders' equity was $20.2 billion and book value per share was $58.71, up 33% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended December, our return on equity was 31.5%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $86.1 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in February. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $118.1 million. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: As we look forward, we expect challenging market conditions to persist with continued uncertainty regarding mortgage rates, the capital markets and general economic conditions that may significantly impact our business. We are providing detailed guidance for the second quarter as is our standard practice, but it is still too early to know what housing market conditions will be during the height of the spring selling season, so we are not providing specific guidance for the full year yet. We currently expect to generate consolidated revenues in our March quarter of $6.3 billion to $6.7 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 16,000 to 17,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be approximately 20% to 21% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter to be approximately 8% to 8.3%. We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin of around 20%, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 23.5% to 24% in the second quarter. We are well positioned to aggregate market share in both our homebuilding and rental operations. Our goal remains to generate consolidated revenues in fiscal 2023 or slightly higher than fiscal 2022. However, it is realistic to expect that our full year revenues will decline year-over-year, given the environment and pricing actions we are taking. The low end of our current range of expectations includes consolidated revenues down from fiscal 2022 by a mid-teens percentage, which is unchanged from last quarter. We forecast an income tax rate for the year of approximately 23.5% to 24%. We expect to generate increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations and on a consolidated basis in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. We also plan to repurchase shares at a similar dollar amount as last year to reduce our share count during this year with the volume of our repurchases dependent on cash flow, liquidity, market conditions and our investment opportunities. We have $700 million of senior notes that matured during the remainder of fiscal 2023, which we are currently preparing to repay from cash. We plan to continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, our rental operations, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares. David?\nDavid Auld: In closing, our results and positions reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions and continue aggregating market share. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. We are incredibly well positioned to continue improving our operations in providing homeownership opportunities to more American families. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl, your line is live. You may go ahead.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I just want to ask about inventory, unsold inventory. So about two-thirds of the inventory that you've got now is unsold. I think normally, it's about half when I went back and looked, so I just want to make sure, should we be optimistic because you've got product ready to go for the spring or in the supply chain perhaps is normalizing a little which is allowing you to get that ready or should we be more pessimistic because you haven't necessarily price that inventory to move yet? That's my first question.\nDavid Auld: Well, Carl, as you know, I'm always optimistic. We feel very good about our inventory position. And you know, through the last three, four quarters, we limited sales to better align inventory cost demand and our ability to deliver. We are now positioned more in what I would consider a normalized inventory position and again, feel very good about our position and where we're heading into this quarter.\nMike Murray: Normally coming into the spring selling season, we'd be a little heavier than our normal 50% spec ratio. But feel really good about what we have in front of us right now for demand.\nCarl Reichardt: Okay. And then -- I was looking at the market count now we're about 109 markets and say four years ago, I think you were about 80 or so, that's a lot. And obviously, you all benefited post-COVID by entering a lot of smaller markets that saw a fair amount of demand, post the pandemic. Now that that wave is potentially crested, can you talk about how some of the new, especially, the smaller what I call the tertiary city markets are performing over the course of the last six months? Are they better than some of the major markets less competitors, or is that growth beginning to wane now that we've seen a little more return to office back to the large cities? Thanks, guys.\nPaul Romanowski: Carl, we've seen these newer markets and secondary markets performing well for us due to limited competition in those markets. We certainly saw a strong push to all the secondary markets with a pandemic moving people making them more mobile that we've been happy with the progression in the secondary markets and glad that we entered them.\nDavid Auld: You know, Carl, even before the pandemic, we did very well in the small markets. And ultimately, it comes back to SG&A and control and the ability to deliver houses incrementally add a competitive advantage to what anybody else out there is able to do. So, that - that's been a part of our program and I think you're going to see continue to be a part of our program.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Matthew, your line is live.\nMatthew Bouley: Morning everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. Want to ask about the construction cost environment, I think I heard you say at the top that you were making some progress, but I'm paraphrasing but perhaps not expecting to see as much benefit on the construction cost side on homes close through fiscal 2023? Obviously, some of your peers have sort of quantified, some of the benefits they might already be seeing on the construction cost side. So, just curious if you can parse that out a little bit as you guys sort of aggregate market share as we think about your ability to press on costs here? Thank you.\nMike Murray: We've been really successful working with a lot of our trade partners in lowering our cost. And we've gotten a little bit of tailwind from certainly from the lumber price reductions that have occurred, but it just takes a while for those cost changes on the front end to actually show up in the closing, especially with the more recently prolonged build times. So, it's just a function of the calendar working those new cost structures through the pipeline. So, the deliveries we see in 2023 were largely, first half of the year especially started in fiscal 2022 in a different cost environment.\nJessica Hansen: And typically, lumber prices go up as we move throughout the spring. So although we're seeing a benefit from lumber today, if typical seasonality holds, lumber would actually be a headwind against the cost reductions that we are seeing on those new home starts that Mike just alluded to.\nMatthew Bouley: Okay. Gotcha. Thank you for that color. And then second one, just kind of following up around the pricing environment. As you've seen sort of some of your peers enacted, I guess, different strategies around pricing versus pace here. And perhaps as we get into the spring, we might expect to see some builders on the ground react more aggressively on the pricing side versus -- I would argue you guys have been leading that first, I guess. So as we get into the spring, sort of, what are your expectations or perhaps what are you seeing on the ground right now around your competition and price reductions and would you expect to see another leg lower on the pricing and margin side through all that? Thank you.\nDavid Auld: We have still addressed our incentives with a balance of rate buy-downs, financial incentives, along with adjusting price community by community to drive the returns that we're looking for. As we enter into the spring selling season, we're seeing some seasonality that we're happy with as the market starts to lead and we'll continue to adjust to drive the absorptions by community.\nMatthew Bouley: All right. Thank you very much, and good luck.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from John Lovallo from UBS. John, your line is live.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. The first one is you mentioned the first few weeks of January saw increased activity, can you maybe just elaborate a little bit on that and maybe frame it sequentially or year-over-year? And how were incentives in the first few weeks of January relative to December?\nJessica Hansen: Yeah. So we talked about on the call that we do expect to see normal seasonality in terms of the move from Q1 to Q2 sales. And so what we saw in terms of the increased sales activity in the first few weeks of January was a positive early indicator. It is still too early to ultimately say what's going to happen this spring, but it gave us the confidence to say that we could see normal seasonality, which typically would be about 50% up from Q1 to Q2 in terms of net sales orders. We also did see a slight improvement, it\u2019s only a few weeks, which doesn't make a quarter, but we've seen a slight improvement in our cancellation rate in January as well, which also helps give us the confidence to say an increased level of net sales orders in Q2 versus Q1.\nJohn Lovallo: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe could we talk just about cash flow expectations. It seems like it's going to be pretty robust here. I mean you're buying back stock, paying dividends, paying down $700 million in debt. So maybe just your expectations for cash flow and what the expectation for rental investment might be?\nDavid Auld: Yeah, we still expect increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2023 versus fiscal 2022. We saw our inventory step down slightly this quarter. We will be increasing our start pace as we move into the spring and then adjusting that to what we see in market demand. So we may not continue to see the same pace of cash generation as we did in our first quarter, but we do still expect to see robust cash. And then we're going to continue to take our balanced approach to deploying that first foremost of the homebuilding business next to the rental business. We will still see a substantial increase in our assets in the rental business this year, we're not guiding to a specific growth number there quite yet for fiscal 2023 because we're still evaluating the market and evaluating investments as we move through the year, but we do expect that level of inventory to increase while we see a significant increase in revenues in that business. And then past that, we will continue to pay dividends and continue to repurchase shares. We expect to repurchase shares at a similar dollar volume as last year, which would indicate greater than $1 billion of share repurchases for fiscal 2023. And then finally, on the balance sheet front, while we're very pleased with our leverage level, we do have $700 million of senior notes that mature in fiscal 2023, 300 million in February, 400 million in August. And currently, just given the overall environment and our cash flow expectations, we're preparing to pay those debt to maturities off with from cash. But obviously, we'll evaluate capital markets along the way to determine whether we want to refinance or not. But right now, preparing to pay those from cash.\nJohn Lovallo: Great. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is live.\nStephen Kim: Great. Thanks very much, guys. Lots of good information. I wanted to follow up on, I think, Matt's question regarding the cost negotiations, though. I think last quarter, you had suggested that you could see the benefit starting to certainly from repositioning your product at least to benefit you by your fiscal third quarter I was just wondering whether or not that process is maybe taking a little longer or if that was sort of separate from your comments on the \u2013 the labor and product negotiations. And then in your answer to him, I think you also sort of mentioned or volunteered that you were sort of assuming lumber costs were going to increase. And I just wanted to get a sense, how much of an assumption or -- how much of an increase are you assuming you might see in lumber? Are you sort of just conservatively modeling it might go like halfway back to where it was last year. Just give us a sense for what you're incorporating in your outlook for lumber, knowing that you don't know yet, obviously.\nDavid Auld: Most importantly, we don't know. And we're taking probably a conservative stance in looking at the fact that seasonally in a normal seasonal environment, we do see lumber cost increase through the spring -- and if we do -- are seeing some normalized demand coming back with the spring selling season, seasonality, would expect that to drive lumber prices higher, which would offset some of the efforts we've made on like-for-like cost reductions. We have been able to get new product starts out, new home starts out that are more reflected to today's environment, smaller homes, more affordable homes that should help -- but in terms of a like-for-like cost benefit increase, it's going to take a little while for that product to move through the system in a material way.\nStephen Kim: I didn't hear a number there. I think I was getting ready to write a number down. I didn't hear a number. You want to give us a sense or sort of like how much of the way back just sort of thinking lumber might increase. Yes.\nDavid Auld: We don't have a sense for a number, Steve, I'm sorry. We're not that good at predicting. We're just taking a conservative approach that seasonally lumber tends to go up in the spring. And that's probably going to have an impact on our cost and our deliveries later in the year.\nBill Wheat: It does feel Stephen, like there is some normalcy returning to the market. And so you go back pre-pandemic and you look at what happened \u2013 costs get inflated during the last year, 18 months? Yes. Are we fighting get that back? Yes. our commodity price like lumber may go up, may go down, may stay the same. But are we going to be conservative in our guidance? Absolutely, we are.\nStephen Kim: No complaints here. And I'll say that if lumber goes up because of normalization, I think we'll take it. In regards to your lot count, I noticed that your owned lot count in numbers -- numbers of lots went up a little bit. I think quarter-on-quarter, it had declined, I believe, in the last two quarters preceding that. So, I'm curious, are you -- or at least in the last -- sorry, the last two quarters preceding that, are you -- do you feel like your lot cost -- sorry, your lots owned will increase from here, or do you think we might actually see a further reduction in your actual number of owned lots? Just try to give us a sense for what that number might be, not in year supply but more like in absolute units?\nDavid Auld: Yes, Stephen. We have worked hard for the lot position that we have and the relationships that we've built and with those developer relationships, we're continuing to -- it's still hard to get a lot on the graph. And so our lot count as a percentage of owned and total numbers, we expect to continue to increase -- and some of that will depend on what we see with the spring selling season and through the rest of fiscal 2023. But we don't expect that to go down and we expect to see potentially our owned lot supply as a percent increase marginally through this market.\nJessica Hansen: And as a reference, again, our owned lots finished percentage is only 32%, which is roughly 43,000 lots. So, we're by no means oversupplied from a finished lot perspective, which is what we're trying to continue to position ourselves forward community-by-community.\nStephen Kim: Got you. Thanks so much guys.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan. Mike your line is live.\nMike Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to circle back to your more recent trend and demand comments. Obviously, you mentioned that the first few weeks of January, saw some increased activity and that you could see a typical 50% improvement in orders in 2Q versus 1Q. That would imply if we're to take that just on a straightforward basis an order decline of only roughly 20% down year-over-year. So, I'm curious around if that's kind of -- and I know you haven't given hard guidance or a range. But directionally, if that's how we should be thinking about things? And also to this point around the improvement that you saw in January, I was curious also if you could kind of give any color around trends intra-quarter during the past first quarter, if that improvement in January was a continuation of perhaps a change in trend that you saw during your December quarter?\nJessica Hansen: I would say during the December quarter, as we mentioned on the call, as you know, Mike, is the seasonally slowest quarter of the year. So, we generally don't extrapolate anything that happens in October, November, and December, and we don't generally give a whole lot of monthly color, but we felt like based on current market conditions that warranted talking about the first few weeks of January, and that's what we're pleased with is we've seen what we would typically expect to see as we move through these first few weeks.\nDavid Auld: In terms of the math that you laid out. If we do see that normal seasonality, yes, it still would result in net sales down year-over-year, but up very nicely sequentially.\nMike Rehaut: Right. And secondly, I know there's been a couple of questions around the construction costs and the impact there. I think that's been covered pretty well. Obviously, another big part is the gross margin guidance for the second quarter, and you're expecting further declines. I wanted to also focus though on pricing trends in the market. And if you could give us a sense of on a total basis, how much net pricing has come down from June of last year to today? And how much of that has occurred in the last month or two?\nBill Wheat: In terms of just pricing, really, our net sales orders in the quarter and the average sales price on that is the best indication. Our net sales order price this quarter is around 367,000, I believe. And, of course, we peaked last year, a little over 400,000. So you're already looking at roughly a 10% decline in our net sales orders. And as then we look at our margin guide going forward, we're taking recent pricing into effect. We're hopeful that if we see some normal seasonality and normal demand during the spring that further significant pricing reductions would not be necessary, but we're going to assess that week-to-week and month-to-month as we go through the spring. But our gross margin guide takes into account recent pricing along with the cost trends that we've already been discussing.\nDavid Auld: Just to add, it is very hard to put a lot on the ground. It's very hard to build houses. And the overall market is still undersupplied. So long-term, I think we've got a great outlook what happens in the next quarter. We're going to deal with the market as it comes.\nMike Rehaut: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Truman, your line is live.\nTruman Patterson: Hey good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So first, has the land market started to capitulate at all on takedown pricing with your alls, ASPs down kind of 8% quarter-over-quarter. Are you actually starting to see the land market correct at all with more meaningful price declines, or is it still just too early to tell?\nBill Wheat: I think generally, it's still a little too early Truman. Land is typically one of the stickier parts of the process. And as David and Paul both mentioned earlier in the call, it is increasingly difficult to get a lot entitled and on the ground. And so that is something that has held up pretty well. But anecdotally, there are situations where we're able to make some progress on the land residual with some of our land sellers. But not broad trends yet, for sure.\nTruman Patterson: Okay, okay. Thanks for that. And then you all made a recent acquisition in Arkansas. Could you all just, kind of, walk through the drivers of that purchase? And are you seeing more small privates, their willingness to sell at a relatively attractive valuation pop-up given the market slowdown?\nBill Wheat: Yeah. The acquisition of Riggins in Northwest Arkansas gave us -- not I want to say, an entrance into the market. We were in there with a couple of communities, but gave us a solid position in a market that has remained strong with good employment growth and limited housing supply again to the earlier question of the secondary markets, a solid market that we are happy to be in. It was a good acquisition and tuck-in for us with a well-established community with a great lot of supply. And so gave us immediate inventory and homes in progress, well-respected builder in the market that we're happy to as part of the family. As far as other acquisitions, we continue to look at those -- and where we have tuck-in opportunities similar to this, we had things that we would explore but no broad-based change in how we look at builders and margin.\nTruman Patterson: All right. Thank you all. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Eric, your line is live.\nEric Bosshard: Good morning. Two things. First of all, the 40% reduction in starts, I'm curious if there's -- what the discipline or logic is in what you're not starting if there's buckets of this. You mentioned trying to change the product a bit to fit a price point. But curious if there's something to learn from how you're making those decisions of where you're reducing starts.\nDavid Auld: A lot of our starts decisions are made within the quarter on the basis of what the sales trends are occurring at that point in time. And certainly, through late summer and into the fall, our first quarter, mortgage rates spiking up, cancellations increasing, looking at our current inventory positions neighborhood by neighborhood relative to recent sales paces, certainly led us to slow down our starts. Coming into this fiscal \u2013 this calendar year into the second quarter, seeing some improvement in our cycle time and supply chain issues unsnarling, and we feel like we'll be able to start homes and complete them in a more timely fashion this year. So we did -- we are trying to meter our starts out a little bit to more closely match our sales demand right now.\nBill Wheat: And Eric I think its just \u2013 I think it's just indicative of the entire industry and lessons learned in the last downturn. I mean I do believe that there is a discipline around the industry, and it's not just short-term, chase every market every day. So it's -- we're trying to do a lot in inventory levels with demand. And it ultimately comes back to if you look at the long-term position of the industry, there aren't enough lots for houses for the population and demand that we see taking place over the next three to five years.\nEric Bosshard: Okay. And then related to this, the inventory per community number, it looks like it's up. And I guess the follow-on would be the path forward with starts from here is down 40 a pace you maintain for another quarter and then lift your heads up, or how do you think about the pace of managing the supply path going forward?\nDavid Auld: I think we saw the starts kind of align with our sales pace in the quarter, and I think we're going to look to try to maintain that relationship through this time of the year as we're seeing good sales demand in the early spring selling season, we'll be replacing those homes with new starts to continue having inventory in the shelf available to sell. We are certainly seeing more homes selling later in the construction process, certainty of delivery date, certainty of mortgage rate and payment are big important factors for our buyers. And we're also focusing very heavily on recovering our housing inventory turnover metrics and getting more efficient with those inventory dollars. Got to get our returns back up on our housing inventory.\nJessica Hansen: And so as with everything, our starts are managed community by community, market by market by our local operators to focus on not piling up excess completed homes that have been sitting there for an extended period of time.\nEric Bosshard: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Anthony your line is live.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning. Can you talk about the tenure of buyers who canceled this quarter? Were those contracts that were signed in fiscal 4Q or maybe even earlier? Is there a larger cohort of buyers who may be placed orders in the fall, but are still at risk of cancellation with rates rising? Just wondering if you can give any color around kind of cancellation trends there?\nPaul Romanowski: I think as you've seen, our cancellation trend moderate and cancellation rate moderate, we have younger backlog that have signed contracts more recently. As Mike spoke to, certainty of home close date and mortgage rate is very important. So, as we have cycled through and we're improving our housing inventory turns, I think that's where you're seeing our reduction in cancellation rate.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay, that's helpful. And then just in terms of renegotiating prices for homes in backlog, has that sort of normalized or died down now that rates have stopped rising and to your point, cancellations have come down?\nBill Wheat: Hopefully, with the rate stabilization we've seen -- we'll see stabilization in incentives and pricing environment going forward.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Buck, your line is live.\nBuck Horne: Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. I wonder if I could dive in a little bit more on the incentives that are out there, the tools that you're using out in the field, it sounds like a lot of builders are having some success with a mortgage rate buy-down program. where you're buying down or fixing the mortgage rate below market for sounds like for the life of the loan, it seems to be popular out there. I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on -- are you using mortgage rate buy-downs? How does that mechanically work? And kind of what does that cost you in terms of upfront margin hit or as a percentage of sales?\nDavid Auld: Yes, Buck, we do, as an ordinary course use mortgage rate buy-downs and many of those are for the life of the loan. That's been a program we've had in quite place for quite some time. The costs do vary from time to time, depending on market conditions and timing of when you tie up those positions. But that's something that we try to make sure that we have in the toolbox for our salespeople is to be able to offer an attractive mortgage rates to buyers who come in.\nBuck Horne: Okay. Would you say that that's the most effective sales tool at the moment is a buy-down or are you using some other level of incentives?\nDavid Auld: It's going to vary community-by-community and over time as to what the most attractive incentive is, and we try to put a lot of tools in our division operators' hands to make the best decisions about what's going to motivate and drive their realtor and buyer traffic in their communities and excite our sales agents with a reason to call and a reason to drive some traffic this week. So, it might be a little bit of a pricing adjustment on a few homes. It might be the rate buy-down, some mortgage financing incentives have been very popular, very heavily utilized. And it might be that supply chain is working back out that we're back to a washer-dryer Wednesdays. I mean there's plenty of incentives out there that we're going to use to drive a pace to hit a return we need to hit at every given neighborhood.\nBuck Horne: Okay. Thank you. And one quick separate topic on single-family rentals and the -- it sounds like the guidance quarter-over-quarter is slightly lower in terms of projected sales of single-family rental homes. I'm wondering if that's strategic to hold back the pace of those sales. And just curious what the demand is like in the marketplace for and/or the pricing for stabilized SFR homes these days?\nDavid Auld: It's just timing of projects and when they'll be ready -- completed and ready and through a sale process. We'll just have fewer this quarter ready to close than we had this past quarter.\nMike Murray: The first quarter benefited from a few projects that were lined up to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 had some storm impact and delayed some timing of a few closings there. So that 1Q number was probably a little higher than the original production sales schedule is set up for.\nDavid Auld: The business model is still complete lease-up market and so.\nJessica Hansen: And you're starting to see some level of closings each and every quarter, but it is still choppy here in the earlier stages, and we would expect that to become more consistent over time as we get further along with the lots and the houses we have under construction.\nBuck Horne: Awesome. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Alan, your line is live.\nAlan Ratner: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I was hoping maybe you could just help me a little bit reconciling the closings results versus the orders. The closings for this quarter came in well above your guidance. The orders were a bit lighter versus what you signaled in mid-November. And I thought I heard you say that cycle times have been relatively stable, maybe even ticked up a little bit. So how did you drive the upside to closings without stronger order activity? Was it just that much of a greater mix of completed sales versus homes that were a month or two out from completion than you were anticipating? And I'm sure that ties into the 2Q guidance as well with your delivery guidance above your beginning backlog. So I'm just maybe looking for a little bit more color to understand what's going on there?\nDavid Auld: Yeah. As we see marginal improvement in our inventory turns and home construction times, you're starting to see and you see that in our numbers, a larger percentage of our inventory homes on the completed side, which allows us to meet the market, which quite frankly is available to us today, which is shorter-term close. And so we're seeing more homes sell and close in the quarter, getting back more towards historical norms, and we expect to see that on a go-forward basis with the maturity of the home inventory that we have.\nAlan Ratner: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Second question, kind of, related, but tying in maybe the margin conversation as well. So when you look at your 7,000 completed specs, are you able to provide a little bit more detail on how many of those are maybe less than 30 days completed? What's more than 30? And how is your pricing strategy differ on completed specs as it hits certain threshold? Is there a level or a point where you get more aggressive on price adjustments, or do you just look at it more holistically?\nDavid Auld: So generally, we talk about a completed spec, we have a pretty aggressive definition of what's completed, it's when it gets into the final flooring stage. So typically, from a home hitting that completion milestone for us, normal conditions, it's probably going to take between two weeks to four weeks for that home actually to be moving ready and more likely to the four-week side of that. So if we look at how many houses we have out there that are aging in the buckets, we have about 190 houses that have been passed our completion date by more than six months or more. So we still feel very comfortable about the freshness of that spec inventory, and this is the exact right time of the year to have that inventory, especially with the backdrop of very low existing home sale inventory available in the marketplace.\nBill Wheat: And that's something we manage very closely. Obviously, we've been building specs for a very long time. We have a lot of discipline around that. And so we do watch those completed specs as they start to age. And they get longer if they get longer than 90 days, then yes, we will start to step up the efforts to ensure that we move them. But right now, we still have a very fresh \u2013 fresh batch of completed specs out there for springs selling season.\nAlan Ratner: Great. Appreciate that. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Mike, your line is live.\nMike Dahl: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So the first one, just to follow up on the margin discussion. I understand there's not a lot of forward guidance you're going to get beyond this next quarter and a level of uncertainty. I'm wondering just as you see it today, if you look at your current orders, as you look at what you're expecting to sell in the quarter versus kind of the timing of some backlog still coming through in that gross margin that will be reported in fiscal 2Q. How should we be thinking about the likely cadence of margin beyond 2Q? Is it still barring some quick improvement in the market, going to be lower as you cycle off your backlog and into the recent sales as you get into fiscal 3Q, or any color on that?\nBill Wheat: Mike, we're only guiding to Q2 margin. And the reason we're only guiding to Q2 margin is we don't know what margins or what the environment will be beyond Q2. The spring selling season, obviously, we've got some early encouraging signs but we don't know what their conditions will be at the height of the spring selling season. So we have visibility to where our margins and our sales and our backlog and our pricing and our costs are today heading into the quarter but even Q2 had some level of uncertainty to it. We would expect to sell and close 40% of our closings in the same quarter in the coming quarters. So while we believe that there's some possibility of some stability in the market with mortgage rates stable that could change this afternoon. And so right now, we're giving you what we get -- what we have. So our guidance for margins of 20% to 21% is what we can see today for Q2. There is some risk, both upside and downside there. I would say it's possible we could beat that range. But it's certainly possible that we might not. But past Q2, we simply don't have visibility right now.\nJessica Hansen: We're going to continue to meet the market and do what we need to do to maximize returns community by community.\nMike Dahl: Okay. Fair enough. And then my second question, there's been a lot in the press around Arizona, in particular, tightening up on some of the water rights and kind of permitting or lack of issuing permits in certain parts of the Phoenix, Metro area given some of the requirements around water usage. You guys obviously had your Vidler acquisition last year. I think they do have some projects in Arizona. Can you give us a sense of if the counties or municipalities are just outright refusing to issue permits to certain areas, does your \u2013 does your ownership of Vidler and the projects in those regions exempt you from that? Are you able to still get permits for your planned projects, or any color on what you're seeing there would be, I think, interesting in light of some of the press that's been out there?\nDavid Auld: Well, yes, I think there has been a lot in the press on water and water is and will continue to be a headwind throughout the West, not just in Arizona. And certainly, our acquisition and integration of Vidler has helped our positioning and that's really some benefit to the short-term, but mostly a long-term strategic decision on our part, knowing that we're going to head these -- facing these headwinds for the foreseeable future. I don't think there's been a significant change on a local basis. It's still difficult to get lots on the ground to get entitlements through the process and to get those permits. It has been for a while, and that continues. So, we feel good about our position -- the lot positions we have in the Phoenix market and we've got a great team on board there that continues to navigate through that environment.\nMike Dahl: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jay McCanless from Wedbush. Jay your line is live.\nJay McCanless: Hey, good morning everyone. So, Bill going back to what you talked about looking to close 40 -- or so and closed 40% of the 2Q closings. I guess, how in, say, pre-COVID times, what would that percentage have been in normal Q2?\nJessica Hansen: Sure, Jay. Our typical percentage, we're in just pretty consistently up until the last year or two in the 35% to 40% range. A quarter ago, we were in the high teens. A year ago, it was even lower than that. And this quarter, we were roughly 34%. So, when we talk about reverting to normal, we started to see that reversion in the first quarter, but we expect that to continue to tick up. So, whether it's actually 40% or closer to the 35%, 36%, we don't know. But typically, 35% to 40% would be a pretty consistent range for us.\nJay McCanless: Okay. And then the second question I had, assuming you pay down the $1 billion in debt like you've talked about. Any idea of what benefit that might be to gross margin since it's going to be less amortized interest or interest being amortized?\nBill Wheat: Yes, Jay, we have $700 million of homebuilding notes that mature this year and right now we plan to do to pay those off with cash. That's out of just under $3 billion of homebuilding debt. So, roughly 25% of the balance would be paid down that if we do not replace that debt, that would reduce our interest carry in time. That benefit would really primarily be probably noticed in fiscal 2024 and beyond because it takes time for the interest to be capitalized and move their inventory. But it would take our interest carry down probably 20, 30 basis points as a percentage of margin over time -- longer term benefit.\nJay McCanless: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nBill Wheat: Thanks Jay.\nOperator: Thank you. And in the interest of time today, the last question will be coming from Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America. Rafe, your line is live.\nRafe Jadrosich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask on the rental side. What are you seeing in terms of demand? And margins have been really strong last year and obviously this quarter. Just do you anticipate any type of normalization going forward, or do you think you'll have to hold those properties longer if demand comes down?\nDavid Auld: I think we're still seeing demand for the properties. I think the pricing and the margins we realized on our early project sales benefited from construction and lower construction cost environments coupled with a very attractive rate environment when we sold those and that continued to some degree into our first quarter deliveries, we would expect to see some kind of a more normalized reversion to demand to a mean. And I think we'll see our margins come back in line to be closer to slightly above on what we're seeing on for sale side, the traditional core sales side. But our business model is to develop the communities and sell them into the marketplace. That's what we do best, finding the land, building the homes and bringing people to those communities is what we've been very successful with so far. So still learning, still going to get better, but we do like that business.\nRafe Jadrosich: And then just one more on the -- in terms of the improvement in demand that you're seeing in the quarter and quarter outlook for orders in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. Can you talk about what you think is driving the stronger demand? Is it the fact that mortgage rates have come down a little bit? Is there anything happening with consumer confidence what's giving you that confidence in supporting the view that we're going to get back to normal seasonality after what's been a very tough housing market at the end of 2022?\nDavid Auld: I do think the credit markets have stabilized somewhat, consumer confidence improved a little bit. Job growth continues to be very good. So overall, if you look at product demand at just a generalized economy becoming less bad, very good signs for housing. And we monitor our sales; we monitor cancellations week to week to week to week. And so when we see that trend returning to more of a normalized market, it's hard not to be optimistic that we're going to good spring. And that's the way we're positioned and we'll get up every day and respond to what happens out there in the field.\nJessica Hansen: Yeah, specific to Horton, those are other industry reasons, right? Specific to Horton, our inventory position puts us in a more confident place to be able to say we're going to see that pick up with the level of completed homes we have and the stage of construction, the homes behind those are at, because what we're seeing the most success in today is buyers who do want a home quickly because they can get that certainty of not only close date, but most importantly, interest rate. And so that is the majority of our buyers today, and that's why we feel very confident and are very happy with our inventory position right now.\nRafe Jadrosich: Great. I appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to hand the call off to David Auld for some closing remarks.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Paul. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today, and look forward to speaking with you again to share our second quarter results in April. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton team. We're producing a solid first quarter while navigating changing market conditions, go compete and continue to win every day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

Net income for the quarter decreased 16% to $958.7 million, on a 3% increase in consolidated revenues to $7.3 billion. Our first quarter home sales revenues were $6.7 billion, on 17,340 homes closed compared to $6.7 billion on 18,396 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $386,900, up 7% from the prior year quarter and down 4% sequentially. Paul? Our home building lot position at December 31st consisted of approximately 551,000 lots, of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. Our total homebuilding lot position decreased by 22,000 lots from September to December. 32% of our total owned lots are finished and 53% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. We continually underwrite all of our lot and land purchases based on future expected home prices and cost. We are actively managing our investments in lots, land, and development based on current market conditions. During the quarter, our Homebuilding segment incurred $4.8 million of inventory impairments and wrote off $19.4 million of option deposits and due diligence costs related to land and lot purchase contracts. We expect our level of option cost write-offs remain elevated in fiscal 2023 as we manage our lot portfolio. Our first quarter home building investments in lots, land, and development totaled $1.7 billion, down 21% from the prior year quarter and up 16% sequentially. Our current quarter investments consisted of $900 million for finished lots, $690 million for land development, and $130 million to acquire land. Bill? Our rental operations generated $328 million of revenues during the first quarter from the sale of 694 single-family rental homes and 300 multi-family rental units, earning pre-tax income of $110 million. Our rental property inventory at December 31st was $2.9 billion, which included approximately $1.9 billion of single-family rental properties and $1 billion of multi-family rental properties. We expect our rental operations to generate significant increases in both revenues and profits in fiscal 2023 as our platform matures and expands across more markets. For the second quarter, we currently expect no multifamily rental sales and to close fewer single-family rental homes than in the first quarter. Paul? Normally coming into the spring selling season, we'd be a little heavier than our normal 50% spec ratio. But feel really good about what we have in front of us right now for demand. We've been really successful working with a lot of our trade partners in lowering our cost. And we've gotten a little bit of tailwind from certainly from the lumber price reductions that have occurred, but it just takes a while for those cost changes on the front end to actually show up in the closing, especially with the more recently prolonged build times. So, it's just a function of the calendar working those new cost structures through the pipeline. So, the deliveries we see in 2023 were largely, first half of the year especially started in fiscal 2022 in a different cost environment. The first quarter benefited from a few projects that were lined up to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 had some storm impact and delayed some timing of a few closings there. So that 1Q number was probably a little higher than the original production sales schedule is set up for."

            "content": "During the quarter, we continued to sell homes later in the construction cycle to better ensure the certainty of the home close date and mortgage rate for our home buyers with almost no sales occurring prior to start of home construction. Our cancellation rate for the first quarter was 27%, down from 32% sequentially, but still elevated from our typical levels. Our net sales orders in the first quarter decreased 38% to 13,382 homes, and our order value decreased 40% from the prior year to $4.9 million. Our average number of active selling communities increased 4% from the prior year quarter and was down 1% sequentially. The average sales price of net sales orders in the first quarter was $367,900, down 4% from the prior year quarter. We are continuing to offer mortgage interest rate locks and buy-downs and other incentives to drive traffic to our communities, and we are reducing home prices where necessary to optimize the returns on our inventory investments. Our second quarter sales volume will depend on the strength of its spring selling season, and we currently expect significantly higher levels of net sales orders in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter based on historical seasonal trends, current market conditions and our inventory of completed homes available for sale. Bill? We slightly increased our home starts from the last quarter to 13,900 homes and ended the quarter with 43,200 homes in inventory, down 21% from a year-ago and down 7% sequentially. 27,800 of our homes at December 31 were unsold, of which 7,100 were completed. We are focused on improving our housing inventory turnover. With more completed homes not available for sale, we expect our mix of homes sold and closed in the same quarter to increase back towards our normal historical levels. For homes we closed this quarter, our construction cycle time fully increased by a few days compared to fourth quarter, which reflects lingering supply chain issues. However, we are seeing some stabilization in cycle times on homes that we have recently started and we expect the cycle times to improve during fiscal 2023. We will continue to evaluate demand and adjust our homes and inventory and start pace based on current market conditions. Mike? Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company reported total revenues of $216.7 million on 2,263 lots sold and pre-tax income of $27.9 million for the first quarter. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at December 31st was 82,300 lots. 57% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $190 million of our finished lots purchased in the first quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had more than $580 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 28.7%. Forestar is well-positioned to meet the current challenging market conditions with its strong capitalization, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Bill? Carl, we've seen these newer markets and secondary markets performing well for us due to limited competition in those markets. We certainly saw a strong push to all the secondary markets with a pandemic moving people making them more mobile that we've been happy with the progression in the secondary markets and glad that we entered them. I think as you've seen, our cancellation trend moderate and cancellation rate moderate, we have younger backlog that have signed contracts more recently. As Mike spoke to, certainty of home close date and mortgage rate is very important. So, as we have cycled through and we're improving our housing inventory turns, I think that's where you're seeing our reduction in cancellation rate."

            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered a solid first quarter, highlighted by earnings of $2.76 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income was $1.3 billion, on a 3% increase in revenue with a pre-tax profit margin of 17.5%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31 was 39.5% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 31.5%. Beginning in June 2022 and continuing through today, we have seen a moderation in housing demand due to affordability challenges caused by the significant rise in mortgage rates, coupled with high inflation and general economic uncertainty. Despite these pressures, we still closed over 17,000 homes and sold more than 13,000 homes in what is typically the seasonally slowest quarter of the year. We have seen increased sales activity in the first few weeks of January. While higher mortgage rates and economic uncertainty may persist for some time, the supply of both new and resale homes at a portable price points remains limited, and the demographics supporting housing demand remained favorable. We are well-positioned to navigate the current challenging market conditions with our experienced operators, affordable product offerings, flexible lot supply and great creative supplier relationships. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility. We will continue to focus on turning our inventory and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to meet market, optimize returns, consolidate market share and generate increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations. Mike? In closing, our results and positions reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions and continue aggregating market share. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. We are incredibly well positioned to continue improving our operations in providing homeownership opportunities to more American families. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Well, Carl, as you know, I'm always optimistic. We feel very good about our inventory position. And you know, through the last three, four quarters, we limited sales to better align inventory cost demand and our ability to deliver. We are now positioned more in what I would consider a normalized inventory position and again, feel very good about our position and where we're heading into this quarter. You know, Carl, even before the pandemic, we did very well in the small markets. And ultimately, it comes back to SG&A and control and the ability to deliver houses incrementally add a competitive advantage to what anybody else out there is able to do. So, that - that's been a part of our program and I think you're going to see continue to be a part of our program. We have still addressed our incentives with a balance of rate buy-downs, financial incentives, along with adjusting price community by community to drive the returns that we're looking for. As we enter into the spring selling season, we're seeing some seasonality that we're happy with as the market starts to lead and we'll continue to adjust to drive the absorptions by community. Yeah, we still expect increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2023 versus fiscal 2022. We saw our inventory step down slightly this quarter. We will be increasing our start pace as we move into the spring and then adjusting that to what we see in market demand. So we may not continue to see the same pace of cash generation as we did in our first quarter, but we do still expect to see robust cash. And then we're going to continue to take our balanced approach to deploying that first foremost of the homebuilding business next to the rental business. We will still see a substantial increase in our assets in the rental business this year, we're not guiding to a specific growth number there quite yet for fiscal 2023 because we're still evaluating the market and evaluating investments as we move through the year, but we do expect that level of inventory to increase while we see a significant increase in revenues in that business. And then past that, we will continue to pay dividends and continue to repurchase shares. We expect to repurchase shares at a similar dollar volume as last year, which would indicate greater than $1 billion of share repurchases for fiscal 2023. And then finally, on the balance sheet front, while we're very pleased with our leverage level, we do have $700 million of senior notes that mature in fiscal 2023, 300 million in February, 400 million in August. And currently, just given the overall environment and our cash flow expectations, we're preparing to pay those debt to maturities off with from cash. But obviously, we'll evaluate capital markets along the way to determine whether we want to refinance or not. But right now, preparing to pay those from cash. Most importantly, we don't know. And we're taking probably a conservative stance in looking at the fact that seasonally in a normal seasonal environment, we do see lumber cost increase through the spring -- and if we do -- are seeing some normalized demand coming back with the spring selling season, seasonality, would expect that to drive lumber prices higher, which would offset some of the efforts we've made on like-for-like cost reductions. We have been able to get new product starts out, new home starts out that are more reflected to today's environment, smaller homes, more affordable homes that should help -- but in terms of a like-for-like cost benefit increase, it's going to take a little while for that product to move through the system in a material way. We don't have a sense for a number, Steve, I'm sorry. We're not that good at predicting. We're just taking a conservative approach that seasonally lumber tends to go up in the spring. And that's probably going to have an impact on our cost and our deliveries later in the year. Yes, Stephen. We have worked hard for the lot position that we have and the relationships that we've built and with those developer relationships, we're continuing to -- it's still hard to get a lot on the graph. And so our lot count as a percentage of owned and total numbers, we expect to continue to increase -- and some of that will depend on what we see with the spring selling season and through the rest of fiscal 2023. But we don't expect that to go down and we expect to see potentially our owned lot supply as a percent increase marginally through this market. In terms of the math that you laid out. If we do see that normal seasonality, yes, it still would result in net sales down year-over-year, but up very nicely sequentially. Just to add, it is very hard to put a lot on the ground. It's very hard to build houses. And the overall market is still undersupplied. So long-term, I think we've got a great outlook what happens in the next quarter. We're going to deal with the market as it comes. A lot of our starts decisions are made within the quarter on the basis of what the sales trends are occurring at that point in time. And certainly, through late summer and into the fall, our first quarter, mortgage rates spiking up, cancellations increasing, looking at our current inventory positions neighborhood by neighborhood relative to recent sales paces, certainly led us to slow down our starts. Coming into this fiscal \u2013 this calendar year into the second quarter, seeing some improvement in our cycle time and supply chain issues unsnarling, and we feel like we'll be able to start homes and complete them in a more timely fashion this year. So we did -- we are trying to meter our starts out a little bit to more closely match our sales demand right now. I think we saw the starts kind of align with our sales pace in the quarter, and I think we're going to look to try to maintain that relationship through this time of the year as we're seeing good sales demand in the early spring selling season, we'll be replacing those homes with new starts to continue having inventory in the shelf available to sell. We are certainly seeing more homes selling later in the construction process, certainty of delivery date, certainty of mortgage rate and payment are big important factors for our buyers. And we're also focusing very heavily on recovering our housing inventory turnover metrics and getting more efficient with those inventory dollars. Got to get our returns back up on our housing inventory. Yes, Buck, we do, as an ordinary course use mortgage rate buy-downs and many of those are for the life of the loan. That's been a program we've had in quite place for quite some time. The costs do vary from time to time, depending on market conditions and timing of when you tie up those positions. But that's something that we try to make sure that we have in the toolbox for our salespeople is to be able to offer an attractive mortgage rates to buyers who come in. It's going to vary community-by-community and over time as to what the most attractive incentive is, and we try to put a lot of tools in our division operators' hands to make the best decisions about what's going to motivate and drive their realtor and buyer traffic in their communities and excite our sales agents with a reason to call and a reason to drive some traffic this week. So, it might be a little bit of a pricing adjustment on a few homes. It might be the rate buy-down, some mortgage financing incentives have been very popular, very heavily utilized. And it might be that supply chain is working back out that we're back to a washer-dryer Wednesdays. I mean there's plenty of incentives out there that we're going to use to drive a pace to hit a return we need to hit at every given neighborhood. It's just timing of projects and when they'll be ready -- completed and ready and through a sale process. We'll just have fewer this quarter ready to close than we had this past quarter. The business model is still complete lease-up market and so. Yeah. As we see marginal improvement in our inventory turns and home construction times, you're starting to see and you see that in our numbers, a larger percentage of our inventory homes on the completed side, which allows us to meet the market, which quite frankly is available to us today, which is shorter-term close. And so we're seeing more homes sell and close in the quarter, getting back more towards historical norms, and we expect to see that on a go-forward basis with the maturity of the home inventory that we have. So generally, we talk about a completed spec, we have a pretty aggressive definition of what's completed, it's when it gets into the final flooring stage. So typically, from a home hitting that completion milestone for us, normal conditions, it's probably going to take between two weeks to four weeks for that home actually to be moving ready and more likely to the four-week side of that. So if we look at how many houses we have out there that are aging in the buckets, we have about 190 houses that have been passed our completion date by more than six months or more. So we still feel very comfortable about the freshness of that spec inventory, and this is the exact right time of the year to have that inventory, especially with the backdrop of very low existing home sale inventory available in the marketplace. Well, yes, I think there has been a lot in the press on water and water is and will continue to be a headwind throughout the West, not just in Arizona. And certainly, our acquisition and integration of Vidler has helped our positioning and that's really some benefit to the short-term, but mostly a long-term strategic decision on our part, knowing that we're going to head these -- facing these headwinds for the foreseeable future. I don't think there's been a significant change on a local basis. It's still difficult to get lots on the ground to get entitlements through the process and to get those permits. It has been for a while, and that continues. So, we feel good about our position -- the lot positions we have in the Phoenix market and we've got a great team on board there that continues to navigate through that environment. I think we're still seeing demand for the properties. I think the pricing and the margins we realized on our early project sales benefited from construction and lower construction cost environments coupled with a very attractive rate environment when we sold those and that continued to some degree into our first quarter deliveries, we would expect to see some kind of a more normalized reversion to demand to a mean. And I think we'll see our margins come back in line to be closer to slightly above on what we're seeing on for sale side, the traditional core sales side. But our business model is to develop the communities and sell them into the marketplace. That's what we do best, finding the land, building the homes and bringing people to those communities is what we've been very successful with so far. So still learning, still going to get better, but we do like that business. I do think the credit markets have stabilized somewhat, consumer confidence improved a little bit. Job growth continues to be very good. So overall, if you look at product demand at just a generalized economy becoming less bad, very good signs for housing. And we monitor our sales; we monitor cancellations week to week to week to week. And so when we see that trend returning to more of a normalized market, it's hard not to be optimistic that we're going to good spring. And that's the way we're positioned and we'll get up every day and respond to what happens out there in the field. Thank you, Paul. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today, and look forward to speaking with you again to share our second quarter results in April. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton team. We're producing a solid first quarter while navigating changing market conditions, go compete and continue to win every day. Thank you."

            "content": "Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the first quarter was 23.9%, down 440 basis points sequentially from the September quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were down 4% sequentially, stick-and-brick cost per square foot increased 2% and lock costs were flat. The decrease in our gross margin from September to December was in line with our expectations and reflects the increased construction costs we incurred during 2022, along with higher sales incentives and home price reductions. We expect both our average sales price and home sales gross margin to decrease further in our second quarter for fiscal 2023. We are continuing to work with our trade partners and suppliers to reduce our construction costs on new home starts. We are making progress in these efforts, but we do not expect to see much benefit from lower costs on homes closed in fiscal 2023. Jessica? Financial services pre-tax income in the first quarter was $18.2 million on $137 million of revenues with a pre-tax profit conversion of 13.3%. The lower profitability of our financial services business this quarter was primarily due to lower gains on sales and mortgages, increased competitive conditions, and a lower volume of interest rate lots by homebuyers during the December quarter. We expect our financial services to pre-tax profit margin for fiscal 2023 to be higher than the first quarter, but lower than the full year of fiscal 2022. During the first quarter, 99% from mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed to buyer home building operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 77% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans are accounted for 45% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 7.2 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time home buyers represented 55% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Mike? Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity to provide a firm foundation for our operated platforms during changes in market conditions and to support our ability to provide consistent returns to our shareholders. During the first three months of the year, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $313.9 million, and our consolidated cash provided by operations was $829.1 million. At December 31st, we had $4 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Our liquidity provides significant flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 12.8% at the end of December, and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 4.4%. Our consolidated leverage at December 31st was 22% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 13.3%. At December 31st, our stockholders' equity was $20.2 billion and book value per share was $58.71, up 33% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended December, our return on equity was 31.5%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $86.1 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in February. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $118.1 million. Jessica? It does feel Stephen, like there is some normalcy returning to the market. And so you go back pre-pandemic and you look at what happened \u2013 costs get inflated during the last year, 18 months? Yes. Are we fighting get that back? Yes. our commodity price like lumber may go up, may go down, may stay the same. But are we going to be conservative in our guidance? Absolutely, we are. In terms of just pricing, really, our net sales orders in the quarter and the average sales price on that is the best indication. Our net sales order price this quarter is around 367,000, I believe. And, of course, we peaked last year, a little over 400,000. So you're already looking at roughly a 10% decline in our net sales orders. And as then we look at our margin guide going forward, we're taking recent pricing into effect. We're hopeful that if we see some normal seasonality and normal demand during the spring that further significant pricing reductions would not be necessary, but we're going to assess that week-to-week and month-to-month as we go through the spring. But our gross margin guide takes into account recent pricing along with the cost trends that we've already been discussing. I think generally, it's still a little too early Truman. Land is typically one of the stickier parts of the process. And as David and Paul both mentioned earlier in the call, it is increasingly difficult to get a lot entitled and on the ground. And so that is something that has held up pretty well. But anecdotally, there are situations where we're able to make some progress on the land residual with some of our land sellers. But not broad trends yet, for sure. Yeah. The acquisition of Riggins in Northwest Arkansas gave us -- not I want to say, an entrance into the market. We were in there with a couple of communities, but gave us a solid position in a market that has remained strong with good employment growth and limited housing supply again to the earlier question of the secondary markets, a solid market that we are happy to be in. It was a good acquisition and tuck-in for us with a well-established community with a great lot of supply. And so gave us immediate inventory and homes in progress, well-respected builder in the market that we're happy to as part of the family. As far as other acquisitions, we continue to look at those -- and where we have tuck-in opportunities similar to this, we had things that we would explore but no broad-based change in how we look at builders and margin. And Eric I think its just \u2013 I think it's just indicative of the entire industry and lessons learned in the last downturn. I mean I do believe that there is a discipline around the industry, and it's not just short-term, chase every market every day. So it's -- we're trying to do a lot in inventory levels with demand. And it ultimately comes back to if you look at the long-term position of the industry, there aren't enough lots for houses for the population and demand that we see taking place over the next three to five years. Hopefully, with the rate stabilization we've seen -- we'll see stabilization in incentives and pricing environment going forward. And that's something we manage very closely. Obviously, we've been building specs for a very long time. We have a lot of discipline around that. And so we do watch those completed specs as they start to age. And they get longer if they get longer than 90 days, then yes, we will start to step up the efforts to ensure that we move them. But right now, we still have a very fresh \u2013 fresh batch of completed specs out there for springs selling season. Mike, we're only guiding to Q2 margin. And the reason we're only guiding to Q2 margin is we don't know what margins or what the environment will be beyond Q2. The spring selling season, obviously, we've got some early encouraging signs but we don't know what their conditions will be at the height of the spring selling season. So we have visibility to where our margins and our sales and our backlog and our pricing and our costs are today heading into the quarter but even Q2 had some level of uncertainty to it. We would expect to sell and close 40% of our closings in the same quarter in the coming quarters. So while we believe that there's some possibility of some stability in the market with mortgage rates stable that could change this afternoon. And so right now, we're giving you what we get -- what we have. So our guidance for margins of 20% to 21% is what we can see today for Q2. There is some risk, both upside and downside there. I would say it's possible we could beat that range. But it's certainly possible that we might not. But past Q2, we simply don't have visibility right now. Yes, Jay, we have $700 million of homebuilding notes that mature this year and right now we plan to do to pay those off with cash. That's out of just under $3 billion of homebuilding debt. So, roughly 25% of the balance would be paid down that if we do not replace that debt, that would reduce our interest carry in time. That benefit would really primarily be probably noticed in fiscal 2024 and beyond because it takes time for the interest to be capitalized and move their inventory. But it would take our interest carry down probably 20, 30 basis points as a percentage of margin over time -- longer term benefit. Thanks Jay."

I'm pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team produced solid results to finish the year highlighted by consolidated pre-tax income of $1.7 billion on revenues of $10 billion with a pre-tax profit margin of 17.1%. Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $3.92. For the year, earnings per diluted share increased 4% to $14.34 and our consolidated pre-tax income was $6.3 billion on revenues of $36.8 billion, with a pre-tax profit margin of 17.1%. Our homebuilding pre-tax return on inventory for the year was 27.8%, return on equity was 19.9% and return on assets was 13.9%. Our return on assets ranks in the top 25% of all S&P 500 Companies for the past three, five, ten year periods. Our consolidated cash flow from operations for 2024 was $2.2 billion and we returned all of the cash we generated this year to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Our fiscal 2024 share distributions increased by approximately $700 million or 44% from the prior year. Over the past five years, we have generated $9 billion of cash flow from operations, and we have reduced our outstanding share count by 12%. For the quarter, despite continued affordability challenges and competitive market conditions, our net sales orders increased slightly from the prior year. Our sales pace was in-line with normal seasonality from the third to fourth quarter, but below our expectations. While mortgage rates have decreased from their highs earlier this year, many potential homebuyers expect rates to be lower in 2025. We believe that the volatility of rates combined with general uncertainty during the election season is causing some buyers to stay on the sidelines in the near-term. To help spur demand and address affordability, we are continuing to use incentives such as mortgage rate buydowns and we have continued to start and sell more of our smaller floor plans. With 46% of fourth quarter closings, also sold in the same quarter, our sales incentive levels and gross margin are generally representative of current market conditions. We typically experience seasonally slower demand during the fall and our tenured local operators seek to find the right balance of sales pace, pricing and incentives in each community that will best position our returns and inventory levels before we enter the spring. For the full year of fiscal 2025, our homebuilding volume and profit margins will largely be dependent on the strength of the upcoming spring selling season. Overall, the demographics supporting housing demand are favorable and we continue to see a generally limited supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points, in addition to a limited supply of finished lots available for new home construction. With our focus on affordable product offerings, 37,400 homes in inventory, continued improvement in our construction cycle times and adequate finished lots available in our pipeline, we are well positioned for fiscal 2025. We remain focused on enhancing the capital efficiency of all of our operations to produce consistent, sustainable returns and cash flows, so that we can return more capital to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. Mike?\nMichael Murray : Earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 12% to $3.92 per diluted share compared to $4.45 per share in the prior year quarter. Earnings for the full year increased 4% to $14.34 per diluted share compared to $13.82 in fiscal 2023. Net income for the quarter decreased 15% to $1.3 billion on consolidated revenues of $10 billion. And for the year, net income increased slightly to $4.8 billion on revenues of 36.8 billion. Our fourth quarter home sales revenues were $8.9 billion on 23,647 homes closed compared to $8.8 billion on 22,928 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $377,600, down 1% both sequentially and from the prior year quarter. Bill?\nBill Wheat : Our net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased slightly from the prior year quarter to 19,035 homes, and order value decreased 2% to $7.1 billion. The sequential decline in our net sales orders was consistent with the prior year and in-line with normal seasonality from the third to the fourth quarter, but both our home sales and closings this quarter were below our expectations. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 21%, up from 18% sequentially and unchanged from the prior year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was flat sequentially and up 10% from the prior year. The average price of net sales orders in the fourth quarter was $375,400, down 1% sequentially and 2% from the prior year quarter. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the fourth quarter was 23.6%, down 40 basis points sequentially from the June quarter. The decrease in our gross margin from June to September was primarily due to higher incentive costs on homes closed during the quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were down roughly [1.5%] (ph) sequentially, while stick and brick costs per square foot decreased 1% and lot cost increased 1.5%. We anticipate our incentive levels to increase further on homes closed over the next few months, so we expect our home sales gross margin to be lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Our incentive levels and home sales gross margin for the full year of fiscal 2025, will be dependent on the strength of demand during the spring selling season, in addition to changes in mortgage interest rates and other market conditions. Bill?\nBill Wheat : In the fourth quarter, our home building SG&A expenses increased by 17% from last year. And homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.6%, up 100 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. For the year homebuilding SG&A was 7.5% of revenues, up 40 basis points from fiscal 2023. Our increased SG&A costs in both periods are primarily due to the expansion of our operating platform. Our employee and average community count are both up 10% from a year ago, while our market count increased to 125 markets in 36 states from 118 markets in 33 states. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski : We started 18,400 homes in the September quarter and ended the year with 37,400 homes in inventory, down 11% from a year ago and approximately 5,000 homes lower than at the end of June. 25,700 of our total homes at September 30th were unsold. 10,300 of our unsold homes at year end were completed, of which 1,100 had been completed for greater than six months. The increase in unsold completed homes this quarter resulted from a combination of a seasonally slowing sales pace and further improvement in our construction cycle times. For homes we closed in the fourth quarter, our cycle time decreased by almost a week from the third quarter and a month from a year ago. Our improved cycle times position us to turn our housing inventory faster in 2025, and we will continue to manage our homes and inventory and starts pace based on market conditions. Mike?\nMichael Murray : Our home building lot position at September 30th consisted of approximately 633,000 lots, of which 24% were owned and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. We remain focused on our relationships with land developers across the country to maximize returns. These relationships allow us to build more homes on lots developed by others. Of the homes we closed during the fourth quarter, 64% were on a lot developed by either 4 Star or a third-party, up from 62% in the prior year quarter. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our fourth quarter home building investments in lots, land, and development totaled $2.2 billion, of which $1.5 billion was for finished lots, $560 million was for land development, and $170 million was for land acquisition. For the year, our home building investments in lots, land, and development totaled $9.5 billion, up 19% from fiscal 2023. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski : In the fourth quarter, our rental operations generated $100 million of pre-tax income, $705 million of revenues from the sale of 1,692 single-family rental homes and 868 multi-family rental units. For the full year, our rental operations generated $229 million of pre-tax income on $1.7 billion of revenues from the sale of 3,970 single-family rental homes and 2,202 multifamily rental units. We can continue to operate a merchant-build model in which we construct and sell purpose-built rental communities. Our rental operations provide synergies to our home-building operations by enhancing our purchasing scale and providing opportunities for more efficient utilization of trade, labor, and land parcels. Our rental property inventory at September 30th was $2.9 billion, which consisted of $800 million of single-family rental properties and $2.1 billion of multifamily rental properties. We expect our total rental inventory to remain around the current level for the next several quarters. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen : 4 Star, our majority-owned residential lot development company, reported revenues of $551 million for the fourth quarter on 5,374 lots sold with pre-tax income of $109 million. For the full year, 4 Star delivered 15,068 lots, generating $1.5 billion of revenues and $270 million of pre-tax income with a pre-tax profit margin of 17.9%. 4 Star's owned and controlled lot position at September 30th was 95,100 lots. 65% of 4 Star's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a write-off first offer to D.R. Horton. $430 million of our finished lots purchased in the fourth quarter were from 4 Star. 4 Star had approximately $860 million of liquidity at year end with a net debt to capital ratio of 12.4%. Our strategic relationship with 4 Star, is a vital component of our returns focused business model. 4 Star's strong, separately capitalized balance sheet, growing operating platform, and lot supply, position them well to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots in the homebuilding industry and to aggregate significant market share over the next several years. Mike?\nMichael Murray : Financial services earn $76 million of pre-tax income in the fourth quarter on $222 million of revenues with a pre-tax profit margin of 34.2%. For the year, financial services earned $311 million of pre-tax income on $883 million of revenues with a pre-tax profit margin of 35.3%. During the fourth quarter, essentially all of our mortgage companies loan originations related to homes closed by our home building operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 77% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 60% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First time home buyers represented 59% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Bill?\nBill Wheat : Our capital allocation strategy is disciplined and balanced to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth, and cash flow. We have a strong balance sheet with low leverage and substantial liquidity, which provides us with significant financial flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions and opportunities. During fiscal 2024, our consolidated cash provided by operations was $2.2 billion and we distributed all of the cash we generated through share repurchases and dividends to enhance shareholder returns. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock for $561 million. And for the year, we repurchased 12.5 million shares for $1.8 billion, which reduced our outstanding share count by 3% from the prior year end. Our remaining share repurchase authorization at September 30th was $3.6 billion. During the quarter, we also paid cash dividends of $98 million for a total of $395 million of dividends paid during the year. On September 30th, we had $7.6 billion of consolidated liquidity, consisting of $4.5 billion of cash and $3.1 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities. In August, we issued $700 million of senior notes due 2034. Our debt at September 30th totaled $5.9 billion. Subsequent to year end, we repaid $500 million of senior notes at maturity and we have no additional maturities in fiscal 2025. Our consolidated leverage at September 30th was 18.9% and leverage net of cash was 5.2%. We plan to maintain our leverage around 20% over the long-term. At September 30th, our stockholders equity was $25.3 billion and book value per share was $78.12, up 15% from a year ago. For the year, our return on equity was 19.9%, and our return on assets was 13.9%. Based on our strong financial position and cash flow, our board recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by 33% to $0.40 per share. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen : Looking forward, our fiscal 2025 business plan was built from the community level up, beginning with our lot position. With a return to more normal seasonality, we expect our results for the full year will largely be dependent on the strength of the spring. As outlined in our press release this morning, for the full year of fiscal 2025, we expect to generate consolidated revenues of approximately $36 billion to $37.5 billion and homes closed by our home building operations to be in the range of 90,000 to 92,000 homes. We forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2025 of approximately 24.5%. We expect to generate more cash flow from operations in fiscal 2025 than fiscal 2024, and to utilize a substantial portion of our cash flows to enhance shareholder returns. We currently plan to repurchase approximately $2.4 billion of our common stock this year, in addition to making annual dividend payments of around $500 million. For our first fiscal quarter, ended December 31st, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of $6.8 billion to $7.3 billion, and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 17,500 to 18,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the first quarter to be around 22.5% and homebuilding SG&A, as a percentage of revenues to be approximately 8.9%. We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin of around 20% in the first quarter, and we expect our income tax rate for the quarter to be approximately 24.5%. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski : In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, and focus on affordable product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform that sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth, and cash flow while continuing to aggregate market share. We have significant financial flexibility and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation and provide consistently high returns to our shareholders to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton family of employees, land developers, trade partners, vendors, and real estate agents for your continued efforts and hard work. We look forward to working together to improve our operations and provide home ownership opportunities to more individuals and families during 2025. [concludes] (ph) our prepared to remarks. We will now host questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And your first question this morning is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nStephen Kim: Yeah, thanks very much guys. Appreciate the color. I wanted to ask a couple of questions regarding your guide. First of all, I think in particular your revenue guide, can be influenced a lot by rental revenue. And the other factor that you didn't give was also the ASP for closing. So I just wanted to see if you could help us disaggregate a little bit. What are you assuming in terms of rental revenue \u2013 maybe sequentially or year-over-year? However you think is best? I'm thinking about it in revenue dollars, and both for the first quarter and for the full year guide.\nBill Wheat: Yes, Steve. Implied in our consolidated revenue guide would be relatively flat rental revenues year-over-year. We would expect those revenues to be weighted a little heavier in the back half of the year than in the first half of the year, and so a little bit lighter in the first quarter as well. In terms of ASP, we are assuming relatively flat ASP with recent trends. Of course, that's going to be subject to market conditions going forward into the spring as well as incentive levels.\nStephen Kim: Got you. Okay. That's helpful. All right. And then the second question I wanted to sort of delve a little bit into the -- your comment about market conditions, which I think we all realize it's tough out there. But in particular, you talked about -- how you think that buyers are sort of on the sidelines kind of waiting maybe the election, maybe just affordability. And so I wanted to see if we could disaggregate that. Can you talk about what you are seeing with respect to your interest list or traffic? And can you help us maybe draw a distinction between what you're seeing today versus what you saw in other previous times when buyers kind of went on strike, like maybe the back half of calendar 2022 for example. Just to help us get a better sense of how much of this is actual true unaffordability versus psychological effects causing people to wait on the sidelines?\nPaul Romanowski: Yes, Steve. It certainly is a combination of both, but we are seeing our buyers sit on the side lines, sit on the fence. A little less motivated today than they were previously in prior quarters. And affordability has been challenged. We still see consistent traffic. It was below our expectations in the quarter. Hence the results in terms of total sales. But still, we were up year-over-year. I\u2019d say, that for the quarter and our sales were in-line with normal seasonality. I don't think this is a structural issue with demand. There is just a lot of noise in the market today. The rate volatility we've seen combined with the election news that's out there, I just think we are seeing people take a pause. But it certainly is a stretch today, and we got to continue to focus on affordability to make sure we get product and monthly payment and position for our people to move forward.\nStephen Kim: Just a clarification there. Are you looking for mortgage rates to come down next year? Is that what's embedded in your guide?\nPaul Romanowski: No, we would expect -- and we aren't going to manage our business around that expectation one way or another. We are going to continue to respond to the market as we go week to week and month to month.\nStephen Kim: Got it. Okay, thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Matthew your line is live. Please go head.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. So looking at the delivery guide of 90,000 to 92,000 in 2025, and comparing that versus the -- I guess the 37,000 homes in inventory you have at the moment, I guess that ratio is maybe a little bit higher than it typically is and during a year. So is there kind of an expectation for maybe a bigger ramp in starts as you get into the spring? Or are you saying that kind of cycle times have come down to such a degree where you can have that kind of ratio where it is? Thank you.\nMichael Murray: Matt, I think we are looking at both actually to come into play in 2025. We have seen tremendous improvement in our cycle times over the past year and continuing through the fourth quarter with our lot position that we have, our ability to lean into starts with the market. As we see the market unfold, we'll be able to press into the starts. And we feel really good about our ability to turn that opening housing inventory, what it implies almost 1.5 times in fiscal 2025.\nJessica Hansen: Yes. So for the first quarter, our starts probably only stepped up slightly from where they were in Q4, and they are lower than the average for the full year. We would expect it to pick up as we move into the spring.\nMichael Murray: Right.\nMatthew Bouley: Okay. Got it. Thank you for that. And then on the topic of building smaller floor plans, apologies if I missed the number. But I guess what was your home size down in Q4? And kind of what is the expectation for home sizes that you're embedding in 2025? And beyond just the numbers, I'm curious if you could just speak about that kind of balance of affordability versus kind of how you think about the efficiency of building smaller homes. So kind of what goes into that decision? Thank you.\nJessica Hansen: Yes, I'll start with the specifics, and then Paul can give you his commentary on where he thinks we're going. In terms of square footage for the quarter, we were down again both 1% sequentially and year-over-year. And part of that driver is we continue to see attached product, predominantly town-homes, making up a bigger percentage of our closings mix. So we are -- roughly 15% of our closings this quarter were attached product versus detached single-family homes.\nPaul Romanowski: And we do see efficiency in the smaller plans, and that helps us to position as we enter into the spring market for our ability to deliver. We have purposefully reduced the number of homes we have in the market because of that ability. No significant shift overall, other than we just need to continue to drive to affordable price points and affordable monthly payments. And that comes from a lean towards smaller product. That being said, we still do have our move-up in the freedom buyers that we'll continue to provide what it is that they are looking for in the marketplace.\nMatthew Bouley: All right. Thanks guys. Good luck.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from John Lovallo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions as well. The first one is that I think you described the inventory in the market as generally limited supply of new and existing homes. Just curious if you saw some worsening in that trend as the quarter progressed? And if so, are there particular markets where you are seeing more inventory come online? And how are you feeling about overall conditions in that regard?\nPaul Romanowski: The overall numbers haven't grown significantly. I think with the low number of sales you are seeing, the month's supply continues to expand. But still at the price points that we compete at, we see limited supply across most of our markets. And with people still -- that lock-in effect still impacting people from the low mortgage rate that they have, we are just not seeing that supply grow in a significant way. We still feel very good about our competitive abilities with new home, ability to offer a more attractive rate. And in markets where there is pressure on insurance, we see a consistent and relatively stable insurance premiums which are our competitive advantage against the resale market.\nJohn Lovallo: Understood. And then on the first quarter gross margin outlook of 22.5%, that 110 basis point step down. I think you guys attributed the majority of that to just step up in incentives. Just want to make sure that -- that is the case. And if so, can you just help us with what are your current incentive levels as a percentage of revenue? And where are you expecting those to trend over the next few months?\nBill Wheat: Yes, that's right, John. The step down in our guide for margin in Q1 is due to higher incentives. And really, we started seeing those higher level incentives later in Q4. Our margin in the month of September was lower than it was in July and August, and we expect that trend to continue into Q1. And it's based on volatility in rates. Where rates have recently gone, the costs of our interest rate buydowns is increasing, and so that's why we expect our incentive levels to increase further into Q1. On a year-over-year basis, do you have some stats, Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Yes. I'll give you just the buyers that had a rate buydown associated with it. So of the buyers utilizing our mortgage company during the quarter, over 80% had some form of a rate buydown, which was flat sequentially, but it was up from 74% a year ago. And so that equates to 63% of our overall closings in the fourth quarter, which was also relatively flat sequentially. So it is not necessarily an increase in the percentage of buyers utilizing it, it really is just the costs associated with the buydown. And I think with the substantial majority of our closings already being bought down through our mortgage company, that would be the continued expectation is it's just going to be the cost level, not necessarily a significant higher percentage of buyers that would utilize it.\nJohn Lovallo: Got it. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl your line is live, please go ahead.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks everybody. Just one two-parter. Can you talk at all about any impact from hurricanes on ops traffic, the communities themselves? And then has there been any positive or negative impact given your reliance on buyers' brokers? It's a big focus for you has been for a long time. Any impact from the settlement to driving traffic sales rates at all or cost?\nMichael Murray: Yeah, Carl, I'll take the first part of that question. First of all the hurricanes, just horrified as everyone else was with the impact that had on so many families across those regions. Fortunately, the D.R. Horton family, our employees and our homeowners, fared very well in those storms. We did not have a significant impact on our communities. Thankfully, with the current building codes we build to, we see those communities perform very well in adverse weather events. At the same time, you see the crews responding, utility crews and municipalities focus is diverted to restoring services to residents and rightly so, that can slow down power, electrification for us, it can slow down inspections and some of that processing. But it becomes a timing issue rather than any kind of a permanent effect on the business. So we feel very fortunate as D.R. Horton [or] (ph) the D.R. Horton family got through these storms pretty well.\nPaul Romanowski: As far as the NAR settlement and realtor community response, they seem to have been handling it well. They are largely adjusting to what they need to do to satisfy the requirements of the NAR settlements. I haven't seen much of a significant shift one way or the other in terms of traffic, and/or much change in broker commissions. I think that will play out over time. But again, with the limited number of homes generally available across the market, we still have our realtors that have been consistent in their performance with us, still showing up in our sales office and able to navigate the requirements of the settlement.\nCarl Reichardt: All right. Thanks for that. And then you talked to employee and average store count up quite a bit in fiscal '24. As you are looking at '25, what are your expectations for what we might see in terms of a flattening of that store count growth or a slowdown in the number of new markets you you'd add so that we might get better SG&A leverage next year? Or do you expect to continue to grow those pretty aggressively? Thanks.\nBill Wheat: Yes. Clearly, we have been making an investment in these new markets to prepare for some growth. And as we grow into that, I would expect those growth rates to moderate a bit. The community count growth has been near double-digit, high single to low double for the last year or so. And so naturally, we'd expect that to start to moderate back towards the mid-single-digit level as well. So yes, we always want to make sure to control our SG&A, but we have been making some investments here recently, that we do expect will support a higher growth level going forward.\nCarl Reichardt: Okay, thanks Bill. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sam Reid from Wells Fargo. Sam, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nSam Reid: Thank you so much. So it sounds like gross margin moved lower intra-quarter, September versus July, August. And then as you look to your guidance for the fourth quarter, that 22.5%, kind of is that 22.5% in-line with the exit rate from the last quarter? Or does it imply that November or December will be below October levels?\nJessica Hansen: Yes. Great question, Sam. It is incorporated in our guide that our September month of closings was our lowest gross margin in the quarter. Not quite to where we expect to be for the full year of Q1 because as we said, we do expect to have further increases in incentive costs, but not far off from where we were in the September month.\nSam Reid: Got you. And then I wanted to touch on your completed unsold inventories around 10,300. Just wanted to see if there was any details specifically on geographic dispersion, whether you are seeing a concentration of completed unsold inventories in some of the focus markets that investors are interested in, like Florida and Texas? Thanks.\nPaul Romanowski: No. No geographic sensitivity or a place where we've seen those units stack up across the Board and across our footprint. We've seen improvement in our cycle times. And sales being slightly below our expectations in the quarter is why we've seen that increase in completed inventory. We still are not seeing it sit around and age, and that's when we start to get concerned. We do expect that our completed inventory over the next few quarters, we'll start to trend back down. As we've hit the sales pace we need community-backed community and have adjusted starts where we needed to. But we have the homes we are comfortable with today, and we need to adjust that completed number down over the next few quarters.\nSam Reid : Great. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll pause it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Michael, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rehaut: Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Appreciate you taking my questions. I want to delve a little bit into regional color, if possible. And apologies if I missed this earlier. But with all the focus on Florida and Texas obviously, and around inventory levels, I know that you've kind of stated a couple of times that you feel like that, that perhaps on a broad base is not an issue. But just trying to get a sense, when you think about particularly the guide kind of flat to up low single digits for closings, does that reflect any regional challenges? Or maybe just more broadly, if you can kind of give us a sense of where you feel demand is stronger versus weaker across your footprint?\nMichael Murray: I don't think the guide is reflecting any concern with a given region. The biggest markets that we've been in, Florida and Texas, are also very competitive markets. And so as the buyers have taken a pause that's been reflective I think, across the footprint in those markets. And looking forward into the guide and expectations for next year, that was built largely on the basis of available lots that we have -- that we have a comfort level around starts pace, that we'll lean into as we see spring unfolds. And we have the capacity to adjust that starts pace reflective of the spring selling conditions.\nMichael Rehaut: Okay. I appreciate that. I guess secondly, you mentioned that throughout the quarter, September was your lower margin month with higher incentives. I was curious -- and again, apologies if I missed this earlier, but wanted to get a sense just from a demand and order growth standpoint, sales pace standpoint. We've heard some of your competitors talk to September being the strongest month of the quarter. And I was just kind of wondering if that's what you saw from a sales pace or an order growth standpoint. Obviously, rates fluctuated a lot during the quarter, but there was perhaps that points into September -- August, September, a little bit of a lower point from a rate standpoint. So just kind of curious on what you saw, how things trended during the quarter and where September was relative to the rest?\nMichael Murray: I think we saw a pretty choppy sales environment through the quarter. If we look at the chart of the mortgage rates. We started the quarter just under 7%. We ended the quarter just above 6%, and it is a pretty smooth trajectory down. And I think that affected a lot of buyers' psyche and thinking about, wow, the rates are on a good trend. I'm going to keep riding that trend before I jump in. And then lo and behold, we saw October turnaround after the Fed cuts and rates are up 50 basis points in the month of October. So it is kind of crazy predicting interest rates. So hard to see any discernible trend, other than we saw some choppy sales and a buyer that was on pause.\nJessica Hansen: And still have through the month of October to date, just continued rate volatility.\nMichael Rehaut: Okay, very good. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Alan, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nAlan Ratner: Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for the time and info so far. My question, I guess, relates to just the broader strategy that you've had, as long as we've been covering Horton, which is to consolidate market share. And I guess what I'm thinking about is you've heard from several other of your larger peers, a goal or a target to grow in '25 by a 5% to 10% rate on closings, orders, whatever the metrics they are looking at. And your guide is obviously a bit below that in '25. And I know it is preliminary and I know it can obviously move around based on how the spring unfolds. But on the surface right now, it would look like, at least in the near term, you don't expect to be taking a significant amount of market share. So I'm curious when you think about that outlook, is that a function of you see maybe some more aggressive incentives out in the market from some of your competitors, that you don't feel the need or the desire to match right now to do what you need to do to actually take share? Do you think that some of the guys out there might prove to be too aggressive? Is it a function of a price point differential, maybe stronger activity at higher price points? Just curious if you can kind of talk about the competitive dynamics that would seemingly set you guys up for a year of no meaningful share growth.\nPaul Romanowski: All right. Alan, we do feel very good our position. We are still well ahead of the spring selling season. We do have the lot position. We have the inventory and cycle time improvement that we need to lean into the market if we see a stronger market in the spring. Our operators are always going to have a higher goal than the numbers that we're reaching to, and it's not a significant shift other than a guide as best we see it today. And we are going to stay positioned to respond to the market. We feel great about our position and great about our operators in the field and their ability to gauge the market and lean in should it show up stronger in the spring.\nAlan Ratner: Got it. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then second question is kind of around the spec strategy. I know, obviously, you and others have pivoted to kind of 100% spec models over the course of the last several years, somewhat out of necessity given the supply chain somewhat out of -- that's where the demand was given the tight resale market? But we've talked about this in the past where even though you never were a huge build-to-order builder by any stretch of the imagination, that was always at least some portion of your business. And I'm curious now with kind of where your spec position is, where your backlog is. Is there any thought of maybe kind of returning to some extent to the build-to-order market, especially if the demand in the spring turns out to be shown signs of acceleration?\nMichael Murray: I wouldn't -- see change shift in our strategy, it\u2019s a kind of a community by community, since we are past the supply chain challenges. We've driven a lot of efficiency into the building process and cycle times. We will allow our local operators to make those decisions community by community about going to more of a presale focus depending upon the customer segment that they're seeking to serve with that particular community and what the market conditions are like. I mean we still see tremendous demand, especially for the first-time homebuyer with the house that can close in 60 days, get them qualified for the mortgage and in-line with when a lease or something may be expiring.\nAlan Ratner: Make sense. All right. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Eric your line is live. Please go ahead.\nEric Bosshard: Thanks. Two things, if I could. The increased incentive spender costs, just for a little more clarity, is this you investing more lowering the cost for your customers and is that the strategy? Or is this just it's gotten -- the cost of it's gotten more expensive as rates ticked back higher? Just where we are and what the strategy or vision for that is?\nPaul Romanowski: It is our expectation. We need to increase our incentives and stay where they are lean in a little more based on rates and achieving affordability for our buyers. So then if want to maintain a bigger spread off of market rates. That's going to cost a little more. But as we look forward into the next quarter, we expect that our incentives will have to remain elevated in order to maintain affordability and monthly payments that our buyers are looking for.\nBill Wheat: And then, Eric when rates are volatile or more uncertain, the cost of those incentives do increase. And so regardless of where the level is or how much we're choosing to buy during those periods where it's more uncertain, the cost is just higher.\nEric Bosshard: Okay. And then second question which is lately potentially redundant, I'll ask it nonetheless. But you talked about this phenomenon of affordability challenges. Your solution for affordability challenges incentives, a bit more smaller homes. Is there anything beyond that or incremental to that as you look at one of the key limiting factors is this phenomenon of affordability? Any other solutions that you see that you can help address that to unlock more demand?\nMichael Murray: We are continually evaluating the product selection that are going into the homes and looking to see where it makes sense to hit the affordability numbers. Neighborhood location can have a lot to do with ultimate affordability as to cost of the underlying dirt, cost of development requirements and what municipalities are asking for, whether it is in horizontal improvements or the homes themselves. And so continually looking for ways to bring houses people can afford in the market. And it's a combination of everything. It's not one thing that we do. It's something we try to get to do every day and be as efficient as possible with our starts program, to work with our trade partners and labor to make sure that they're able to plan a business and share those savings of a planful business with us that we can pass along to our shareholders.\nEric Bosshard : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Paul Przybylski from Wolfe Research. Paul your line is live. Please go ahead.\nPaul Przybylski: Thank you. Your can rate increased a little bit quarter-over-quarter. I was wondering, are accelerating incentives create any issues with backlog right now? And historically, down payments have been the greatest impediment for the entry level buyer. Is that still the case? Or has that shifted more to DTI or monthly payment constraint?\nJessica Hansen: I think we haven't seen a big change in the buyer profile. Obviously, we've harped on affordability being an issue that hasn't changed. So it does take a little bit more household income to qualify for a home today than it did several years ago. But our can rate was in-line with a year ago and typically we do see a slight tick-up in the fourth quarter for various reasons. And if you look at our cadence intra-quarter and Q4 on our can rate, it was very consistent with last year's Q4. And low -- high double-digit to low 20s is a very comfortable rate for us to manage.\nPaul Przybylski: Okay. I was wondering, what was your average 4Q rate promotion? How that compared to 3Q? And what is it so far in October?\nPaul Romanowski: Yes. We are really in the 4.5% to 5.5% in terms of our offerings that are out there. Rates have moved up in the last few weeks. We'll see where they settle in over the next couple. That may drift up, but still staying in that 1% to 1.5% kind of below market rates is where we have maintained this past quarter end, and the prior couple of quarters.\nJessica Hansen: Yes. Our backlog is right in the middle of that, it's at 5.2%.\nPaul Przybylski: Great. Thank you, I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Anthony your line is live. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Pettinari: Hi, good morning. You had pretty favorable stick and brick costs in the quarter, and I was just wondering how you saw those trending in fiscal 1Q. And then I think referencing maybe John's question, is it fair to say stick and brick is not really driving a big move in margins quarter-over-quarter in terms of that step down?\nJessica Hansen: Yes. That's very fair. I think we've said for a couple of quarters, we expect the benefit of lumber to be behind us, but that was still a benefit in the closings this quarter. Our stick and brick costs were down roughly 1% sequentially and about 2.5% year-over-year. And I think our base case as we move throughout '25, is we'd see relatively flat, give or take a percent, on the stick and brick side.\nAnthony Pettinari: Got it. Got it. And I'm just curious, I mean with the election coming up, are there one or two issues that you could see impacting the industry from a builder perspective or buyers that you'll be really watching as we see kind of how it plays out?\nMichael Murray: I think everybody would be happy the election is over. I think that will help buyer sentiment and the ability to move forward with their life decision.\nAnthony Pettinari: Sounds good. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ken Zener from Seaport Research Partners. Ken, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nKen Zener: Good morning everybody. Can you hear me?\nJessica Hansen: Yes, go ahead.\nKen Zener: I just want to check. Thank you. All right. Obviously, not what the Street or probably what you all were expecting. But I just want to go through a few basic thoughts here. First, do you think part of the -- I mean, look, price is high. We can see that in affordability. Therefore, you're using incentives, which makes sense. But do you think part of the issue is on the slowing supply given the whole narrative of tight supply in terms of under construction? Is that in most markets, because the builders are so dominant that new homebuyers already have been in a rate-neutral environment because most new builders are offering incentives? That seems to me that you might have pulled forward demand given that we are -- you still have these incentives. Or do you think it's strictly an issue of affordability therefore, that affects your long-term view on gross margins?\nPaul Romanowski: I do think that the lock-in -- the fact that we don't have a lot of resale homes in the market also means that we don't have those buyers coming in when they sell their house coming into our offices. 45% of our buyers are not first-time homebuyers. Although we sell more than 50% too. Those means they need to move on from their existing home. I don't think there is a lack of want, it's -- or need going out there. So we could be building some pent-up demand. And so we aren't that concerned if we see resale inventory start to rise a little bit because that means people are moving around more, and that's going to provide more buyers into our offices. We are certainly competitive with the resale market today. We do hear that from our realtors, that because of our rate buydowns and availability that we have of house, at more affordable price points, that it's challenged to the resale market.\nKen Zener: And do you want to comment, I think at some point over the last couple of years, you talked about structurally higher gross margins in contrast to what had been a 19% or 20% time -- under prior management. But do you still have confidence that your -- the gross margins can be structurally higher for you guys? Or do you perhaps have the view that at current rates, the affordability is actually a bigger issue given the persistency of these incentives? Thank you.\nJessica Hansen: Ken, we've always said that we're going to do what we need to do to maximize returns. And so for periods of time, we could see gross margin compression. But over the long-term, I do think, on average, we believe there is reasons that the long-term average gross margin could be structurally higher because of the scale advantages in the business and our lower cost of capital from the deleveraging we've done. But we're going to meet the market quarter to quarter to quarter. And if that means compressing margins in the short-term to maximize returns, that's the approach we're going to take.\nBill Wheat: And to the longer-term view, we are talking about a step-down in margin to 22.5%, which is above the high-end of our historic range of margins. So we have been at a higher level. And -- but we are going to meet the market, and there will be periods of times where we need to.\nKen Zener : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America. Rafe your line is live. Please go ahead.\nRafe Jadrosich: Hi, good morning thanks for taking my questions. You spoke about the stick and brick inflation that you are expecting. Can you talk about what you're anticipating for land inflation in the first quarter and then through 2025?\nJessica Hansen: So we've seen a little bit of a moderation from low double-digit percentage increase in our lot cost to high single digit this quarter. On a full year basis, we were up a double-digit percentage. But on a quarter-over-quarter basis, it was a high single. So I think we expect to continue to have cost inflation as we move throughout 2025 that maybe it can moderate to a mid-single digit as we get a couple of quarters past and have cycled through some of those comparisons already. But our base case is that lot costs will continue to increase at least a mid-single-digit percentage.\nRafe Jadrosich: Okay. That's really helpful. And then just putting that all kind of together, how do we think of what level of net price you would need in fiscal '25 to hold margins?\nBill Wheat: We would need a small amount. With the lot cost at the mid-to-high impact on overall price, you need a small amount but not a significant amount because we do expect our stick and brick costs to remain relatively flat.\nRafe Jadrosich : Okay, that\u2019s really helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Susan your line is live. Please go ahead.\nSusan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning everyone. I just want to focus in a bit more on the cost side of the business. We have seen lumber and wood product prices generally inflating over the last several weeks. It feels like they are on a general upward trajectory as you think about the next several quarters in there. Can you talk about what you're seeing and how you're thinking about that element of the cost structure in fiscal '25?\nPaul Romanowski: Sue, we have seen lumber come up some recently. And as we look at next year, we are looking for relatively flat stick and brick. We have seen a good response from the labor markets. We see trades looking for business which tends to mean we can hold our costs as relatively flat. So as we kind of look at it all, we aren't sure exactly where lumber goes, as we move over the next several months, but feel like we don't expect much movement up or down in stick and brick over the next -- in 2025.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe turning to the rental side of the business. You mentioned in your comments that you expect your inventories to hold flat for the next several years. But as you do think about the potential that rates stay relatively higher versus lower in there, can you just talk about the demand that you are seeing on that rental side? And how you're thinking about managing that and meeting that need as well?\nJessica Hansen: A quick clarification on the first part. The comment on our rental investment was over the next several quarters. Haven't spoken out to future years, that's going to depend on market conditions and where we get the return profile on that business in terms of what we're willing to invest in it.\nPaul Romanowski: Yes. And I think overall as we look at the market, we still see relatively solid demand in terms of the number of buyers in the market. We've certainly seen a reduction in apartment starts consistently over the past 12 months and feel good about our positioning, and the inventory we have in production, the timing that it's going to come to market. So still feel good about that segment, and we will monitor it quarter-to-quarter in terms of what we do with our starts and positioning on a go-forward basis.\nSusan Maklari: Okay, thank you for the color. Good luck with everything.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Jade your line is live. Please go ahead.\nJade Rahmani : Thank you very much. What level of rates would need -- would you need to see to spur demand and get buyers off the sidelines as you've categorized? Would it be around a 100 basis point reduction? And would you need to see that through the 10-year treasury?\nMichael Murray: Hard to predict what's going to drive the rates, whether it's the underlying 10-year benchmark or the spreads to treasury. But more than any one given rate, I think stability in rates is most helpful for us in seeing buyers demand and come off the sidelines. So they are not waiting for rates to come down or fearful they are going to escape their ability to afford right now. Stability is good, we saw a tighter trading band in the mortgages in the third quarter, and we have a stronger sales environment. And there's had some seasonality to that as well, but we had more volatility in rates in the fourth quarter, and that was a negative to demand.\nJade Rahmani : In terms of the APR you're currently offering, is it in the mid-5% range or low 5% range? I've seen at least one competitor in the 4s, but most do seem to be in that 5-ish percent range.\nPaul Romanowski: Our offering across the market can kind of range in the mid-4 to mid-5. The average in our backlog, I think Jessica alluded to earlier, was just over 5%.\nJade Rahmani : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Q&A session. I would now like to hand the floor back to Paul Romanowski for closing remarks.\nPaul Romanowski: Thank you, Tom. We appreciate everyone\u2019s time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you in January to share our first quarter results. Congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family on a successful fiscal 2024. Due to your efforts, we just completed 23rd consecutive year as the largest builder in the United States. We are honored to represent you on this call, and we look forward to everything we will accomplish together in fiscal 2025.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Paul Romanowski",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I'm pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team produced solid results to finish the year highlighted by consolidated pre-tax income of $1.7 billion on revenues of $10 billion with a pre-tax profit margin of 17.1%. Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $3.92. For the year, earnings per diluted share increased 4% to $14.34 and our consolidated pre-tax income was $6.3 billion on revenues of $36.8 billion, with a pre-tax profit margin of 17.1%. Our homebuilding pre-tax return on inventory for the year was 27.8%, return on equity was 19.9% and return on assets was 13.9%. Our return on assets ranks in the top 25% of all S&P 500 Companies for the past three, five, ten year periods. Our consolidated cash flow from operations for 2024 was $2.2 billion and we returned all of the cash we generated this year to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Our fiscal 2024 share distributions increased by approximately $700 million or 44% from the prior year. Over the past five years, we have generated $9 billion of cash flow from operations, and we have reduced our outstanding share count by 12%. For the quarter, despite continued affordability challenges and competitive market conditions, our net sales orders increased slightly from the prior year. Our sales pace was in-line with normal seasonality from the third to fourth quarter, but below our expectations. While mortgage rates have decreased from their highs earlier this year, many potential homebuyers expect rates to be lower in 2025. We believe that the volatility of rates combined with general uncertainty during the election season is causing some buyers to stay on the sidelines in the near-term. To help spur demand and address affordability, we are continuing to use incentives such as mortgage rate buydowns and we have continued to start and sell more of our smaller floor plans. With 46% of fourth quarter closings, also sold in the same quarter, our sales incentive levels and gross margin are generally representative of current market conditions. We typically experience seasonally slower demand during the fall and our tenured local operators seek to find the right balance of sales pace, pricing and incentives in each community that will best position our returns and inventory levels before we enter the spring. For the full year of fiscal 2025, our homebuilding volume and profit margins will largely be dependent on the strength of the upcoming spring selling season. Overall, the demographics supporting housing demand are favorable and we continue to see a generally limited supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points, in addition to a limited supply of finished lots available for new home construction. With our focus on affordable product offerings, 37,400 homes in inventory, continued improvement in our construction cycle times and adequate finished lots available in our pipeline, we are well positioned for fiscal 2025. We remain focused on enhancing the capital efficiency of all of our operations to produce consistent, sustainable returns and cash flows, so that we can return more capital to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. Mike? We started 18,400 homes in the September quarter and ended the year with 37,400 homes in inventory, down 11% from a year ago and approximately 5,000 homes lower than at the end of June. 25,700 of our total homes at September 30th were unsold. 10,300 of our unsold homes at year end were completed, of which 1,100 had been completed for greater than six months. The increase in unsold completed homes this quarter resulted from a combination of a seasonally slowing sales pace and further improvement in our construction cycle times. For homes we closed in the fourth quarter, our cycle time decreased by almost a week from the third quarter and a month from a year ago. Our improved cycle times position us to turn our housing inventory faster in 2025, and we will continue to manage our homes and inventory and starts pace based on market conditions. Mike? In the fourth quarter, our rental operations generated $100 million of pre-tax income, $705 million of revenues from the sale of 1,692 single-family rental homes and 868 multi-family rental units. For the full year, our rental operations generated $229 million of pre-tax income on $1.7 billion of revenues from the sale of 3,970 single-family rental homes and 2,202 multifamily rental units. We can continue to operate a merchant-build model in which we construct and sell purpose-built rental communities. Our rental operations provide synergies to our home-building operations by enhancing our purchasing scale and providing opportunities for more efficient utilization of trade, labor, and land parcels. Our rental property inventory at September 30th was $2.9 billion, which consisted of $800 million of single-family rental properties and $2.1 billion of multifamily rental properties. We expect our total rental inventory to remain around the current level for the next several quarters. Jessica? In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, and focus on affordable product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform that sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth, and cash flow while continuing to aggregate market share. We have significant financial flexibility and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation and provide consistently high returns to our shareholders to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton family of employees, land developers, trade partners, vendors, and real estate agents for your continued efforts and hard work. We look forward to working together to improve our operations and provide home ownership opportunities to more individuals and families during 2025. [concludes] (ph) our prepared to remarks. We will now host questions. Yes, Steve. It certainly is a combination of both, but we are seeing our buyers sit on the side lines, sit on the fence. A little less motivated today than they were previously in prior quarters. And affordability has been challenged. We still see consistent traffic. It was below our expectations in the quarter. Hence the results in terms of total sales. But still, we were up year-over-year. I'd say, that for the quarter and our sales were in-line with normal seasonality. I don't think this is a structural issue with demand. There is just a lot of noise in the market today. The rate volatility we've seen combined with the election news that's out there, I just think we are seeing people take a pause. But it certainly is a stretch today, and we got to continue to focus on affordability to make sure we get product and monthly payment and position for our people to move forward. No, we would expect -- and we aren't going to manage our business around that expectation one way or another. We are going to continue to respond to the market as we go week to week and month to month. And we do see efficiency in the smaller plans, and that helps us to position as we enter into the spring market for our ability to deliver. We have purposefully reduced the number of homes we have in the market because of that ability. No significant shift overall, other than we just need to continue to drive to affordable price points and affordable monthly payments. And that comes from a lean towards smaller product. That being said, we still do have our move-up in the freedom buyers that we'll continue to provide what it is that they are looking for in the marketplace. The overall numbers haven't grown significantly. I think with the low number of sales you are seeing, the month's supply continues to expand. But still at the price points that we compete at, we see limited supply across most of our markets. And with people still -- that lock-in effect still impacting people from the low mortgage rate that they have, we are just not seeing that supply grow in a significant way. We still feel very good about our competitive abilities with new home, ability to offer a more attractive rate. And in markets where there is pressure on insurance, we see a consistent and relatively stable insurance premiums which are our competitive advantage against the resale market. As far as the NAR settlement and realtor community response, they seem to have been handling it well. They are largely adjusting to what they need to do to satisfy the requirements of the NAR settlements. I haven't seen much of a significant shift one way or the other in terms of traffic, and/or much change in broker commissions. I think that will play out over time. But again, with the limited number of homes generally available across the market, we still have our realtors that have been consistent in their performance with us, still showing up in our sales office and able to navigate the requirements of the settlement. No. No geographic sensitivity or a place where we've seen those units stack up across the Board and across our footprint. We've seen improvement in our cycle times. And sales being slightly below our expectations in the quarter is why we've seen that increase in completed inventory. We still are not seeing it sit around and age, and that's when we start to get concerned. We do expect that our completed inventory over the next few quarters, we'll start to trend back down. As we've hit the sales pace we need community-backed community and have adjusted starts where we needed to. But we have the homes we are comfortable with today, and we need to adjust that completed number down over the next few quarters. All right. Alan, we do feel very good our position. We are still well ahead of the spring selling season. We do have the lot position. We have the inventory and cycle time improvement that we need to lean into the market if we see a stronger market in the spring. Our operators are always going to have a higher goal than the numbers that we're reaching to, and it's not a significant shift other than a guide as best we see it today. And we are going to stay positioned to respond to the market. We feel great about our position and great about our operators in the field and their ability to gauge the market and lean in should it show up stronger in the spring. It is our expectation. We need to increase our incentives and stay where they are lean in a little more based on rates and achieving affordability for our buyers. So then if want to maintain a bigger spread off of market rates. That's going to cost a little more. But as we look forward into the next quarter, we expect that our incentives will have to remain elevated in order to maintain affordability and monthly payments that our buyers are looking for. Yes. We are really in the 4.5% to 5.5% in terms of our offerings that are out there. Rates have moved up in the last few weeks. We'll see where they settle in over the next couple. That may drift up, but still staying in that 1% to 1.5% kind of below market rates is where we have maintained this past quarter end, and the prior couple of quarters. I do think that the lock-in -- the fact that we don't have a lot of resale homes in the market also means that we don't have those buyers coming in when they sell their house coming into our offices. 45% of our buyers are not first-time homebuyers. Although we sell more than 50% too. Those means they need to move on from their existing home. I don't think there is a lack of want, it's -- or need going out there. So we could be building some pent-up demand. And so we aren't that concerned if we see resale inventory start to rise a little bit because that means people are moving around more, and that's going to provide more buyers into our offices. We are certainly competitive with the resale market today. We do hear that from our realtors, that because of our rate buydowns and availability that we have of house, at more affordable price points, that it's challenged to the resale market. Sue, we have seen lumber come up some recently. And as we look at next year, we are looking for relatively flat stick and brick. We have seen a good response from the labor markets. We see trades looking for business which tends to mean we can hold our costs as relatively flat. So as we kind of look at it all, we aren't sure exactly where lumber goes, as we move over the next several months, but feel like we don't expect much movement up or down in stick and brick over the next -- in 2025. Yes. And I think overall as we look at the market, we still see relatively solid demand in terms of the number of buyers in the market. We've certainly seen a reduction in apartment starts consistently over the past 12 months and feel good about our positioning, and the inventory we have in production, the timing that it's going to come to market. So still feel good about that segment, and we will monitor it quarter-to-quarter in terms of what we do with our starts and positioning on a go-forward basis. Our offering across the market can kind of range in the mid-4 to mid-5. The average in our backlog, I think Jessica alluded to earlier, was just over 5%. Thank you, Tom. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you in January to share our first quarter results. Congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family on a successful fiscal 2024. Due to your efforts, we just completed 23rd consecutive year as the largest builder in the United States. We are honored to represent you on this call, and we look forward to everything we will accomplish together in fiscal 2025."

            "content": "Earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 12% to $3.92 per diluted share compared to $4.45 per share in the prior year quarter. Earnings for the full year increased 4% to $14.34 per diluted share compared to $13.82 in fiscal 2023. Net income for the quarter decreased 15% to $1.3 billion on consolidated revenues of $10 billion. And for the year, net income increased slightly to $4.8 billion on revenues of 36.8 billion. Our fourth quarter home sales revenues were $8.9 billion on 23,647 homes closed compared to $8.8 billion on 22,928 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $377,600, down 1% both sequentially and from the prior year quarter. Bill? Our home building lot position at September 30th consisted of approximately 633,000 lots, of which 24% were owned and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. We remain focused on our relationships with land developers across the country to maximize returns. These relationships allow us to build more homes on lots developed by others. Of the homes we closed during the fourth quarter, 64% were on a lot developed by either 4 Star or a third-party, up from 62% in the prior year quarter. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our fourth quarter home building investments in lots, land, and development totaled $2.2 billion, of which $1.5 billion was for finished lots, $560 million was for land development, and $170 million was for land acquisition. For the year, our home building investments in lots, land, and development totaled $9.5 billion, up 19% from fiscal 2023. Paul? Financial services earn $76 million of pre-tax income in the fourth quarter on $222 million of revenues with a pre-tax profit margin of 34.2%. For the year, financial services earned $311 million of pre-tax income on $883 million of revenues with a pre-tax profit margin of 35.3%. During the fourth quarter, essentially all of our mortgage companies loan originations related to homes closed by our home building operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 77% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 60% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First time home buyers represented 59% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Bill? Matt, I think we are looking at both actually to come into play in 2025. We have seen tremendous improvement in our cycle times over the past year and continuing through the fourth quarter with our lot position that we have, our ability to lean into starts with the market. As we see the market unfold, we'll be able to press into the starts. And we feel really good about our ability to turn that opening housing inventory, what it implies almost 1.5 times in fiscal 2025. Right. Yeah, Carl, I'll take the first part of that question. First of all the hurricanes, just horrified as everyone else was with the impact that had on so many families across those regions. Fortunately, the D.R. Horton family, our employees and our homeowners, fared very well in those storms. We did not have a significant impact on our communities. Thankfully, with the current building codes we build to, we see those communities perform very well in adverse weather events. At the same time, you see the crews responding, utility crews and municipalities focus is diverted to restoring services to residents and rightly so, that can slow down power, electrification for us, it can slow down inspections and some of that processing. But it becomes a timing issue rather than any kind of a permanent effect on the business. So we feel very fortunate as D.R. Horton [or] (ph) the D.R. Horton family got through these storms pretty well. I don't think the guide is reflecting any concern with a given region. The biggest markets that we've been in, Florida and Texas, are also very competitive markets. And so as the buyers have taken a pause that's been reflective I think, across the footprint in those markets. And looking forward into the guide and expectations for next year, that was built largely on the basis of available lots that we have -- that we have a comfort level around starts pace, that we'll lean into as we see spring unfolds. And we have the capacity to adjust that starts pace reflective of the spring selling conditions. I think we saw a pretty choppy sales environment through the quarter. If we look at the chart of the mortgage rates. We started the quarter just under 7%. We ended the quarter just above 6%, and it is a pretty smooth trajectory down. And I think that affected a lot of buyers' psyche and thinking about, wow, the rates are on a good trend. I'm going to keep riding that trend before I jump in. And then lo and behold, we saw October turnaround after the Fed cuts and rates are up 50 basis points in the month of October. So it is kind of crazy predicting interest rates. So hard to see any discernible trend, other than we saw some choppy sales and a buyer that was on pause. I wouldn't -- see change shift in our strategy, it's a kind of a community by community, since we are past the supply chain challenges. We've driven a lot of efficiency into the building process and cycle times. We will allow our local operators to make those decisions community by community about going to more of a presale focus depending upon the customer segment that they're seeking to serve with that particular community and what the market conditions are like. I mean we still see tremendous demand, especially for the first-time homebuyer with the house that can close in 60 days, get them qualified for the mortgage and in-line with when a lease or something may be expiring. We are continually evaluating the product selection that are going into the homes and looking to see where it makes sense to hit the affordability numbers. Neighborhood location can have a lot to do with ultimate affordability as to cost of the underlying dirt, cost of development requirements and what municipalities are asking for, whether it is in horizontal improvements or the homes themselves. And so continually looking for ways to bring houses people can afford in the market. And it's a combination of everything. It's not one thing that we do. It's something we try to get to do every day and be as efficient as possible with our starts program, to work with our trade partners and labor to make sure that they're able to plan a business and share those savings of a planful business with us that we can pass along to our shareholders. I think everybody would be happy the election is over. I think that will help buyer sentiment and the ability to move forward with their life decision. Hard to predict what's going to drive the rates, whether it's the underlying 10-year benchmark or the spreads to treasury. But more than any one given rate, I think stability in rates is most helpful for us in seeing buyers demand and come off the sidelines. So they are not waiting for rates to come down or fearful they are going to escape their ability to afford right now. Stability is good, we saw a tighter trading band in the mortgages in the third quarter, and we have a stronger sales environment. And there's had some seasonality to that as well, but we had more volatility in rates in the fourth quarter, and that was a negative to demand."

            "content": "Our net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased slightly from the prior year quarter to 19,035 homes, and order value decreased 2% to $7.1 billion. The sequential decline in our net sales orders was consistent with the prior year and in-line with normal seasonality from the third to the fourth quarter, but both our home sales and closings this quarter were below our expectations. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 21%, up from 18% sequentially and unchanged from the prior year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was flat sequentially and up 10% from the prior year. The average price of net sales orders in the fourth quarter was $375,400, down 1% sequentially and 2% from the prior year quarter. Jessica? In the fourth quarter, our home building SG&A expenses increased by 17% from last year. And homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.6%, up 100 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. For the year homebuilding SG&A was 7.5% of revenues, up 40 basis points from fiscal 2023. Our increased SG&A costs in both periods are primarily due to the expansion of our operating platform. Our employee and average community count are both up 10% from a year ago, while our market count increased to 125 markets in 36 states from 118 markets in 33 states. Paul? Our capital allocation strategy is disciplined and balanced to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth, and cash flow. We have a strong balance sheet with low leverage and substantial liquidity, which provides us with significant financial flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions and opportunities. During fiscal 2024, our consolidated cash provided by operations was $2.2 billion and we distributed all of the cash we generated through share repurchases and dividends to enhance shareholder returns. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock for $561 million. And for the year, we repurchased 12.5 million shares for $1.8 billion, which reduced our outstanding share count by 3% from the prior year end. Our remaining share repurchase authorization at September 30th was $3.6 billion. During the quarter, we also paid cash dividends of $98 million for a total of $395 million of dividends paid during the year. On September 30th, we had $7.6 billion of consolidated liquidity, consisting of $4.5 billion of cash and $3.1 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities. In August, we issued $700 million of senior notes due 2034. Our debt at September 30th totaled $5.9 billion. Subsequent to year end, we repaid $500 million of senior notes at maturity and we have no additional maturities in fiscal 2025. Our consolidated leverage at September 30th was 18.9% and leverage net of cash was 5.2%. We plan to maintain our leverage around 20% over the long-term. At September 30th, our stockholders equity was $25.3 billion and book value per share was $78.12, up 15% from a year ago. For the year, our return on equity was 19.9%, and our return on assets was 13.9%. Based on our strong financial position and cash flow, our board recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by 33% to $0.40 per share. Jessica? Yes, Steve. Implied in our consolidated revenue guide would be relatively flat rental revenues year-over-year. We would expect those revenues to be weighted a little heavier in the back half of the year than in the first half of the year, and so a little bit lighter in the first quarter as well. In terms of ASP, we are assuming relatively flat ASP with recent trends. Of course, that's going to be subject to market conditions going forward into the spring as well as incentive levels. Yes, that's right, John. The step down in our guide for margin in Q1 is due to higher incentives. And really, we started seeing those higher level incentives later in Q4. Our margin in the month of September was lower than it was in July and August, and we expect that trend to continue into Q1. And it's based on volatility in rates. Where rates have recently gone, the costs of our interest rate buydowns is increasing, and so that's why we expect our incentive levels to increase further into Q1. On a year-over-year basis, do you have some stats, Jessica? Yes. Clearly, we have been making an investment in these new markets to prepare for some growth. And as we grow into that, I would expect those growth rates to moderate a bit. The community count growth has been near double-digit, high single to low double for the last year or so. And so naturally, we'd expect that to start to moderate back towards the mid-single-digit level as well. So yes, we always want to make sure to control our SG&A, but we have been making some investments here recently, that we do expect will support a higher growth level going forward. And then, Eric when rates are volatile or more uncertain, the cost of those incentives do increase. And so regardless of where the level is or how much we're choosing to buy during those periods where it's more uncertain, the cost is just higher. And to the longer-term view, we are talking about a step-down in margin to 22.5%, which is above the high-end of our historic range of margins. So we have been at a higher level. And -- but we are going to meet the market, and there will be periods of times where we need to. We would need a small amount. With the lot cost at the mid-to-high impact on overall price, you need a small amount but not a significant amount because we do expect our stick and brick costs to remain relatively flat."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the former presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Senior Vice President of Communications for D.R. Horton.\nJessica Hansen: Thank you, Paul, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Before we get started, today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K and its most recent quarterly report on Form-10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q early next week. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our Executive Chairman.\nDavid Auld: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. Before we discuss our results, I wanted to take a moment to pay tribute to our Founder, Don Horton, who passed away in May. Don was an incredible man with an unstoppable drive and work ethic that established the foundation and culture of our company. D.R. Horton, the Company would not exist as it does today without Don's tireless pursuit to help as many Americans as possible achieve the dream of home ownership. This simple mission has driven us from the first home that Don built, sold and closed himself more than 45 years ago through the more than 1 million homes our company has provided for families across the country. We are thankful for Don and we and all D.R. Horton employees are beneficiaries of his life's work. Along with our homeowners, customers, contractors, suppliers, land sellers, real estate brokers, and everyone else, Don included, in his family. It is bittersweet to be talking about the company's results publicly for the first time since his passing. Don took great pride in the company's growth, profitability, and shareholder returns, which have been at the top of all public companies in America for the past decade. We will work every day to preserve this legacy and continue to build upon it to improve our operations and the value of our company. We would also like to thank the countless people who contacted us to share their condolences and memories. We received hundreds of messages from employees across the country, and we heard from many industry leaders of other home building companies. Our suppliers, lot developers, bankers, and so many more. On behalf of Don's family and our company, we thank you for the kind words and tributes to a remarkable man. He will be missed. Now I'll turn the call over to Paul Romanowski, our president and CEO.\nPaul Romanowski: Thank you, David, for sharing those words and sentiments about Don on behalf of all of us at D.R. Horton. In addition to David and Jessica, I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the third quarter, the D.R. Horton team delivered solid results, highlighted by earnings of $4.10 per diluted share, which was an increase of 5% from the prior year quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 1% to $1.8 billion on a 2% increase in revenues to $10 billion, with a pre-tax profit margin of 18.1%. During the nine months ended June 30th, we generated $972 million of cash flow from our home building operations and consolidated cash flow of $228 million. Our home building return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30th was 29.5%, and our return on equity for the same period was 21.5%. Although inflation and mortgage interest rates remain elevated, the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points is still limited and the demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable. Homebuyer demand during the spring selling season was good despite continued affordability challenges. With 42,600 homes in inventory and an average selling price of approximately $380,000, we are well positioned to continue consolidating market share. Our average construction cycle times are back to normal and improved from the second quarter, driving additional improvement in our housing inventory turns. We remain focused on enhancing capital efficiency to produce consistent, sustainable returns and to increase our consolidated operating cash flows so that we can return more capital to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. Mike?\nMichael Murray: Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 5% to $4.10 per diluted share compared to $3.90 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter is $1.4 billion on consolidated revenues of $10 billion. Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 6% to $9.2 billion on 24,155 homes closed compared to $8.7 billion on 22,985 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $382,200, up 2% sequentially and up 1% from the prior year quarter. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our net sales orders for the third quarter increased 1% from the prior year to just over 23,000 homes and order value was flat at $8.7 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 18%, up from 15% sequentially and flat with the prior year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 3% sequentially and up 12% year-over-year. The average price of net sales orders in the third quarter was $378,900, which is flat sequentially and down 1% from the prior year quarter. To address affordability, we are still using incentives such as mortgage rate buy downs, and we have reduced the prices and sizes of our homes where necessary. Although our home sales gross margin improved sequentially this quarter, incentives are elevated and we expect them to remain near these levels assuming similar market conditions and no significant changes in mortgage rates. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the third quarter was 24%, up 80 basis points sequentially from the March quarter. Our gross margin was better than expected, primarily due to lower incentive costs than in the second quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were up 2% and stick and brick costs were down 1% in the quarter, while lot costs increased approximately 2.5%. For the fourth quarter, we expect our home sales gross margin to be similar to the third quarter. Further out, our home sales gross margin will continue to be dependent on the strength of new home demand, changes in mortgage rates, and other market conditions. Bill?\nBill Wheat: In the third quarter, our home building SG&A expenses increased by 12% from last year, and home building SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.1%, up 40 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date, homebuilding SG&A was 7.5% of revenues, up 30 basis points from the same period last year, due primarily to the expansion of our operations, including new markets and an increased community count. We will continue to control our SG&A, while ensuring that our platform adequately supports our business. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: We started 21,400 homes in the June quarter and ended the quarter with 42,600 homes in inventory, down 3% from a year ago. 26,200 of our homes at June 30th were unsold. 8,800 of our total unsold homes were completed, of which 990 had been completed for more than six months. For homes we closed in the third quarter, our construction cycle times improved slightly from the second quarter, bringing us below our historical average cycle times. Our faster construction and housing terms allow us to manage our homes and inventory more efficiently. We plan to maintain a sufficient start pace and homes in inventory to meet demand, while remaining focused on improving capital efficiency. Mike?\nMichael Murray: Our home building lot position at June 30th consisted of approximately 630,000 lots, of which, 24% were owned and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. We remain focused on our relationships with land developers across the country to maximize returns. These relationships allow us to build more homes on lots developed by others. Of the homes we closed this quarter, 64% were on a lot developed by either 4 Star or a third party. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our third quarter home building investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.5 billion. Our investments this quarter consisted of $1.4 billion for finished lots, $750 million for land development and $340 million for land acquisition. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: In the third quarter, our rental operations generated $64 million of pre-tax income on $414 million of revenues from the sale of 790 single-family rental homes and 610 multifamily rental units. We continue to operate a merchant-built model, in which we construct purpose-built rental communities and sell them to investors. Our rental operations provide synergies to our home building business by enhancing our purchasing scale and providing opportunities for more efficient utilization of trade labor and land parcels. Our rental property inventory at June 30th was $3.1 billion, which consisted of $1.1 billion of single-family rental properties and $2 billion of multifamily rental properties. We expect our total rental inventory to remain around the current level for the next several quarters. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: 4 Star, our majority-owned residential lot development company, reported revenues of $318 million for the third quarter on 3,255 lots sold with pre-tax income of $52 million. 4 Star's owned and controlled lot position at June 30th was 102,100 lots. 63% of 4 Star's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a write-off first offer to D.R. Horton. $270 million of the finished lots we purchased in the third quarter were from 4 Star. 4 Star had approximately $745 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt to capital ratio of 18.7%. Our strategic relationship with 4 Star is a vital component of our returns-focused business model for our home building and rental operations. For 4 Star's strong, separately capitalized balance sheet, growing operating platform, and lot supply, position them well to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots in the home building industry, and to aggregate significant market share over the next several years. Mike?\nMichael Murray: Financial services earned $91 million in pre-tax income in the third quarter on $242 million of revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 37.7%. During the third quarter, essentially all of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our home building operations. And our mortgage company handled the financing for 78% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 56% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 725 and an average loan to value ratio of 88%. First-time home buyers represented 57% of the closings handled by a mortgage company this quarter. Bill? Bill Wheat Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We have a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity which provides us with the ability to adjust to changing market conditions. During the first nine months of the year, our consolidated cash provided by operations were $228 million, and our home building operations provided $972 million of cash. At June 30th, we had $5.8 billion of consolidated liquidity, consisting of $3 billion of cash and $2.8 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities. Debt at the end of the quarter totaled $5.7 billion with $500 million of senior notes maturing in October, which we expect to refinance. Our consolidated leverage at June 30th was 18.8%, and we plan to maintain our leverage around or slightly below 20% over the long term. At June 30th, our stockholders' equity was $24.7 billion, and book value per share was $75.32, up 18% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended June 30th, our return on equity was 21.5% and our consolidated return on assets was 14.8%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $0.30 per share, totaling $99 million. And our board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level to be paid in August. We repurchased 3 million shares of common stock for $441 million during the quarter. Our fiscal year-to-date stock repurchases through June increased by over 60% from the same period last year to $1.2 billion, which reduced our outstanding share count by 3% from a year ago. Based on our strong financial position and expectation for increased cash flows, our board recently approved a new share repurchase authorization totaling $4 billion. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: For the fourth quarter, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of $10 billion to $10.4 billion and homes closed by our home building operations to be in the range of 24,000 to 24,500 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be around 24%, and home-building SG&A as a percentage of revenues to be approximately 7%. We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin of around 35% in the fourth quarter, and we expect our quarterly income tax rate to be approximately 24% to 24.3%. For the full year of fiscal 2024, we now expect to generate consolidated revenues of $36.8 to $37.2 billion and expect homes closed by our home building operations to be in the range of 90,000 to 90,500 homes. We continue to expect to generate approximately $3 billion of cash flow from our home building operations in fiscal 2024. Finally, we now plan to repurchase approximately $1.8 billion of our common stock for the full year in addition to annual dividend payments of around $400 million. We plan to provide guidance for fiscal 2025 in October when we report our fourth quarter earnings and after we have completed our annual budgeting process with our operators. We expect to be positioned to increase our market share further next year. We also expect to generate increased cash flow from operations in fiscal 2025, which we plan to utilize to increase our returns to shareholders through proportionately higher share repurchases and dividends. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, and focus on affordable product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform that sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth, and cash flow, while continuing to aggregate market share. We have significant financial flexibility and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation by providing consistently high returns to our shareholders to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton family of employees, land developers, trade partners, vendors, and real estate agents for your continued efforts and hard work. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from John Lovallo from UBS. John, your line is live.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is, absorptions were somewhat worse than normal seasonality I would suggest. I know there's been some noise in normal seasonality over the past few years. But margin was 50 basis points above the high end of your outlook at 24%. So I guess the question is, did you guys focus more on profitability per home versus maintaining the sales pace, maybe as rates rose in April? And along those lines, absorptions tend to decline, call it, 15%, maybe a little bit more percent quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter. How are you thinking about this kind of the seasonality in the fourth quarter?\nPaul Romanowski: Yes, John. We continue to balance price and pace to drive the returns that we're looking for community by community. We saw choppiness through the quarter in demand as you saw fluctuation in interest rates and we responded accordingly. We did maintain incentives, but didn't lean in too hard and I think that's where you saw the result in the overall sales pace, but still feel good about our position, about the backlog we have, and the opportunity to perform on our guidance for the full year.\nJohn Lovallo: Got it. Yes, it was a good outcome. And then maybe the next question is in the Southeast, which obviously encompasses Florida and South Central, which has Texas in it. Orders were a little bit lighter than what we were looking for. And I think when we spoke in the quarter, Paul, it seemed that the pickup in existing home inventory in those markets was characterized as more of a normalization than a glut. I think the thought was that the age of the existing housing stock and the price points just weren't that competitive with DHS product. How are you thinking about existing home inventory in those two markets specifically today? And did higher inventory negatively impact the orders in the quarter? Thank you.\nPaul Romanowski: I think similar to what we've seen last quarter and through today. Yes, inventory continues to increase, not just in Florida, but across the markets. But we still feel good about our competitive advantage, especially in the price points that we operate in and with the incentive package and opportunity with being able to be flexible on rates. And so, I don't think that some of the flatness in sales that you saw across those regions was significantly impacted by increase in inventory, and we still feel good about the demand, just not as vibrant as it was in prior quarters.\nJohn Lovallo: Great. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl, your line is live.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Once again, for me, as I expressed to you all privately, my condolences on [DRS] (ph) passing. I'm really very sorry for your loss, and the industry's too. So that said, John took one of my questions, but I wanted to ask about inter-quarter sales and closings. I think it was over 50% last quarter. I'm curious what it is this quarter. And given that you're back to really normalized cycle times and you've got a good amount of inventory heading into Q4 and into next year. What's your guess sort of long term as to sort of the sales closings inter-quarter level is going to be on a go forward basis?\nPaul Romanowski: I think we've seen with the volatile interest rate environment a choppy traffic pattern. When rates move, the traffic patterns are impacted and we saw that through the quarter. I think we ended the quarter with better traffic patterns, better demand and felt that coming into July. What we would also see is that, people are trying to have interest rate certainty when they're buying a home, and so homes that are closer to completion are more attractive, because they can get into a better interest rate that we can help them with on our [Builder Forward] (ph) program. And at the same time, that means they're buying a little bit later and so we're seeing a high level of homes sold and closed in the same quarter. We're focused on a start space to drive a closings number and the sales are going to occur between those two things.\nCarl Reichardt: Okay. And then one of the elements you guys have talked about in the past, I think it's still in your deck, is this idea of getting your cash in and out of land deals in 24 months. And I'm kind of curious as you're looking at deals going forward here, obviously, we've seen entitlements, lot development times take longer and longer. Is that still realistic to expect that as you underwrite you're going to see that? And maybe what percentage of your current communities right now have hit that goal of getting your cash in and out within 24 months of those transactions. Thanks, all.\nPaul Romanowski: Carl, yes, that has been a standard of us on underwriting for several years, and we intend to hold to that. We really aren't looking to own that land until it's shovel ready. So although the entitlement may take longer, we are positioning ourselves in expectation of that time so that we can have properties under contract and/or third party development partners involved to help. And so the more lots that we have, more homes that we're building on lots that were developed by a third-party developer, makes it easier for us to maintain that 24 month cashback. So we don't always hit it. We'd love to say we do. But reality sets in sometimes, but it's absolutely an underwriting standard that we intend to hold on to.\nCarl Reichardt: Great. Appreciate it, guys. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is live.\nStephen Kim: Yes, thanks very much, guys. Let me also echo what Carl was -- Carl's sentiments about DR. Really a great man, and it was a real pleasure to work with him all those years. I do want to ask about your cash flow commentary, which I found very encouraging, both in terms of the remaining quarter you have this year and then also your intimations about next year. I think you said you were looking to increase -- you expected or hoped to increase free cash flow next year and, obviously, deploy that maybe more towards repurchases and dividends. So just leaning into that a little bit more, your guidance has typically been around home building, operating cash flow where rental and 4 Star have kind of been offsets to that. So your consolidated free cash flow is obviously being a little lower than your -- or meaningfully lower than your home building cash flow. But you said, I think I heard you right, that the rental inventory is going to remain consistent going forward. So does that mean that going forward your home building operating cash flow is going to be much closer to your consolidated? And when you talk about hoping to increase your free cash flow, are you talking home building or you talking -- or can we say, now that's pretty much consolidated free cash flow increasing next year?\nMichael Murray: Thanks, Steve. Thanks for asking this question. This helps us clarify this. Yes, we are talking about consolidated cash flow. And going forward into fiscal 2025, we would anticipate any future guidance that we provide on cash flow will be based on a consolidated basis. With our rental inventory now flattening out, stabilizing within a range around the current level, we would anticipate that our consolidated cash flow will be much nearer to the home building cash flow level. There won't be as much of an offset from home building cash flow from rental. 4 Star is consolidated in our financials. We would expect them to continue to use cash flow, but just as a reminder, they're totally separately capitalized, so it really doesn't impact the cash flow we have available to utilize for shareholder returns. But with the sharp improvement in our cycle times this past year. Our inventory turns have improved. We expect that improvement to continue into next year. So the efficiency in our home building operation is improving and therefore the cash flow generation from our income should continue to improve. With stabilization and rental, we do expect an increased level of consolidated cash flow next year. And then that's reflected in the increased share repurchase authorization that our board authorized that we'll be utilizing going forward as we expect to see proportionally higher share repurchases and dividends being paid out of that cash flow.\nStephen Kim: Well, that all sounds pretty great. So thanks for that. That does also segue very nicely to my next question, which relates to your levels of spec inventory and backlog turns that we can expect. Your guidance for the fourth quarter closings implies a fairly high level of backlog turnover. And I'm wondering if you can give us a sense for what is a comfortable level of backlog turn that we can expect going forward? Is what we're seeing this year kind of -- can we expect kind of a similar level on a going forward basis? And tied to that, your spec inventory, I think you're running at like 26 total specs per community. Oh, actually, you don't report to the community. Let me put it this way. Whatever your spec levels are per community, where they are today? Is that about what we can expect on a go-forward basis, both on a total basis and on a finished basis? Or if you can give us some color there on terms of what is a target range for finished specs and normal specs and backlog turnover ratio?\nJessica Hansen: Sure, that was a lot to unpack Steve, but I'll do my best to answer all of your questions. So on the latter part, there really is no global expectation for number of specs. We run the business as you know, community by community. And so, our operators are adjusting based on their sales environment in each individual community in terms of what they're starting and how many specs they're going to carry based on their sales run rate that they're experiencing. And so they can adjust very quickly to current market conditions in terms of either slowing down or speeding up, assuming we have the finished lot position to do so. So that kind of just rolls up from the bottoms up perspective. We're very comfortable with where we are today. As I think Paul's remarks on the call said, we're selling homes still later in construction. And to one of Mike's earlier points that we -- buyers want a certainty of close. And so, the 60 to 90 days of being able to lock the rate, we're very comfortable with our completed spec position today. And it is allowing us to run at much higher backlog conversion rates than we have historically. We don't really focus on backlog conversion. We focus on turning our houses and not running with an excess supply of completed specs that have been sitting for an extended period of time unsold. And so, that's really our focus is on continuing to turn our houses faster. And as long as those completed specs aren't aged for an extended period of time, we're very comfortable running with the levels we're at today.\nStephen Kim: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan. Mike, your line is live.\nMichael Rehaut: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And I also wanted to express my condolences on the loss of D.R. Obviously, a great leader and visionary for the industry, and he'll be sorely missed. I wanted to start off my first question just on some of the comments you made around, I think earlier you said there was some choppiness during the quarter, obviously, with rates earlier in the quarter being a little higher. At the same time, you talked about incentives maybe being a little less than you expected and that drove the gross margin upside. I was just kind of curious as rates maybe subsided a little bit or came down perhaps to the lower end of their range that we've seen in the last 345 months, if any of that choppiness has subsided? And it appears that maybe incentives are similar as you see them going in 4Q versus 3Q, but if it's had any impact on either incentives or just more broadly demand trends as those rates have come in a little bit in the last month or so.\nJessica Hansen: Obviously, any pullback in rates, we would call beneficial, and we would expect to have some relief on the incentive front, as incentives are able to be reduced, or at least the cost of the incentive that we're offering. But we are still balancing that with just overall affordability issues in the market today. And we do continue to experience higher lot costs, which is why our guide for Q4 would be a relatively flat gross margin. Because even if we do have the ability to pull back on incentive costs to some extent, we do have cost pressures particularly on the lot side.\nMichael Rehaut: Okay. No, that's helpful and makes sense. Also maybe just along this line of questioning, in the prepared remarks you highlighted that you reduced prices and sizes of homes to a degree over, and I don't know if that was specific to the quarter, or just more broadly over the last several quarters. But we'd love to get a little more clarity around that comment, and maybe just more broadly, obviously, we can see the closing ASP and backlog ASP, but just kind of curious, obviously, there's a mix that impacts those numbers. Maybe just give us a sense of percent of homes that you've either lowered or reduced prices, and by how much? By contrast, if there's been a percent of homes or communities that where you've raised prices or sizes and how to think about the ASP for the business going forward into 2025?\nMichael Murray: Yes, it's a lot there in that question, Mike. So in total, our average house size is down about 2% from a year ago and about flat sequentially. And you're right, that is a mixed reflection of what our operators are choosing to start in a given community and the communities that they're planning to come online. And we might be moving to a few more town home communities to try to meet affordability targets for a given sub-market. With regard to pricing increases or price decreases, that's occurring very much week to week at a community level by our operators as they're gauging their market demand, their inventory conditions, and their future lot supply. So we feel really good about those teams making the right decision, and we really don't aggregate up and say we had 14% of the communities make a price increase, 20% a decrease, everybody else was flat, we just don't look at those numbers at a high level here. We tend to look at are we turning our housing inventory and are we driving returns community by community the best we can.\nMichael Rehaut: Great, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Matthew, your line is live.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to go back to the comment around finished spec. I think you were clear that you were intentionally selling homes later in the construction cycle for a lot of obvious reasons. But obviously the number of finished spec did rise sequentially. Your starts did come down sequentially. I'm trying to understand if there is any kind of signal we should take from that around sort of the state of demand and with finished spec being higher, is there an implication to how we should think about margins going forward to the extent you have to clear some of that with either incentives or price? Thank you.\nPaul Romanowski: Yes, Matthew. I think that some of that, what you've seen is increase in completed specs as we have seen consistent improvement in our cycle times. So those homes are moving through the construction at a faster pace, which means they're reaching completion sooner. So even though we may still be selling those homes later in the construction process, it now allows us to sell them with a closer certainty. So we'll cycle through that. We don't worry a lot about how many of them exactly as a percentage are completed. As Jessica pointed out earlier, it's more focused on are they sitting once they reach completion. So as they age, that tends to be an indicator that we've seen slower absorption or demand community by community. So we're focused on maintaining housing inventory levels that we need in each community. And we're going to moderate that with starts either increase or pullback based on demand, assuming we have lots in front of us that we need to continue the pace that we're looking for. We're very comfortable with the housing inventory that we have. We don't have a buildup of aged inventory and feel good about that going into the fourth quarter.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Okay, that's very clear, Paul. Thanks for that. Secondly, I noticed, you mentioned earlier in the quarter that stick and brick were down -- costs were down sequentially on a per square foot basis. I'm curious as we think about that fourth quarter margin guide of flat sequentially, I mean is the expectation that stick and brick is continuing to come down further into the next quarter? And I guess what specifically in terms of construction costs are you actually able to press down on? Thank you.\nPaul Romanowski: I think we're looking for effectively flat stick and brick cost. We've gotten a lot of the tailwind out of the lumbered price decreases coming through and I think we're coming to a more consistent level there. The balance of our stick and brick costs, we're probably seeing some pressing for increases, some that we're able to make some progress with in various markets as start have pulled back, people have come looking for work, it may be a little bit sharper pencil coming in trying to get the next neighborhood or the next phase of starts. So we expect some flat stick and brick will probably see an escalation in the lot cost going forward into the fourth quarter. And then, the ultimate margin is going to determine based upon what the concession levels are like in the fourth quarter. And since a significant portion of our closings in the fourth quarter will be sold in that quarter, north of 40%. That will heavily drive the ultimate margin. That's why we felt very comfortable looking at a flat margin environment Q3 to Q4.\nMatthew Bouley: All right. Thanks, everyone. Good luck.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman. Alan, your line is live.\nAlan Ratner: Hey guys. Good morning. And I also share my condolences to you and to D.R.\u2019s family on his passing of the quarter. So thank you for all the great info so far. We've heard from some other builders and also just other consumer facing companies about some deterioration, I guess, in the credit quality of the consumer recently over the last handful of months, we've seen savings rates on the decline. You guys have done a fantastic job keeping your price point low when you walk through all the drivers of that, but I'm just curious if you can provide some insight into what you are seeing from the consumer today in terms of their ability to qualify, funds for down payment, credit card debt, etc. Any color there would be great.\nJessica Hansen: Well, with our can rate still being around 18%, we feel very comfortable about the buyers that are making their way into our sales offices and their ability to qualify. A historical cancellation rate for us would be high teens to low 20s. And so we're at the low end actually of a comfortable cancellation rate. On what we closed this quarter, a very strong FICO at 725 I think for the second quarter consistently. The only noticeable difference in terms of the buyers that were ultimately selling and closing to is that their average income has, of course, unfortunately had to continue to rise because of the interest rate environment today. So on a household income basis, we were at roughly, I think it was the first quarter, it rounded up to $100,000. $99.9 is the average household income on the buyers who utilize our mortgage company and closed in a home in the third quarter. And so, that's really the only noticeable difference is that, buyers coming into our sales offices today do have to have higher income to be able to qualify. But in terms of what we're selling and closing, no noticeable deterioration in those credit metrics. Everything has been very stable.\nAlan Ratner: That's great to hear. Appreciate that, Jessica. And second, a really positive commentary on the cash flow and capital allocation. I think that that's going to certainly excite investors. If I look at your last several years, you've been buying back around 3% of your shares each year, or at least reducing your share count by that amount. Some other builders have been a bit higher than that. It certainly sounds like you're looking to take that a bit higher here. Is there a target you could give us just to think about where that can go on an annualized basis, could you be in the kind of mid to high single digit range? I know you have the authorization in place, but it doesn't really give us a lot of insight into kind of what timing you expect to utilize that.\nPaul Romanowski: Yes, it does not have an expiration date. Our last authorization was issued in our first quarter, so that one lasted about nine months. Typically, they've been in the 12-month range, but we're not providing specific cash flow or repurchase guidance for 2025 as of yet. As we just commented, we want to go through our budgeting process before we provide that specific guidance. But we do expect that as cash flow does provide a significant increase next year, we will increase our repurchases and dividends proportionately to that. So we do expect it to be a meaningful step up in the level of repurchases. And the reduction in share count will be a function of really where our share price is as well in combination with that, because we're allocating and ultimately we will be in the market, we'll repurchase shares that we're able to get with those dollars. But we would expect the reduction in share count to be greater next year than it has been the last few years.\nAlan Ratner: Understood. Appreciate it. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Eric, your line is live.\nEric Bosshard: Thanks. Two things. First of all, to circle back to the choppiness on demand relative to the movement in rates. I'm just curious how much of the orders now are using a rate buy-down? And I guess I would have thought with the rate buy-down prevalence, there'd be less visibility and influence on consumers as a result of that. Can you just help me understand that a little bit better?\nJessica Hansen: Yes, we actually saw a slight pick-up in the number of buyers getting the permanent rate buy down, which is the vast majority of what we're offering in the market today. Of the buyers that utilize our mortgage company, it was roughly 77%. I think that translates to about 60% of the overall business, give or take. And that was up slightly from the second quarter and it was up more significantly from a year ago.\nPaul Romanowski: I think there's a lot of noise in the marketplace when rates were moving and rates were moving up and that affects I think our perspective buyer behavior as to whether or not they're even going to come into the sales office and talk to us. Once they come into the sales office and they understand what's available to them, they might have had an expectation that I got to make a 7% mortgage rate work in my budget and they come in and we're able to put them in something different at a different monthly payment, it opens our eyes up quite a bit to what's possible. And so, the struggle becomes the traffic patterns. If we get the traffic, we're pretty good at conversion, but sometimes all the headline noise on uninterest rates can depress the traffic.\nEric Bosshard: And then secondly, if Florida has been an important and successful market, sounds like it continues to be both. Curious if you could just dig a little bit more into for us what's going on there in terms of traffic and price sensitivity and what you're doing or what your communities there are doing in response to that that position of business to continue to grow.\nPaul Romanowski: Yes, Florida has been an important market to us and we certainly continue to see in migration. People love to live in Florida, want to be there, but affordability is challenged like it is across the country. And so we've seen significant rise in prices in Florida and across the country and with interest rates sticking where they have, it's certainly taxing. And that Jessica spoke to, the real change in buyers is they just need to make a little more to afford homes at a static sales price in a higher interest rate environment. And I think that that's really what we're seeing on the impact of sales in Florida, not so much significant change in traffic and/or basic demand or want. It's a matter of continuing to provide the right house at the right affordable price point that reaches as many people as possible and that's what we continue to strive to do as we position our new communities.\nEric Bosshard: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Sam Reid from Wells Fargo. Sam, your line is live.\nSam Reid: Awesome, thanks so much. So, wanting to touch on your rental business. One of your bigger competitors is looking to do more in the space, but they're also approaching it from perhaps a less capital intensive standpoint. So first, maybe talk through the implications as more builders enter the rental space or the build to rent space, I guess, I should say. But second, are there opportunities to recapitalize this segment longer term, perhaps run it with more third party capital. It sounds like your rental inventories are right sized for now, but just curious if there's room down the road to rethink the approach to capital structure here? Thanks.\nPaul Romanowski: Yes, as we continue to grow in this business, we're continually looking at ways to not only capitalize, but how we want to execute in this space. And I think from a single family for rent basis, we've become more efficient with the capital and how we produce and sell these communities. And I think that's some of what you're seeing in our moderation of growth in the inventory levels that we expect to see consistency of the investment level that we have out there. And so we still see strong demand. We still see an under supply and an ability to meet the demand of what's out there. So it's going to maintain, we're going to continue to be focused on it ourselves and be as efficient as we can with that capital.\nSam Reid: That's helpful. And then, switching gears to community count, it gives us double digits still in Q3, if I'm not mistaken, and it's really been strong throughout 2024. I believe in the past you've indicated you expect that growth to slow, and I know you're not providing guidance, obviously, for 2025, but curious if there's a level of community account growth that you'll need to sustain next year in order to hit those market share gain aspirations. Thanks.\nJessica Hansen: Sure, Sam. And the great thing is, the position of strength we're coming from in terms of --even if we grow sub 10%, we're generally growing the size of a top 10 builder and consolidating share regardless. But I think we have tried to get across the point the last couple of quarters that we do believe going forward more of our growth is going to come from community count. Whereas really for most of this cycle outside of the early years it's been coming from increased absorption. So we do recognize that to continue to grow, we're going to continue to need those increased communities. Some of that's come through our increased market count, which has expanded dramatically over the last several years. And we've still got a hit list of quite a few additional markets to enter into. And we're continuing to work on our finished lot position to where we can get those new flags open sooner. I think what we said last quarter does still hold though. Within the next quarter or two, I think our community count is going to moderate. It won't be up double digit, but I think we're hopeful we can continue to maintain it in at least a mid to maybe high single digit increase for some period of time. And then at some point it may not have to grow to mid to high. It may just be a low to mid. As you already kind of indicated though, it's one of the hardest things for us to talk about and get right, because there's so many moving pieces to either bringing on a new community or closing out one in terms of sales pace. So we don't ever give specific guidance, but that's our best estimate as we sit here today.\nSam Reid: Well, thanks so much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Anthony, your line is live.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning. Can you talk about what lot costs were in the quarter, maybe mix-adjusted? And then, based on the prices for land that you've been buying and expectations for stronger cash in 2025, should we expect a lot cost inflation to maybe kind of normalize a bit in fiscal 2025? Could it kind of go back down to low single digit or mid-single digit or just any thoughts on those lot cost trends?\nPaul Romanowski: Yes, we have continued to see increase in our lot cost and slight increases as a percentage of overall revenue. We don't expect to see that moderate significantly. I don't know whether that settles in at high singles, low double digits, but we do expect that to be a headwind for us. As the reality of the cost to put a lot on the ground, we just haven't seen much relief in that. And so, we expect to see a continued decline.\nJessica Hansen: In terms of the specific, since you asked for that on a per square foot basis, as I said on the call, sequentially we were up about 2.5% on a lot cost basis. Year-over-year we were still up low double digit percentage, which would still have some mixed impact that we've continued to talk to in terms of the South Central and Southeast making up a slightly lower percentage of our closings, and those are generally lower lot cost markets. And to kind of give you another data point, we typically talk about in terms of just the percentage of home sales revenue that our lot cost averages, it generally is in a 20% to 25% range pretty consistently. And we're right in the heart of that range today, even with the increased lot cost we've been experiencing.\nAnthony Pettinari: Got it. That's very helpful. And then just -- 4 Star is obviously a major source of developed lots for you, but putting aside 4 Star, could you just touch on the kind of the health of your land banking pipeline and partners?\nMichael Murray: Yeah, I wouldn't necessarily refer to it as a land banking pipeline. I'd refer to it as a lot developers pipeline. It's a large collection of very seasoned, experienced land development companies across the country that have had to -- frankly, they've had to look for some different capital sources and we've been able to help them find some other capital sources as a lot of the regional and community banks have pulled back from that sort of lending, but there's been other capital sources willing to step up when the developer is working for somebody like D.R. Horton, that we've been able to keep those folks in business producing lots for us. And 64% of our closings this quarter came on lots developed by someone else besides D.R. Horton, and that's a great part of our business strategy.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay, that's very helpful. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Buck, your line is live.\nBuck Horne: Thank you. Good morning. My question is just a quick one on 4 Star and just if there's an update on the longer-term plan for what to do with 4 Star or is there a thought to eventually recapitalize that so that 4 Star could eventually be deconsolidated?\nPaul Romanowski: Yes, 4 Star is a very important part of our strategy with them being separately capitalized. They are able to support their growth with their own capital sources. And so, it does not have any offset on the cash available for the parent company and our shareholders. And they're growing their platform. And so, we are working alongside them as they grow their platform. They're now in about 60 markets, I believe, so roughly half of the markets that D.R. Horton is in. So they've still got a lot of opportunities to grow that platform. And so, our focus right now is to continue to work with them as they grow, improve their operations, get as efficient as they can at delivering lots to us and to the industry. And then as they mature, they're raising capital. I would expect them to continue to raise capital over time. And so, as that capital structure ultimately matures, then that will give us the visibility to be able to make the determinations on what we do in terms of our investment. And so, obviously, we made an additional investment to buy majority stake and we have not contributed or needed to contribute any additional capital to 4 Star and don't expect that we will need to going forward. But there will be an opportunity at some point down the line to look at their capitalization when they're at a more mature level.\nBuck Horne: Got it. Got it. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And quickly on the rental operations, in terms of the current inventory balance, it kind of looks like it's about one-third single-family rental, about two-thirds multifamily. Is that the right mix for how you think the inventory is going to track going forward, or do you think at some point, given the amount of multifamily inventory that's out there right now, do you think it shifts more towards the SFR weighting?\nPaul Romanowski: I think near-term, our expectation based on the pipeline that we have of deals is the weighting towards multifamilies probably a little bit higher in the near term, the next few quarters. Over the long term, I would expect that to balance out a little bit more than where it is today as FSR picks back up. But near term, probably a little bit heavier multifamily.\nBuck Horne: Okay. Is like 50-50 the right optimal balance kind of where you'd like to get it to?\nPaul Romanowski: We don't have a set level necessarily. It's whatever the market demand is and whatever we believe the best mix is for returns community by community across our markets.\nBuck Horne: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Susan, your line is live.\nSusan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question is, you mentioned that the cycle times have actually moved below your normalized levels historically. Can you talk about where you saw that improvement come from? And how sustainable do you think that is, especially if we do see a world where perhaps rates come down and activity picks up on a relative basis?\nPaul Romanowski: Yes, we've seen that mostly from -- we don't really have supply chain challenges. That has largely healed and we have the parts and pieces we need to build. And labor has strengthened. We've seen -- with our consistent production and market scale, we have the labor that we need and job site maintenance and controls and efficiency, just all of that kind of coming together. And that's where you've seen our cycle times drop a little bit below our historical norms. We continue to focus on being more efficient with the construction process and something we're focused on every day.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. That's helpful. And then perhaps turning to the M&A environment. Can you talk a bit about what you're seeing there? Has anything changed in how that pipeline is looking today?\nMichael Murray: We still prefer small tuck-in acquisitions. We like things that will either expand our footprint in a new and emerging geography, where we can acquire some people along with the lot position in other places. It becomes oftentimes a homes and construction, finished lot [indiscernible]. And then we were able to work with the selling principle to stay in the business as a lot entitler and developer. And that's been a very successful strategy for us in creating a lot development partners around the country as well. Still see good flow of deals to look at, but I would say we're pretty selective on what we're willing to do right now.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. All right. Thank you for the color, and good luck with everything.\nMichael Murray: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America. Rafe, your line is live.\nRafe Jadrosich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and I'll add my condolences on D.R. Just going back to your earlier comments on price and pace and then targeting market share gains for 2025. If I look at your starts in the quarter, they're down -- they're tracking down year-over-year. The census single family starts are up 7% quarter-over-quarter in the second quarter. Your margin was higher though. Has there been a strategy shift at all? Why not incentivize or push orders more at this gross margin level? And then my second question would be, how do we think about the start to pace going forward relative to your plan for market share gains?\nPaul Romanowski: Yes, no change in strategy, Rafe. We are seeing efficiencies in our operation, which is why you've seen a little lower start pace than maybe might have been expected. But as we continue to move through this market, we're going to have to see some improvement in the overall, or increase, I guess, if you will, in the overall starts pace to keep pace with our growth goals. But it's really just us managing our inventory, making sure we have that we need community by community to hit the price and pace goals that we're looking for. And we'll manage that inventory based on our ability to get those homes moved through the construction process and based on availability of lot, community by community in front of us.\nRafe Jadrosich: Thank you. And then just on the -- for the fourth quarter gross margin guidance, a flat quarter-over-quarter, it sounds like you're expecting net price to be flatish with incentives. You talked about stick and brick being flatish and then land is up. What is -- is there another piece in there that's going to be giving you relief on the cost side, like what's happening with broker, commission, or mix to get to that flat quarter-over-quarter?\nPaul Romanowski: As we look -- as we're going into the quarter here, obviously, we've had some rate volatility. We did see sequential ASP growth, and so there's probably a little bit of price. We saw a little bit of our cost of our incentives go down sequentially this quarter, so there's probably a little bit of an assumption, a little bit of price, a little bit of incentive cost reduction in the quarter to offset the lot cost increase.\nRafe Jadrosich: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Mike, your line is live.\nMichael Dahl: Thanks for squeezing in. Just to follow up on Rafe's question about kind of the price versus pace, sorry to hit it again, but I guess from a more near-term standpoint was the decision to not lean in more heavily on incentives because at the time there was rate volatility, you didn't -- your perception was that there just wouldn't be a sufficient demand response or anything else you can give as far as just during the quarter. It did sound like you kind of made a decision not to push more aggressively.\nPaul Romanowski: We aren't making that decision here on a broad scale. I wish we were good enough to know which way rates were going to go. But we rely on our operators at a community level to make those decisions based on the traffic volume that they have and the sales demand and the people and buyers that they have in front of them on a daily basis. And I think, overall, what that resulted in is a solid margin for us and sales that seasonally didn't increase maybe like they would, but we're in a good place with the sales pace that we achieved in the quarter and the inventory we have to hit our guidance for the year.\nMichael Dahl: Got it, got it. Okay. And then on the rental business, just specifically on the fourth quarter, obviously, the last three quarters, it's been a volatile environment to sell either SFR or multifamily. Can you talk more specifically about what your expectations are for fourth quarter for the rental platform?\nPaul Romanowski: Yes, the rental is baked into our consolidated revenue guide and there is uncertainty around timing of closings of rental deals. So there's a little bit of lumpiness in those numbers, but that's built into the range that we're providing in a revenue guide, but no other specific guidance on the Q4 revenues from rental.\nMichael Dahl: Okay. All right.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude our Q&A session today. I would like to hand the call back to Paul Romanowski for closing remarks.\nPaul Romanowski: Thank you, Paul. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our fourth quarter results in October. Congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family on producing a solid third quarter. We are honored to represent you on this call and greatly appreciate all that you do.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, David, for sharing those words and sentiments about Don on behalf of all of us at D.R. Horton. In addition to David and Jessica, I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the third quarter, the D.R. Horton team delivered solid results, highlighted by earnings of $4.10 per diluted share, which was an increase of 5% from the prior year quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 1% to $1.8 billion on a 2% increase in revenues to $10 billion, with a pre-tax profit margin of 18.1%. During the nine months ended June 30th, we generated $972 million of cash flow from our home building operations and consolidated cash flow of $228 million. Our home building return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30th was 29.5%, and our return on equity for the same period was 21.5%. Although inflation and mortgage interest rates remain elevated, the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points is still limited and the demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable. Homebuyer demand during the spring selling season was good despite continued affordability challenges. With 42,600 homes in inventory and an average selling price of approximately $380,000, we are well positioned to continue consolidating market share. Our average construction cycle times are back to normal and improved from the second quarter, driving additional improvement in our housing inventory turns. We remain focused on enhancing capital efficiency to produce consistent, sustainable returns and to increase our consolidated operating cash flows so that we can return more capital to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. Mike? We started 21,400 homes in the June quarter and ended the quarter with 42,600 homes in inventory, down 3% from a year ago. 26,200 of our homes at June 30th were unsold. 8,800 of our total unsold homes were completed, of which 990 had been completed for more than six months. For homes we closed in the third quarter, our construction cycle times improved slightly from the second quarter, bringing us below our historical average cycle times. Our faster construction and housing terms allow us to manage our homes and inventory more efficiently. We plan to maintain a sufficient start pace and homes in inventory to meet demand, while remaining focused on improving capital efficiency. Mike? In the third quarter, our rental operations generated $64 million of pre-tax income on $414 million of revenues from the sale of 790 single-family rental homes and 610 multifamily rental units. We continue to operate a merchant-built model, in which we construct purpose-built rental communities and sell them to investors. Our rental operations provide synergies to our home building business by enhancing our purchasing scale and providing opportunities for more efficient utilization of trade labor and land parcels. Our rental property inventory at June 30th was $3.1 billion, which consisted of $1.1 billion of single-family rental properties and $2 billion of multifamily rental properties. We expect our total rental inventory to remain around the current level for the next several quarters. Jessica? In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, and focus on affordable product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform that sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth, and cash flow, while continuing to aggregate market share. We have significant financial flexibility and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation by providing consistently high returns to our shareholders to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton family of employees, land developers, trade partners, vendors, and real estate agents for your continued efforts and hard work. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Yes, John. We continue to balance price and pace to drive the returns that we're looking for community by community. We saw choppiness through the quarter in demand as you saw fluctuation in interest rates and we responded accordingly. We did maintain incentives, but didn't lean in too hard and I think that's where you saw the result in the overall sales pace, but still feel good about our position, about the backlog we have, and the opportunity to perform on our guidance for the full year. I think similar to what we've seen last quarter and through today. Yes, inventory continues to increase, not just in Florida, but across the markets. But we still feel good about our competitive advantage, especially in the price points that we operate in and with the incentive package and opportunity with being able to be flexible on rates. And so, I don't think that some of the flatness in sales that you saw across those regions was significantly impacted by increase in inventory, and we still feel good about the demand, just not as vibrant as it was in prior quarters. I think we've seen with the volatile interest rate environment a choppy traffic pattern. When rates move, the traffic patterns are impacted and we saw that through the quarter. I think we ended the quarter with better traffic patterns, better demand and felt that coming into July. What we would also see is that, people are trying to have interest rate certainty when they're buying a home, and so homes that are closer to completion are more attractive, because they can get into a better interest rate that we can help them with on our [Builder Forward] (ph) program. And at the same time, that means they're buying a little bit later and so we're seeing a high level of homes sold and closed in the same quarter. We're focused on a start space to drive a closings number and the sales are going to occur between those two things. Carl, yes, that has been a standard of us on underwriting for several years, and we intend to hold to that. We really aren't looking to own that land until it's shovel ready. So although the entitlement may take longer, we are positioning ourselves in expectation of that time so that we can have properties under contract and/or third party development partners involved to help. And so the more lots that we have, more homes that we're building on lots that were developed by a third-party developer, makes it easier for us to maintain that 24 month cashback. So we don't always hit it. We'd love to say we do. But reality sets in sometimes, but it's absolutely an underwriting standard that we intend to hold on to. Yes, Matthew. I think that some of that, what you've seen is increase in completed specs as we have seen consistent improvement in our cycle times. So those homes are moving through the construction at a faster pace, which means they're reaching completion sooner. So even though we may still be selling those homes later in the construction process, it now allows us to sell them with a closer certainty. So we'll cycle through that. We don't worry a lot about how many of them exactly as a percentage are completed. As Jessica pointed out earlier, it's more focused on are they sitting once they reach completion. So as they age, that tends to be an indicator that we've seen slower absorption or demand community by community. So we're focused on maintaining housing inventory levels that we need in each community. And we're going to moderate that with starts either increase or pullback based on demand, assuming we have lots in front of us that we need to continue the pace that we're looking for. We're very comfortable with the housing inventory that we have. We don't have a buildup of aged inventory and feel good about that going into the fourth quarter. I think we're looking for effectively flat stick and brick cost. We've gotten a lot of the tailwind out of the lumbered price decreases coming through and I think we're coming to a more consistent level there. The balance of our stick and brick costs, we're probably seeing some pressing for increases, some that we're able to make some progress with in various markets as start have pulled back, people have come looking for work, it may be a little bit sharper pencil coming in trying to get the next neighborhood or the next phase of starts. So we expect some flat stick and brick will probably see an escalation in the lot cost going forward into the fourth quarter. And then, the ultimate margin is going to determine based upon what the concession levels are like in the fourth quarter. And since a significant portion of our closings in the fourth quarter will be sold in that quarter, north of 40%. That will heavily drive the ultimate margin. That's why we felt very comfortable looking at a flat margin environment Q3 to Q4. Yes, it does not have an expiration date. Our last authorization was issued in our first quarter, so that one lasted about nine months. Typically, they've been in the 12-month range, but we're not providing specific cash flow or repurchase guidance for 2025 as of yet. As we just commented, we want to go through our budgeting process before we provide that specific guidance. But we do expect that as cash flow does provide a significant increase next year, we will increase our repurchases and dividends proportionately to that. So we do expect it to be a meaningful step up in the level of repurchases. And the reduction in share count will be a function of really where our share price is as well in combination with that, because we're allocating and ultimately we will be in the market, we'll repurchase shares that we're able to get with those dollars. But we would expect the reduction in share count to be greater next year than it has been the last few years. I think there's a lot of noise in the marketplace when rates were moving and rates were moving up and that affects I think our perspective buyer behavior as to whether or not they're even going to come into the sales office and talk to us. Once they come into the sales office and they understand what's available to them, they might have had an expectation that I got to make a 7% mortgage rate work in my budget and they come in and we're able to put them in something different at a different monthly payment, it opens our eyes up quite a bit to what's possible. And so, the struggle becomes the traffic patterns. If we get the traffic, we're pretty good at conversion, but sometimes all the headline noise on uninterest rates can depress the traffic. Yes, Florida has been an important market to us and we certainly continue to see in migration. People love to live in Florida, want to be there, but affordability is challenged like it is across the country. And so we've seen significant rise in prices in Florida and across the country and with interest rates sticking where they have, it's certainly taxing. And that Jessica spoke to, the real change in buyers is they just need to make a little more to afford homes at a static sales price in a higher interest rate environment. And I think that that's really what we're seeing on the impact of sales in Florida, not so much significant change in traffic and/or basic demand or want. It's a matter of continuing to provide the right house at the right affordable price point that reaches as many people as possible and that's what we continue to strive to do as we position our new communities. Yes, as we continue to grow in this business, we're continually looking at ways to not only capitalize, but how we want to execute in this space. And I think from a single family for rent basis, we've become more efficient with the capital and how we produce and sell these communities. And I think that's some of what you're seeing in our moderation of growth in the inventory levels that we expect to see consistency of the investment level that we have out there. And so we still see strong demand. We still see an under supply and an ability to meet the demand of what's out there. So it's going to maintain, we're going to continue to be focused on it ourselves and be as efficient as we can with that capital. Yes, we have continued to see increase in our lot cost and slight increases as a percentage of overall revenue. We don't expect to see that moderate significantly. I don't know whether that settles in at high singles, low double digits, but we do expect that to be a headwind for us. As the reality of the cost to put a lot on the ground, we just haven't seen much relief in that. And so, we expect to see a continued decline. Yes, 4 Star is a very important part of our strategy with them being separately capitalized. They are able to support their growth with their own capital sources. And so, it does not have any offset on the cash available for the parent company and our shareholders. And they're growing their platform. And so, we are working alongside them as they grow their platform. They're now in about 60 markets, I believe, so roughly half of the markets that D.R. Horton is in. So they've still got a lot of opportunities to grow that platform. And so, our focus right now is to continue to work with them as they grow, improve their operations, get as efficient as they can at delivering lots to us and to the industry. And then as they mature, they're raising capital. I would expect them to continue to raise capital over time. And so, as that capital structure ultimately matures, then that will give us the visibility to be able to make the determinations on what we do in terms of our investment. And so, obviously, we made an additional investment to buy majority stake and we have not contributed or needed to contribute any additional capital to 4 Star and don't expect that we will need to going forward. But there will be an opportunity at some point down the line to look at their capitalization when they're at a more mature level. I think near-term, our expectation based on the pipeline that we have of deals is the weighting towards multifamilies probably a little bit higher in the near term, the next few quarters. Over the long term, I would expect that to balance out a little bit more than where it is today as FSR picks back up. But near term, probably a little bit heavier multifamily. We don't have a set level necessarily. It's whatever the market demand is and whatever we believe the best mix is for returns community by community across our markets. Yes, we've seen that mostly from -- we don't really have supply chain challenges. That has largely healed and we have the parts and pieces we need to build. And labor has strengthened. We've seen -- with our consistent production and market scale, we have the labor that we need and job site maintenance and controls and efficiency, just all of that kind of coming together. And that's where you've seen our cycle times drop a little bit below our historical norms. We continue to focus on being more efficient with the construction process and something we're focused on every day. Yes, no change in strategy, Rafe. We are seeing efficiencies in our operation, which is why you've seen a little lower start pace than maybe might have been expected. But as we continue to move through this market, we're going to have to see some improvement in the overall, or increase, I guess, if you will, in the overall starts pace to keep pace with our growth goals. But it's really just us managing our inventory, making sure we have that we need community by community to hit the price and pace goals that we're looking for. And we'll manage that inventory based on our ability to get those homes moved through the construction process and based on availability of lot, community by community in front of us. As we look -- as we're going into the quarter here, obviously, we've had some rate volatility. We did see sequential ASP growth, and so there's probably a little bit of price. We saw a little bit of our cost of our incentives go down sequentially this quarter, so there's probably a little bit of an assumption, a little bit of price, a little bit of incentive cost reduction in the quarter to offset the lot cost increase. We aren't making that decision here on a broad scale. I wish we were good enough to know which way rates were going to go. But we rely on our operators at a community level to make those decisions based on the traffic volume that they have and the sales demand and the people and buyers that they have in front of them on a daily basis. And I think, overall, what that resulted in is a solid margin for us and sales that seasonally didn't increase maybe like they would, but we're in a good place with the sales pace that we achieved in the quarter and the inventory we have to hit our guidance for the year. Yes, the rental is baked into our consolidated revenue guide and there is uncertainty around timing of closings of rental deals. So there's a little bit of lumpiness in those numbers, but that's built into the range that we're providing in a revenue guide, but no other specific guidance on the Q4 revenues from rental. Thank you, Paul. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our fourth quarter results in October. Congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family on producing a solid third quarter. We are honored to represent you on this call and greatly appreciate all that you do."

            "content": "Our net sales orders for the third quarter increased 1% from the prior year to just over 23,000 homes and order value was flat at $8.7 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 18%, up from 15% sequentially and flat with the prior year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 3% sequentially and up 12% year-over-year. The average price of net sales orders in the third quarter was $378,900, which is flat sequentially and down 1% from the prior year quarter. To address affordability, we are still using incentives such as mortgage rate buy downs, and we have reduced the prices and sizes of our homes where necessary. Although our home sales gross margin improved sequentially this quarter, incentives are elevated and we expect them to remain near these levels assuming similar market conditions and no significant changes in mortgage rates. Jessica? In the third quarter, our home building SG&A expenses increased by 12% from last year, and home building SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.1%, up 40 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date, homebuilding SG&A was 7.5% of revenues, up 30 basis points from the same period last year, due primarily to the expansion of our operations, including new markets and an increased community count. We will continue to control our SG&A, while ensuring that our platform adequately supports our business. Paul?"

            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. Before we discuss our results, I wanted to take a moment to pay tribute to our Founder, Don Horton, who passed away in May. Don was an incredible man with an unstoppable drive and work ethic that established the foundation and culture of our company. D.R. Horton, the Company would not exist as it does today without Don's tireless pursuit to help as many Americans as possible achieve the dream of home ownership. This simple mission has driven us from the first home that Don built, sold and closed himself more than 45 years ago through the more than 1 million homes our company has provided for families across the country. We are thankful for Don and we and all D.R. Horton employees are beneficiaries of his life's work. Along with our homeowners, customers, contractors, suppliers, land sellers, real estate brokers, and everyone else, Don included, in his family. It is bittersweet to be talking about the company's results publicly for the first time since his passing. Don took great pride in the company's growth, profitability, and shareholder returns, which have been at the top of all public companies in America for the past decade. We will work every day to preserve this legacy and continue to build upon it to improve our operations and the value of our company. We would also like to thank the countless people who contacted us to share their condolences and memories. We received hundreds of messages from employees across the country, and we heard from many industry leaders of other home building companies. Our suppliers, lot developers, bankers, and so many more. On behalf of Don's family and our company, we thank you for the kind words and tributes to a remarkable man. He will be missed. Now I'll turn the call over to Paul Romanowski, our president and CEO."

            "content": "Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 5% to $4.10 per diluted share compared to $3.90 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter is $1.4 billion on consolidated revenues of $10 billion. Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 6% to $9.2 billion on 24,155 homes closed compared to $8.7 billion on 22,985 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $382,200, up 2% sequentially and up 1% from the prior year quarter. Bill? Our home building lot position at June 30th consisted of approximately 630,000 lots, of which, 24% were owned and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. We remain focused on our relationships with land developers across the country to maximize returns. These relationships allow us to build more homes on lots developed by others. Of the homes we closed this quarter, 64% were on a lot developed by either 4 Star or a third party. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our third quarter home building investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.5 billion. Our investments this quarter consisted of $1.4 billion for finished lots, $750 million for land development and $340 million for land acquisition. Paul? Financial services earned $91 million in pre-tax income in the third quarter on $242 million of revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 37.7%. During the third quarter, essentially all of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our home building operations. And our mortgage company handled the financing for 78% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 56% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 725 and an average loan to value ratio of 88%. First-time home buyers represented 57% of the closings handled by a mortgage company this quarter. Bill? Bill Wheat Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We have a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity which provides us with the ability to adjust to changing market conditions. During the first nine months of the year, our consolidated cash provided by operations were $228 million, and our home building operations provided $972 million of cash. At June 30th, we had $5.8 billion of consolidated liquidity, consisting of $3 billion of cash and $2.8 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities. Debt at the end of the quarter totaled $5.7 billion with $500 million of senior notes maturing in October, which we expect to refinance. Our consolidated leverage at June 30th was 18.8%, and we plan to maintain our leverage around or slightly below 20% over the long term. At June 30th, our stockholders' equity was $24.7 billion, and book value per share was $75.32, up 18% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended June 30th, our return on equity was 21.5% and our consolidated return on assets was 14.8%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $0.30 per share, totaling $99 million. And our board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level to be paid in August. We repurchased 3 million shares of common stock for $441 million during the quarter. Our fiscal year-to-date stock repurchases through June increased by over 60% from the same period last year to $1.2 billion, which reduced our outstanding share count by 3% from a year ago. Based on our strong financial position and expectation for increased cash flows, our board recently approved a new share repurchase authorization totaling $4 billion. Jessica? Thanks, Steve. Thanks for asking this question. This helps us clarify this. Yes, we are talking about consolidated cash flow. And going forward into fiscal 2025, we would anticipate any future guidance that we provide on cash flow will be based on a consolidated basis. With our rental inventory now flattening out, stabilizing within a range around the current level, we would anticipate that our consolidated cash flow will be much nearer to the home building cash flow level. There won't be as much of an offset from home building cash flow from rental. 4 Star is consolidated in our financials. We would expect them to continue to use cash flow, but just as a reminder, they're totally separately capitalized, so it really doesn't impact the cash flow we have available to utilize for shareholder returns. But with the sharp improvement in our cycle times this past year. Our inventory turns have improved. We expect that improvement to continue into next year. So the efficiency in our home building operation is improving and therefore the cash flow generation from our income should continue to improve. With stabilization and rental, we do expect an increased level of consolidated cash flow next year. And then that's reflected in the increased share repurchase authorization that our board authorized that we'll be utilizing going forward as we expect to see proportionally higher share repurchases and dividends being paid out of that cash flow. Yes, it's a lot there in that question, Mike. So in total, our average house size is down about 2% from a year ago and about flat sequentially. And you're right, that is a mixed reflection of what our operators are choosing to start in a given community and the communities that they're planning to come online. And we might be moving to a few more town home communities to try to meet affordability targets for a given sub-market. With regard to pricing increases or price decreases, that's occurring very much week to week at a community level by our operators as they're gauging their market demand, their inventory conditions, and their future lot supply. So we feel really good about those teams making the right decision, and we really don't aggregate up and say we had 14% of the communities make a price increase, 20% a decrease, everybody else was flat, we just don't look at those numbers at a high level here. We tend to look at are we turning our housing inventory and are we driving returns community by community the best we can. Yeah, I wouldn't necessarily refer to it as a land banking pipeline. I'd refer to it as a lot developers pipeline. It's a large collection of very seasoned, experienced land development companies across the country that have had to -- frankly, they've had to look for some different capital sources and we've been able to help them find some other capital sources as a lot of the regional and community banks have pulled back from that sort of lending, but there's been other capital sources willing to step up when the developer is working for somebody like D.R. Horton, that we've been able to keep those folks in business producing lots for us. And 64% of our closings this quarter came on lots developed by someone else besides D.R. Horton, and that's a great part of our business strategy. We still prefer small tuck-in acquisitions. We like things that will either expand our footprint in a new and emerging geography, where we can acquire some people along with the lot position in other places. It becomes oftentimes a homes and construction, finished lot [indiscernible]. And then we were able to work with the selling principle to stay in the business as a lot entitler and developer. And that's been a very successful strategy for us in creating a lot development partners around the country as well. Still see good flow of deals to look at, but I would say we're pretty selective on what we're willing to do right now. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Senior Vice President of Communications for D.R. Horton.\nJessica Hansen: Thank you, Tom and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Before we get started, today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's Annual report on Form 10-K and its most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q early next week. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to Paul Romanowski, our President and CEO.\nPaul Romanowski: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I'm pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the second quarter, the D.R. Horton team delivered solid results, highlighted by earnings of $3.52 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 23% to $1.5 billion on a 14% increase in revenues to $9.1 billion with a pre-tax profit margin of 16.8%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended March 31st was 29.9%, and our return on equity for the same period was 22.2%. Although inflation and mortgage interest rates remain elevated, our net sales orders increased 46% for the first quarter and 14% from the prior year quarter as the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points is still limited and the demographics supporting housing demand remained favorable. Homebuyer demand during the spring selling season thus far has been good despite continued affordability challenges. With 45,000 homes in inventory, we are well-positioned to continue consolidating market share. Our average construction cycle times are back to normal and our housing inventory turns are improving. We continue to focus on capital efficiency to produce consistent, strong homebuilding operating cash flows and returns. Mike?\nMichael Murray: Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 29% to $3.52 per diluted share compared to $2.73 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $1.2 billion on consolidated revenues of $9.1 billion. Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 14% to $8.5 billion on 22,548 homes closed compared to $7.4 billion on 19,664 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $375,500 flat sequentially and down 1% from the prior year quarter. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our net sales orders in the second quarter increased 14% to 26,456 homes and order value increased 17% from the prior year to $10.1 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 15%, down from 19% sequentially and 18% in the prior year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 4% sequentially and up 15% year-over-year. The average price of net sales orders in the second quarter was $380,400, up 1% sequentially and up 2% from the prior year quarter. To address affordability for homebuyers, we are still using incentives such as mortgage rate buydowns and we have reduced the prices and sizes of our homes where necessary. Based on current market conditions and mortgage rates, we expect our incentives to remain at these elevated levels in the near term. Our sales continue to be primarily from homes under construction and completed homes and we will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the second quarter was 23.2%, up 30 basis points sequentially from the December quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues and stick and brick costs were both essentially flat in the quarter, while lot costs increased 3%. Our home sales gross margin for the full year of fiscal 2024 will be dependent on the strength of demand during the rest of the spring selling season in addition to changes in mortgage interest rates and other market conditions. For the third quarter, we expect our home sales gross margin to be similar to or slightly better than the second quarter. Bill?\nBill Wheat: In the second quarter, our homebuilding SG&A expenses increased by 13% from last year and homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.2%, down 10 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date homebuilding SG&A was 7.7% of revenues, up 20 basis points from the same period last year due primarily to the expansion of our operations to support growth. We will continue to control our SG&A while ensuring that our platform adequately supports our business. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: We started 24,900 homes in the March quarter and ended the quarter with 45,000 homes in inventory, up 3% from a year ago and up 6% sequentially. 27,600 of our homes at March 31st were unsold. 7,300 of our total unsold homes were completed, of which 790 had been completed for greater than six months. For homes we closed in the second quarter, our construction cycle time improved slightly from the first quarter and we are back to our historical average of four months from start to complete. We will maintain a sufficient starts pace and homes and inventory to meet demand and continue consolidating market share. Mike?\nMichael Murray: Our homebuilding lot position at March 31st consisted of approximately 617,000 lots, of which 23% were owned and 77% were controlled through purchase contracts. We remain focused on our relationships with land developers across the country to maximize returns. These relationships allow us to build more homes on lots developed by others. Of the homes we closed this quarter, 62% were on a lot developed by Forestar or a third party. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our second quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.4 billion. Our investments this quarter consisted of $1.4 billion for finished lots, $760 million for land development and $230 million for land acquisition. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: In the second quarter, our rental operations generated $33 million of pre-tax income on $371 million of revenues from the sale of 1,109 single-family rental homes and 424 multifamily rental units. Our rental property inventory at March 31st was $3.1 billion, which consisted of $1.3 billion of single-family rental properties and $1.8 billion of multi-family rental properties. We are not providing separate annual guidance for our rental segment due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of closings caused by interest rate volatility and capital market fluctuations. Based on our current pipeline of projects, we expect our rental revenues in the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company reported revenues of $334 million for the second quarter on 3,289 lots sold with pre-tax income of $59 million. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at March 31st was 96,100 lots. 60% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $310 million of the finished lots we purchased in the second quarter were from Forestar. Forestar had approximately $800 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt to capital ratio of 16.4%. Forestar remains uniquely positioned to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots in the homebuilding industry and to aggregate significant market share over the next few years with its strong balance sheet, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Mike?\nMichael Murray: Financial services earned $78 million of pre-tax income in the second quarter on $226 million of revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 34.6%. During the second quarter, essentially all of our mortgage companies loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 80% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 59% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 725 and an average loan to value ratio of 89%. First time homebuyers represented 57% of the closings handled by a mortgage company this quarter. Bill?\nBill Wheat: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity, which provides us with the ability to adjust to changing market conditions. During the first six months of the year, our consolidated cash used in operations was $470 million and our homebuilding operations provided $408 million of cash. At March 31st, we had $5.7 billion of consolidated liquidity consisting of $3.1 billion of cash and $2.6 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities. Debt at the end of the quarter totaled $5.9 billion with no senior note maturities in fiscal 2024. Our consolidated leverage at March 31st was 20% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 10.8%. At March 31st, our stockholders' equity was $23.8 billion and book value per share was $72.13, up 19% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended March 31st, our return on equity was 22.2% and our consolidated return on assets was 15.1%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $0.30 per share, totaling $99 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level to be paid in May. We repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock for $402 million during the quarter and our fiscal year-to-date stock repurchases were $801 million. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: For the third quarter, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of $9.5 billion to $9.7 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 23,500 homes to 24,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the third quarter to be approximately 23% to 23.5% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues to be approximately 7%. We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin of around 30% to 35% in the third quarter, and we expect our quarterly income tax rate to be approximately 24%. Our full year fiscal 2024 revenue, pricing and margins will be affected by market conditions and changes in mortgage rates in addition to our efforts to meet demand by balancing sales pace and price to maximize returns. For the full year of fiscal 2024, we now expect to generate consolidated revenues of approximately $36.7 billion to $37.7 billion and expect homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 89,000 to 91,000 homes. We continue to expect to generate approximately $3 billion of cash flow from our homebuilding operations. We now plan to purchase approximately $1.6 billion of our common stock for the full year in addition to our annual dividend payments of around $400 million. Finally, we now expect an income tax rate for fiscal 2024 in the range of 23.5% to 24%. We are balancing our cash flow utilization priorities to grow our operations, pay an increased dividend and consistently repurchase shares while maintaining strong liquidity and conservative leverage. Paul?\nPaul Romanowski: In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform that sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth and cash flow, while continuing to aggregate market share. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton family of employees, land developers, trade partners, vendors and real estate agents for your continued focus and hard work. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question this morning is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to talk about Florida. It's a pretty important market for you all. The long experience there. We've seen an increase in existing home inventory in some parts of that market and we obviously know higher insurance costs are also coming to bear there. So could you talk a little bit in some detail about your performance there, maybe the various markets within Florida and how it feels to you right now?\nPaul Romanowski: You know, Carl, Florida still feels good to us. There certainly has been a lot of news tied to the rise in insurance rates and for most of where we sell our homes are off the coast and building new construction allows for some stability in those insurance rates. So haven't seen a significant an increase for the homes in the communities where we sell as you may see reported along the coastal and high wind zones. Still seeing good in migration and good job growth throughout the Florida market. So we feel pretty good about the Florida market and especially about our positioning at the more affordable price points across the Florida Peninsula.\nCarl Reichardt: Right. Thanks. And then a follow-up on multi-family and single-family for sale, that portfolio business. With some lumpiness there, I'm curious about the markets where you've got fairly good-sized operations in multi-family and single-family rental, one of the reasons for you entering and playing more significantly in that space, I think is scale benefits for the overall homebuilding operations. So if you think about the markets where you're big in those two businesses, are you seeing lower overall vertical costs for the homebuilding operation too or better margins? And maybe sort of expand a little bit on that particular element of the business? Thanks.\nPaul Romanowski: I think there's two big factors that drive into our push into the rental business. One is, we're a better buyer of land, a better user of land and that we're able to convert more of the land to its ultimate final use. So we're a better counterparty to a lot of sellers as we can deal with the build for rent and multi-family component as well as the residential for sale. That gives us some economies in the purchase of the land and efficiencies in the entitlement process. Certainly within the vertical cost structure, we've probably seen more ability to influence cost on the traditional multi-family side coming over from our homebuilding operations because we're much bigger buyers of parts and pieces that go into the structures than a traditional multi-family developers.\nCarl Reichardt: Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks all.\nPaul Romanowski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from John Lovallo from UBS. John, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. The first one, obviously, there's a lot of concern in the market given the stickier than expected CPI. Although rates -- the long-term mortgage rates only moved up by about 35 basis points since pre-CPI. I mean, I guess the question is, have you seen or would you expect to see any impact to demand or would there be any change in your incentive activity given this 35 basis point move in rates?\nPaul Romanowski: We expect to continue to meet the market and we continue to stay focused on incentives that drive that activity and interest rate buydowns has been a big portion of what we have done. We tend to move with the market. So as you've seen that increase in market rates, we will move up the rate buy downs to be about a point to a point and a half below market. But we do expect incentives to remain near their elevated levels today, especially with the rate instability and stickiness up in that 7% range today.\nJohn Lovallo: Understood. And maybe splitting gears slightly here, but you guys beat deliveries versus your outlook in the quarter by about 2,300 units at the midpoint, raised the outlook by about 1,500 units at the midpoint. I mean, was there some pull forward in the second quarter or is there some conservatism in this outlook or maybe the expectation that delivery pace could moderate to some extent? I mean, how should we think about that?\nJessica Hansen: Yeah, great question, John. We did go into the quarter with a significant number of completed specs. So we actually sold and closed intra-quarter 54% of our houses. And so that is a very high percentage for us. A typical range would be about 35% to 40% of our homes would be sold and closed within the same quarter. So we still have over 7,000 completed specs. So I do think you'll see that intra-quarter activity stay higher than our historical norms. It may not be at the 54% we saw this quarter. But that did allow for probably a little bit of pull forward of demand, and it gave us the confidence to up the low end of our range by the full 2,000 units that we beat, and then the high end of our range by just 1,000. And we're now back to normal, if not better than our historical inventory turns in terms of what we're guiding to at the high end, it'd be a roughly 2.2 times turn. So feel very good about the ability to take that range up, but don't think there is necessarily an opportunity for the same scale of beat next quarter.\nJohn Lovallo: Yeah, makes a lot of sense. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Stephen your line is live. Please go ahead.\nStephen Kim: Thanks very much guys. Strong quarter. I appreciate all the guidance thus far. I was curious if you could shed a little bit more light regarding your cash flow guidance. You mentioned about $3 billion from homebuilding specifically, but you do have other segments, you have the rental segment, and you have Forestar in particular. And I was curious as to what kind of an offset should we expect from rental or Forestar this year relative to that $3 billion from homebuilding? And then specifically with rental, you have about $3.1 billion in inventory value right now. Where do you think that's going to go over the next, let's call it, 12 months or so?\nBill Wheat: Sure, Steve. On our cash flow guide, we have been guiding to homebuilding cash flow because that has been the primary generator of cash for us over the last couple of years. And we have invested portions of that into the rental operation as well, which feeds to the consolidated cash flow from ops. So there is some offset versus the homebuilding cash flow this year. We're guiding to around $3 billion of homebuilding cash flow. I would expect in the $800 million to $1 billion range, probably offsets that for the full year this year on consolidated. But we do expect that gap to start narrowing in future years as the growth ramp of our rental platform starts to moderate. And so we would expect going forward, our consolidated cash flow and our homebuilding cash flow to be much nearer to the same number beyond fiscal '24. So with the rental platform asset growth moderating, we're at 3.1 today. We do still expect to see that grow a bit further this year and will grow slightly next year, primarily from the multi-family platform. Our multi-family platform continues to grow and we're building out a more elevated level of starts over the last couple of years. But that will probably late '25 start to moderate as well. And so we do see prospects for the cash flow on a consolidated basis to be increasing consistently from here into '24 and into '25.\nStephen Kim: Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate that. And then with respect to uses of cash, I think as always, you talk about the opportunity for growth and your market share across the country, it still leaves some room there. And so I wanted to ask about your community count. You were up 4% month-to-month, up 15% year-over-year. That's an area where a lot of other builders have struggled. And I'm curious if you can provide a little bit of granularity into how much you expect there is further opportunity for growth this year in your community count and what you generally target for the next year or two in terms of community count growth.\nJessica Hansen: Sure, Steve. We've been up a double-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis for community count now for several quarters. So we've probably got at least another quarter or so until we've cycled and anniversaried that and would expect the growth to moderate a bit. But as we look at our overall lot position and our positioning for the future to continue to drive growth, we have shifted to a lot of that coming from community count rather than just continuing to have to drive more absorption out of each and every community. So I do think you'll continue to see our community count grow. It just probably won't continue to be at the double-digit percentage year-over-year increase here in a quarter or two.\nStephen Kim: Okay. Got you. So like more like kind of like a high single-digit kind of rate is what you're talking about, right?\nJessica Hansen: Yes, mid to high.\nStephen Kim: Okay, got you. Appreciate it. Thanks very much, guys.\nPaul Romanowski: Thank you. Stephen.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Matthew, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask around start pace going forward. Perhaps we -- assuming we live in this kind of mid to high sevens mortgage rate environment. Is there a scenario where you would dial back production at all to the extent it supports price or margin or maybe said another way, is there a mortgage rate at which you would consider pulling back a little bit on starts? Thank you.\nPaul Romanowski: I think we're going to manage the starts space at a community-by-community level based upon what we're seeing with buyers in the market and how they're responding to the current interest rate environment and mix of incentives that we're offering. Traditionally, we've had a limiter for the past several periods on lot supply in terms of what we could actually start. So as we're seeing our lots get developed and get brought online, we're able to bring good production starts into the market. I think we started just under 25,000 homes in the quarter. And we probably expect that to continue into the June quarter as if we see continued absorptions and sales.\nJessica Hansen: And so with our gross margin currently over 23% and very solid, it would take a pretty big disruption in the market for you to see us have a broad-based across the board pullback in starts. As Mike alluded to, it's going to be just driven on a community-by-community basis like it always is based on our finished lot position and what makes the most sense to maximize returns at that individual community level. So as we see right now, without another big shock or any sort of big shock to the system or a more significant move in rates, I think we would expect our starts to be pretty consistent through the remainder of the year.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Very helpful. Secondly, I wanted to ask around credit and DTI metrics, particularly for your first time buyers. Are you seeing any sort of incremental signs of stress in your mortgage applications just given this affordability backdrop? Thank you.\nPaul Romanowski: No, we've seen a pretty, pretty solid level of qualified buyer. Our average FICO store this last quarter was still at 725. And with the low level of inventory and available homes to purchase out there, you know, we still see strong buyer demographic and demand and we've remained pretty consistent. We have seen fluctuation in rates, but they've really not been significant enough to have any meaningful impact on our backlog and people's ability to qualify.\nMatthew Bouley: Great. Thanks, everyone.\nJessica Hansen: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Michael, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to drill down, if possible a little bit on the demand trends over the last couple of months. And I know you don't typically go too far down the rabbit hole in terms of month-to-month, but obviously with the change in rates, with some of the concerns in the market, any kind of January, February, March, April type of progression. We've heard that for example, March -- I'm sorry March and April maybe are a little bit more moderate than what we saw in February. I'd love your take on just how the demand trends, how the sales pace has come in through the door maybe versus your expectations and if incentives in the marketplace have changed at all around that.\nBill Wheat: Sure, Mike. We did see at the end of our first fiscal quarter in December, we saw I'd say better than normal seasonality in terms of sales demand and that continued on into January. When we had our call in January, we were still seeing, I'd say, probably a little bit better than normal seasonality into January. And then as we've talked many times, anytime you see a lot of volatility in rates, there is always an adjustment period for buyers. And so we saw more volatility in rates in February and March. And so we saw some intermittent periods where buyers were having to adjust, which does affect weekly sales pace. But then as we look up like over the last six weeks or so, we've seen that stabilize and are seeing a very good sales pace in line with our overall plans and very pleased that, that's position us to increase our guide for the year. Going forward, as Jessica has said a couple of times already, going forward, it's going to be subject to the rate -- what happens in the market with rates, and we're -- in the last week, we've seen another period of volatility. So I think we'll continue to see that the market adjust and we'll adjust to it as the rate environment changes.\nMichael Rehaut: Great. Thanks, Bill. Appreciate that. And I guess just maybe along those lines in terms of the impact of higher rates at points, it seems like if you go back to your guidance last quarter, there was a little bit of surprise that maybe the out quarter for gross margins was a little less than people were looking for and it kind of went back to the higher level of rates and incentives seen in three -- in the calendar third quarter. Wondering, obviously, you haven't given guidance for the fourth quarter, but all else equal, if perhaps you're having some of the delayed impact of perhaps higher incentives, perhaps more costly incentives, and I know there's some warehouse buying and delaying of an impact on the incentive front from the mortgage rate buydowns. If we were to stay at these levels just from the standpoint basically of the buydowns being maybe a little more expensive, all else equal, would that impact be more on your fiscal fourth quarter than your third quarter?\nJessica Hansen: I think right now, Mike, with the number of homes that we're selling and closing intra-quarter, you're seeing a pretty good real-time average gross margin. And so unlike a lot of other builders, I think you'll see more real-time market conditions show up in our results faster. Hard to say split in hairs between Q3 and Q4, but we were really pleased with where our gross margin came in this quarter. And we actually did see an increase in the number of buyers sequentially that we're able to utilize a mortgage rate buy-down. And in spite of that, we had a slight tick-up in our gross margin. So without giving specific guidance for the remainder of the year because it is going to be dependent on the interest rate environment, it feels pretty good to us right now. Our costs outside of incentives have generally flattened out on the stick and brick side. We're still having some categories go up where we have pressure, but we've had some success getting categories to go down. We obviously do still have some lot cost inflation we would expect to continue to need to be able to offset. So when we think about really predominantly the next two quarters, it is going to be incentive as the wildcard, and it's going to be dependent solely on market conditions.\nMichael Rehaut: But I think just to make sure we understand then, to the extent that rates have -- rates have risen and the cost of those mortgage rate buydowns become more expensive, you feel like a lot of that is already reflected in 2Q and 3Q?\nBill Wheat: I think, again, based on the fact that we are selling more than 50% of our homes intra-quarter, we'll see how that plays out as we look at the next in the third quarter and the fourth. But we move our rates along with the market. And so really it becomes a question of absorption and pace. We're going to continue to manage pace and margin to the returns that we want. And if we need to press a little more on the incentives to keep that pace consistent, we'll do so. But we move our rates along with the market. So it doesn't necessarily mean we're seeing significant cost. In the level of those buydowns, it really just starts to stress the buyer when they climb up into the 7% and if they go to the 8% range, then we'll see a little more challenge in getting buyers qualified. And if it goes that high, I would expect to see our incentives increase to keep our pace.\nMichael Rehaut: Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nJessica Hansen: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from CRC. Eric, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nEric Bosshard: Good morning. Two things if I could. First of all, the gross margin in the quarter was a little bit better. What was different that created that?\nJessica Hansen: I'm assuming you're talking on a sequential basis?\nEric Bosshard: Correct.\nJessica Hansen: Yeah, so a little bit of it was just core inclusive of just a very modest pickup on the incentive front in terms of the forward commitments and the interest rate buydown because you'll see when we put out our supplemental guidance, that kind of core margins up about 20 basis points. And then we also had a little bit less of an impact on warranty and litigation this quarter. Those are the two kind of biggest pieces of why there was a sequential increase.\nEric Bosshard: Okay. And then secondly, you talked about it a little bit, but I'm just curious that the effectiveness of the incentives as you moved through the quarter and in the March and April, I suppose. But just trying to figure out the effectiveness in the last comment that was made of as rates moved higher, what do you have to do different with buydowns? I'm just curious how you're seeing a conversion or closing customers behave relative to incentives relative to buydowns and if you indeed are having to do anything different?\nPaul Romanowski: Currently, we're not doing anything significantly different. We're responding to the rates and the customers that are in front of us at the time. And they are reacting very positively to the incentive offerings that our teams have crafted for the various neighbourhoods we have out there. So no, we're not seeing anything with the current range -- range of rates we've been dealing with right now. We feel like it's sort of -- I won't say business as usual in this crazy volatile world we're in. But right now, we feel pretty steady, pretty good about where things are.\nEric Bosshard: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sam Reid from Wells Fargo. Sam, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nSam Reid: Awesome. Thanks so much guys for taking my question. You made a lot of progress here in getting back to your historic levels on cycle times. That said, I mean, one thing that I'm thinking here is you're also building a more value engineered house today than perhaps what might have been the case pre-pandemic. So the question really is, is there an opportunity to bring cycle times lower versus that historical trend? Or do you really think kind of four months is the steady-state we should be thinking about longer term?\nPaul Romanowski: Yes, Sam, we're pleased to be back at what we deem our historical norm, and you bring up a good point, we are building a more efficient house and it's been an extreme focus of us to try and pull labor and man hours out-of-the home to reach affordable and maintain affordability. We're always going to believe there's upside for improvement in our business. And so we continue to stay focused on our inventory turns and the opportunity to reduce cycle times and be more efficient in the construction process where we can. We're going to continue to strive for that. We're not counting on significant reductions from here. We got back to this place and we'll continue to focus on doing everything we can to drive it down further.\nSam Reid: Got you. And then maybe to touch on order ASP a little bit. It looks like there was a little bit of a sequential lift between Q1 and Q2. I just would like to hear maybe a bit more context on that number. Was there a function of perhaps you know a little bit of a dial back in incentives in early spring? Or were there any kind of geographic or other mix dynamics that might have also driven that sequential improvement? Thanks.\nJessica Hansen: Yeah, it continues to be primarily geographic when you look at our price points. The South Central and the Southeast, which are two of our lower price point markets in terms of average sales price has been a slightly lower percentage of our mix for a couple of quarters now and that continued this quarter.\nSam Reid: Awesome. Thanks so much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman and Associates. Alan, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nAlan Ratner: Hey guys, good morning. Nice quarter and thanks for taking my questions. First, on the resale market, I'm curious some of your thoughts there. We were starting to see inventories ticking up a little bit in some of your markets more meaningfully than others. And when I think about the spec entry-level model, I think you guys have really benefited from the tight resale market over the last few years. I'm just curious, are there any markets now where you're starting to see increased competition from resale, maybe more contingent buyers on your move-up product and just more broadly, how you're viewing kind of the uptick in resale inventory right now?\nPaul Romanowski: I still think it's a very limited amount of inventory that's available in the marketplace, especially at our price point -- affordable price point. That coupled with some of the interest rate incentives that we're able to offer that for the most part existing home offerings don't provide, we're able to solve the affordability problem a little better than some of the existing home sales would be able to do. But we haven't seen a significant impact on our sales pace to date.\nAlan Ratner: Great. Appreciate that. And then second, on the NAR settlement with brokers. I know it's still very early, but you guys have been one of the heavier users that were friends to the brokerage community, if you will, over the years. I think you view them as an important tool to bring buyers to your communities. And I'm just curious if you've given any thought to how this settlement might change the economics there, the relationships you have with brokers. And any commentary you can give would be helpful.\nPaul Romanowski: Yeah, Alan, I mean, we think this is going to take some time to play out. You know we work very closely with the brokerage community, and we'll continue to do so regardless of what direction this takes. I think you are going to see some restructuring, certainly in terms of commissions and it will have some impact, I believe, on the number of realtors that stay active through the market. But we are going to continue to stay close to the realtor community, communicate with them. This is still an emotional buy for people. And we're also going to stay focused on our digital presence and ability to make sure that we are ahead of the curve in terms of reaching customers through whatever form it takes over the next couple of years.\nAlan Ratner: Appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Collin Verron from Jefferies. Colin, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nCollin Verron: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess I just wanted to start on the lot in cost inflation you're seeing. Any thoughts on the magnitude of that through the remainder of the year? I think you said it was tracking in the low-single digits in the most recent quarter.\nBill Wheat: Yeah, I think our expectation is we'll continue to see moderate increases, I think that low single-digit percentage continuing is in our current, what we can see in our current pipeline.\nCollin Verron: That's helpful. And then just on the lots controlled, it's moved up again as you concentrate on that land-light model. I guess how much more runway do you think that there is? And any update on the time line of getting there and just thoughts on the right number of the years of land or lots owned?\nBill Wheat: So, I think we continue to look for ways to be more efficient and more capital-efficient in our lot portfolio. 77% is a very controlled number position right now and we're looking at 62% of our deliveries were on lots that were actually developed by third-parties or Forestar. So, we're continuing to expand those relationships and seek opportunities to buy more lots from third-parties. I'm not going to put a ceiling on to how far we can take that, but we've made a lot of progress. And when you've had a lot of success, incremental success takes a lot more work, but that's what we do every day.\nCollin Verron: Great. Thank you for taking my questions.\nBill Wheat: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Jade, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you. Are you seeing any changes in terms of investor appetite for single-family rentals and multi-family leaving aside the issue of interest rates? We've seen Blackstone, for example, make a couple of quite large acquisitions, wondering what the tone is from the investors you sell to?\nMichael Murray: Yeah, I would say we've seen a little bit of a tick up in terms of interest and the number of investors out there in the market. They're still being cautious and rates are where they are and cap rates acting in kind. But I would say that just across the board, we've seen a bit of a tick up and have more interested parties in those assets that we have out for sale today.\nJade Rahmani: And a follow-up would be, a lot of these investors are looking for scale in their capital deployment. You've already done some large deals. Are you seeing on average the size of deals you're looking at increase?\nMichael Murray: Size per community, not necessarily, but there are large appetites to place dollars at scale into this space.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you.\nMichael Murray: There are multiple communities, yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Mike, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on Jade's question on the -- on the rental side, revenue is flat sequentially expected in 3Q, you do have more units completed on, I think both single-family and multi-families. Is that a function of -- if you have to characterize why it's not better, is it more the investor hesitancy at this point or is it the conversations you're having around price don't meet your objectives for margin and return on those projects.\nPaul Romanowski: You know, it's really a matter of communities, community size and timing of those closings and we're going to be selective through the process, but we have projects that are done and we're going to go ahead and monetize those and put them into the market. Not seeing the margins where we would like to see them, but that's relative, that's just tied to cap rates and interest rates. But no real significant shift that we're going to see in terms of up or down and it's going to be a little lumpy as we look through the quarters because we're selling whole communities at a time. It's not one at a time.\nMichael Dahl: Got it. Okay. And then shifting gears back to the homebuilding margins. Last fall, when there was a period of significant rate volatility and ultimately rates came down, you had a negative mark-to-market. Jessica, I think you mentioned that lower forward contracts played a role in lower-cost or mark-to-market there played a role in sequential gross margin improvement in fiscal quarter. Can you be more specific around what impact or quantification your forward hedges are having on both the 2Q gross margin? And is that actually a continued sequential benefit in your 3Q guide?\nJessica Hansen: No, I mean, we really think about it, Mike, as last quarter was somewhat of an anomaly. We're not going to say one-time. I mean, it could happen again, but it was highly unusual in terms of the rate move going up and down so quickly and the timing in which that happened and then a move close to quarter end. And so this quarter when we say minimal impact, I mean, we've talked about outside of Q1, it's been no more than a plus or minus 10 basis point move from a gross margin perspective. And so, hopefully, that will be the case going forward as well, and you won't see a repeat of what happened in Q1.\nMichael Dahl: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Susan, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nSusan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question is on the material costs. I think, Jessica, you had mentioned that you're seeing some success on seeing some of those move lower. Can you give more detail on what is coming down and how you're thinking about that relative to some of the other areas where there may be some inflation that's coming through? And any thoughts on lumber as well within that?\nJessica Hansen: I'll start with lumber and then I'll leave that up and down on other categories to Paul and Mike, they're probably better or worse than I am. Lumber is still less than half what it was at its peak back in March of '22, but it has started to increase since December, which would be kind of a typical seasonal trend. So hopefully, we're not going to be talking about lumber in terms of big swings in our closings. And most of our year-over-year stick and brick decline is still from lumber, but in terms of sequential moves going forward, we expect it to be relatively modest.\nMichael Murray: Very fair. And I think in terms of the other categories, it's a market-by-market category-by-category, I don't want to say struggle or battle, but it's an ongoing effort to be as efficient as we can do that. And we make some progress on some categories and then we might have to give back some on others. So it's a constant battle, Susan. And we've seen right now, I think some moderation in seeing increases, which has been very helpful in margin right now.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then you guided your SG&A to be about 7% for the third quarter, which is still really low in there even as you're making those investments. Can you just talk about the puts and takes into the SG&A as we think about not just the third quarter, but even looking out? Any thoughts there?\nBill Wheat: Yeah, sure. So we're continually trying to position ourselves to -- across our footprint to be in position to grow. And as we've gotten larger and have more scale in individual markets, that has involved realigning certain divisions, you're breaking up certain markets into multiple divisions to put ourselves in a position to more deeply penetrate market share in those markets. And the same has applied across our infrastructure across the country as well. And so we're making some of those investments right now and we do see pretty quick payback on that. So that's why our SG&A percentage has remained as low as it has, but we are making those investments that sometimes do have to come a little bit ahead of the growth. But it's primarily in people and in making sure we've got the depth on our teams and we've got the land personnel in various markets in order to be able to tie-up the land positions and develop those relationships with third-party developers and trades to continue to position our platform to support growth.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. That's great. Thank you. Good luck.\nMichael Murray: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Kenneth Zener from Seaport Research Partners. Kenneth, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Zener: Good morning, everybody.\nBill Wheat: Good morning.\nPaul Romanowski: Good morning, Ken.\nKenneth Zener: All right. Margin stability up 52% of closings intra-quarter orders. Why was it higher specifically? It looks to be, again, I could make my own narrative, but I want to hear it specifically. And then what was the margin spread between those 52% intra-q versus the ones that were naturally coming out of backlog?\nJessica Hansen: I frankly don't think any of us looked at that before the call, but we can take a look and get back to you. It was 54% versus the 52%, just to clarify. And the driver on that was just a function of we went into the quarter with over 9,000 completed specs and our cycle times are back to normal.\nKenneth Zener: Okay. So you're getting, yeah, we'll follow-up on the margin backlog versus intra-q, is that correct?\nJessica Hansen: Yes.\nKenneth Zener: Okay. And then Paul I think you kind of talked about your markets in Florida not being affected by the rise in inventory we're seeing in coastal markets and/or a higher cost of ownership related to insurance. Could we maybe isolate that comment to a place like Central Texas, I think Austin? I know you're building in Buda, not Austin per se. But we are seeing inventory go up in Central Texas, you don't have right the coastal issues. Is this still that you have homes that are affordable and in demand? So you're seeing the same dynamics you talked about there where we're kind of excluding coastal conditions? Thank you.\nPaul Romanowski: Well, the question and the comment back on Florida was mostly as it relates to insurance and increased costs around that. Inventories, we have certainly seen more inventory in the market today on the resale side than we have in the past. Months of supply has crept up slowly across most of our markets, but majority of what we see coming to the market is still maybe either overpriced or has significant need and work and very minimal in the affordable price points where we tend to compete. So we expect it's going to take significantly more homes to come on before we see to be a lot of impact on our ability to sell. But we've competed in that market forever. We have been a spec builder. We do that to compete in the new-home market as much as we do against the resale market. Feel very good about our product and positioning against the homes that come to market as resale available when they do. And we think we have a great package of incentives, warranty and closing cost basis to compete against that inventory when it does come on and it will at some point in the future.\nKenneth Zener: Right. Appreciate it. And I guess, Jessica, you said 3% on land. Could you split that between land you developed and land you're buying finished?\nJessica Hansen: I don't think we've quantified that, and I definitely don't have that in front of me.\nKenneth Zener: Talk to you guys later. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America. Rafe, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nRafe Jadrosich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for -- thanks for taking my questions. Just first on the fiscal third quarter gross margin outlook for flat to slightly up. Just how do we think about the assumptions for the stick and brick per square foot, net pricing and land inflation that's baked into that guidance? And then specifically on land inflation, just the lot cost is flat quarter-over-quarter. What are you seeing in terms of land inflation for land that's contracted today?\nPaul Romanowski: Yeah, Rafe, in our forward guide, we've got relative stability right now in materials and labor. So but we are still seeing some components go up slightly. So I think a very low single-digit percentage increase is generally the expectation there and our lot costs are a little bit higher than that, still low single-digits, but probably more in that 3% to 4% range. And in terms of just new land, that's deal by deal specific, market by market specific. I think in general, we've seen land prices kind of settle out here over the last little while, not as much inflation, but the long-term trend is still up over time. This industry still has a shortage of lot availability. And so I think that's going to continue to be a constrained situation. And so in that situation, we would not expect to see land prices come down.\nRafe Jadrosich: Thank you. That's very helpful. And then on the further rate buydowns, the forward commitments that you all have, how long do those go out? Are those months, are those weeks? So the recent move in rates, it hasn't impacted the rates that you are offering yet. When will that start to be kind of offered to the homebuyer? Like how long of forward commitment do you have?\nBill Wheat: We generally don't go out too terribly far in terms of the volume of forward commitments that we go with. We have various levels based upon anticipated demand of how much we'll buy for a given expiration date, which can vary from 60 days to 90 days out. But we're not going to look to fulfill all of our existing sales expectations with any one given a hedge or any one given build or forward and we'll continually sort of reprice to market so that we're offering incentives that are within as Paul said before, I think a point to a point and a half of market when that is the incentive that we feel is the most effective at driving appropriate pace and margin for the returns at a given community.\nRafe Jadrosich: Thank you. That's helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alex Barron from Housing Research Center. Alex, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nAlex Barron: Yeah, thanks guys and great job in the quarter. Yeah, I was just curious around land development costs. I mean, you guys are developing, I mean using a lot more land options and stuff, but are land development costs expected to impact margin for you guys in the near term or do you feel that's going to be more absorbed by whoever is developing the land for you?\nPaul Romanowski: Hey, Alex, we haven't seen much reduction in land development costs either from materials or labor. You know, we still have significant demand out there for the labor and those that are putting lots in the ground, not just in what we're doing and other builders are doing, but you have infrastructure improvements throughout the country that are keeping demand up for materials and labor. So that's kind of baked into what we look at in terms of our increase in lot price over time. So we don't -- we'd love to see some reduction, but we don't expect to see it in the near term.\nAlex Barron: Got it. And I guess you already touched a bit on the rental business, but I was just curious if the margins we saw this quarter, do you expect that's going to be sort of more what they're going to look like in the future or not necessarily?\nBill Wheat: It's going to be largely rate dependent in the capital markets as to the execution on those. I think at this point, our expectation is that it's going to be somewhat consistent with where we are today, but there is opportunity for some volatility around that too, especially within quarters within one quarter to the next because these are some chunky transactions. There are large individual transactions. And our multi-family platform is not yet to the scale where they're producing a significant number of multi-family communities delivering every quarter to the marketplace. So there's a relatively small number, they can be chunky and there's opportunity for volatility. Our expectation is somewhere in the range we're in today.\nAlex Barron: Got it. Okay. Well, good luck. Thanks.\nPaul Romanowski: Thank you.\nBill Wheat: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The final question this morning is coming from Jay McCanless from Wedbush. Jay, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nJay McCanless: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So on that rental guidance you talked about for 3Q, is that guidance based on projects that already have financing in place? Or is that just the schedule of what you think might close during the quarter?\nPaul Romanowski: It's a mix of both.\nJay McCanless: Okay. And then the other question I had is, I don't want to make too much of this if it's not a big deal, but it does seem like you're going from maybe an aggressive selling pace during the COVID years now to trying to gain market share leadership through more communities. I guess, how far along do you think you are in that transition? And I think kind of to Su's question also, what is that ultimately going to mean for SG&A going forward if you are starting to staff up and bring more people on to support a larger organization?\nJessica Hansen: Yeah. I wouldn't say, Jay, that it has anything to do with us trying to push more pace during COVID, it's all tied to our lot position. And so we've been building our lot position up, but not all of those lots were ready to go. And so we knew the communities were coming. And obviously, the market was extremely hot for a period of time. So we were able to drive additional absorption where we had the lots available. We don't have that same kind of strong demand, less affordability challenged environment today. And at the same time, our lots are getting finished and the communities are ready to go. So we're bringing them online and it happens to be good timing that we have the communities ready to go when we're not able to drive incremental absorption further in our existing communities.\nJay McCanless: Okay. And I guess how far along do you think you are maybe in the process of trying to get bigger from a community count standpoint?\nJessica Hansen: That's going to be an ongoing plan and goal and positioning. And I'd say just watch our lot position and ultimately, the communities are going to come online over time. Now from year-to-year, what exactly is that community count growth going to look like. It's impossible for us to predict.\nJay McCanless: Okay. Great. Thanks for fitting me in.\nJessica Hansen: Sure. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the floor back to Paul Romanowski for closing remarks.\nPaul Romanowski: Thank you, Tom. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look-forward to speaking with you again to share our third quarter results in July. Congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family on producing a solid second quarter. We are proud to represent you on this call and appreciate all that you do.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Paul Romanowski",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I'm pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the second quarter, the D.R. Horton team delivered solid results, highlighted by earnings of $3.52 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 23% to $1.5 billion on a 14% increase in revenues to $9.1 billion with a pre-tax profit margin of 16.8%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended March 31st was 29.9%, and our return on equity for the same period was 22.2%. Although inflation and mortgage interest rates remain elevated, our net sales orders increased 46% for the first quarter and 14% from the prior year quarter as the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points is still limited and the demographics supporting housing demand remained favorable. Homebuyer demand during the spring selling season thus far has been good despite continued affordability challenges. With 45,000 homes in inventory, we are well-positioned to continue consolidating market share. Our average construction cycle times are back to normal and our housing inventory turns are improving. We continue to focus on capital efficiency to produce consistent, strong homebuilding operating cash flows and returns. Mike? We started 24,900 homes in the March quarter and ended the quarter with 45,000 homes in inventory, up 3% from a year ago and up 6% sequentially. 27,600 of our homes at March 31st were unsold. 7,300 of our total unsold homes were completed, of which 790 had been completed for greater than six months. For homes we closed in the second quarter, our construction cycle time improved slightly from the first quarter and we are back to our historical average of four months from start to complete. We will maintain a sufficient starts pace and homes and inventory to meet demand and continue consolidating market share. Mike? In the second quarter, our rental operations generated $33 million of pre-tax income on $371 million of revenues from the sale of 1,109 single-family rental homes and 424 multifamily rental units. Our rental property inventory at March 31st was $3.1 billion, which consisted of $1.3 billion of single-family rental properties and $1.8 billion of multi-family rental properties. We are not providing separate annual guidance for our rental segment due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of closings caused by interest rate volatility and capital market fluctuations. Based on our current pipeline of projects, we expect our rental revenues in the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter. Jessica? In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform that sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth and cash flow, while continuing to aggregate market share. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton family of employees, land developers, trade partners, vendors and real estate agents for your continued focus and hard work. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. You know, Carl, Florida still feels good to us. There certainly has been a lot of news tied to the rise in insurance rates and for most of where we sell our homes are off the coast and building new construction allows for some stability in those insurance rates. So haven't seen a significant an increase for the homes in the communities where we sell as you may see reported along the coastal and high wind zones. Still seeing good in migration and good job growth throughout the Florida market. So we feel pretty good about the Florida market and especially about our positioning at the more affordable price points across the Florida Peninsula. I think there's two big factors that drive into our push into the rental business. One is, we're a better buyer of land, a better user of land and that we're able to convert more of the land to its ultimate final use. So we're a better counterparty to a lot of sellers as we can deal with the build for rent and multi-family component as well as the residential for sale. That gives us some economies in the purchase of the land and efficiencies in the entitlement process. Certainly within the vertical cost structure, we've probably seen more ability to influence cost on the traditional multi-family side coming over from our homebuilding operations because we're much bigger buyers of parts and pieces that go into the structures than a traditional multi-family developers. Thank you. We expect to continue to meet the market and we continue to stay focused on incentives that drive that activity and interest rate buydowns has been a big portion of what we have done. We tend to move with the market. So as you've seen that increase in market rates, we will move up the rate buy downs to be about a point to a point and a half below market. But we do expect incentives to remain near their elevated levels today, especially with the rate instability and stickiness up in that 7% range today. Thank you. Stephen. I think we're going to manage the starts space at a community-by-community level based upon what we're seeing with buyers in the market and how they're responding to the current interest rate environment and mix of incentives that we're offering. Traditionally, we've had a limiter for the past several periods on lot supply in terms of what we could actually start. So as we're seeing our lots get developed and get brought online, we're able to bring good production starts into the market. I think we started just under 25,000 homes in the quarter. And we probably expect that to continue into the June quarter as if we see continued absorptions and sales. No, we've seen a pretty, pretty solid level of qualified buyer. Our average FICO store this last quarter was still at 725. And with the low level of inventory and available homes to purchase out there, you know, we still see strong buyer demographic and demand and we've remained pretty consistent. We have seen fluctuation in rates, but they've really not been significant enough to have any meaningful impact on our backlog and people's ability to qualify. Currently, we're not doing anything significantly different. We're responding to the rates and the customers that are in front of us at the time. And they are reacting very positively to the incentive offerings that our teams have crafted for the various neighbourhoods we have out there. So no, we're not seeing anything with the current range -- range of rates we've been dealing with right now. We feel like it's sort of -- I won't say business as usual in this crazy volatile world we're in. But right now, we feel pretty steady, pretty good about where things are. Yes, Sam, we're pleased to be back at what we deem our historical norm, and you bring up a good point, we are building a more efficient house and it's been an extreme focus of us to try and pull labor and man hours out-of-the home to reach affordable and maintain affordability. We're always going to believe there's upside for improvement in our business. And so we continue to stay focused on our inventory turns and the opportunity to reduce cycle times and be more efficient in the construction process where we can. We're going to continue to strive for that. We're not counting on significant reductions from here. We got back to this place and we'll continue to focus on doing everything we can to drive it down further. I still think it's a very limited amount of inventory that's available in the marketplace, especially at our price point -- affordable price point. That coupled with some of the interest rate incentives that we're able to offer that for the most part existing home offerings don't provide, we're able to solve the affordability problem a little better than some of the existing home sales would be able to do. But we haven't seen a significant impact on our sales pace to date. Yeah, Alan, I mean, we think this is going to take some time to play out. You know we work very closely with the brokerage community, and we'll continue to do so regardless of what direction this takes. I think you are going to see some restructuring, certainly in terms of commissions and it will have some impact, I believe, on the number of realtors that stay active through the market. But we are going to continue to stay close to the realtor community, communicate with them. This is still an emotional buy for people. And we're also going to stay focused on our digital presence and ability to make sure that we are ahead of the curve in terms of reaching customers through whatever form it takes over the next couple of years. You know, it's really a matter of communities, community size and timing of those closings and we're going to be selective through the process, but we have projects that are done and we're going to go ahead and monetize those and put them into the market. Not seeing the margins where we would like to see them, but that's relative, that's just tied to cap rates and interest rates. But no real significant shift that we're going to see in terms of up or down and it's going to be a little lumpy as we look through the quarters because we're selling whole communities at a time. It's not one at a time. Good morning, Ken. Well, the question and the comment back on Florida was mostly as it relates to insurance and increased costs around that. Inventories, we have certainly seen more inventory in the market today on the resale side than we have in the past. Months of supply has crept up slowly across most of our markets, but majority of what we see coming to the market is still maybe either overpriced or has significant need and work and very minimal in the affordable price points where we tend to compete.

So I think a very low single-digit percentage increase is generally the expectation there and our lot costs are a little bit higher than that, still low single-digits, but probably more in that 3% to 4% range. And in terms of just new land, that's deal by deal specific, market by market specific.

            "content": "Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 29% to $3.52 per diluted share compared to $2.73 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $1.2 billion on consolidated revenues of $9.1 billion. Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 14% to $8.5 billion on 22,548 homes closed compared to $7.4 billion on 19,664 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $375,500 flat sequentially and down 1% from the prior year quarter. Bill? Our homebuilding lot position at March 31st consisted of approximately 617,000 lots, of which 23% were owned and 77% were controlled through purchase contracts. We remain focused on our relationships with land developers across the country to maximize returns. These relationships allow us to build more homes on lots developed by others. Of the homes we closed this quarter, 62% were on a lot developed by Forestar or a third party. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our second quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.4 billion. Our investments this quarter consisted of $1.4 billion for finished lots, $760 million for land development and $230 million for land acquisition. Paul? Financial services earned $78 million of pre-tax income in the second quarter on $226 million of revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 34.6%. During the second quarter, essentially all of our mortgage companies loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 80% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 59% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 725 and an average loan to value ratio of 89%. First time homebuyers represented 57% of the closings handled by a mortgage company this quarter. Bill? Yeah, I would say we've seen a little bit of a tick up in terms of interest and the number of investors out there in the market. They're still being cautious and rates are where they are and cap rates acting in kind. But I would say that just across the board, we've seen a bit of a tick up and have more interested parties in those assets that we have out for sale today. Size per community, not necessarily, but there are large appetites to place dollars at scale into this space. There are multiple communities, yes. Very fair. And I think in terms of the other categories, it's a market-by-market category-by-category, I don't want to say struggle or battle, but it's an ongoing effort to be as efficient as we can do that. And we make some progress on some categories and then we might have to give back some on others. So it's a constant battle, Susan. And we've seen right now, I think some moderation in seeing increases, which has been very helpful in margin right now. Thank you."

            "content": "Our net sales orders in the second quarter increased 14% to 26,456 homes and order value increased 17% from the prior year to $10.1 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 15%, down from 19% sequentially and 18% in the prior year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 4% sequentially and up 15% year-over-year. The average price of net sales orders in the second quarter was $380,400, up 1% sequentially and up 2% from the prior year quarter. To address affordability for homebuyers, we are still using incentives such as mortgage rate buydowns and we have reduced the prices and sizes of our homes where necessary. Based on current market conditions and mortgage rates, we expect our incentives to remain at these elevated levels in the near term. Our sales continue to be primarily from homes under construction and completed homes and we will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share. Jessica? In the second quarter, our homebuilding SG&A expenses increased by 13% from last year and homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.2%, down 10 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date homebuilding SG&A was 7.7% of revenues, up 20 basis points from the same period last year due primarily to the expansion of our operations to support growth. We will continue to control our SG&A while ensuring that our platform adequately supports our business. Paul? Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity, which provides us with the ability to adjust to changing market conditions. During the first six months of the year, our consolidated cash used in operations was $470 million and our homebuilding operations provided $408 million of cash. At March 31st, we had $5.7 billion of consolidated liquidity consisting of $3.1 billion of cash and $2.6 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities. Debt at the end of the quarter totaled $5.9 billion with no senior note maturities in fiscal 2024. Our consolidated leverage at March 31st was 20% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 10.8%. At March 31st, our stockholders' equity was $23.8 billion and book value per share was $72.13, up 19% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended March 31st, our return on equity was 22.2% and our consolidated return on assets was 15.1%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $0.30 per share, totaling $99 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level to be paid in May. We repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock for $402 million during the quarter and our fiscal year-to-date stock repurchases were $801 million. Jessica? Sure, Steve. On our cash flow guide, we have been guiding to homebuilding cash flow because that has been the primary generator of cash for us over the last couple of years. And we have invested portions of that into the rental operation as well, which feeds to the consolidated cash flow from ops. So there is some offset versus the homebuilding cash flow this year. We're guiding to around $3 billion of homebuilding cash flow. I would expect in the $800 million to $1 billion range, probably offsets that for the full year this year on consolidated. But we do expect that gap to start narrowing in future years as the growth ramp of our rental platform starts to moderate. And so we would expect going forward, our consolidated cash flow and our homebuilding cash flow to be much nearer to the same number beyond fiscal '24. So with the rental platform asset growth moderating, we're at 3.1 today. We do still expect to see that grow a bit further this year and will grow slightly next year, primarily from the multi-family platform. Our multi-family platform continues to grow and we're building out a more elevated level of starts over the last couple of years. But that will probably late '25 start to moderate as well. And so we do see prospects for the cash flow on a consolidated basis to be increasing consistently from here into '24 and into '25. Sure, Mike. We did see at the end of our first fiscal quarter in December, we saw I'd say better than normal seasonality in terms of sales demand and that continued on into January. When we had our call in January, we were still seeing, I'd say, probably a little bit better than normal seasonality into January. And then as we've talked many times, anytime you see a lot of volatility in rates, there is always an adjustment period for buyers. And so we saw more volatility in rates in February and March. And so we saw some intermittent periods where buyers were having to adjust, which does affect weekly sales pace. But then as we look up like over the last six weeks or so, we've seen that stabilize and are seeing a very good sales pace in line with our overall plans and very pleased that, that's position us to increase our guide for the year. Going forward, as Jessica has said a couple of times already, going forward, it's going to be subject to the rate -- what happens in the market with rates, and we're -- in the last week, we've seen another period of volatility. So I think we'll continue to see that the market adjust and we'll adjust to it as the rate environment changes. I think, again, based on the fact that we are selling more than 50% of our homes intra-quarter, we'll see how that plays out as we look at the next in the third quarter and the fourth. But we move our rates along with the market. And so really it becomes a question of absorption and pace. We're going to continue to manage pace and margin to the returns that we want. And if we need to press a little more on the incentives to keep that pace consistent, we'll do so. But we move our rates along with the market. So it doesn't necessarily mean we're seeing significant cost. In the level of those buydowns, it really just starts to stress the buyer when they climb up into the 7% and if they go to the 8% range, then we'll see a little more challenge in getting buyers qualified. And if it goes that high, I would expect to see our incentives increase to keep our pace. Yeah, I think our expectation is we'll continue to see moderate increases, I think that low single-digit percentage continuing is in our current, what we can see in our current pipeline. So, I think we continue to look for ways to be more efficient and more capital-efficient in our lot portfolio. 77% is a very controlled number position right now and we're looking at 62% of our deliveries were on lots that were actually developed by third-parties or Forestar. So, we're continuing to expand those relationships and seek opportunities to buy more lots from third-parties. I'm not going to put a ceiling on to how far we can take that, but we've made a lot of progress. And when you've had a lot of success, incremental success takes a lot more work, but that's what we do every day. Thank you. Yeah, sure. So we're continually trying to position ourselves to -- across our footprint to be in position to grow. And as we've gotten larger and have more scale in individual markets, that has involved realigning certain divisions, you're breaking up certain markets into multiple divisions to put ourselves in a position to more deeply penetrate market share in those markets. And the same has applied across our infrastructure across the country as well. And so we're making some of those investments right now and we do see pretty quick payback on that. So that's why our SG&A percentage has remained as low as it has, but we are making those investments that sometimes do have to come a little bit ahead of the growth. But it's primarily in people and in making sure we've got the depth on our teams and we've got the land personnel in various markets in order to be able to tie-up the land positions and develop those relationships with third-party developers and trades to continue to position our platform to support growth. Good morning. We generally don't go out too terribly far in terms of the volume of forward commitments that we go with. We have various levels based upon anticipated demand of how much we'll buy for a given expiration date, which can vary from 60 days to 90 days out. But we're not going to look to fulfill all of our existing sales expectations with any one given a hedge or any one given build or forward and we'll continually sort of reprice to market so that we're offering incentives that are within as Paul said before, I think a point to a point and a half of market when that is the incentive that we feel is the most effective at driving appropriate pace and margin for the returns at a given community. It's going to be largely rate dependent in the capital markets as to the execution on those. I think at this point, our expectation is that it's going to be somewhat consistent with where we are today, but there is opportunity for some volatility around that too, especially within quarters within one quarter to the next because these are some chunky transactions. There are large individual transactions. And our multi-family platform is not yet to the scale where they're producing a significant number of multi-family communities delivering every quarter to the marketplace. So there's a relatively small number, they can be chunky and there's opportunity for volatility. Our expectation is somewhere in the range we're in today. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Senior Vice President of Communications for D.R. Horton.\nJessica Hansen: Thank you, Holly and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Before we get started, today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's Annual Report on Form 10-K which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-Q later this week. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the presentations section under News & Events for your reference. Now I will turn the call over to Paul Romanowski, our President and CEO.\nPaul J. Romanowski: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the first quarter the D.R. Horton chain delivered solid results highlighted by earnings of $2.82 per diluted share. Our consolidated pretax income was $1.2 billion on a 6% increase in revenues to $7.7 billion, with a pretax profit margin of 16.1%. Our home building return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31st was 29% and our return on equity for the same period was 21.8%. Although inflation and mortgage interest rates remain elevated, our net sales orders increased 35% from the prior year quarter as the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points is still limited and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable.  Early signs for the Spring selling season have been encouraging. We will continue to focus on consolidating market share and are well positioned for the Spring with 42,600 homes in inventory and our average construction cycle times returning to more normal levels. We expect our housing inventory terms to improve in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 and our ongoing focus on capital efficiency to produce strong home building operating cash flows and consistent returns. Mike?\nMichael J. Murray: Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 2% to $2.82 per diluted share compared to $2.76 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $947 million on consolidated revenues of $7.7 billion. Our first quarter home sales revenues was $7.3 billion on 19,340 homes closed compared to $6.7 billion on 17,340 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $376,200, down 2% sequentially and down 3% from the prior year quarter. Bill?\nBill W. Wheat: Our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 35% to 18,069 homes, and order value increased 38% from the prior year to $6.8 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 19%, down from 21% sequentially and down from 27% in the prior year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 2% sequentially and up 14% year-over-year. The average price of net sales orders in the first quarter was $375,800, down 2% sequentially and up 2% from the prior year quarter.  To adjust to changing market conditions during fiscal 2023 and into fiscal 2024, we have increased our use of incentives and reduced home prices and sizes of our home offerings where necessary to provide better affordability to home buyers. Based on current market conditions, mortgage rates, and continued affordability challenges, we expect our incentive levels to remain elevated in the near-term. Our sales volumes can be significantly affected by changes in mortgage rates and other economic factors. However, we will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the first quarter was 22.9%, down 220 basis points sequentially from the September quarter, 100 basis points of the sequential margin decline related to the decrease in the value of hedging instruments we used to offer below market interest rate financing to our home buyers while the remainder was primarily due to an increase in incentive levels on homes closed during the quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were down 1.5% in the quarter and lot costs increased 1.5% while stick and brick costs decreased 1%. As Bill mentioned, we expect our incentive levels to remain elevated in the near-term, but with mortgage rates generally declining from the recent highs, we expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter. Our home sales gross margin for the full year of fiscal 2024 will be dependent on the strength of demand and other market conditions during the Spring in addition to changes in mortgage interest rates. Bill?\nBill W. Wheat: In the first quarter, our home building SG&A expenses increased by 14% from last year and home building SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 8.3%, up 50 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year, due primarily to expansion of our operations to support future growth and an increase in equity and stock market-based compensation expense. We will continue to control our SG&A while ensuring that our platform adequately supports our business. Paul?\nPaul J. Romanowski: We started 19,900 homes in the December quarter and ended the quarter with 42,600 homes in inventory, down 1% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. 28,800 of our homes at December 31st were unsold. 9,000 of our total unsold homes were completed, of which 730 had been completed for greater than six months. Our current level of homes in inventory puts us in a strong position for the upcoming Spring selling season. For homes we closed in the first quarter, our construction cycle times continued to improve and we are essentially back to our historical average of roughly four months from start to complete. We will continue to adjust our homes and inventory and start space based on market conditions and expect our housing inventory terms to improve in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023. Mike?\nMichael J. Murray: Our home building lot position at December 31st consisted of approximately 607,000 lots, of which 24% were owned and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. 39% of our total owned lots are finished and 52% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our first quarter home building investments in lots, land, and development totaled $2.4 billion, up 3% sequentially. Our investments this quarter consisted of $1.4 billion per finished lots, $740 million for land development, and $270 million for land acquisition. Paul?\nPaul J. Romanowski: In the first quarter, our rental operations generated $31 million of pre-tax income on $195 million of revenues from the sale of 379 single family rental homes and 300 multifamily rental units. Our rental property inventory at December 31st was $3 billion, which consisted of $1.4 billion of single family rental properties and $1.6 billion of multifamily rental properties. We are not providing separate guidance for our rental segment this year due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of closings caused by interest rate volatility and capital market fluctuations. Based on our current pipeline of projects, we expect our rental closings and revenues in the second quarter to exceed the first quarter. Jessica?\nJessica Hansen: Forestar, our majority owned residential lot development company, reported revenues of $306 million for the first quarter on 3,150 lots sold with pretax income of $51 million. Forestar\u2019s owned and controlled lot position at December 31st was 82,400 lots. 61% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $270 million of our finished lots purchased in the first quarter were from Forestar Forestar had more than $840 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt to capital ratio of 14.9%. Forestar remains uniquely positioned to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots for the home building industry and to aggregate significant market share over the next few years with its strong balance sheet, lot supply, and relationship with D.R. Horton. Mike.\nMichael J. Murray: Financial services earned $66 million of pretax income in the first quarter on $193 million of revenues resulting in a pretax profit margin of 34.3%. During the first quarter essentially all of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our home building operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 78% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 57% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgages this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan to value ratio of 88%. First time home buyers represented 56% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Bill.\nBill W. Wheat: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic to support and to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth, and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity, which provides us with flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. During the first three months of the year, our consolidated cash used in operations was $153 million. At December 31st, we had $6.4 billion of consolidated liquidity consisting of $3.3 billion of cash and $3.1 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities.  Debt at the end of the quarter totaled $5.3 billion with no senior note maturities in fiscal 2024. Our consolidated leverage at December 31st was 18.6% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 7.8%. At December 31st, our stockholder's equity was $23.2 billion, and book value per share was $69.70, up 19% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended December, our return on equity was 21.8%, and our consolidated return on assets was 14.8%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of approximately $100 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level to be paid in February. We repurchased 3.3 million shares of common stock for $398 million during the quarter. Jessica.\nJessica Hansen: Although volatility in mortgage rates and changes in economic conditions could significantly impact our business, for the second quarter we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 20,000 to 20,500 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be approximately 22.6% to 23.1% and home building SG&A as a percentage of revenues to be in the range of 7.5% to 7.7%. We anticipate a financial services pretax profit margin of around 30% to 35% in the second quarter, and we expect our quarterly income tax rate to be approximately 23.5% to 24%.  We are well positioned to continue consolidating market share in all of our operations. Our full year fiscal 2024 revenue, pricing, and margins in our home building, rental, financial services, and Forestar businesses will be determined by market conditions and the strength of the Spring selling season in addition to our efforts to meet demand by balancing pace and price to maximize returns. For the full year of fiscal 2024, we now expect to generate consolidated revenues of approximately $36 billion to $37.3 billion and expect homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 87,000 to 90,000 homes. We expect to generate approximately $3 billion of cash flow from our homebuilding operations. We also plan to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of our common stock to continue reducing our outstanding share count in addition to annual dividend payments of around $400 million.  Finally, we now expect an income tax rate for fiscal 2024 of approximately 24%. We remain focused on balancing our cash flow utilization priorities to grow our operations, pay an increased dividend and consistently repurchase shares while maintaining strong liquidity and conservative leverage. Paul.\nPaul J. Romanowski: In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint, and diverse product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform that sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth, and cash flow while continuing to aggregate market share. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton family of employees, land developers, trade partners, vendors, and real estate agents for your continued focus and hard work. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question for today is coming from Steven Kim with Evercore ISI.\nStephen Kim: Yeah, thanks very much, guys. Appreciate it, and thanks for all your commentary. I guess, just to start off with, could you clarify, I think you mentioned at the beginning of the call about 100 basis points of the gross margin was affected by hedging related to I think you said rate buy downs. And in your guide for 2Q, can you also just clarify like what -- I thought I heard you said 20,000 to 20,500 closings and $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion in consolidated revenue, just want to make sure I heard those right?\nJessica Hansen: Yes, Steve, that's correct. For the second quarter, $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion of consolidated revenues and closing to 20,000 to 20,500 homes. And in terms of home sales gross margin, you're also correct that 100 basis points of the impact was due to the rate buy downs that we've been offering and adjustments we had to make to that position during the quarter on a sequential basis. But what we've guided to for Q2 versus Q1 is relatively flat in terms of a 22.6% to 23.1% gross margin in Q2 versus the 22.9% that we posted this quarter.\nStephen Kim: Gotcha. And that 100 basis points, is that something that you have done in the past, is that a number that compares I guess, can you give us some sense of what that number has been over the last couple of quarters?\nBill W. Wheat: Steve, this quarter is the first time that, that amount has been significant at all. It is essentially adjusting the valuation of our hedging positions that we have in place to offer our programmatic rate buy downs across the country, and it's typically a very small move either up or down. But this quarter, given the significant volatility in rates during the quarter, of course, mortgage rates moved up to 8% in November and then dropped sharply in December, those hedging positions had to be adjusted to reflect that. So it was an unusual situation this quarter. Generally, we don't plan for any significant move one way or the other.\nJessica Hansen: And if you were to exclude that charge, we would have landed in the gross margin that we had guided to for the quarter, that was really the reason that we came in below.\nStephen Kim: Gotcha. Okay. That's really helpful. I'm sure there's going to be more questions about the guide, but I wanted to talk about your capital allocation, and in particular, I guess, I know that the mantra for D.R. Horton over the last several years now has been about consistency and predictability and reliability and that sort of thing, and you've done a great job there. But as I think about your overall cash position, it looks like you have sufficient cash. Currently, you've got another $3 billion coming. I think maybe a little less than $2 billion is spoken for with buybacks and dividends, I was curious about that extra $1 million and I'm curious how land investment factors into that and rental. So those are the two of the big pieces it would seem. So I guess, when I look at your land, your land supply has been coming down for -- had been coming down for a number of years, but now for about three years, your land and year supply has been flat. I was wondering, do you think you can bring down that land investment down further or is this kind of the level that you think that we're going to be seeing in the future? And then in rental, can you give us a sense for what you think the growth in the rental inventory may be over the course of the next year?\nMichael J. Murray: Steve, when we look at our land position, we feel that the forward one year's roughly supply of land that we own is important to maintain the production velocity in our neighborhoods. Bringing that down significantly is going to be incremental because it's going to be with more developers providing finished lots for us versus self-development. And I think we're back up to 76% controlled which is up from where it's been in the past few quarters. So we're going to continue to incrementally look to control more land and acquire lots that are being finished by others, but we will still need to maintain a supply of land on our balance sheet, lots primarily on our balance sheet to feed the production.\nStephen Kim: And the rental inventory?\nMichael J. Murray: And the rental inventory, we'll probably invest in some during fiscal 2024 to grow that platform. It's getting closer to a good sustainable volume that will produce consistent revenues and profits quarter-to-quarter, but it's still in the growth mode.\nJessica Hansen: And in terms of the overall capital allocation, as you already alluded to, we did guide to the $1.5 billion of common stock. We've got the annual dividend payments of $400 million. We also have a sizable debt maturity that's very early in fiscal 2025 of $500 million in October. So too early to say what we're going to do with that, and we're very focused on maintaining conservative leverage and we'll see as we get closer, but that is something we're going to be prepared to potentially pay out of cash if we don't feel like the market is right to go refi that.\nStephen Kim: Great. Thanks very much, guys. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Carl Reichardt with BTIG.\nCarl Reichardt: Good morning, everybody. I want to talk about SG&A for a second. Bill, can you talk about the basis points associated with the incentive comp this quarter? And then you talked about it being also ahead of some growth you're planning. Can you talk a little bit about community count expansion and whether or not this also might be related to some of the new markets you've entered more recently? Thanks. \nBill W. Wheat: Sure. Yes. The first factor this quarter, we could point to our 14% increase in our average selling community. So that's obviously a significant increase, and our SG&A is up 14% this quarter year-over-year as well. So that's a bigger move than we have had in a while that's positioning us to be able to provide the increased guidance, and you have seen our market count increase over the last several years. Obviously, we expect in time to achieve some leverage on that. And as we grow our revenues, we would expect our SG&A to come back down to historic levels. But I think we've got a couple of quarters here where we're going to see our SG&A little bit higher as a percentage of revenues, primarily driven by that.  This quarter, we have one additional factor and really, it's just a timing factor in terms of the impact of equity and stock-based comp. We typically have an amount that we incurred typically in our second quarter or third quarter, but the timing of some grants this year were a little bit earlier into our first quarter. And so there's an amount of roughly $13 million that it was incurred in Q1 of this quarter that typically would be a Q2 or Q3 event.\nCarl Reichardt: Okay. That's small. So it's different this year. Okay, thank you for that. And then I have a bigger picture question for Paul. So obviously, the biggest news that we've seen in the business for a while is a large acquisition by an offshore player of a domestic homebuilder. And historically, long ago, Horton was a fairly significant acquirer of public companies and other private companies and still here and there. We've seen you look at some deals. Paul, can you talk a little bit about from your perspective, what do you think -- whether or not acquisitions are something that Horton would consider historically, I know you've done it more recently, you've talked about doing most of your growth greenfield. I'd just like to know, given current conditions where you sit on this sort of big picture? Thanks so much. \nPaul J. Romanowski: Yes, Carl. We still today look at -- continually look at acquisitions. And for us, we're more interested in the smaller tuck-in builders that may add to our market share in an existing market or give us some entry, but we do always have that opportunity to greenfield those. I don't see on the horizon, a significant large acquisition. Certainly, the acquisition that you're referring to make some sense. We speak to scale a lot in market share, and that makes some sense to us. But today, we're going to continue to look at those as they come available, but no significant shift in what you've seen us do over the last couple of years.\nCarl Reichardt: Appreciate it, thanks Paul.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from John Lovallo with UBS.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning guys, thank you for taking my questions as well. The first one here is it seems like the first quarter gross margin at least relative to your expectations was impacted by that 100 basis points of hedging that seemingly was not contemplated in the initial guide. So I guess the question is, why would the 2Q gross margin be flattish sequentially if that hit is not expected to repeat and rates have come in a bit?\nBill W. Wheat: Well, it starts with -- we sold homes with an increased level of incentives while rates were higher during Q1, and some of those closed in December, but there are still a number of them that will be closing in Q2. And so far on a core basis, we still are entering the quarter a little bit lower margin than what the average presents. And so that's -- but obviously, rates have dropped, and so those incentive costs are a bit lower in the later sales. And so on balance, we expect we should be able to hold margins around the current levels, excluding the hedging going forward.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay, got it. And then I think last quarter, lot costs were up 10% or 11% year-over-year, but I think there's some geographic mix that was in there and maybe it normalized to up sort of mid-single digits if you kind of accounted for that mix. I mean, how did lot cost trend in the quarter and how are you thinking about that in 2Q?\nJessica Hansen: Pretty similar to what we said last quarter. That was a year-over-year comp. And so we still were up low double digits on a year-over-year basis, and it did continue to have a little bit of geographic mix. But I would say, stripping out geography, our lot cost on a year-over-year basis probably are up high single digit. And until we cycle an entire year, it probably stays that way, and then it would moderate in terms of year-over-year because it's certainly less than that on a sequential basis.\nBill W. Wheat: Yes. 1.5% on a sequential basis.\nJohn Lovallo: Got it, thank you guys. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank.\nJoseph Ahlersmeyer: Hey, good morning everybody. If you are to humor me for maybe a couple more on the gross margin, could you just talk about the actual P&L impact of that charge, whether it was something that hit deductions from revenue or if it was just a hit to COGS? And then similarly, on the -- what you're expecting going forward, I guess it makes sense, you're not expecting it given rates has kind of stabilized but is there a way to think about the sensitivity based on what you've still got out there notionally, like if we had another 50 to 100 basis point drop, would you have another 100 basis point impact from here?\nBill W. Wheat: Joe, the charge -- the amount of the charge was $65 million approximately, and that's basically what hit during the quarter. In terms of our position, outstanding. We believe that our position is -- reflects the current market and the valuation adjustment in the December quarter takes care of all of it. There's always some sensitivity. We always have some hedging position outstanding. And so anytime there is a significant sudden change in rates that can leave some exposure there obviously, the opposite side of that is the benefits to the business. When rates drop, obviously, that improves affordability and improves our ability to sell at a price point in the core business. And so what this hedging position allows us to do is offer below market rates on a consistent basis on a broad basis across our business. And like we said, we try to manage that as best as we can, but in a period of significant sudden volatility, there can be some exposure to the position.\nMichael J. Murray: There were two very significant moves in interest rates in the quarter. They went up significantly in the middle of the quarter, and they came down significantly to the end of the quarter. Kind of a very unique dynamic that we have not experienced. That's what led to the mark-to-market adjustment being more severe than it's been in prior quarters.\nJessica Hansen: And that $65 million mark-to-market is in cost of goods sold, whereas the just standard routine interest rate offering does net against revenue and flows through our ASP. But the $65 million specifically is in cost of goods.\nJoseph Ahlersmeyer: That's all very helpful, thanks for the transparency there. As a follow-up, thinking about the outlook for materials either inflation or deflation can you just speak to what's in your 2Q guide and then maybe just generally, if we're looking at starts rising and your volumes obviously growing, how should we think about the competition for materials perhaps driving inflation again in those?\nPaul J. Romanowski: Yes, we're seeing some relative flatness in our cost side of the business and would expect to see similar all things stay consistent through the next quarter. Certainly, with the encouraging signs early in to January, it's possible that we see some increase in starts from all of our peers. That could put pressure on labor and on materials, which could cause some headwinds or some increase in the cost side.\nJoseph Ahlersmeyer: Alright, thanks everybody. Good luck.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan.\nMichael Rehaut: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Good morning everyone. I wanted just to circle back for a moment on SG&A and I think, Bill, you talked about the main drivers of the higher or negative leverage, I guess, you could say, being community count and the stock comp. You're going to see a similar type of negative leverage impact on the second quarter. Would you expect that to kind of flatten out everything else equal seems to imply you said that maybe in the first couple of quarters, you're going to see this impact and that should kind of run through by the time you get to the back half or is this more of a 2025 event? And as part of this question, I'm also curious if higher sales incentives outside broker commissions has impacted this at all or if you could remind us if that's the portion that's in the COGS?\nBill W. Wheat: Yes, the last part first. Yes, our broker commissions are in and our gross margins are in our cost of goods sold. So that's not part of the equation. And I think your general commentary there is fair. We only provide specific SG&A guidance one quarter out. But generally, our expectation over the longer term is that we would get back to a similar SG&A level as last year and beyond. So I think it is a phenomenon here for a couple of quarters where we're guiding a little bit higher than last year.\nMichael J. Murray: Little headwind on the community count market growth, but a little tailwind in Q2 on the equity comp position recognizing that in Q1 versus Q2.\nBill W. Wheat: And we're also -- also ASP is down year-over-year. And so it's always a little bit more of a headwind on a percentage basis for SG&A when ASPs are down.\nMichael Rehaut: Right. No, that's fair. That makes sense as well. I appreciate that. Secondly, not to beat a dead horse, but I do -- you kind of made a comment on the gross margins, Bill, and I don't know if you misspoke or it would kind of make sense to us if indeed you did not misspeak. But I think you said at one point, we would expect gross margins to get back to the 1Q levels excluding the hedging impact, that would kind of make sense to us to the extent that in the last couple of months, rates have come down and your current orders would include less expensive rate buy downs than, let's say, a couple of months ago. And I think you were kind of saying 2Q is currently being impacted by some of the carryover from 1Q. I just wanted to make sure I heard that right or how to think about where gross margins are today on orders taken in mid-January, let's say, versus a couple of months ago?\nBill W. Wheat: Yes. We provided guidance one quarter out so we've guided to 22.6% to 23.1%. So essentially straddling the GAAP margin that we reported in Q1. Coming into Q2, the closings that we will have early in the quarter are at the -- probably the low end of that range, maybe even a little below that. But then later in the quarter, margins are improving because of the cost of buy downs after rates have dropped is lower. And so -- but on average, that's -- we believe that, that will balance out to a margin in the 22.6% to 23.1% range. What will occur after that we can't really comment. It's really going to be a matter of what\u2019s the strength of the Spring selling season, what does demand look like through the Spring and what happens with mortgage rates. And so -- but on average, that's where we believe things will fall for margins in Q2.\nMichael Rehaut: Right. So basically, what you're saying is beginning of the quarter at the low end, perhaps a little bit below the low end of that range, that would imply towards the end of the quarter at the higher end or perhaps a little bit above the high end of that range, is that fair?\nBill W. Wheat: I think on balance it's going to balance out to 22.6% to 23.1%.\nPaul J. Romanowski: And we still sell a large portion of our homes inter-quarter. So 35% to 40% is our kind of historical average. And so those are being sold now and as we look through the quarter and into the Spring selling season. So certainly, as the Spring selling season emerges and continues, it's going to give us better visibility as we look towards the end of this quarter in to 3Q.\nMichael Rehaut: Great, appreciate it. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research.\nTruman Patterson: Hey, good morning everyone. Not to beat a dead horse here, but I just want to understand kind of your old philosophy and some near-term dynamics with rates coming below, a little bit below 7%. I realize there's this hedging noise, but have you all been able to kind of pull back on core incentives, if you will, the past several weeks or is this much more taking kind of a bit of a wait-and-see approach, I think you mentioned a good rebound early in the year, are you taking a wait-and-see approach, so you're not disrupting kind of demand or the momentum ahead of the Spring selling season?\nPaul J. Romanowski: Truman, I think that as we look at this today, it's still very early. And for us, consistency of activity has been important. So we haven't made any significant changes in our incentives if the market gives this to us, and we continue to see the early encouragement that we are, then we'll respond to the market in kind. If rates continue to stay up, then we'll need to lift our rate offerings like we've done in the past and will fluctuate as those rates move. Still it has been our best incentive is the rate buy down and consistency of rate, consistency of payment to our buyers as they shop in market.\nJessica Hansen: And all of that continues to be managed market by market, community by community based on what our local operators are seeing and believe it's the best to drive the strongest returns. I mean, even with a little bit of giveback in our gross margin, our improved cycle times and what we're going to turn this year in terms of inventory is way more important to our bottom line and the returns we're going to generate than giving up a little bit of gross margin and still being at roughly 23%.\nTruman Patterson: Makes total sense. And with that, you all bumped your closings guidance a little bit to about 89,000 around there. That's well above the prior peak of, we'll call it, 83,000 back in 2022 when there were all of these supply chain issues and constraints. Could you just help us get a little more comfortable with that level of growth kind of based on today's labor pool, a lot availability. I'm really trying to understand constraints today and maybe what level of closings would really create bottlenecks in the construction process, not asking about demand or anything along those lines?\nMichael J. Murray: We've been very focused on creating a quarter-to-quarter consistent starts plan where we're feeding our neighborhoods with lots that are available in front of us and making sure we have those lots supplied and secured to us. At the same time, we've made a tremendous amount of progress reducing our cycle times and coming back to sort of our historical norms of around four months from starting a home to completion. And so that's giving us much greater flexibility going into this year with the strong finished lot position we currently have, combined with the reduced cycle times, we're able to reduce our homes in inventory and still deliver a closing target that's going to be at or in excess of our two times beginning of the year housing terms. So we really feel good about what's happened there. As to what the upside top side is where the bottlenecks would come in, hard to speculate on where that would be. We feel really good about our lot position, neighborhood by neighborhood and the trade partnerships that we have and the supplier relationships that we have, they've been very supportive of us.\nJessica Hansen: But great point, Truman, and that when we think about overall industry constraints, finished lots are going to continue to be an issue in terms of builders being able to put more houses on the ground today. It's not getting any easier to put a finish lot on the ground and so we continue to have a focus on building out our lot position and our relationships with third-party developers to make sure we're positioned for growth. But when we think about the biggest constraints to the industry overall, it definitely starts with finished lots.\nTruman Patterson: Perfect. Thank you all and good luck in the coming year. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.\nEric Bosshard: Good morning. Curious if you can provide a little bit of perspective. You talked about favorable trends into the Spring and 56% first time. Just as you look across the business, in terms of where you're seeing relative strength in regards to price points and product where things are above average and where things are below average?\nMichael J. Murray: I think it's pretty consistent across the board. We're feeling really good across all of our offerings. I mean as 55% to 56% of our deliveries have been to first-time homebuyers, that's generally where we've kind of geared our neighborhoods that we're positioning and the product that we're positioning with that. I think 70% of our deliveries were at $400,000 or less, which for us is maintaining a focus on affordability and a payment that works for people in their monthly budget. Hence, we've used the interest rate buy downs quite a bit. But feel really good. Coming out in January does not make a quarter or a Spring selling season, but we're very encouraged by the early trends in January and are excited for what the spring is going to hold.\nEric Bosshard: From a product perspective or price point perspective with lower rates, do you think differently than you did 90 days ago in terms of focus on affordability or do you think about expanding a bit more what you're doing?\nPaul J. Romanowski: I think we have made adjustments as the market has shifted over the last 12 to 18 months and feel comfortable with our trajectory and the product offering that we have. Certainly, as you look across our communities, they're going to trend inside of the product offering that we have based on rate and monthly payment environment, whether that means that they're buying up in size or down in size. But we feel like we have a good offering across our markets, and we'll continue to stay as we need to respond to a monthly payment and interest rates and provide affordable opportunities across all of our platforms.\nEric Bosshard: Great, thank you. \nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates.\nAlan Ratner: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for all the details so far. I got some questions on kind of the spec versus build to order dynamic in the industry right now. You guys being a spec builder, I think, had a pretty strong advantage during the pandemic. Obviously, resale inventory was incredibly tight. The extended cycle time as well, I'm sure it was hard to manage from your side. Kind of gave you an advantage versus the BTO guys in terms of the consumer experience. So I guess my question is now that cycle times seem to be improving across the industry, resale inventory is ticking a little bit higher. Are you thinking about that dynamic any differently, are you maybe contemplating selling earlier in the construction process again, whereas before you were maybe waiting for homes to get closer to completion, are you seeing more competition from build-to-order builders that have kind of shrunk in their construction cycle times, any commentary on that would be great?\nPaul J. Romanowski: I think today, we are still seeing people looking for closing with certainty of close date and in that 30 to 60-day time frame based on their ability to lock in interest rate. And so I don't know that we've seen much significant shift from the build-to-order builders being able to deliver a presale into those time frames. We are very comfortable with our inventory position, both in the total homes and in a completed home scenario. It's continued to play into the shortness of resale inventory across our markets and I don't expect a significant change for us. We're going to continue to stay focused on inventory sales and consistent production community.\nMichael J. Murray: Even with the decline in existing home sales, they're still three to four times larger of a market transaction volume than new home sales. So we've always tried to position ourselves to compete against those homes rather than just other new home providers.\nPaul J. Romanowski: The timing of that sale has been able to move up earlier in our stage of construction just because we have gotten back to our historical norms of months of delivery of our houses.\nAlan Ratner: Got it. But in terms of your sales strategy, I mean, I look at your completed spec count, it's been ticking a little bit higher here more recently. Is that still kind of the strategy to hold these homes off until you're maybe a month or two from completion to allow the buyer to lock in that rate or are you maybe thinking about kind of pulling that forward a little bit?\nMichael J. Murray: We're allowing -- we're not restricting the sale of homes. Seasonally, you'll see the completed spec inventory, the completed home inventory tick up through the fall and be positioned that we have houses available for quick deliveries beginning in January for the Spring selling season. So we're able to deliver the homes that people are coming in and needing in 30 or 60 days. At the same time, with the compressed cycle times, as Paul mentioned, we are very comfortable selling and locking a rate in for a buyer earlier in the production process than we were a year ago for sure.\nAlan Ratner: Okay, got you. One last quick one, if I could. Just going back to the charge on the hedge, I just want to better understand this, like we have heard from other builders in the past situations where they would buy kind of forward commitment pools and when rates pull back sharply in a short period of time, those pools would kind of go unused because the market kind of fell below wherever that pool was. Is that kind of what's going on with you guys or are the mechanics of this much different, I'm just trying to wrap my arms around that better?\nBill W. Wheat: No, you've described it exactly. We typically will buy those forward commitment pools really for the next few weeks of deliveries essentially is the plan. We're not going out very far, but it is a few weeks and so that's when we say a very sudden sharp change in rates, that can present some exposure there, but it has not occurred in the past, but the circumstances this quarter were pretty unusual in terms of the significance and the suddenness of the rate moves.\nJessica Hansen: And it was really restructuring so it could be used, not that we weren't going to fulfill the pool. We just had to restructure it so it was usable.\nBill W. Wheat: And then at the end of the quarter, we always have to mark-to-market the value at the end of the quarter. So that's always a factor there as well.\nAlan Ratner: So it sounds like this is an industry phenomenon, not necessarily an important phenomenon, but obviously, we'll learn more about that in the next few weeks. But I appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.\nAnthony Pettinari: Hi, good morning. There was an earlier question on the large builder acquisition we saw last week. I guess we also saw a large acquisition in SFR. And I'm just wondering if you could talk about how institutional demand for build-to-rent homes has been trending, maybe relative to earlier expectations. Do you expect that to grow as a portion of your homebuilding operations and just maybe the impact of that business in this kind of rate environment?\nMichael J. Murray: Certainly we have seen that with the change in the capital markets, that demand environment became much choppier last year. But we still had institutional buyers that were anxious to get the product we were delivering to the market, and they continue to be so. We delivered projects in the first quarter, we expect to deliver more in the second quarter and then throughout the year with the pipeline that's there. I mean, for us, it's a strategy to help us derisk land positions and more rapidly monetize our land portfolio. And so we are still seeing good demand for the product, good demand on the rentals and the lease-ups when we're taking the stabilization process on and continue to expect that to become a growing part of our business.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay, that's helpful. And then just last quarter, I think 60% of your buyers took some form of a buy down and you were offering 6.25 on a conventional loan. Just wondering if you can update where that stands coming out of fiscal 1Q and I guess you talked about this earlier a bit but do you think about kind of a rate level where buy-downs maybe stop becoming kind of the chief incentive mechanism or where incentives start to shift back to more kind of traditional ones?\nJessica Hansen: We're probably up, call it, roughly 10% sequentially in terms of the take rate on that buy downs. So we were in the 70s and now we'd be in the 80% range of the buyers that utilize our mortgage company. So the 60% you said was on our overall business, so say 60% to roughly 70% of buyers took that this quarter.\nPaul J. Romanowski: And the use of those rate buy downs is not just new to us over the last 12 months. We've been 24-plus months utilizing that incentive. So I believe on a go-forward basis, staying competitive to not only the new home market, but especially to the resale market for us, and the ability to have a lower monthly payment for same cost of home is advantageous. So we have no plan in the near-term to stop utilizing it even if we see rates shift down.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I will turn it over.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Ken Zener with Seaport Research Partners.\nKenneth Zener: Good morning everybody. \nPaul J. Romanowski: Good morning Ken.\nKenneth Zener: I wonder, with the industry, everybody likes to focus on the income statement, right. So the gross margin has obviously been a focus today. However, your initial comments were about inventory returns, which together gets you returns on inventory. So because you took up volume for the year modestly and all we see is one quarter forward guidance, is it fair to say that you guys' internal metrics are generating the same or higher ROI than you had started the year at, I know you kept the $3 billion cash flow the same but I'm just trying to understand we see one part of the business, but not necessarily the output of the other?\nBill W. Wheat: Sure, yes. I mean our returns are in line with our plans, and our divisions are out there executing on their plans, their start plans week-to-week, month-to-month and deliver the homes that we expected to this quarter, plus a few hundred more. And so as we enter the Spring, we're continuing with that and very consistent with our expectations from an inventory turn standpoint and a return on our assets, our investments in inventory.\nKenneth Zener: Right. So you talked about improving cycle times, obviously, part of that stuff. Do you see -- when you started 20,000, the last three years starts to have been 14,000, 25,000 all over the place. Can you talk to that level, I mean, do you see some degree of maybe use the word seasonality or what's kind of affecting that, is it orders or is it just a plan that you have to reach your closings, A? And then B, what do you expect your inventory units to be at the end of the year given your underlying assumptions right now? Thank you very much.\nPaul J. Romanowski: Yes, Ken, as you look at our past year plus starts space, it has been inconsistent and a lot of that has been in response to the market, in response to the elongation of cycle times and then further reduction of cycle times. As you look at our inventory today and our guide to basically turn a little more than two times that inventory, we can expect to see consistent and sustainable starts expansion over the next few quarters. We want to maintain the level of inventory that we have and be in a position as we respond to the Spring selling season to stay consistent with our starts, but we do need to grow our starts consistently quarter-to-quarter over the remainder of the year.\nBill W. Wheat: And as we consistently look to position ourselves to grow, we would certainly love one position ourselves to grow fiscal 2025 over fiscal 2024. So we would expect our inventory at the end of the year to be a little higher than it was at the start of the year with the expectation of turning it a little more than two times in fiscal 2025.\nKenneth Zener: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.\nSusan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning everyone. I wanted to talk a bit more about thinking of the competitive dynamics on the ground. As you think about some of the smaller new home markets that you have recently entered and the potential for more existing home turnover to perhaps come through as we move through the year, any thoughts on what those competitive dynamics could mean for you in various markets and perhaps how you're positioned relative to that?\nMichael J. Murray: I think, Susan, that we're continually looking to provide affordable homes that hit a payment that's going to work in the monthly budget for our buyers. And that is what's oftentimes overlooked, especially by the smaller markets, a lot of the builders that are currently existing have capital constraints on what they're able to build and start. And so they're looking generally to maximize revenue per lot or margin per lot and go with the lower volume. And so they're leaving that first-time homebuyer, that family that needs a more affordable home, kind of not really their target. So that's the target customer we seek out and we see good results when we go into a new market, greenfield a new market and focus on the affordable price points.\nSusan Maklari: Okay, that's helpful. And then thinking about the cash generation and the balance sheet, what -- as things have normalized, what level of cash, I guess you're comfortable holding on the balance sheet today, and how do you think about the potential for perhaps increasing the buybacks or allocating capital as some of the other growth initiatives that you have out there as you continue to bolster the balance sheet?\nBill W. Wheat: Susan, from the size and scale of our business today and the volume that we have in terms of just our constant production of inventory, the cash balance we have on the balance sheet today is in the range of where we'd like to be. So cash across our business segments and the availability under our credit facilities. We would like to maintain the current level and as we scale up over time, we'd incrementally increase that level over time. With our plans this year and our guidance on share repurchase in fiscal 2024, we are increasing our share repurchase by 25% this year from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion, and that's just part of our plan to be consistent with our distributions to shareholders as well, increased our dividend this year as well, expect to spend $400 million on dividends this year. And so that is an increase over last year and our plan would be to -- as we continue to scale the business, continue to be able to increase incrementally those repurchases and dividend levels.\nSusan Maklari: Okay, thank you and good luck. \nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Rafe Jadrosich at Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. It is Reese. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the outlook that for an improvement in build cycles in 2024, can you talk about where your build cycles are now where they were last quarter, how much do you think that can improve, and then like what gets you there from a supply chain perspective?\nJessica Hansen: We were just over four months this quarter, Reese. And when we think about our historical norm, it really is right at that four months in terms of start to complete, and then there's an additional time from complete to close. That's down from seven months a year ago. So a very substantial improvement in terms of year-over-year basis. Sequentially, it improved by about 10 days. So when we think about further improvements from here, they're not large moved, they're just continued improvements on average. So where hopefully, we can get below four months but that's not something that we expect to drive from 4 to 2.\nUnidentified Analyst : Got it, thank you. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to follow up on the comment that you're seeing encouraging signs as we head into the Spring season. Can you just give a little bit more color on what you're seeing, is that better home buyer traffic or conversion, and do you think that's just driven by sort of the headline rate number that's coming down, just want to understand what you're seeing that's encouraging in the market.\nMichael J. Murray: I think there's lots of reasons people are out looking for houses, but ultimately, they need a house, and we're seeing both good traffic and good convergence early in the Spring. And so we have set up operating plan for the year. And so far, we feel really good about how the market is responding to that.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.\nUnidentified Analyst : Okay. In terms of the land market, are you seeing a pickup in land development into 2024, I know that you said that things can kind of get a little bit more crunched as the demand increases. How are you thinking about land development costs and lot costs moving higher and kind of offsetting that?\nPaul J. Romanowski: For us, we are set in terms of our consistent delivery of loss into our starts plan. And so that plan is in place for us as we look 12 months out. We have not seen much reduction in development costs and wouldn't expect with the shortness of lots across the industry that we're going to see, and we're not anticipating much reduction in either the labor side or the supply side, product side of the components that go into developing lots. But we have a plan that we have stuck to and are consistent with, we feel good about our lot position in the near term and as we look next year or two out.\nUnidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. And then just kind of switching over to affordability. Aside from rate buy-downs, is there anything else that buyers have been kind of responsive to as far as like the levers that you have to kind of make payment work for them or has there been a type -- any sort of change to those strategies?\nMichael J. Murray: Product selection, generally, they'll buy a smaller home to make the payment work. And sometimes that's within an existing neighborhood or moving to a different neighborhood that's offering a smaller set of plans.\nJessica Hansen: So our square footage was down again about 3% year-over-year. It was relatively flat sequentially, but we would expect just continued gradual moves down from a mix shift perspective in terms of average square footage.\nUnidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. \nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Paul Romanowski for closing remarks.\nPaul J. Romanowski: Thank you, Holly. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our second quarter results in April. Congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family on producing a solid first quarter. We're proud to represent you on this call and appreciate all that you do.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.

            "name": "Paul J. Romanowski",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the first quarter the D.R. Horton chain delivered solid results highlighted by earnings of $2.82 per diluted share. Our consolidated pretax income was $1.2 billion on a 6% increase in revenues to $7.7 billion, with a pretax profit margin of 16.1%. Our home building return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31st was 29% and our return on equity for the same period was 21.8%. Although inflation and mortgage interest rates remain elevated, our net sales orders increased 35% from the prior year quarter as the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points is still limited and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable.  Early signs for the Spring selling season have been encouraging. We will continue to focus on consolidating market share and are well positioned for the Spring with 42,600 homes in inventory and our average construction cycle times returning to more normal levels. We expect our housing inventory terms to improve in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 and our ongoing focus on capital efficiency to produce strong home building operating cash flows and consistent returns. Mike? We started 19,900 homes in the December quarter and ended the quarter with 42,600 homes in inventory, down 1% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. 28,800 of our homes at December 31st were unsold. 9,000 of our total unsold homes were completed, of which 730 had been completed for greater than six months. Our current level of homes in inventory puts us in a strong position for the upcoming Spring selling season. For homes we closed in the first quarter, our construction cycle times continued to improve and we are essentially back to our historical average of roughly four months from start to complete. We will continue to adjust our homes and inventory and start space based on market conditions and expect our housing inventory terms to improve in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023. Mike? In the first quarter, our rental operations generated $31 million of pre-tax income on $195 million of revenues from the sale of 379 single family rental homes and 300 multifamily rental units. Our rental property inventory at December 31st was $3 billion, which consisted of $1.4 billion of single family rental properties and $1.6 billion of multifamily rental properties. We are not providing separate guidance for our rental segment this year due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of closings caused by interest rate volatility and capital market fluctuations. Based on our current pipeline of projects, we expect our rental closings and revenues in the second quarter to exceed the first quarter. Jessica? In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint, and diverse product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform that sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth, and cash flow while continuing to aggregate market share. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton family of employees, land developers, trade partners, vendors, and real estate agents for your continued focus and hard work. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Yes, Carl. We still today look at -- continually look at acquisitions. And for us, we're more interested in the smaller tuck-in builders that may add to our market share in an existing market or give us some entry, but we do always have that opportunity to greenfield those. I don't see on the horizon, a significant large acquisition. Certainly, the acquisition that you're referring to make some sense. We speak to scale a lot in market share, and that makes some sense to us. But today, we're going to continue to look at those as they come available, but no significant shift in what you've seen us do over the last couple of years. Yes, we're seeing some relative flatness in our cost side of the business and would expect to see similar all things stay consistent through the next quarter. Certainly, with the encouraging signs early in to January, it's possible that we see some increase in starts from all of our peers. That could put pressure on labor and on materials, which could cause some headwinds or some increase in the cost side. And we still sell a large portion of our homes inter-quarter. So 35% to 40% is our kind of historical average. And so those are being sold now and as we look through the quarter and into the Spring selling season. So certainly, as the Spring selling season emerges and continues, it's going to give us better visibility as we look towards the end of this quarter in to 3Q. Truman, I think that as we look at this today, it's still very early. And for us, consistency of activity has been important. So we haven't made any significant changes in our incentives if the market gives this to us, and we continue to see the early encouragement that we are, then we'll respond to the market in kind. If rates continue to stay up, then we'll need to lift our rate offerings like we've done in the past and will fluctuate as those rates move. Still it has been our best incentive is the rate buy down and consistency of rate, consistency of payment to our buyers as they shop in market. I think we have made adjustments as the market has shifted over the last 12 to 18 months and feel comfortable with our trajectory and the product offering that we have. Certainly, as you look across our communities, they're going to trend inside of the product offering that we have based on rate and monthly payment environment, whether that means that they're buying up in size or down in size. But we feel like we have a good offering across our markets, and we'll continue to stay as we need to respond to a monthly payment and interest rates and provide affordable opportunities across all of our platforms. I think today, we are still seeing people looking for closing with certainty of close date and in that 30 to 60-day time frame based on their ability to lock in interest rate. And so I don't know that we've seen much significant shift from the build-to-order builders being able to deliver a presale into those time frames. We are very comfortable with our inventory position, both in the total homes and in a completed home scenario. It's continued to play into the shortness of resale inventory across our markets and I don't expect a significant change for us. We're going to continue to stay focused on inventory sales and consistent production community. The timing of that sale has been able to move up earlier in our stage of construction just because we have gotten back to our historical norms of months of delivery of our houses. And the use of those rate buy downs is not just new to us over the last 12 months. We've been 24-plus months utilizing that incentive. So I believe on a go-forward basis, staying competitive to not only the new home market, but especially to the resale market for us, and the ability to have a lower monthly payment for same cost of home is advantageous. So we have no plan in the near-term to stop utilizing it even if we see rates shift down. Good morning Ken. Yes, Ken, as you look at our past year plus starts space, it has been inconsistent and a lot of that has been in response to the market, in response to the elongation of cycle times and then further reduction of cycle times. As you look at our inventory today and our guide to basically turn a little more than two times that inventory, we can expect to see consistent and sustainable starts expansion over the next few quarters. We want to maintain the level of inventory that we have and be in a position as we respond to the Spring selling season to stay consistent with our starts, but we do need to grow our starts consistently quarter-to-quarter over the remainder of the year. For us, we are set in terms of our consistent delivery of loss into our starts plan. And so that plan is in place for us as we look 12 months out. We have not seen much reduction in development costs and wouldn't expect with the shortness of lots across the industry that we're going to see, and we're not anticipating much reduction in either the labor side or the supply side, product side of the components that go into developing lots. But we have a plan that we have stuck to and are consistent with, we feel good about our lot position in the near term and as we look next year or two out. Thank you, Holly. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our second quarter results in April. Congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family on producing a solid first quarter. We're proud to represent you on this call and appreciate all that you do."

            "name": "Bill W. Wheat",
            "content": "Our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 35% to 18,069 homes, and order value increased 38% from the prior year to $6.8 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 19%, down from 21% sequentially and down from 27% in the prior year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 2% sequentially and up 14% year-over-year. The average price of net sales orders in the first quarter was $375,800, down 2% sequentially and up 2% from the prior year quarter.  To adjust to changing market conditions during fiscal 2023 and into fiscal 2024, we have increased our use of incentives and reduced home prices and sizes of our home offerings where necessary to provide better affordability to home buyers. Based on current market conditions, mortgage rates, and continued affordability challenges, we expect our incentive levels to remain elevated in the near-term. Our sales volumes can be significantly affected by changes in mortgage rates and other economic factors. However, we will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share. Jessica? In the first quarter, our home building SG&A expenses increased by 14% from last year and home building SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 8.3%, up 50 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year, due primarily to expansion of our operations to support future growth and an increase in equity and stock market-based compensation expense. We will continue to control our SG&A while ensuring that our platform adequately supports our business. Paul? Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic to support and to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth, and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity, which provides us with flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. During the first three months of the year, our consolidated cash used in operations was $153 million. At December 31st, we had $6.4 billion of consolidated liquidity consisting of $3.3 billion of cash and $3.1 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities.  Debt at the end of the quarter totaled $5.3 billion with no senior note maturities in fiscal 2024. Our consolidated leverage at December 31st was 18.6% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 7.8%. At December 31st, our stockholder's equity was $23.2 billion, and book value per share was $69.70, up 19% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended December, our return on equity was 21.8%, and our consolidated return on assets was 14.8%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of approximately $100 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level to be paid in February. We repurchased 3.3 million shares of common stock for $398 million during the quarter. Jessica. Steve, this quarter is the first time that, that amount has been significant at all. It is essentially adjusting the valuation of our hedging positions that we have in place to offer our programmatic rate buy downs across the country, and it's typically a very small move either up or down. But this quarter, given the significant volatility in rates during the quarter, of course, mortgage rates moved up to 8% in November and then dropped sharply in December, those hedging positions had to be adjusted to reflect that. So it was an unusual situation this quarter. Generally, we don't plan for any significant move one way or the other. Sure. Yes. The first factor this quarter, we could point to our 14% increase in our average selling community. So that's obviously a significant increase, and our SG&A is up 14% this quarter year-over-year as well. So that's a bigger move than we have had in a while that's positioning us to be able to provide the increased guidance, and you have seen our market count increase over the last several years. Obviously, we expect in time to achieve some leverage on that. And as we grow our revenues, we would expect our SG&A to come back down to historic levels. But I think we've got a couple of quarters here where we're going to see our SG&A little bit higher as a percentage of revenues, primarily driven by that.  This quarter, we have one additional factor and really, it's just a timing factor in terms of the impact of equity and stock-based comp. We typically have an amount that we incurred typically in our second quarter or third quarter, but the timing of some grants this year were a little bit earlier into our first quarter. And so there's an amount of roughly $13 million that it was incurred in Q1 of this quarter that typically would be a Q2 or Q3 event. Well, it starts with -- we sold homes with an increased level of incentives while rates were higher during Q1, and some of those closed in December, but there are still a number of them that will be closing in Q2. And so far on a core basis, we still are entering the quarter a little bit lower margin than what the average presents. And so that's -- but obviously, rates have dropped, and so those incentive costs are a bit lower in the later sales. And so on balance, we expect we should be able to hold margins around the current levels, excluding the hedging going forward. Yes. 1.5% on a sequential basis. Joe, the charge -- the amount of the charge was $65 million approximately, and that's basically what hit during the quarter. In terms of our position, outstanding. We believe that our position is -- reflects the current market and the valuation adjustment in the December quarter takes care of all of it. There's always some sensitivity. We always have some hedging position outstanding. And so anytime there is a significant sudden change in rates that can leave some exposure there obviously, the opposite side of that is the benefits to the business. When rates drop, obviously, that improves affordability and improves our ability to sell at a price point in the core business. And so what this hedging position allows us to do is offer below market rates on a consistent basis on a broad basis across our business. And like we said, we try to manage that as best as we can, but in a period of significant sudden volatility, there can be some exposure to the position. Yes, the last part first. Yes, our broker commissions are in and our gross margins are in our cost of goods sold. So that's not part of the equation. And I think your general commentary there is fair. We only provide specific SG&A guidance one quarter out. But generally, our expectation over the longer term is that we would get back to a similar SG&A level as last year and beyond. So I think it is a phenomenon here for a couple of quarters where we're guiding a little bit higher than last year. And we're also -- also ASP is down year-over-year. And so it's always a little bit more of a headwind on a percentage basis for SG&A when ASPs are down. Yes. We provided guidance one quarter out so we've guided to 22.6% to 23.1%. So essentially straddling the GAAP margin that we reported in Q1. Coming into Q2, the closings that we will have early in the quarter are at the -- probably the low end of that range, maybe even a little below that. But then later in the quarter, margins are improving because of the cost of buy downs after rates have dropped is lower. And so -- but on average, that's -- we believe that, that will balance out to a margin in the 22.6% to 23.1% range. What will occur after that we can't really comment. It's really going to be a matter of what's the strength of the Spring selling season, what does demand look like through the Spring and what happens with mortgage rates. And so -- but on average, that's where we believe things will fall for margins in Q2. I think on balance it's going to balance out to 22.6% to 23.1%. No, you've described it exactly. We typically will buy those forward commitment pools really for the next few weeks of deliveries essentially is the plan. We're not going out very far, but it is a few weeks and so that's when we say a very sudden sharp change in rates, that can present some exposure there, but it has not occurred in the past, but the circumstances this quarter were pretty unusual in terms of the significance and the suddenness of the rate moves. And then at the end of the quarter, we always have to mark-to-market the value at the end of the quarter. So that's always a factor there as well. Sure, yes. I mean our returns are in line with our plans, and our divisions are out there executing on their plans, their start plans week-to-week, month-to-month and deliver the homes that we expected to this quarter, plus a few hundred more. And so as we enter the Spring, we're continuing with that and very consistent with our expectations from an inventory turn standpoint and a return on our assets, our investments in inventory. And as we consistently look to position ourselves to grow, we would certainly love one position ourselves to grow fiscal 2025 over fiscal 2024. So we would expect our inventory at the end of the year to be a little higher than it was at the start of the year with the expectation of turning it a little more than two times in fiscal 2025. Susan, from the size and scale of our business today and the volume that we have in terms of just our constant production of inventory, the cash balance we have on the balance sheet today is in the range of where we'd like to be. So cash across our business segments and the availability under our credit facilities. We would like to maintain the current level and as we scale up over time, we'd incrementally increase that level over time. With our plans this year and our guidance on share repurchase in fiscal 2024, we are increasing our share repurchase by 25% this year from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion, and that's just part of our plan to be consistent with our distributions to shareholders as well, increased our dividend this year as well, expect to spend $400 million on dividends this year. And so that is an increase over last year and our plan would be to -- as we continue to scale the business, continue to be able to increase incrementally those repurchases and dividend levels."

            "name": "Michael J. Murray",
            "content": "Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 2% to $2.82 per diluted share compared to $2.76 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $947 million on consolidated revenues of $7.7 billion. Our first quarter home sales revenues was $7.3 billion on 19,340 homes closed compared to $6.7 billion on 17,340 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $376,200, down 2% sequentially and down 3% from the prior year quarter. Bill? Our home building lot position at December 31st consisted of approximately 607,000 lots, of which 24% were owned and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. 39% of our total owned lots are finished and 52% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our first quarter home building investments in lots, land, and development totaled $2.4 billion, up 3% sequentially. Our investments this quarter consisted of $1.4 billion per finished lots, $740 million for land development, and $270 million for land acquisition. Paul? Financial services earned $66 million of pretax income in the first quarter on $193 million of revenues resulting in a pretax profit margin of 34.3%. During the first quarter essentially all of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our home building operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 78% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 57% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgages this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan to value ratio of 88%. First time home buyers represented 56% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Bill. Steve, when we look at our land position, we feel that the forward one year's roughly supply of land that we own is important to maintain the production velocity in our neighborhoods. Bringing that down significantly is going to be incremental because it's going to be with more developers providing finished lots for us versus self-development. And I think we're back up to 76% controlled which is up from where it's been in the past few quarters. So we're going to continue to incrementally look to control more land and acquire lots that are being finished by others, but we will still need to maintain a supply of land on our balance sheet, lots primarily on our balance sheet to feed the production. And the rental inventory, we'll probably invest in some during fiscal 2024 to grow that platform. It's getting closer to a good sustainable volume that will produce consistent revenues and profits quarter-to-quarter, but it's still in the growth mode. There were two very significant moves in interest rates in the quarter. They went up significantly in the middle of the quarter, and they came down significantly to the end of the quarter. Kind of a very unique dynamic that we have not experienced. That's what led to the mark-to-market adjustment being more severe than it's been in prior quarters. Little headwind on the community count market growth, but a little tailwind in Q2 on the equity comp position recognizing that in Q1 versus Q2. We've been very focused on creating a quarter-to-quarter consistent starts plan where we're feeding our neighborhoods with lots that are available in front of us and making sure we have those lots supplied and secured to us. At the same time, we've made a tremendous amount of progress reducing our cycle times and coming back to sort of our historical norms of around four months from starting a home to completion. And so that's giving us much greater flexibility going into this year with the strong finished lot position we currently have, combined with the reduced cycle times, we're able to reduce our homes in inventory and still deliver a closing target that's going to be at or in excess of our two times beginning of the year housing terms. So we really feel good about what's happened there. As to what the upside top side is where the bottlenecks would come in, hard to speculate on where that would be. We feel really good about our lot position, neighborhood by neighborhood and the trade partnerships that we have and the supplier relationships that we have, they've been very supportive of us. I think it's pretty consistent across the board. We're feeling really good across all of our offerings. I mean as 55% to 56% of our deliveries have been to first-time homebuyers, that's generally where we've kind of geared our neighborhoods that we're positioning and the product that we're positioning with that. I think 70% of our deliveries were at $400,000 or less, which for us is maintaining a focus on affordability and a payment that works for people in their monthly budget. Hence, we've used the interest rate buy downs quite a bit. But feel really good. Coming out in January does not make a quarter or a Spring selling season, but we're very encouraged by the early trends in January and are excited for what the spring is going to hold. Even with the decline in existing home sales, they're still three to four times larger of a market transaction volume than new home sales. So we've always tried to position ourselves to compete against those homes rather than just other new home providers. We're allowing -- we're not restricting the sale of homes. Seasonally, you'll see the completed spec inventory, the completed home inventory tick up through the fall and be positioned that we have houses available for quick deliveries beginning in January for the Spring selling season. So we're able to deliver the homes that people are coming in and needing in 30 or 60 days. At the same time, with the compressed cycle times, as Paul mentioned, we are very comfortable selling and locking a rate in for a buyer earlier in the production process than we were a year ago for sure. Certainly we have seen that with the change in the capital markets, that demand environment became much choppier last year. But we still had institutional buyers that were anxious to get the product we were delivering to the market, and they continue to be so. We delivered projects in the first quarter, we expect to deliver more in the second quarter and then throughout the year with the pipeline that's there. I mean, for us, it's a strategy to help us derisk land positions and more rapidly monetize our land portfolio. And so we are still seeing good demand for the product, good demand on the rentals and the lease-ups when we're taking the stabilization process on and continue to expect that to become a growing part of our business. I think, Susan, that we're continually looking to provide affordable homes that hit a payment that's going to work in the monthly budget for our buyers. And that is what's oftentimes overlooked, especially by the smaller markets, a lot of the builders that are currently existing have capital constraints on what they're able to build and start. And so they're looking generally to maximize revenue per lot or margin per lot and go with the lower volume. And so they're leaving that first-time homebuyer, that family that needs a more affordable home, kind of not really their target. So that's the target customer we seek out and we see good results when we go into a new market, greenfield a new market and focus on the affordable price points. I think there's lots of reasons people are out looking for houses, but ultimately, they need a house, and we're seeing both good traffic and good convergence early in the Spring. And so we have set up operating plan for the year. And so far, we feel really good about how the market is responding to that. Product selection, generally, they'll buy a smaller home to make the payment work. And sometimes that's within an existing neighborhood or moving to a different neighborhood that's offering a smaller set of plans."
